12235,the urbanization and construction of modern infrastructure lead to the increase in surface runoff and decrease in infiltration groundwater is one of the most important water sources in the kathmandu valley nepal the amount of groundwater extraction over the years has been greater than the natural replenishment capacity as a result the water table has significantly decreased this study mainly aims to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge the land covers in 1996 and 2011 were generated based on landsat satellite image with a 30 30 m resolution the 2030 land cover was modeled with a land change modeler the arc curve number tool was used to calculate the curve number cn runoff was calculated with the scs runoff equation compared to that in 1996 the forest and agriculture area in 2011 decreased whereas the vegetation and built up areas increased from 2011 to 2030 no changes in forest decrease in vegetation and agriculture area and increase in the built up area are observed the water area throughout the study periods is less than 0 2 the city center of kathmandu valley has higher cn greater than 85 for all the observed periods as a result a higher runoff is observed the weighted average cns are 63 and 65 for 2011 and 2030 respectively the northern and southern parts of kathmandu valley has lower cns hence the lower runoff and possibly higher infiltration indicate critical locations for the groundwater recharge the northern area includes lapsephedi gagalphedi nayapati sundarijal chapali bhadrakali budalinilkantha and baluwa and southern area includes devichour nallu bhardv and godawari graphical abstract image 1 keywords curve number groundwater kathmandu valley land cover scs runoff gis 1 introduction sustainable development goals have been developed with the objective of ending poverty protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030 un 2015 access to clean water and sanitation for all is covered by goal 6 under the category clean water and sanitation groundwater is the major source of water where there is a shortage of surface water groundwater can be replenished by rainfall and snowmelt as a result of water infiltration into the ground surface the presence of pervious areas in the urban area acts as a major source of replenishing groundwater resources however if the rate of extraction is greater than the recharge then there might be a fall in groundwater level groundwater depletion is a serious problem throughout the world where there alternate water resources are lacking for the sustainable management of groundwater resources the rate of extraction of groundwater must be compensated by the groundwater recharge groundwater is a very crucial replenishing natural water resource in the kathmandu valley nepal where water shortage occurs throughout the year guragai et al 2017 the current water demand in the kathmandu valley is approximately 280 million litres per day mld of which only about 31 86 mld and 38 105 mld are being met during dry and wet seasons respectively shrestha 2009 in 2011 the groundwater extraction in kathmandu valley was estimated to be approximately 40 60 mld which is approximately 15 20 of the total water demand and approximately 50 of the total available water in the valley pathak et al 2009 rana 2011 the remaining water demand is being met through unregulated groundwater extraction and the details of exact extraction both at the household and industrial scale are unknown this overexploitation of groundwater has been documented to be approximately six times higher than the natural recharge capacity consequently a groundwater table depletion of approximately 2 5 m year has been reported shrestha 2009 in some areas with hardly available tap water almost all of the domestic water demand is being met by groundwater the over exploitation of groundwater has resulted in a gradual decline in the groundwater level and drying up of most of the stone spouts in kathmandu valley pathak et al 2009 it can be assumed that the continuation of increasing population and urbanization of the valley at the current rate and a consistent increase in water demand would further worsen the stress on groundwater resources to meet the ever increasing demand for adequate supply the melamchi water supply project mwsp which is a multi donor water supply mega project was started in 1998 the mwsp is expected to be completed by 2019 and is expected to provide 170 mld of fresh water to kathmandu valley with an increasing consumption rate from 41 l capita day lpcd in 2011 to 126 lpcd in 2025 the average supply duration is expected to increase from 7 h day in 2011 to 23 h day in 2025 melamchi water supply project 2019 shrestha 2012 ironically even with mwsp the number of people without access to water by 2050 would be in excess of 1 6 million because of the impact of climate change and population growth shrestha 2014 the water table is under tremendous stress and limited studies on assessing the water table have further exacerbated the already lacking effective policy framework for groundwater management in kathmandu valley a number of studies have discussed the groundwater quality in kathmandu khatiwada et al 2002 pant 2011 chapagain and kazama 2012 almost all of these studies concluded that groundwater is poor and hardly suitable for drinking without proper treatment a comprehensive review of the kathmandu valley groundwater is available elsewhere shrestha et al 2012 however the identification of areas for groundwater recharge in depth analysis of the water table and integrated analysis on remote sensing and field based data are still lacking there are very limited studies that have discussed groundwater quantity or to say the water table in kathmandu valley on a global scale mohan et al 2018 found that the groundwater recharge in nepal during 1981 2014 varied from approximately 100 mm yr to 600 mm yr coefficient of variation of around 0 4 and standard deviation of around 50 mm yr chen et al 2016 also found that the average groundwater depletion in nepal during 2005 2009 was approximately 20 cm yr due to lack of reliable data on the water table in kathmandu valley strong policies for the management of groundwater resources have not been formulated especially to address the problem of groundwater depletion considering the excessive extraction rate in the present and predicted higher water demand in the future the maximum extraction should not exceed 40 mld smec 1992 cited by dixit and upadhya 2005 to meet the natural recharge capacity however the documented extraction in 2002 was more than 60 mld without considering the unauthorized and undocumented extraction another report showed that the groundwater extraction of kathmandu prior to 1980 1980 1990 and 1990 2010 was 7 mld 46 mld and greater than 76 mld respectively dhakal 2010 some of the obvious signs of groundwater depletion are the drying up of stone spouts and inability of historical dug well and hand pumps to extract groundwater the groundwater level in the kathmandu valley reduced by 13 33 m during 1980 2000 and by 0 37 7 5 m during 2000 2008 if extraction from the groundwater reserve continues at the same rate as that in 2001 21 6 million cubic meters mcm then the recharge of 9 6 mcm year the groundwater in the shallow and deep aquifer in the kathmandu valley is expected to be depleted in less than 100 years pandey et al 2010 2012 another report of jica jica 1990 cited in dixit and upadhya 2005 stated a groundwater level depletion of 10 m year pandey et al 2010 showed aquifer depletion in different locations of the kathmandu valley mainly bansbari gokarna dhobi khola and pharping another study by gautam and prajapati 2014 showed the average water table depth gradually increasing from 2000 to 2005 the land use pattern of the kathmandu valley has been changing rapidly over the years with an increase in the built up areas and decrease in the forest and vegetation areas thapa 2012 it is necessary to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge considering the future land use pattern and climatic condition one of the methods for increasing groundwater infiltration is by identifying the locations for surface runoff and groundwater infiltration this assessment of runoff or infiltration could be done by the application of runoff curve number cn this study is one of the selected studies to use remote sensing and cn in comparing the land cover and runoff pattern in the past 1996 present 2011 and future 2030 to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge in the kathmandu valley the specific objectives include i generation of land cover pattern of the kathmandu valley for 1996 and 2011 ii prediction of the land cover pattern of kathmandu valley for 2030 iii calculation of the cn for each of 2011 and 2030 iv calculation of the surface runoff for 2030 and v identification of the critical locations for groundwater recharge 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the kathmandu valley in nepal is situated between 27 32 13 27 49 10 n latitude and 85 11 31 85 31 38 e longitude and enclosed between mountains shivapuri and mahabharat range in the north and south phulchowki in the south east chandragiri champa devi in the south west shivapuri in the north west and nagarkot in the north east the altitude ranges from 1300 to 2732 m above sea level and the study area is 658 km2 the climate of kathmandu valley is subtropical to monsoon it usually has hot and wet summers and cold and slightly dry winters rainfall occurs mostly during the summer and approximately 80 of rainfall occurs from june to september the annual average rainfall is 1650 mm mishra and herath 2012 the average summer and winter temperatures are 28 30 c and 9 11 c respectively the total population of kathmandu valley is approximately 3 million and the average population density is 2300 persons km2 range 70 13 000 persons km2 the population growth in the kathmandu valley is 4 muzzini and aparicio 2013 and if this rate continues the population will be in excess of 6 million by 2030 the city center has a population density in excess of 6000 persons km2 cbs 2012 more than 60 of the population in valley is dependent on groundwater for their basic needs map of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 general flowchart the methodology simplified in a flowchart is shown in fig 2 this flowchart shows the overall methods involved for the creation of land cover accuracy test cn and runoff estimation in spite of the shortcoming of the scs cn method it gives an insight about the surface runoff and infiltration zhan and huang 2004 in brief on manual sorting of different years of usgs landsat archive l5 tm satellite images with a 30 30 m resolution usgs earthexplorer 2017 the cloud cover was in the lower range 2 for both the land and scene cloud covers and a better image quality was obtained compared with the other years for the years 1996 and 2011 hence images of december 5 1996 and february 14 2011 were selected both satellite images have a path row of 141 and 41 these images have special reference in universal transverse mercator utm projection with datum world geodetic system 1984 utm zone 45n and are projected similarly for all the images land covers were categorized as forest water built up agriculture and vegetation anderson et al 1976 usda 1986 the vegetation area is defined as a fully developed residential districts consisting of roads and parks and naturally occurring plant species it does not cover any specific plants but a multitude of species which can be in the form of bush flora or the collective plants thereof in a lot size of 1 acre 4047 m2 in vegetation area about half is covered by the residential area and the other half consists of road and park with 25 of average impervious areas the vegetation area is prone towards change in the land use pattern during the course of urban development the forest area includes any area with a presence of large number of specific species of plants forest covers any dense forest open forest mixed forest and dense trees found in the parks the agriculture area covers seasonal and or permanent crops and irrigated and non irrigated farms in small and or large scale the built up area covers all of impervious or very little pervious areas consisting of commercial and business areas recreational sites the residential buildings illegal settlements industrial sites paved streets arterial roads highways and the airports water is an area where there is presence of water throughout the year or during a specific season such that there is a pond lake river stream dam or even spring water the land cover map of 1996 and 2011 were generated after a supervised image classification land change modeler lcm eastman 2006 2009 pontius and chen 2006 clark labs 2018 was used to model the past trend and predict the future land use land cover lulc in brief with the availability of at least two historical land cover sets along with a set of potential explanatory variables e g proximity to roads soil type and slopes the lcm generalizes complex transitions using trend surface analysis empirical modelling tools logistic regression a modified knn k nearest neighbor and a multi layer perceptron neural network for model development in addition the markov chain analysis is used to project the expected quantity of change and a competitive land allocation model to determine scenarios for a specified future date wilson and weng 2011 and uddin et al 2015 used 10 and 17 years difference respectively to predict the future lulc in this research a 15 years difference 1995 2011 was used to predict future 2030 lulc years 1995 and 2011 were selected because of the availability of a clear image during these period the accuracy of future lulc is checked against the accuracy rate and skill measure in the transition sub model of lcm the transition sub model models the likelihood potential of the land transition in the future using multi layer perceptron neural network driver variables logistic regression and a modified machine learning procedure for details please refer to eastman 2009 clark labs 2018 in this study based on 10000 iterations for the transition sub model the accuracy rate and skill measure for 1996 to 2011 lulc were 49 0 and 0 45 respectively the accuracy rate and skill measure for 2011 to 2030 were 50 6 and 0 34 respectively which were close to those for the known lulc changes in the 1996 to 2011 hence the 2030 lulc projection was deemed satisfactory in addition validation of 2030 lulc was also performed by comparing with the 2030 lulc map of kathmandu valley obtained from thapa and murayama 2012 accuracy assessment and validation must be performed to ensure that the generated lulc maps of 1996 and 2011 are practical and realistic the accuracy assessment task was performed by taking 80 random points for both 1996 and 2011 maps and visually comparing them with google earth the calculated percentage accuracy was 74 and 75 for the classified images of 1996 and 2011 respectively the detailed data on the hydro geomorphology of kathmandu were not available hence in this study the hydro geomorphology of the area was analyzed based on a digital elevation model dem fao soil properties iuss working group wrb 2015 and different lulc the dominant soil types in kathmandu are eutric cambisols cme chromic cambisols cmx gleyic cambisols cmg and vertic luvisols lvx for details please refer to the iuss working group wrb 2015 the soils in kathmandu were assumed to have an average moisture content amc ii i e the 5 day antecedent dry weather period varied from 23 to 40 mm which is a range similar to that of the earlier study mishra et al 2008 it is necessary to calculate precipitation for the calculation of runoff average rainfall intensity is expressed in terms of the intensity duration frequency idf curve an idf is a graphical representation of the probability of stated average rainfall in a given timeframe the accuracy of the idf increases with the timeframe used for the calculation of average rainfall the selected idf average rainfall intensities for the current climatic condition 1979 2003 for the 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods were 4 32 6 48 7 68 and 8 50 in 24hr or 10 97 16 46 19 51 and 21 59 cm 24 h respectively for the future climatic condition 2075 2099 the idf average rainfall intensities for the 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods were 4 80 7 68 9 36 and 10 3 in 24hr or 12 19 19 51 23 77 and 26 16 cm 24hr respectively mishra and herath 2012 2 3 runoff curve number the runoff cn which is also called scs or nrcs curve number was originally developed by usda natural resources conservation service formerly called as soil conservation service or scs in 1954 to estimate runoff from rainfall events on agricultural fields usda 1986 and 1989 this widely used and simple method integrates effect of soil watershed characteristics and land use to identify the runoff coefficient an empirical equation normalizes the total precipitation to runoff potential after considering the losses caused by infiltration evaporation transpiration and surface storage despite the wide popularity of cn its application is limited to a single rainfall event maximum of 24 h areas with unfrozen ground representative of average watershed condition and measurement of direct runoff volume the scs runoff equation is presented as 1 q p ia 2 p ia s for p ia whereas q 0 for p ia where q runoff in p rainfall in s potential maximum retention after runoff begins in and ia initial abstraction in also 2 s 1000 cn 10 or 3 c n 1000 10 s the value of cn varies from 0 when s maximum retention or no runoff to 100 when s 0 zero retention or total runoff the cn is a model variable which is only constant for a particular storm and depends on a number of factors like land use type soil texture and moisture content of the soil and is not an intrinsic physical property woodward et al 2006 also ia λs where λ is an empirical coefficient also called as initial abstraction ratio the value of λ has been assumed to be 0 2 in the original usda scs runoff equation however a number of researchers have recently proposed λ to vary from 0 to 0 996 jiang 2001 woodward et al 2006 shi et al 2009 fu et al 2011 lal et al 2019 and a value of 0 05 is most commonly agreed for an unknown area woodward et al 2003 hence in this study λ was taken as 0 05 however the cn and the runoff values reported in most studies have been based on λ of 0 2 hence the scs cn equation needs to be modified to account for this change in value of λ woodward et al 2003 putting ia λs in eq 1 gives 4 q p λ s 2 p 1 λ s for λ 0 05 5 q p 0 05 s 0 05 2 p 0 95 s 0 05 where 6 s 0 05 1 33 s 0 20 1 15 and 7 cn 0 05 100 1 879 100 cn 0 20 1 1 15 1 s0 05 is obtained by putting the value of s0 20 calculated from eq 2 into eq 6 which is then used in eq 5 to get q alternatively cn0 05 can also be calculated from eq 7 by calculating cn0 20 from eq 3 and putting it into eq 7 putting the value of cn0 05 in eq 2 yields s0 05 which can be used in eq 5 to obtain the runoff soil was categorized into hydrologic groups a b c and d based on the runoff potential usda 1986 and 2009 soil group a normally has the least runoff potential while group d the most the changes in the four hydrologic soil groups based on the change in land use pattern give the changes in the cn the cn lookup table table 1 was adapted usda 1986 for the vegetation area the cn value was taken from fully developed urban areas with 25 average impervious areas for forest it was the meadow cover containing continuous grass protected from grazing and generally mowed for hay for agriculture it was the average for row crops with contoured and crop residue cover for the built up area it was the average of commercial and business areas in urban districts the cn lookup table in this study was in the similar range as that in the earlier study of kathmandu mishra et al 2008 critiques argue that the disadvantages of the cn approach lie in its sensitivity defining antecedent wet weather condition varying accuracy for different soil types absence of an explicit provision for spatial scale effects and fixing of the initial abstraction ratio at 0 2 ponce and hawkins 1996 garen and moore 2005 even though runoff is directly proportional to the rainfall and land use type the cn method does not address the impact of spatial and temporal variation in rainfall pattern and intensity initial moisture content of the soil which depends on the land use type infiltration and other abstraction losses in addition it also does not have clear guidelines on the methodology to adjust antecedent moisture and impact of initial moisture content of the soil on runoff generation and soil moisture storage this disadvantage is minimized by taking the mean values i e by taking average rainfall in a given area for the 24 h ponce and hawkins 1996 smith 1997 golding et al 1997 nevertheless cn is still widely used for the runoff estimation because of its simplicity predictability stability reliance on only one parameter and responsiveness to major runoff producing watershed properties i e soil type land use treatment surface condition and antecedent condition zhan and huang 2004 developed the arccn runoff tool which is an extension of esri gis software for generating the cn and runoff maps there are limited studies on runoff estimation in nepal based on the application of arcgis cn approach shrestha 2003 used spatially distributed model with scs cn to assess the runoff changes caused by the land use changes in kathmandu valley and found that the percentage change in runoff due to change in land use was almost constant for different land uses irrespective of the rainfall pattern and time of occurrence mishra et al 2008 used cn for hydrologic regionalization of nepalese river basins for flood frequency analysis 3 results 3 1 land cover pattern in 1996 land cover map of 1996 is shown in fig 3 a it can be observed that vegetation and agriculture areas tend to be widely scattered throughout the map the vegetation area covered approximately 178 km2 27 0 most of the forest area was situated at the periphery of kathmandu valley and covered approximately 181 km2 27 5 deciduous monsoon forest is the dominant forest and some of the common species are oak elm beech maple and some coniferous trees the agriculture area covered approximately 263 km2 40 0 the water area covered approximately 2 km2 0 3 of the total area water is predominated by the bagmati river and its tributaries namely bishnumati dhobi khola manohara khola hanumant khola and tukucha khola the built up area accounted for 34 km2 5 2 and was concentrated at the city center around the periphery of the former royal palace the built up area had a fair network of roads buildings commercial areas airport and the highways 3 2 land cover pattern in 2011 land cover pattern for 2011 is shown in fig 3b the total areas for vegetation forest agriculture built up and water were 215 153 184 104 and 2 km2 respectively the forest area decreased from 27 5 in 1996 to 23 2 in 2011 there was non significant change in water area less than 0 1 water could be said to be fairly constant from 1996 to 2011 there was substantial decrease in the agriculture area 40 0 in 1996 to 28 0 in 2011 the vegetation area increased from 27 0 in 1996 to 32 7 in 2011 the built up area increased from 5 2 in 1996 to 15 8 in 2011 the construction of more buildings commercial complexes roads and industrial areas accounted for this increment of built up area in 2011 most of this construction was concentrated in the city center the decrease in the agriculture area was compensated for by the increase in the built up area 3 3 land cover pattern in 2030 land cover pattern of 2030 in shown in fig 3c in 2030 vegetation forest agriculture built up and water are 190 km2 28 9 153 km2 23 3 129 km2 19 6 184 km2 28 0 and 2 km2 0 2 respectively compared with 2011 the forest and water areas are essentially unchanged a decrease in the vegetation area from 32 7 in 2011 to 28 9 in 2030 is compensated for by increase in built up area from 15 8 in 2011 to 28 0 in 2030 the built up area in the city center is almost the same in 2011 and 2030 the additional built up area in 2030 is situated toward the northern and southern peripheries the comprehensive table of land cover pattern of 1996 2011 and 2030 is shown in table 2 ignoring the changes of less than 2 km2 the changes in land cover pattern from 1996 to 2011 and 2011 to 2030 are shown in fig 4 a b the specific pattern of gain and loss in the built up and agriculture areas during the intervals of 1996 2011 and 2011 to 2030 is shown in fig 4c d and 4e f respectively in brief from 2011 to 2030 both the agriculture and vegetation areas are converted to the built up area fig 4b d and f 3 4 curve number for 2011 the cn for 2011 fig 5 a varied from 33 to 100 the city center and urban areas had a cn greater than 85 implying that there would be more runoff compared with the northern and southern territories where cn values of 33 and 54 cn were predominant the higher value of cn also corresponded to the presence of higher runoff or lower infiltration in the city center in water areas with cn of 100 almost all the precipitation will be converted to runoff a lower value of cn i e 33 was observed around the periphery of the kathmandu valley where there was more forest area in an earlier study the cn for forest area varied from 36 to 40 for the whole of nepal similar to the range in this study mishra et al 2008 for the vegetation and agriculture areas the cn varied from 54 to 78 depending on the different types of built up areas like commercial areas industrial complex airport highway roads and residential area the cn varied from 85 to 94 the weighted average cn for whole of kathmandu valley was 63 3 5 curve number for 2030 the cn for 2030 is shown in fig 5b some of the areas having vegetation in 2011 are projected to be converted to the built up areas in 2030 these built up areas have a new cn of 85 in 2030 compared with the cn of 54 in 2011 for other areas the pattern and the distribution of cn in 2011 and 2030 are basically the same the weighted average cn for whole of kathmandu valley is 65 in general there was significant increase in the cn in the city center from 2011 to 2030 3 6 runoff estimation for 2030 runoff estimation for the year 2030 in the kathmandu valley under the current and future climatic conditions based on the average rainfall for 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods is shown in table 3 the runoff was directly related to the rainfall and the rainfall for the future climatic condition was higher than the current climatic in addition the runoff increased as the number of years of return period for calculation of rainfall increased however this increment was not directly proportional to the increment in rainfall for a cn of less than 54 a 10 20 increase in rainfall led to the runoff increase of approximately 40 for example for a cn of 33 rainfall increased from 4 32 in 24hr or 10 97 cm 24hr in the current climatic condition to 4 80 in 24hr or 12 19 cm 24hr in the future climatic condition an 11 increment in rainfall for 2 year return period whereas the runoff increased from 0 11 to 0 16 in or 0 28 0 40 cm approximately 47 increment in runoff meanwhile for the 25 and 50 year return periods a 20 increment in rainfall led to an increase in runoff by approximately 60 table 3 for the cn greater than 85 the runoff increment approximately 25 was proportional to the increase in rainfall approximately 20 in addition since the weighted cn for 2030 was greater than that in 2011 the runoff for 2030 was greater than 2011 4 discussion 4 1 changes in land cover pattern in 1996 2011 and 2030 in an earlier study by thapa 2012 the land cover in the kathmandu valley significantly increased from 2 9 in 1967 to 24 7 in 2011 thapa 2012 the built up areas in the kathmandu valley in 1991 and 2000 were 63 9 2 and 97 km2 14 2 respectively thapa 2012 the reason for discrepancies in the built up areas in this study and those by thapa 2012 were not clear but these might be caused by the difference in the land cover categorization categorization as industrial area institutional area airports government secretariat area royal palace agriculture area open space natural forest shrubs and as roads by thapa 2012 and in this study categorization as vegetation forest agriculture built up and water and the total area taken 684 km2 by thapa 2012 and 658 km2 in this study with the presence of this built up area there is limited groundwater infiltration and fairly large surface runoff this built up area coupled with the overexploitation of groundwater has led to the decrease in groundwater level in the kathmandu valley the non agricultural land also increased from 5 6 to 27 6 during 1984 2000 whereas the urban area increased from 4 8 to 14 6 during the same period pandey et al 2010 the increase in the built up area in 2030 was also evident in the earlier study by thapa and murayama 2012 because of this rapid increase in the built up area there could be unprecedented stress on land water and forest ecosystems the water area was less than 2 of the total area compared with less than 0 3 in this study in the study by thapa 2012 and remained fairly constant around 2 from 1967 to 2011 4 2 identification of the critical locations for groundwater recharge the slope of the kathmandu valley varied from 0 to 4 3 this slope should not be a major concern for surface runoff as it is relatively small the scs runoff curve number was applied by mishra et al 2008 for the prediction of flood frequency in nepal with the cn varying from 50 to 80 similar to the cn range in this study the cn of the core of city center areas in this study varied from 78 to 94 other areas had a lower cn which was 67 54 and 33 in general the cn could be categorized as lower i e 33 and 54 for the vegetative and forest areas typically in the northern and southern territories of the kathmandu valley medium i e 67 and 78 for semi urban area and higher i e 85 86 and 94 for the highly urbanized city centers in order to find the critical locations for possible groundwater infiltration and surface runoff a map of the kathmandu valley was overlain onto administrative zones thapa and murayama 2012 thapa and murayama 2012 categorized the kathmandu valley as kathmandu city madhyapur thimi bhaktapur kirtipur and lalitpur as the major urban areas and other peri urban and rural areas in the kathmandu valley the land cover and the cn of 2030 were taken as representative figures in finding critical locations of the surface runoff and groundwater infiltration in the kathmandu valley fig 6 the critical locations for the possible groundwater recharge are identified based on the assumption that in the areas with higher runoff there will be less infiltration and vice versa though this assumption does not account for the moisture content and hydro geochemistry of the soil the results can be a benchmark to identify areas prone to runoff and groundwater recharge the comparison of the dominant cn in the core areas based on the analysis of fig 6 and the minimum and maximum surface runoff for 25 and 50 year return period for 2030 is shown in table 4 based on the summary of table 4 it is evident that the urbanized areas of the main cities of kathmandu valley have a higher surface runoff which were in the range 5 6 9 5 inch or 14 22 24 13 cm for kathmandu city the dominant cns in the kathmandu city are 85 and 94 limited groundwater infiltration will occur in kathmandu city because of this higher surface runoff toward the periphery as the cn gradually decreases there will be less runoff and more infiltration for other cities i e madhyapur thimi bhaktapur kirtipur and lalitpur the cn and the adjacent surface runoff are also comparable to that of in kathmandu city however for most of the northern and southern territories the minimum cn 33 is observed for which the surface runoff corresponds to 0 6 1 3 inch or 1 52 3 30 cm these northern and southern territories are dominated by forest and mountain areas with permeable soils because of lower surface runoff it is concluded that these northern lapsephedi gagalphedi nayapati sundarijal chapali bhadrakali budalinilkantha and baluwa and southern territories devichour nallu bhardv and godawari could be the potential areas for groundwater recharge in the kathmandu valley fig 6 and table 4 this conclusion is consistent with that of an earlier study which found that the northern territory consisting of huge permeable land surfaces could be the potential area for storage and recovery of groundwater recharge in kathmandu valley dixit and upadhya 2005 5 conclusions in this study usgs landsat satellite image of resolution 30 30 m was used to generate land use land cover lulc for 1996 and 2011 the lulc for 2030 was simulated with the land change modeler with an estimation accuracy of 50 6 the cn values for 2011 and 2030 were generated based on an arccn runoff model the average rainfall for the 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods under two different scenarios for current climatic condition 1979 2003 and future climatic condition 2075 2099 were used to calculate the runoff using the usda scs runoff equation the critical locations for the groundwater recharge were estimated based on the assumption that runoff is lower recharge will be higher and vice versa the water area throughout the study period was fairly constant with less than 0 3 for all of 1996 2011 and 2030 the city center of the kathmandu valley had a higher cn greater than 85 for both 2011 and 2030 the cn could generally be categorized as lower i e 33 and 54 for the vegetative and forest areas typically in the northern and southern territories of the kathmandu valley medium i e 67 and 78 for the semi urban area and higher i e 85 86 and 94 for the highly urbanized city centers the northern and southern part of the kathmandu valley having the lowest cn and hence the lower runoff and possibly higher infiltration could be the critical locations for groundwater recharge the northern area includes lapsephedi gagalphedi nayapati sundarijal chapali bhadrakali budalinilkantha and baluwa while the southern area includes devichour nallu bhardv and godawari 5 1 recommendations in order to increase the rate of infiltration at the urban city centers it is recommended to build artificial recharge trenches and permeable pavements however due to lack of systematic planning policy framework and categorization of the available groundwater database the groundwater in the kathmandu valley has not been properly managed the geospatial mapping generated in this study could provide fundamental basics for exploring runoff or infiltration and characterization of land use should be done based on its ability for groundwater recharge in addition field based monitoring and validation scheme will help to verify modelling approach of estimation of surface runoff and infiltration this mapping and monitoring scheme coupled with the development of a policy framework and a smart management approach are recommended for the groundwater recharge in the kathmandu valley

12235,the urbanization and construction of modern infrastructure lead to the increase in surface runoff and decrease in infiltration groundwater is one of the most important water sources in the kathmandu valley nepal the amount of groundwater extraction over the years has been greater than the natural replenishment capacity as a result the water table has significantly decreased this study mainly aims to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge the land covers in 1996 and 2011 were generated based on landsat satellite image with a 30 30 m resolution the 2030 land cover was modeled with a land change modeler the arc curve number tool was used to calculate the curve number cn runoff was calculated with the scs runoff equation compared to that in 1996 the forest and agriculture area in 2011 decreased whereas the vegetation and built up areas increased from 2011 to 2030 no changes in forest decrease in vegetation and agriculture area and increase in the built up area are observed the water area throughout the study periods is less than 0 2 the city center of kathmandu valley has higher cn greater than 85 for all the observed periods as a result a higher runoff is observed the weighted average cns are 63 and 65 for 2011 and 2030 respectively the northern and southern parts of kathmandu valley has lower cns hence the lower runoff and possibly higher infiltration indicate critical locations for the groundwater recharge the northern area includes lapsephedi gagalphedi nayapati sundarijal chapali bhadrakali budalinilkantha and baluwa and southern area includes devichour nallu bhardv and godawari graphical abstract image 1 keywords curve number groundwater kathmandu valley land cover scs runoff gis 1 introduction sustainable development goals have been developed with the objective of ending poverty protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030 un 2015 access to clean water and sanitation for all is covered by goal 6 under the category clean water and sanitation groundwater is the major source of water where there is a shortage of surface water groundwater can be replenished by rainfall and snowmelt as a result of water infiltration into the ground surface the presence of pervious areas in the urban area acts as a major source of replenishing groundwater resources however if the rate of extraction is greater than the recharge then there might be a fall in groundwater level groundwater depletion is a serious problem throughout the world where there alternate water resources are lacking for the sustainable management of groundwater resources the rate of extraction of groundwater must be compensated by the groundwater recharge groundwater is a very crucial replenishing natural water resource in the kathmandu valley nepal where water shortage occurs throughout the year guragai et al 2017 the current water demand in the kathmandu valley is approximately 280 million litres per day mld of which only about 31 86 mld and 38 105 mld are being met during dry and wet seasons respectively shrestha 2009 in 2011 the groundwater extraction in kathmandu valley was estimated to be approximately 40 60 mld which is approximately 15 20 of the total water demand and approximately 50 of the total available water in the valley pathak et al 2009 rana 2011 the remaining water demand is being met through unregulated groundwater extraction and the details of exact extraction both at the household and industrial scale are unknown this overexploitation of groundwater has been documented to be approximately six times higher than the natural recharge capacity consequently a groundwater table depletion of approximately 2 5 m year has been reported shrestha 2009 in some areas with hardly available tap water almost all of the domestic water demand is being met by groundwater the over exploitation of groundwater has resulted in a gradual decline in the groundwater level and drying up of most of the stone spouts in kathmandu valley pathak et al 2009 it can be assumed that the continuation of increasing population and urbanization of the valley at the current rate and a consistent increase in water demand would further worsen the stress on groundwater resources to meet the ever increasing demand for adequate supply the melamchi water supply project mwsp which is a multi donor water supply mega project was started in 1998 the mwsp is expected to be completed by 2019 and is expected to provide 170 mld of fresh water to kathmandu valley with an increasing consumption rate from 41 l capita day lpcd in 2011 to 126 lpcd in 2025 the average supply duration is expected to increase from 7 h day in 2011 to 23 h day in 2025 melamchi water supply project 2019 shrestha 2012 ironically even with mwsp the number of people without access to water by 2050 would be in excess of 1 6 million because of the impact of climate change and population growth shrestha 2014 the water table is under tremendous stress and limited studies on assessing the water table have further exacerbated the already lacking effective policy framework for groundwater management in kathmandu valley a number of studies have discussed the groundwater quality in kathmandu khatiwada et al 2002 pant 2011 chapagain and kazama 2012 almost all of these studies concluded that groundwater is poor and hardly suitable for drinking without proper treatment a comprehensive review of the kathmandu valley groundwater is available elsewhere shrestha et al 2012 however the identification of areas for groundwater recharge in depth analysis of the water table and integrated analysis on remote sensing and field based data are still lacking there are very limited studies that have discussed groundwater quantity or to say the water table in kathmandu valley on a global scale mohan et al 2018 found that the groundwater recharge in nepal during 1981 2014 varied from approximately 100 mm yr to 600 mm yr coefficient of variation of around 0 4 and standard deviation of around 50 mm yr chen et al 2016 also found that the average groundwater depletion in nepal during 2005 2009 was approximately 20 cm yr due to lack of reliable data on the water table in kathmandu valley strong policies for the management of groundwater resources have not been formulated especially to address the problem of groundwater depletion considering the excessive extraction rate in the present and predicted higher water demand in the future the maximum extraction should not exceed 40 mld smec 1992 cited by dixit and upadhya 2005 to meet the natural recharge capacity however the documented extraction in 2002 was more than 60 mld without considering the unauthorized and undocumented extraction another report showed that the groundwater extraction of kathmandu prior to 1980 1980 1990 and 1990 2010 was 7 mld 46 mld and greater than 76 mld respectively dhakal 2010 some of the obvious signs of groundwater depletion are the drying up of stone spouts and inability of historical dug well and hand pumps to extract groundwater the groundwater level in the kathmandu valley reduced by 13 33 m during 1980 2000 and by 0 37 7 5 m during 2000 2008 if extraction from the groundwater reserve continues at the same rate as that in 2001 21 6 million cubic meters mcm then the recharge of 9 6 mcm year the groundwater in the shallow and deep aquifer in the kathmandu valley is expected to be depleted in less than 100 years pandey et al 2010 2012 another report of jica jica 1990 cited in dixit and upadhya 2005 stated a groundwater level depletion of 10 m year pandey et al 2010 showed aquifer depletion in different locations of the kathmandu valley mainly bansbari gokarna dhobi khola and pharping another study by gautam and prajapati 2014 showed the average water table depth gradually increasing from 2000 to 2005 the land use pattern of the kathmandu valley has been changing rapidly over the years with an increase in the built up areas and decrease in the forest and vegetation areas thapa 2012 it is necessary to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge considering the future land use pattern and climatic condition one of the methods for increasing groundwater infiltration is by identifying the locations for surface runoff and groundwater infiltration this assessment of runoff or infiltration could be done by the application of runoff curve number cn this study is one of the selected studies to use remote sensing and cn in comparing the land cover and runoff pattern in the past 1996 present 2011 and future 2030 to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge in the kathmandu valley the specific objectives include i generation of land cover pattern of the kathmandu valley for 1996 and 2011 ii prediction of the land cover pattern of kathmandu valley for 2030 iii calculation of the cn for each of 2011 and 2030 iv calculation of the surface runoff for 2030 and v identification of the critical locations for groundwater recharge 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the kathmandu valley in nepal is situated between 27 32 13 27 49 10 n latitude and 85 11 31 85 31 38 e longitude and enclosed between mountains shivapuri and mahabharat range in the north and south phulchowki in the south east chandragiri champa devi in the south west shivapuri in the north west and nagarkot in the north east the altitude ranges from 1300 to 2732 m above sea level and the study area is 658 km2 the climate of kathmandu valley is subtropical to monsoon it usually has hot and wet summers and cold and slightly dry winters rainfall occurs mostly during the summer and approximately 80 of rainfall occurs from june to september the annual average rainfall is 1650 mm mishra and herath 2012 the average summer and winter temperatures are 28 30 c and 9 11 c respectively the total population of kathmandu valley is approximately 3 million and the average population density is 2300 persons km2 range 70 13 000 persons km2 the population growth in the kathmandu valley is 4 muzzini and aparicio 2013 and if this rate continues the population will be in excess of 6 million by 2030 the city center has a population density in excess of 6000 persons km2 cbs 2012 more than 60 of the population in valley is dependent on groundwater for their basic needs map of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 general flowchart the methodology simplified in a flowchart is shown in fig 2 this flowchart shows the overall methods involved for the creation of land cover accuracy test cn and runoff estimation in spite of the shortcoming of the scs cn method it gives an insight about the surface runoff and infiltration zhan and huang 2004 in brief on manual sorting of different years of usgs landsat archive l5 tm satellite images with a 30 30 m resolution usgs earthexplorer 2017 the cloud cover was in the lower range 2 for both the land and scene cloud covers and a better image quality was obtained compared with the other years for the years 1996 and 2011 hence images of december 5 1996 and february 14 2011 were selected both satellite images have a path row of 141 and 41 these images have special reference in universal transverse mercator utm projection with datum world geodetic system 1984 utm zone 45n and are projected similarly for all the images land covers were categorized as forest water built up agriculture and vegetation anderson et al 1976 usda 1986 the vegetation area is defined as a fully developed residential districts consisting of roads and parks and naturally occurring plant species it does not cover any specific plants but a multitude of species which can be in the form of bush flora or the collective plants thereof in a lot size of 1 acre 4047 m2 in vegetation area about half is covered by the residential area and the other half consists of road and park with 25 of average impervious areas the vegetation area is prone towards change in the land use pattern during the course of urban development the forest area includes any area with a presence of large number of specific species of plants forest covers any dense forest open forest mixed forest and dense trees found in the parks the agriculture area covers seasonal and or permanent crops and irrigated and non irrigated farms in small and or large scale the built up area covers all of impervious or very little pervious areas consisting of commercial and business areas recreational sites the residential buildings illegal settlements industrial sites paved streets arterial roads highways and the airports water is an area where there is presence of water throughout the year or during a specific season such that there is a pond lake river stream dam or even spring water the land cover map of 1996 and 2011 were generated after a supervised image classification land change modeler lcm eastman 2006 2009 pontius and chen 2006 clark labs 2018 was used to model the past trend and predict the future land use land cover lulc in brief with the availability of at least two historical land cover sets along with a set of potential explanatory variables e g proximity to roads soil type and slopes the lcm generalizes complex transitions using trend surface analysis empirical modelling tools logistic regression a modified knn k nearest neighbor and a multi layer perceptron neural network for model development in addition the markov chain analysis is used to project the expected quantity of change and a competitive land allocation model to determine scenarios for a specified future date wilson and weng 2011 and uddin et al 2015 used 10 and 17 years difference respectively to predict the future lulc in this research a 15 years difference 1995 2011 was used to predict future 2030 lulc years 1995 and 2011 were selected because of the availability of a clear image during these period the accuracy of future lulc is checked against the accuracy rate and skill measure in the transition sub model of lcm the transition sub model models the likelihood potential of the land transition in the future using multi layer perceptron neural network driver variables logistic regression and a modified machine learning procedure for details please refer to eastman 2009 clark labs 2018 in this study based on 10000 iterations for the transition sub model the accuracy rate and skill measure for 1996 to 2011 lulc were 49 0 and 0 45 respectively the accuracy rate and skill measure for 2011 to 2030 were 50 6 and 0 34 respectively which were close to those for the known lulc changes in the 1996 to 2011 hence the 2030 lulc projection was deemed satisfactory in addition validation of 2030 lulc was also performed by comparing with the 2030 lulc map of kathmandu valley obtained from thapa and murayama 2012 accuracy assessment and validation must be performed to ensure that the generated lulc maps of 1996 and 2011 are practical and realistic the accuracy assessment task was performed by taking 80 random points for both 1996 and 2011 maps and visually comparing them with google earth the calculated percentage accuracy was 74 and 75 for the classified images of 1996 and 2011 respectively the detailed data on the hydro geomorphology of kathmandu were not available hence in this study the hydro geomorphology of the area was analyzed based on a digital elevation model dem fao soil properties iuss working group wrb 2015 and different lulc the dominant soil types in kathmandu are eutric cambisols cme chromic cambisols cmx gleyic cambisols cmg and vertic luvisols lvx for details please refer to the iuss working group wrb 2015 the soils in kathmandu were assumed to have an average moisture content amc ii i e the 5 day antecedent dry weather period varied from 23 to 40 mm which is a range similar to that of the earlier study mishra et al 2008 it is necessary to calculate precipitation for the calculation of runoff average rainfall intensity is expressed in terms of the intensity duration frequency idf curve an idf is a graphical representation of the probability of stated average rainfall in a given timeframe the accuracy of the idf increases with the timeframe used for the calculation of average rainfall the selected idf average rainfall intensities for the current climatic condition 1979 2003 for the 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods were 4 32 6 48 7 68 and 8 50 in 24hr or 10 97 16 46 19 51 and 21 59 cm 24 h respectively for the future climatic condition 2075 2099 the idf average rainfall intensities for the 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods were 4 80 7 68 9 36 and 10 3 in 24hr or 12 19 19 51 23 77 and 26 16 cm 24hr respectively mishra and herath 2012 2 3 runoff curve number the runoff cn which is also called scs or nrcs curve number was originally developed by usda natural resources conservation service formerly called as soil conservation service or scs in 1954 to estimate runoff from rainfall events on agricultural fields usda 1986 and 1989 this widely used and simple method integrates effect of soil watershed characteristics and land use to identify the runoff coefficient an empirical equation normalizes the total precipitation to runoff potential after considering the losses caused by infiltration evaporation transpiration and surface storage despite the wide popularity of cn its application is limited to a single rainfall event maximum of 24 h areas with unfrozen ground representative of average watershed condition and measurement of direct runoff volume the scs runoff equation is presented as 1 q p ia 2 p ia s for p ia whereas q 0 for p ia where q runoff in p rainfall in s potential maximum retention after runoff begins in and ia initial abstraction in also 2 s 1000 cn 10 or 3 c n 1000 10 s the value of cn varies from 0 when s maximum retention or no runoff to 100 when s 0 zero retention or total runoff the cn is a model variable which is only constant for a particular storm and depends on a number of factors like land use type soil texture and moisture content of the soil and is not an intrinsic physical property woodward et al 2006 also ia λs where λ is an empirical coefficient also called as initial abstraction ratio the value of λ has been assumed to be 0 2 in the original usda scs runoff equation however a number of researchers have recently proposed λ to vary from 0 to 0 996 jiang 2001 woodward et al 2006 shi et al 2009 fu et al 2011 lal et al 2019 and a value of 0 05 is most commonly agreed for an unknown area woodward et al 2003 hence in this study λ was taken as 0 05 however the cn and the runoff values reported in most studies have been based on λ of 0 2 hence the scs cn equation needs to be modified to account for this change in value of λ woodward et al 2003 putting ia λs in eq 1 gives 4 q p λ s 2 p 1 λ s for λ 0 05 5 q p 0 05 s 0 05 2 p 0 95 s 0 05 where 6 s 0 05 1 33 s 0 20 1 15 and 7 cn 0 05 100 1 879 100 cn 0 20 1 1 15 1 s0 05 is obtained by putting the value of s0 20 calculated from eq 2 into eq 6 which is then used in eq 5 to get q alternatively cn0 05 can also be calculated from eq 7 by calculating cn0 20 from eq 3 and putting it into eq 7 putting the value of cn0 05 in eq 2 yields s0 05 which can be used in eq 5 to obtain the runoff soil was categorized into hydrologic groups a b c and d based on the runoff potential usda 1986 and 2009 soil group a normally has the least runoff potential while group d the most the changes in the four hydrologic soil groups based on the change in land use pattern give the changes in the cn the cn lookup table table 1 was adapted usda 1986 for the vegetation area the cn value was taken from fully developed urban areas with 25 average impervious areas for forest it was the meadow cover containing continuous grass protected from grazing and generally mowed for hay for agriculture it was the average for row crops with contoured and crop residue cover for the built up area it was the average of commercial and business areas in urban districts the cn lookup table in this study was in the similar range as that in the earlier study of kathmandu mishra et al 2008 critiques argue that the disadvantages of the cn approach lie in its sensitivity defining antecedent wet weather condition varying accuracy for different soil types absence of an explicit provision for spatial scale effects and fixing of the initial abstraction ratio at 0 2 ponce and hawkins 1996 garen and moore 2005 even though runoff is directly proportional to the rainfall and land use type the cn method does not address the impact of spatial and temporal variation in rainfall pattern and intensity initial moisture content of the soil which depends on the land use type infiltration and other abstraction losses in addition it also does not have clear guidelines on the methodology to adjust antecedent moisture and impact of initial moisture content of the soil on runoff generation and soil moisture storage this disadvantage is minimized by taking the mean values i e by taking average rainfall in a given area for the 24 h ponce and hawkins 1996 smith 1997 golding et al 1997 nevertheless cn is still widely used for the runoff estimation because of its simplicity predictability stability reliance on only one parameter and responsiveness to major runoff producing watershed properties i e soil type land use treatment surface condition and antecedent condition zhan and huang 2004 developed the arccn runoff tool which is an extension of esri gis software for generating the cn and runoff maps there are limited studies on runoff estimation in nepal based on the application of arcgis cn approach shrestha 2003 used spatially distributed model with scs cn to assess the runoff changes caused by the land use changes in kathmandu valley and found that the percentage change in runoff due to change in land use was almost constant for different land uses irrespective of the rainfall pattern and time of occurrence mishra et al 2008 used cn for hydrologic regionalization of nepalese river basins for flood frequency analysis 3 results 3 1 land cover pattern in 1996 land cover map of 1996 is shown in fig 3 a it can be observed that vegetation and agriculture areas tend to be widely scattered throughout the map the vegetation area covered approximately 178 km2 27 0 most of the forest area was situated at the periphery of kathmandu valley and covered approximately 181 km2 27 5 deciduous monsoon forest is the dominant forest and some of the common species are oak elm beech maple and some coniferous trees the agriculture area covered approximately 263 km2 40 0 the water area covered approximately 2 km2 0 3 of the total area water is predominated by the bagmati river and its tributaries namely bishnumati dhobi khola manohara khola hanumant khola and tukucha khola the built up area accounted for 34 km2 5 2 and was concentrated at the city center around the periphery of the former royal palace the built up area had a fair network of roads buildings commercial areas airport and the highways 3 2 land cover pattern in 2011 land cover pattern for 2011 is shown in fig 3b the total areas for vegetation forest agriculture built up and water were 215 153 184 104 and 2 km2 respectively the forest area decreased from 27 5 in 1996 to 23 2 in 2011 there was non significant change in water area less than 0 1 water could be said to be fairly constant from 1996 to 2011 there was substantial decrease in the agriculture area 40 0 in 1996 to 28 0 in 2011 the vegetation area increased from 27 0 in 1996 to 32 7 in 2011 the built up area increased from 5 2 in 1996 to 15 8 in 2011 the construction of more buildings commercial complexes roads and industrial areas accounted for this increment of built up area in 2011 most of this construction was concentrated in the city center the decrease in the agriculture area was compensated for by the increase in the built up area 3 3 land cover pattern in 2030 land cover pattern of 2030 in shown in fig 3c in 2030 vegetation forest agriculture built up and water are 190 km2 28 9 153 km2 23 3 129 km2 19 6 184 km2 28 0 and 2 km2 0 2 respectively compared with 2011 the forest and water areas are essentially unchanged a decrease in the vegetation area from 32 7 in 2011 to 28 9 in 2030 is compensated for by increase in built up area from 15 8 in 2011 to 28 0 in 2030 the built up area in the city center is almost the same in 2011 and 2030 the additional built up area in 2030 is situated toward the northern and southern peripheries the comprehensive table of land cover pattern of 1996 2011 and 2030 is shown in table 2 ignoring the changes of less than 2 km2 the changes in land cover pattern from 1996 to 2011 and 2011 to 2030 are shown in fig 4 a b the specific pattern of gain and loss in the built up and agriculture areas during the intervals of 1996 2011 and 2011 to 2030 is shown in fig 4c d and 4e f respectively in brief from 2011 to 2030 both the agriculture and vegetation areas are converted to the built up area fig 4b d and f 3 4 curve number for 2011 the cn for 2011 fig 5 a varied from 33 to 100 the city center and urban areas had a cn greater than 85 implying that there would be more runoff compared with the northern and southern territories where cn values of 33 and 54 cn were predominant the higher value of cn also corresponded to the presence of higher runoff or lower infiltration in the city center in water areas with cn of 100 almost all the precipitation will be converted to runoff a lower value of cn i e 33 was observed around the periphery of the kathmandu valley where there was more forest area in an earlier study the cn for forest area varied from 36 to 40 for the whole of nepal similar to the range in this study mishra et al 2008 for the vegetation and agriculture areas the cn varied from 54 to 78 depending on the different types of built up areas like commercial areas industrial complex airport highway roads and residential area the cn varied from 85 to 94 the weighted average cn for whole of kathmandu valley was 63 3 5 curve number for 2030 the cn for 2030 is shown in fig 5b some of the areas having vegetation in 2011 are projected to be converted to the built up areas in 2030 these built up areas have a new cn of 85 in 2030 compared with the cn of 54 in 2011 for other areas the pattern and the distribution of cn in 2011 and 2030 are basically the same the weighted average cn for whole of kathmandu valley is 65 in general there was significant increase in the cn in the city center from 2011 to 2030 3 6 runoff estimation for 2030 runoff estimation for the year 2030 in the kathmandu valley under the current and future climatic conditions based on the average rainfall for 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods is shown in table 3 the runoff was directly related to the rainfall and the rainfall for the future climatic condition was higher than the current climatic in addition the runoff increased as the number of years of return period for calculation of rainfall increased however this increment was not directly proportional to the increment in rainfall for a cn of less than 54 a 10 20 increase in rainfall led to the runoff increase of approximately 40 for example for a cn of 33 rainfall increased from 4 32 in 24hr or 10 97 cm 24hr in the current climatic condition to 4 80 in 24hr or 12 19 cm 24hr in the future climatic condition an 11 increment in rainfall for 2 year return period whereas the runoff increased from 0 11 to 0 16 in or 0 28 0 40 cm approximately 47 increment in runoff meanwhile for the 25 and 50 year return periods a 20 increment in rainfall led to an increase in runoff by approximately 60 table 3 for the cn greater than 85 the runoff increment approximately 25 was proportional to the increase in rainfall approximately 20 in addition since the weighted cn for 2030 was greater than that in 2011 the runoff for 2030 was greater than 2011 4 discussion 4 1 changes in land cover pattern in 1996 2011 and 2030 in an earlier study by thapa 2012 the land cover in the kathmandu valley significantly increased from 2 9 in 1967 to 24 7 in 2011 thapa 2012 the built up areas in the kathmandu valley in 1991 and 2000 were 63 9 2 and 97 km2 14 2 respectively thapa 2012 the reason for discrepancies in the built up areas in this study and those by thapa 2012 were not clear but these might be caused by the difference in the land cover categorization categorization as industrial area institutional area airports government secretariat area royal palace agriculture area open space natural forest shrubs and as roads by thapa 2012 and in this study categorization as vegetation forest agriculture built up and water and the total area taken 684 km2 by thapa 2012 and 658 km2 in this study with the presence of this built up area there is limited groundwater infiltration and fairly large surface runoff this built up area coupled with the overexploitation of groundwater has led to the decrease in groundwater level in the kathmandu valley the non agricultural land also increased from 5 6 to 27 6 during 1984 2000 whereas the urban area increased from 4 8 to 14 6 during the same period pandey et al 2010 the increase in the built up area in 2030 was also evident in the earlier study by thapa and murayama 2012 because of this rapid increase in the built up area there could be unprecedented stress on land water and forest ecosystems the water area was less than 2 of the total area compared with less than 0 3 in this study in the study by thapa 2012 and remained fairly constant around 2 from 1967 to 2011 4 2 identification of the critical locations for groundwater recharge the slope of the kathmandu valley varied from 0 to 4 3 this slope should not be a major concern for surface runoff as it is relatively small the scs runoff curve number was applied by mishra et al 2008 for the prediction of flood frequency in nepal with the cn varying from 50 to 80 similar to the cn range in this study the cn of the core of city center areas in this study varied from 78 to 94 other areas had a lower cn which was 67 54 and 33 in general the cn could be categorized as lower i e 33 and 54 for the vegetative and forest areas typically in the northern and southern territories of the kathmandu valley medium i e 67 and 78 for semi urban area and higher i e 85 86 and 94 for the highly urbanized city centers in order to find the critical locations for possible groundwater infiltration and surface runoff a map of the kathmandu valley was overlain onto administrative zones thapa and murayama 2012 thapa and murayama 2012 categorized the kathmandu valley as kathmandu city madhyapur thimi bhaktapur kirtipur and lalitpur as the major urban areas and other peri urban and rural areas in the kathmandu valley the land cover and the cn of 2030 were taken as representative figures in finding critical locations of the surface runoff and groundwater infiltration in the kathmandu valley fig 6 the critical locations for the possible groundwater recharge are identified based on the assumption that in the areas with higher runoff there will be less infiltration and vice versa though this assumption does not account for the moisture content and hydro geochemistry of the soil the results can be a benchmark to identify areas prone to runoff and groundwater recharge the comparison of the dominant cn in the core areas based on the analysis of fig 6 and the minimum and maximum surface runoff for 25 and 50 year return period for 2030 is shown in table 4 based on the summary of table 4 it is evident that the urbanized areas of the main cities of kathmandu valley have a higher surface runoff which were in the range 5 6 9 5 inch or 14 22 24 13 cm for kathmandu city the dominant cns in the kathmandu city are 85 and 94 limited groundwater infiltration will occur in kathmandu city because of this higher surface runoff toward the periphery as the cn gradually decreases there will be less runoff and more infiltration for other cities i e madhyapur thimi bhaktapur kirtipur and lalitpur the cn and the adjacent surface runoff are also comparable to that of in kathmandu city however for most of the northern and southern territories the minimum cn 33 is observed for which the surface runoff corresponds to 0 6 1 3 inch or 1 52 3 30 cm these northern and southern territories are dominated by forest and mountain areas with permeable soils because of lower surface runoff it is concluded that these northern lapsephedi gagalphedi nayapati sundarijal chapali bhadrakali budalinilkantha and baluwa and southern territories devichour nallu bhardv and godawari could be the potential areas for groundwater recharge in the kathmandu valley fig 6 and table 4 this conclusion is consistent with that of an earlier study which found that the northern territory consisting of huge permeable land surfaces could be the potential area for storage and recovery of groundwater recharge in kathmandu valley dixit and upadhya 2005 5 conclusions in this study usgs landsat satellite image of resolution 30 30 m was used to generate land use land cover lulc for 1996 and 2011 the lulc for 2030 was simulated with the land change modeler with an estimation accuracy of 50 6 the cn values for 2011 and 2030 were generated based on an arccn runoff model the average rainfall for the 2 10 25 and 50 year return periods under two different scenarios for current climatic condition 1979 2003 and future climatic condition 2075 2099 were used to calculate the runoff using the usda scs runoff equation the critical locations for the groundwater recharge were estimated based on the assumption that runoff is lower recharge will be higher and vice versa the water area throughout the study period was fairly constant with less than 0 3 for all of 1996 2011 and 2030 the city center of the kathmandu valley had a higher cn greater than 85 for both 2011 and 2030 the cn could generally be categorized as lower i e 33 and 54 for the vegetative and forest areas typically in the northern and southern territories of the kathmandu valley medium i e 67 and 78 for the semi urban area and higher i e 85 86 and 94 for the highly urbanized city centers the northern and southern part of the kathmandu valley having the lowest cn and hence the lower runoff and possibly higher infiltration could be the critical locations for groundwater recharge the northern area includes lapsephedi gagalphedi nayapati sundarijal chapali bhadrakali budalinilkantha and baluwa while the southern area includes devichour nallu bhardv and godawari 5 1 recommendations in order to increase the rate of infiltration at the urban city centers it is recommended to build artificial recharge trenches and permeable pavements however due to lack of systematic planning policy framework and categorization of the available groundwater database the groundwater in the kathmandu valley has not been properly managed the geospatial mapping generated in this study could provide fundamental basics for exploring runoff or infiltration and characterization of land use should be done based on its ability for groundwater recharge in addition field based monitoring and validation scheme will help to verify modelling approach of estimation of surface runoff and infiltration this mapping and monitoring scheme coupled with the development of a policy framework and a smart management approach are recommended for the groundwater recharge in the kathmandu valley

keywords dissolved organic matter extraction heavy metals interactions 1 introduction in natural waters dissolved organic matter is defined as a heterogeneous mixture of naturally occurring organic compounds and it originates from the degradation of living and dead plants animals and microorganisms it has been investigated in water systems around the world because of the significant roles this ubiquitous material plays in various biogeochemical and ecological processes the amounts of dissolved organic matter in water sources have been observed in many countries due to issues such as global warming changes in soil acidification increased drought severity and more intensive rain events fabris et al 2008 there are many analytical techniques used to characterize dom spectroscopic techniques become more prevalent in recent years they are efficient and non destructive they can provide information about the source and composition of the organic matter by eliminating the need for isolating or concentrating it prior to analysis among them gc ms ghosh et al 2015 ftir liu et al 2008 sec francisco et al 2008 nmr mladenov et al 2015 fluorescence and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva at

metals can exist as hydrated ions labile complexes predominantly with the respective anionic inorganic constituents of water and non labile complexes with components of the dissolved organic matter among these complexing dom components humic and fulvic acids are considered to be the major significance in speciation of heavy metal traces by dom in natural waters yang et al 2014 the importance of metal speciation and metal organic matter interaction has been pointed out by several investigators kuppusamy and giridhar 2006 quenea et al 2009 environmental conditions might have dramatic effects

this region relies almost entirely on groundwater as sources for drinking water production dom present in the groundwater in this region is predominantly derived from the fractured rock aquifer matrix and not from surface litter and soil the characteristics of the organic matter in this water are expected to be different it is necessary to quantify dom and to examine the relationship between dom

organic matter from groundwater interactions of dom and heavy metals are investigated heavy metals used in this work are cu ii zn ii and hg ii a mixture of the sample 3 mg of each metal and dom was used by ftir spectroscopy and x ray diffraction icp aes perkin elmmer optima 7300v was used to predict the interactions between dom and heavy metals using 4 ml of each sample for fluorescence study the interactions between cu ii zn ii and hg ii were carried out by adding 0 05 m of each metal ion solution to dom 0 05 m the ph was adjusted using 0 01 m of naoh neutral ph xiaoqiao and rudolf 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 general groundwater analysis physico chemical parameters were assessed to evaluate the groundwater suitability for drinking purpose table 1 calcium and magnesium are the most abundant elements in groundwater potassium concentration is low the concentration of cl bears strong correlation with the na content the ph is slightly acidic 3 2 chemical analysis of dom 3 2 1 uv spectroscopic analysis three shoulders are observed around 250 280 and 365 nm indicating the complexity of dom fig 2 an absorbance at 250 nm is associated with both the carboxylic and the aromatic chromophores while the band at 288 reflects the presence of the fulvic substances in dom vergnoux et al 2011 important information about the degree of aromaticity source extent of humification and molecular weight of dom can be provided by uv signal at 365 nm the chemical composition of dom is investigated using three parameters which are suva254 suva280 and e250 e365 table 2 the value of suva is known to be correlated to the percentage of aromaticity of organic matter via the equation weisharr et al 2003 5 aromaticity 6 52 suva 254 3 63 the average suva was 1 06 l mg 1 m 1 an indication of dom of moderate aromaticity table 2 the absorbance ratio at 250 and 365 nm e250 e365 is often used to characterize the molecular weight aromaticity and polycondensation degree of organic molecules it is inversely proportional to the degree of humification and molecular weight of dissolved organic matter the amount of dom in groundwater has been predicted with some parameters including total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod table 2 according to the world health organization who standards the maximum allowable cod levels in drinking water are 5 mg l 1 so the value of the groundwater is at a high level toc concentration is high compared to the data reported in other countries white et al 2003 this concentration value is highly variable from less than 1 mg l 1 in ground or seawaters to 2 10 mg l 1 in lake or river waters up to 10 g l 1 in marshes and fens canadian water quality guidelines 1996 total organic carbon is the most reliable method for the determination of the total amount of humic substances which generally account over half of the total organic carbon toc content in water 3 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy the spectrum of dom shows two close excitation peaks at high wavelengths fig 3 the first peak was observed at the wavelength between 350 and 400 nm this peak is associated with the presence of protein and or amino acid bound humic acid hur et al 2009 the second peak appears at the wavelength between 500 and 600 nm this broad bond with a maximum at 520 nm which is characteristic of humic acids no significant fluorescence peak was observed at the wavelength of 350 nm this fluorescence peak is known to be predominant for fulvic acid hur et al 2007 the humification index hix zsolnay et al 2009 and the biological index bix huguet et al 2009 are also determined hix estimates the degree of maturation of dom in water it is the ratio h l where h is the fluorescence intensity recorded at ex wavelength 255 nm for em spectrum integrated from 434 to 480 nm and l the fluorescence intensity recorded at ex wavelength 255 nm for em spectrum integrated from 300 to 344 nm high hix values 10 correspond to strongly humified aromatic dom principally of terrestrial origin while low values 4 are an indicator of more autochthonous dom justin birdwell and annette summers 2010 bix allows an evaluation of autochthonous biological activity in natural waters it is the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em wavelength 380 nm to that at 430 nm at ex wavelength 310 nm bix values 1 are related to a predominantly autochthonous origin of dom and to the presence of dom freshly produced whereas low bix values 0 6 0 7 correspond to a lower dom production huguet et al 2009 hix value can be used as an indicator for the condensation s degree of aromatic structures in dom fuentes et al 2007 in this work hix value is very low 0 1 this suggests that dom is characterized by a relatively low degree of condensed polyaromatic structures the bix value of dom extracted from tunisian groundwater is high equal to 1 22 hix and bix clearly show the dominance of biological autochthonous dom in the water the autochthonous organic matter is considered to be algal derived material whose components consist of predominantly amino acids carbohydrates and lipids burdige 2007 3 2 3 elemental analysis elemental analysis table 3 indicates that the groundwater contains a high amount of oxygen according to gondar et al 2005 a high value of nitrogen was indicative of high contents of non humified biomolecules polysaccharides and polypeptides in the material david and torgny 2001 attributed the high nitrogen value to the incomplete hydrolysis of proteins the high value of c n ratio may be related to high levels of products arising from protein decomposition the low h c ratio is characteristic of highly condensed aromatic compounds the h c value is similar to the data given by gottschalch et al 2007 for natural organic matter isolated from the aquifer i e 0 06 the relatively high value of o c suggests that the dom exhibits a low degree of aromatic condensation and is considerably aliphatic jouraiphy et al 2008 xiaoqiao et al 2000 this value is similar to that measured by huizhong et al 2001 for dissolved organic matter extracted from natural waters i e 1 28 3 2 4 ir spectroscopy fig 4 shows the ftir spectrum of the extracted dom ir spectroscopy result displayed that the dom contains different functional groups and indicated that the main organic compounds in the groundwater are carboxylic components 3434 cm 1 aliphatic hydrocarbon 2938 cm 1 phenolic compounds 1400 cm 1 polysaccharides and alcohols 1138 cm 1 strong absorption bands at 1000 cm 1 can be attributed to at least two different functional groups i e c o bands in alcohols ethers and polysaccharides senesi et al 2003 cho et al 1998 the spectrum showed aromatic cc stretching co stretching from carboxylic acids and n h bending vibrations of amine in the 1630 cm 1 region the relatively intense peak at around 1400 cm 1 was produced by the carbonates a weak absorption at 620 and 550 cm 1 is assigned to unsaturated bond and benzene ring the ftir spectrum of the dom is very similar to that reported for dissolved organic matter extracted from sludge song et al 2008 which composed of large amounts of protein carbohydrate and low molecular organic acids 3 2 5 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy the1h nmr result clearly shows that the major signals were observed at a chemical shift range between 1 and 2 ppm which comprises partially functionalized aliphatics fig 5 a the distribution of c moieties fig 5 b confirms the low aromatic character of the extracted dom the signals between 15 and 40 ppm suggest a high heterogeneity of the alkyl c including terminal methyl and methylene carbon in long chains and branched alkyl chains the bands at 17 and 23 ppm are attributed to linear methylene ch2 chains roscoe et al 2004 belonging either to cu in like structures or to other aliphatic rich bio moieties nierop et al 2001 the signal at 40 ppm is due to the resonance of the secondary methyne carbon ch possibly generated by chlorophyll like and terpene like systems benke et al 1998 the dom extracted from ain senan water exhibited the highest amounts of carbohydrates or alcoholic carbons at 75 ppm and the lowest amounts of aromatics carbons at 125 145 ppm similar trends were observed in the 13c nmr spectrum of humic substance isolated from a sample collected from rio negro amazon state brazil peuravuori and pihlaj 1998 3 2 6 py gc ms the analysis by pyrolysis cg ms shows that dom possesses both aliphatic and aromatic character fig 6 shows the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene basic pic is at 91 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid basic pic is at 149 2 methyl 7 phenylindole basic pic is at 207 in the chromatogram aromatic hydrocarbons present in water indicated that these pollutants were caused by anthropogenic activities around the study area however many previous studies proposed that the benzenedicarboxylic acid found in groundwater are produced by the photochemical degradation of long chain dicarboxylic acid and the production of c2 c3 comes from the chemical oxidation of c4 chain length component cong et al 2015 the pyrolytic degradation of proteins often yields nitrogen containing products such as pyridines pyrroles and indoles some polypeptides also produce fragments in characteristic relative proportions the phenolic acid derivatives 2 ethylhexyl and diisooctyl ester might represent the final steps in the oxidation of side chains during the microbial degradation of lignin and to be pristine components of the humic structure martin et al 1995 3 2 7 size exclusion chromatography size exclusion chromatography was used to obtain the molecular weight distributions mwds of dissolved organic matter dom extracted from ain senan drinking water source fig 7 chromatographic study reveals that dom can be composed of molecules with relatively small molecular sizes according to the literature data mouna et al 2012 dom is composed of different classes of compounds with relatively small molecular sizes mainly amines amides carbohydrates and polysaccharides weight average mw number average mn and polydispersity ρ of individual dom are calculated dom was characterized by low values of mw 1120 g mol 1 mn 765 g mol 1 and ρ 1 46 a low polydispersity value indicating the significant heterogeneity of dom extracted from ain senan water similar results were found by namguk et al 2003 for dissolved organic matter extracted from irvine ranch groundwater the organic matter exhibited multimodal distributions which indicated the presence of both humic substances and that pool of organic matter is significantly smaller i e hydrophilic organic acids etc presumably the first broad second peak indicated the presence of the more non labile fulvic and humic acids while the later peak is believed to be comprised of smaller dissolved organic species similar to the data reported by stefan et al 2011 for organic matter extracted from the river pfinz near karlsruhe germany the presence of peaks with low elution time indicates that dom contains polar groups with small molecular weight 3 3 interactions of heavy metals with dissolved organic matter 3 3 1 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectra of dom zn ii hg ii cu ii zn complex cu complex and hg complex are shown in fig 8 according to the literature the most important characteristic of the ir spectra of humic substances is an absorption peak at about 1700 cm 1 assigned to co stretching the reaction between metal ions and cooh functional groups forming a metal ion complex results in the disappearance of the 1700 cm 1 absorption band and the appearance of bands at 1600 cm 1 and 1380 cm 1 symmetric coo and antisymmetric coo stretching the disappearance of this band 1700 cm 1 indicates that most of the cooh groups were converted to the coo form ir spectrum of zn complex showed only slight counters of the 1700 and 1220 cm 1 bands suggesting that not all cooh groups take part in ion exchange the content of zinc in the potentially mobile form was even higher than that in the compounds strongly bound to organic matter cu ii is bound preferentially to oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups erdogan et al 2007 cu complex give rise to the weakest adsorption in the 3410 3400 cm 1 region fig 8 spectrum g shows a decrease of the absorption intensity of the bonds at 3446 and 1628 cm 1 this suggests that the adsorption of hg2 on humic acid was mainly acted on h bonded o h groups and c o groups of humic acid as research martyniuk and wieckowska 2003 proved hg ions are able to form complex compounds with carboxylic and phenolic groups of humic substances 3 3 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fig 9 shows browed peaks at wavelengths ranging from 415 to 512 nm in dom spectrum according to chai et al 2012 such fluorescence characteristics could be attributed to the presence of unsaturated carbon bearing carbonyl and carboxylic groups in the dom fluorescence emission spectra showed a successive decrease in fluorescence intensity as hg ii zn ii and cu ii were added to dom the addition of hg ii solution to dom after being shaken for 24 h fluorescence quenching was observed the possible mechanism of fluorescence quenching is probably due to the fact that bending of a metal ion changes the electronic polarization of both the metal ion and the binding site in dom sample resulting in a fluorescence intensity increase or decrease at a specific emission wavelength according to diana et al 2006 and xiaoqiao and rudolf 2001 metal ions can precipitate dom under certain conditions and the decrease of fluorescence intensity could be resulted from the formation of the coprecipitation of hg ii zn ii and cu ii with dom sample cu2 added to dom will complex unoccupied binding sites on the organic matter and will also probably displace more weakly bound metal ions such as zn2 hg2 must have been bound to fluorophore related functional groups from the dom perelomov and pinskii 2003 believe that the weak complexation of zn by dom could also be related to the fact that zn predominant forms outer sphere or unstable inner sphere complexes with organic substances which can be decomposed under water pretreatment conditions copper can form more stable inner sphere organomineral chelate like complex 3 3 3 x ray diffraction the direct methods for the determination of heavy metal interactions based on x ray absorption spectroscopy have been developed rapidly in the last decades xrd patterns fig 10 show no appreciable changes in the diffraction pattern of the metal complex compared to the original sample fig 10 shows that after a reaction between heavy metals and dom the intensity of some peaks are decreased with increasing zn cu and hg concentration spectra d e g due to their retention by organic matter some authors suggest that the ion size of the metals affects these retentions xu and tao 2004 3 3 4 icp aes icp aes is applied for determining the interactions of dissolved organic matter and heavy metals quenea et al 2009 in table 4 the detected amounts of species in dom extracted from tunisian water and the final concentration of the mixture dom heavy metals after interactions as can be seen from this table that copper zinc and mercury are absent in the dom s composition at the beginning but after interactions their values are increased this confirms the interactions between cu ii hg ii zn ii and dom heavy metals share their compounds in the organic matter metal ion radii values cu 73 zn 74 hg 110 which suggests that the ion size of metals affects their retention by organic matter the rapid complexation and mobilization of cu 2 and zn 2 is probably due to the presence of fulvic acid in organic matter plaza et al 2005 özkaraova güngör and miray 2010 with a high resolution of icp aes instrument it is possible to determine the interactions between dom and heavy metals 4 conclusions dom extracted from tunisian groundwater was examined using analytical methods the results obtained from sec uv visible absorbance 13c 1h nmr elemental analysis pyrolysis gc ms fluorescence and ftir were well correlated this study demonstrates a low polydispersity value of 1 46 indicating the significant heterogeneity of dom extracted from ain senan water a low suva absorbance and fluorescence were attributed to a larger

keywords dissolved organic matter extraction heavy metals interactions 1 introduction in natural waters dissolved organic matter is defined as a heterogeneous mixture of naturally occurring organic compounds and it originates from the degradation of living and dead plants animals and microorganisms it has been investigated in water systems around the world because of the significant roles this ubiquitous material plays in various biogeochemical and ecological processes the amounts of dissolved organic matter in water sources have been observed in many countries due to issues such as global warming changes in soil acidification increased drought severity and more intensive rain events fabris et al 2008 there are many analytical techniques used to characterize dom spectroscopic techniques become more prevalent in recent years they are efficient and non destructive they can provide information about the source and composition of the organic matter by eliminating the need for isolating or concentrating it prior to analysis among them gc ms ghosh et al 2015 ftir liu et al 2008 sec francisco et al 2008 nmr mladenov et al 2015 fluorescence and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva at 254 and 280 nm appear to be useful and practical mladenov et al 2015 in natural waters the trace of heavy metals are distributed between the dissolved and solid phase for the dissolved phase heavy metals can exist as hydrated ions labile complexes predominantly with the respective anionic inorganic constituents of water and non labile complexes with components of the dissolved organic matter among these complexing dom components humic and fulvic acids are considered to be the major significance in speciation of heavy metal traces by dom in natural waters yang et al 2014 the importance of metal speciation and metal organic matter interaction has been pointed out by several investigators kuppusamy and giridhar 2006 quenea et al 2009 environmental conditions might have dramatic effects on the binding of metals to dissolved organic matter dom quenea et al 2009 the objective of this work is to assess the amount and composition of dom extracted from tunisian groundwater ain senan kef this region relies almost entirely on groundwater as sources for drinking water production dom present in the groundwater in this region is predominantly derived from the fractured rock aquifer matrix and not from surface litter and soil the characteristics of the organic matter in this water are expected to be different it is necessary to quantify dom and to examine the relationship between dom

organic matter from groundwater interactions of dom and heavy metals are investigated heavy metals used in this work are cu ii zn ii and hg ii a mixture of the sample 3 mg of each metal and dom was used by ftir spectroscopy and x ray diffraction icp aes perkin elmmer optima 7300v was used to predict the interactions between dom and heavy metals using 4 ml of each sample for fluorescence study the interactions between cu ii zn ii and hg ii were carried out by adding 0 05 m of each metal ion solution to dom 0 05 m the ph was adjusted using 0 01 m of naoh neutral ph xiaoqiao and rudolf 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 general groundwater analysis physico chemical parameters were assessed to evaluate the groundwater suitability for drinking purpose table 1 calcium and magnesium are the most abundant elements in groundwater potassium concentration is low the concentration of cl bears strong correlation with the na content the ph is slightly acidic 3 2 chemical analysis of dom 3 2 1 uv spectroscopic analysis three shoulders are observed around 250 280 and 365 nm indicating the complexity of dom fig 2 an absorbance at 250 nm is associated with both the carboxylic and the aromatic chromophores while the band at 288 reflects the presence of the fulvic substances in dom vergnoux et al 2011 important information about the degree of aromaticity source extent of humification and molecular weight of dom can be provided by uv signal at 365 nm the chemical composition of dom is investigated using three parameters which are suva254 suva280 and e250 e365 table 2 the value of suva is known to be correlated to the percentage of aromaticity of organic matter via the equation weisharr et al 2003 5 aromaticity 6 52 suva 254 3 63 the average suva was 1 06 l mg 1 m 1 an indication of dom of moderate aromaticity table 2 the absorbance ratio at 250 and 365 nm e250 e365 is often used to characterize the molecular weight aromaticity and polycondensation degree of organic molecules it is inversely proportional to the degree of humification and molecular weight of dissolved organic matter the amount of dom in groundwater has been predicted with some parameters including total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod table 2 according to the world health organization who standards the maximum allowable cod levels in drinking water are 5 mg l 1 so the value of the groundwater is at a high level toc concentration is high compared to the data reported in other countries white et al 2003 this concentration value is highly variable from less than 1 mg l 1 in ground or seawaters to 2 10 mg l 1 in lake or river waters up to 10 g l 1 in marshes and fens canadian water quality guidelines 1996 total organic carbon is the most reliable method for the determination of the total amount of humic substances which generally account over half of the total organic carbon toc content in water 3 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy the spectrum of dom shows two close excitation peaks at high wavelengths fig 3 the first peak was observed at the wavelength between 350 and 400 nm this peak is associated with the presence of protein and or amino acid bound humic acid hur et al 2009 the second peak appears at the wavelength between 500 and 600 nm this broad bond with a maximum at 520 nm which is characteristic of humic acids no significant fluorescence peak was observed at the wavelength of 350 nm this fluorescence peak is known to be predominant for fulvic acid hur et al 2007 the humification index hix zsolnay et al 2009 and the biological index bix huguet et al 2009 are also determined hix estimates the degree of maturation of dom in water it is the ratio h l where h is the fluorescence intensity recorded at ex wavelength 255 nm for em spectrum integrated from 434 to 480 nm and l the fluorescence intensity recorded at ex wavelength 255 nm for em spectrum integrated from 300 to 344 nm high hix values 10 correspond to strongly humified aromatic dom principally of terrestrial origin while low values 4 are an indicator of more autochthonous dom justin birdwell and annette summers 2010 bix allows an evaluation of autochthonous biological activity in natural waters it is the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em wavelength 380 nm to that at 430 nm at ex wavelength 310 nm bix values 1 are related to a predominantly autochthonous origin of dom and to the presence of dom freshly produced whereas low bix values 0 6 0 7 correspond to a lower dom production huguet et al 2009 hix value can be used as an indicator for the condensation s degree of aromatic structures in dom fuentes et al 2007 in this work hix value is very low 0 1 this suggests that dom is characterized by a relatively low degree of condensed polyaromatic structures the bix value of dom extracted from tunisian groundwater is high equal to 1 22 hix and bix clearly show the dominance of biological autochthonous dom in the water the autochthonous organic matter is considered to be algal derived material whose components consist of predominantly amino acids carbohydrates and lipids burdige 2007 3 2 3 elemental analysis elemental analysis table 3 indicates that the groundwater contains a high amount of oxygen according to gondar et al 2005 a high value of nitrogen was indicative of high contents of non humified biomolecules polysaccharides and polypeptides in the material david and torgny 2001 attributed the high nitrogen value to the incomplete hydrolysis of proteins the high value of c n ratio may be related to high levels of products arising from protein decomposition the low h c ratio is characteristic of highly condensed aromatic compounds the h c value is similar to the data given by gottschalch et al 2007 for natural organic matter isolated from the aquifer i e 0 06 the relatively high value of o c suggests that the dom exhibits a low degree of aromatic condensation and is considerably aliphatic jouraiphy et al 2008 xiaoqiao et al 2000 this value is similar to that measured by huizhong et al 2001 for dissolved organic matter extracted from natural waters i e 1 28 3 2 4 ir spectroscopy fig 4 shows the ftir spectrum of the extracted dom ir spectroscopy result displayed that the dom contains different functional groups and indicated that the main organic compounds in the groundwater are carboxylic components 3434 cm 1 aliphatic hydrocarbon 2938 cm 1 phenolic compounds 1400 cm 1 polysaccharides and alcohols 1138 cm 1 strong absorption bands at 1000 cm 1 can be attributed to at least two different functional groups i e c o bands in alcohols ethers and polysaccharides senesi et al 2003 cho et al 1998 the spectrum showed aromatic cc stretching co stretching from carboxylic acids and n h bending vibrations of amine in the 1630 cm 1 region the relatively intense peak at around 1400 cm 1 was produced by the carbonates a weak absorption at 620 and 550 cm 1 is assigned to unsaturated bond and benzene ring the ftir spectrum of the dom is very similar to that reported for dissolved organic matter extracted from sludge song et al 2008 which composed of large amounts of protein carbohydrate and low molecular organic acids 3 2 5 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy the1h nmr result clearly shows that the major signals were observed at a chemical shift range between 1 and 2 ppm which comprises partially functionalized aliphatics fig 5 a the distribution of c moieties fig 5 b confirms the low aromatic character of the extracted dom the signals between 15 and 40 ppm suggest a high heterogeneity of the alkyl c including terminal methyl and methylene carbon in long chains and branched alkyl chains the bands at 17 and 23 ppm are attributed to linear methylene ch2 chains roscoe et al 2004 belonging either to cu in like structures or to other aliphatic rich bio moieties nierop et al 2001 the signal at 40 ppm is due to the resonance of the secondary methyne carbon ch possibly generated by chlorophyll like and terpene like systems benke et al 1998 the dom extracted from ain senan water exhibited the highest amounts of carbohydrates or alcoholic carbons at 75 ppm and the lowest amounts of aromatics carbons at 125 145 ppm similar trends were observed in the 13c nmr spectrum of humic substance isolated from a sample collected from rio negro amazon state brazil peuravuori and pihlaj 1998 3 2 6 py gc ms the analysis by pyrolysis cg ms shows that dom possesses both aliphatic and aromatic character fig 6 shows the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene basic pic is at 91 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid basic pic is at 149 2 methyl 7 phenylindole basic pic is at 207 in the chromatogram aromatic hydrocarbons present in water indicated that these pollutants were caused by anthropogenic activities around the study area however many previous studies proposed that the benzenedicarboxylic acid found in groundwater are produced by the photochemical degradation of long chain dicarboxylic acid and the production of c2 c3 comes from the chemical oxidation of c4 chain length component cong et al 2015 the pyrolytic degradation of proteins often yields nitrogen containing products such as pyridines pyrroles and indoles some polypeptides also produce fragments in characteristic relative proportions the phenolic acid derivatives 2 ethylhexyl and diisooctyl ester might represent the final steps in the oxidation of side chains during the microbial degradation of lignin and to be pristine components of the humic structure martin et al 1995 3 2 7 size exclusion chromatography size exclusion chromatography was used to obtain the molecular weight distributions mwds of dissolved organic matter dom extracted from ain senan drinking water source fig 7 chromatographic study reveals that dom can be composed of molecules with relatively small molecular sizes according to the literature data mouna et al 2012 dom is composed of different classes of compounds with relatively small molecular sizes mainly amines amides carbohydrates and polysaccharides weight average mw number average mn and polydispersity ρ of individual dom are calculated dom was characterized by low values of mw 1120 g mol 1 mn 765 g mol 1 and ρ 1 46 a low polydispersity value indicating the significant heterogeneity of dom extracted from ain senan water similar results were found by namguk et al 2003 for dissolved organic matter extracted from irvine ranch groundwater the organic matter exhibited multimodal distributions which indicated the presence of both humic substances and that pool of organic matter is significantly smaller i e hydrophilic organic acids etc presumably the first broad second peak indicated the presence of the more non labile fulvic and humic acids while the later peak is believed to be comprised of smaller dissolved organic species similar to the data reported by stefan et al 2011 for organic matter extracted from the river pfinz near karlsruhe germany the presence of peaks with low elution time indicates that dom contains polar groups with small molecular weight 3 3 interactions of heavy metals with dissolved organic matter 3 3 1 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectra of dom zn ii hg ii cu ii zn complex cu complex and hg complex are shown in fig 8 according to the literature the most important characteristic of the ir spectra of humic substances is an absorption peak at about 1700 cm 1 assigned to co stretching the reaction between metal ions and cooh functional groups forming a metal ion complex results in the disappearance of the 1700 cm 1 absorption band and the appearance of bands at 1600 cm 1 and 1380 cm 1 symmetric coo and antisymmetric coo stretching the disappearance of this band 1700 cm 1 indicates that most of the cooh groups were converted to the coo form ir spectrum of zn complex showed only slight counters of the 1700 and 1220 cm 1 bands suggesting that not all cooh groups take part in ion exchange the content of zinc in the potentially mobile form was even higher than that in the compounds strongly bound to organic matter cu ii is bound preferentially to oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups erdogan et al 2007 cu complex give rise to the weakest adsorption in the 3410 3400 cm 1 region fig 8 spectrum g shows a decrease of the absorption intensity of the bonds at 3446 and 1628 cm 1 this suggests that the adsorption of hg2 on humic acid was mainly acted on h bonded o h groups and c o groups of humic acid as research martyniuk and wieckowska 2003 proved hg ions are able to form complex compounds with carboxylic and phenolic groups of humic substances 3 3 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fig 9 shows browed peaks at wavelengths ranging from 415 to 512 nm in dom spectrum according to chai et al 2012 such fluorescence characteristics could be attributed to the presence of unsaturated carbon bearing carbonyl and carboxylic groups in the dom fluorescence emission spectra showed a successive decrease in fluorescence intensity as hg ii zn ii and cu ii were added to dom the addition of hg ii solution to dom after being shaken for 24 h fluorescence quenching was observed the possible mechanism of fluorescence quenching is probably due to the fact that bending of a metal ion changes the electronic polarization of both the metal ion and the binding site in dom sample resulting in a fluorescence intensity increase or decrease at a specific emission wavelength according to diana et al 2006 and xiaoqiao and rudolf 2001 metal ions can precipitate dom under certain conditions and the decrease of fluorescence intensity could be resulted from the formation of the coprecipitation of hg ii zn ii and cu ii with dom sample cu2 added to dom will complex unoccupied binding sites on the organic matter and will also probably displace more weakly bound metal ions such as zn2 hg2 must have been bound to fluorophore related functional groups from the dom perelomov and pinskii 2003 believe that the weak complexation of zn by dom could also be related to the fact that zn predominant forms outer sphere or unstable inner sphere complexes with organic substances which can be decomposed under water pretreatment conditions copper can form more stable inner sphere organomineral chelate like complex 3 3 3 x ray diffraction the direct methods for the determination of heavy metal interactions based on x ray absorption spectroscopy have been developed rapidly in the last decades xrd patterns fig 10 show no appreciable changes in the diffraction pattern of the metal complex compared to the original sample fig 10 shows that after a reaction between heavy metals and dom the intensity of some peaks are decreased with increasing zn cu and hg concentration spectra d e g due to their retention by organic matter some authors suggest that the ion size of the metals affects these retentions xu and tao 2004 3 3 4 icp aes icp aes is applied for determining the interactions of dissolved organic matter and heavy metals quenea et al 2009 in table 4 the detected amounts of species in dom extracted from tunisian water and the final concentration of the mixture dom heavy metals after interactions as can be seen from this table that copper zinc and mercury are absent in the dom s composition at the beginning but after interactions their values are increased this confirms the interactions between cu ii hg ii zn ii and dom heavy metals share their compounds in the organic matter metal ion radii values cu 73 zn 74 hg 110 which suggests that the ion size of metals affects their retention by organic matter the rapid complexation and mobilization of cu 2 and zn 2 is probably due to the presence of fulvic acid in organic matter plaza et al 2005 özkaraova güngör and miray 2010 with a high resolution of icp aes instrument it is possible to determine the interactions between dom and heavy metals 4 conclusions dom extracted from tunisian groundwater was examined using analytical methods the results obtained from sec uv visible absorbance 13c 1h nmr elemental analysis pyrolysis gc ms fluorescence and ftir were well correlated this study demonstrates a low polydispersity value of 1 46 indicating the significant heterogeneity of dom extracted from ain senan water a low suva absorbance and fluorescence were attributed to a larger proportion of non absorbing non fluorescing carbon typical of aliphatic nature elemental analysis and ftir analysis have revealed that polysaccharides were the main organic compounds present in groundwater gc ms indicated that aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and benzene originating from fluvic acids were also present in dom in addition the use of gc ms revealed the presence the indole which is a result of the pyrolytic degradation of proteins the interactions of heavy metals and dom were investigated using x ray diffraction icp aes fluorescence and ftir spectroscopies the ftir spectra indicate that zn appears to be bound to humic acid primarily through carboxyl functional groups while hg ions apparently are bound through carboxylic phenolic and alcoholic moieties cu ii is bound preferentially to oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups fluorescence spectroscopy shows that metal ions can be complexed by dom under certain conditions x ray diffraction indicates that the decrease of intensity is due to the interactions between zn ii hg ii cu ii and dom icp aes showed that the amounts of zn ii hg ii and cu ii found in the final composition of dom while did not exist in the initial composition of dom these results confirm that heavy metals share their compounds in the organic matter based on the obtained results the quality of groundwater depends on various chemical constituents and their concentration which are mostly derived from the geological data of the region and all parameters were within the permissible limits the groundwater of ain senan kef is

adsorbents were studied using the hrtem the specific surface area and pore parameter of the samples were obtained through n2 adsorption desorption isotherm using quantachrome autosorb iq model at 77 k the brunauer emmette teller bet method was used for determination of the specific surface area and the barrett joyner halenda bjh method was used to calculate the pore size distribution and pore volume in the samples prior to the adsorption study the samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 c for 3 h the fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir technique was used to study the functional group present on the surface of the adsorbents and also to study the adsorption of cr vi the ftir spectra were obtained in the wave number range 400 4000 cm 1 using perkinelmer ftir spectrum two ftir 95277 in humidity free atmosphere at room temperature samples were prepared by mixing with kbr and compressing the mixture to form pellets prior to ftir study 2 2 adsorption experiment a stock solution of 1000 mg l cr vi was prepared by dissolving k2cr2o7 merck reagent ar grade with deionized millipore water the desired cr vi concentrations 5 25 mg l were prepared by successive dilutions of the stock solution the batch experiment was carried out to study the cr vi adsorption onto calcined goethite in 250 ml stoppered conical flask by mixing 1 g of sample and 100 ml of cr vi solution at room temperature 25 c the flask containing solutions were kept in orbital incubator shaker with constant shaking at 150 rpm and an equilibrium reached at nearly 1 h adsorption experiments were

goethite used and v l is the volume of the solution 2 3 adsorption kinetic models to understand the reaction pathway and the potential rate controlling mechanisms during adsorption most commonly accepted pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models are applied to the data obtained from the batch experiments georgieva et al 2015 2 3 1 pseudo first order model the lagergren pseudo first order model describes the adsorption rate based on the adsorption potential nemr et al 2008 the integral form of this model is expressed using following equation 3 3 log q e q t logq e k 1 2 303 t where qe and qt mg g represents the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium and at different time interval t min respectively k1 1 min is the rate constant of pseudo first order equation the adsorption rate constant k1 and qe are determined from the slope and intercept of the linear plot between log qe qt and t respectively 2 3 2 pseudo second order model further the pseudo

min and the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mg g are calculated from the linear plot of t qt versus t 2 3 3 intraparticle diffusion model the adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution to the solid phase is a multi step process which involves three types of processes the first step involves the transport of adsorbate from aqueous phase to the surface of solid adsorbent called bulk diffusion or boundary layer diffusion the second step involves the diffusion of adsorbate adsorb in the interior of adsorbent particles called film diffusion and the final stage is the pore or intraparticle diffusion step where the adsorption takes place inside the pores of adsorbent nemr et al 2008 deng et al 2015 the intraparticle diffusion model can be expressed using equation 5 5 q t k d t 1 2 c 1 where kd mg g min1 2 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c1 mg g is the intercept obtained from the slope and intercept from the linear plot of qt versus t1 2 respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of goethite and calcined product the xrd patterns of goethite and its calcined product at different temperature are shown in fig 1 all the peaks of raw sample and its calcined product up to 200 c are identified as goethite it is observed that the peak intensity of goethite shows a small decrease when the temperature increases up to 200 c and then peaks disappear with further increase in temperature no peaks corresponding to goethite are detected at 300 c new peaks are developed when the raw sample is calcined at 300 c and are identified as hematite it indicates that the goethite transforms into hematite due to dehydration and dehydroxylation of goethite around 300 c through equation 6 dai et al 2016 6 α feooh 300 c α fe 2 o 3 h 2 o the ftir spectrum of goethite and calcined goethite at different temperature is shown in fig 2 the goethite at 25 c shows the presence of broad band at 3112 cm 1 which is related to oh stretching a prominent absorption band at 1650 cm 1 is attributed to h2o the bands at 1080 and 1023 cm 1 are caused due to the presence of si o bending mode frost and vassallo 1996 luxton et al 2008 the two strong characteristic bands of goethite representing the oh deformation centered at 894 and 799 cm 1 are observed liu et al 2013 ruan et al 2002 the band centered around 664 cm 1 assigned to an anti symmetric fe oh stretching vibration and the band at 613 and 460 cm 1 are due to symmetric fe o stretching vibration all the above bands are present in the sample calcined at 200 c which further indicate that goethite remains unaltered till 200 c similar results are also observed from the xrd study when the goethite calcined at temperature 300 c new band at 3380 cm 1 appeared and it is due to the oh stretching the h2o band shifts to 1630 cm 1 from 1650 cm 1 all the bands at 460 613 664 799 and 894 cm 1 present up to 200 c are disappeared a set of new band at 540 and 464 cm 1 are developed and representing characteristics of hematite also the bands at 1080 and 1023 cm 1 are present all the bands present in the sample calcined at 300 c also appeared up to 500 c though the intensity of the hematite bands at 540 and 464 cm 1 are slightly diminished the tem images of goethite and its calcined product at 200 300 400 and 500 c are shown in fig 3 the gradual changes in the morphology at different temperatures are clearly visible the natural goethite consists of needle shaped crystals of various sizes fig 3a after calcination at 200 c the goethite particles show the development of minor scale slit shaped pore however at 300 c the slit shaped pores are more prominent and abundance these slit shaped pores form longitudinally and having width varies from about 1 to 10 nm at 300 c liu et al 2013 observed similar porous microstructure upon heating goethite at 300 c and attributed to its dehydroxylation at 400 c the slit shaped pores are no longer retained the pore structure changes to spherical nano shaped pores having diameter nearly 4 22 nm the goethite decomposes and flattens the pores that transform split into large size pores hirokawa et al 1986 as the temperature reaches 500 c the pore boundary diffuses due to the pore coalescence and resulted in subsequent growth into many micropores similar observation with pore structure and pore size is reported earlier pomies et al 1998 the hrtem images and saed pattern show that raw goethite transformed to hematite at 300 c fig 4 the inter planar distance of 0 418 nm corresponding to the 110 plane of goethite is observed similarly the hematite is confirmed by the presence inter plane distance of 0 269 and 0 251 nm corresponding to the 104 and 110 plane respectively the result of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms used for determination of bet surface area is given in fig 5 according to the iupac classification the adsorption desorption isotherms of goethite and its calcined products belong to type iv category which is a indicative of the presence of mesoporosity due to capillary condensation oulego et al 2016 the hysteresis loop can be classified into h3 type which indicates that the adsorbents consist of slit shaped pores the pores are interconnected due to the absence of saturation in hysteresis loop and also the presence of closure point at p po 0 nayak and nayak 2016 cychosz et al 2016 the parameters obtained by means of n2 adsorption desorption method are summarized in table 1 the bet surface area of goethite is found to be 7 m2 g and then it increases to the maximum of 126 m2 g when it is calcined at 300 c the bet surface area started to decrease with calcination temperature beyond 300 c the surface area is found to be 59 and 10 m2 g at 400 and 500 c respectively similar to the variation of surface area total pore volume also follows the same pattern pore volume is 0 013 cm3 g for the goethite at 25 c and increases to 0 196 cm3 g at 300 c followed by sharp decrease to 0 028 cm3 g at 500 c liu et al 2013 proposed that the dramatic increase in surface area at 300 c is due to the dehydroxylation of goethite then there is decrease in surface area on heating goethite above 400 c due to grain coarsening hence the resultant surface area and its total pore volume reveal that goethite calcined at 300 c has maximum number of active surface sites for adsorption of metal ions table 1 the bjh pore size distribution curves for all samples are shown in fig 6 the pore size distribution varies from 3 2 to 3 9 nm the size range also indicates that adsorbents are mesoporous in nature the pore size is around 3 2 nm at 25 c and shown steep increase to 3 7 nm at 200 c followed by slow increase as it reaches 3 9 nm at 500 c these observations are also consistence with the findings of the tem analysis which depicted the increase in pore size with rise in calcined temperature 3 2 adsorption of cr vi the effect of initial concentration on cr vi removal onto goethite and its calcined product at different temperatures is shown in fig 7 it is observed that the cr vi removal decreases with increase in concentration the lower efficiency of removal at higher concentration is due to the higher number of cr vi ions leads to more collisions between them at the fixed available surface sites of adsorbent rivera corredor et al 2014 however the performance for cr vi removal by goethite and its calcine products varies with bet surface area the highest percentage removal of nearly 86 has occurred onto goethite calcined at 300 c the removal of cr vi decreases with calcine temperature above 300 c this is due to the occurrence of maximum surface area in calcined goethite at 300 c hence the variation in cr vi removal seems to be consistent according to their surface area 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the langmuir isotherm is utilized to obtain the adsorption capacity of different adsorbents the langmuir isotherm is applied on a homogeneous surface at the monolayer sorption sites and thereafter no further sorption can take place once the surface is saturated yuan et al 2013 the adsorption isotherm of cr vi onto goethite and its calcine products is shown in fig 8 the linearized form of langmuir isotherm is described by equation 7 7 c e q e 1 q 0 b 1 q 0 c e where ce mg l and qe mg g are the equilibrium concentration of cr vi in solution and the amount of cr vi adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent respectively the q0 mg g is the monolayer adsorption capacity and b l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant the q0 and b are determined from the slope and intercept of the plot between ce qe and ce various parameters obtained from the isotherm study are given in table 2 the adsorption capacities obtained from the langmuir isotherms are 0 569 1 462 2 053 1 506 and 1 295 mg g for the calcined temperature of 25 200 300 400 and 500 c respectively this indicates that adsorption capacity increases with increase in temperature up to 300 c where it becomes maximum then it decreases with increase in temperature thus the equilibrium isotherm demonstrated that the sample calcined at 300 c has considerably higher potential for cr vi adsorption the isotherm study shows a good fit with langmuir isotherm model as the correction coefficient r2 varies from 0 95 to 0 99 the langmuir isotherm can also be expressed in terms of separation factor rl a dimensionless constant jalil et al 2010 it is used to evaluate whether the sorption is favourable or unfavourable using equation 8 idris et al 2013 8 r l 1 1 bc 0 where c0 mg l is the initial cr vi concentration and b l mg is the langmuir constant based on the rl the adsorption process can be classified into i favourable adsorption when it is 0 rl 1 ii unfavourable for rl 1 iii rl 1 the sorption is linear and iv rl 0 for irreversible sorption song and wu 2014 it is found that the value of rl lies between 0 and 1 table 3 this indicates that a favourable cr vi adsorption occurs onto goethite and its calcined products the rl values of calcined goethite at 300 c are minimum for all the concentration which indicates the most favourable adsorption at this particular temperature 3 4 adsorption kinetic study the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models are applied to the adsorption data obtained using the calcined product at 300 c since it shows the maximum adsorption capacity the value of kinetic model parameters and regression coefficients r2 obtained from various kinetic plots fig 9 are given in table 4 the value of r2 of pseudo second order kinetic model is relatively higher 0 997 than that of the pseudo first order model 0 927 besides the calculated equilibrium capacity of pseudo second order model 0 432 mg g is very close to that of the experimental equilibrium capacity 0 429 mg g this implies that the adsorption of cr vi onto the calcined goethite follows the pseudo second order kinetic model thus the adsorption of cr vi involves the chemisorption process as described by the pseudo second order kinetic model ho and mckay 1999 the diffusion kinetic model fig 9c shows that the linear graph does not pass through the origin which indicates the intraparticle diffusion is not the only controlling mechanism thus adsorption process of cr vi onto calcined goethite is controlled by more than one step furthermore the linear plot gives the intercept c1 which provides the measure of the boundary layer thickness as the c1 is very small it suggests that the surface diffusion step plays minor role as the rate determining step during adsorption process 3 5 thermodynamic study to evaluate the feasibility of the adsorption process various thermodynamic parameters such as change in gibb s free energy δg change in enthalpy δh and change in entropy δs are calculated at different temperatures between 298 and 313 k using equations 9 11 romero gonzalez et al 2005 9 k c q e c e 10 δ g rtln k c 11 logk c δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 rt where kc is the equilibrium constant qe is the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium mg g and ce is the equilibrium concentration of cr vi in solution mg l t is temperature in kelvin k and r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k the δh and δs are obtained from the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot between logkc and 1 t respectively fig 10 the calculated value of the thermodynamic parameters is given in table 5 the δg values are found to be negative at all temperatures indicate the spontaneous and feasible cr vi adsorption gorzin and abadi 2018 the decrease in values of δg with an increase in temperature shows more cr vi adsorption at high temperature on calcined goethite the positive value of δh indicates that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature in addition the positive value of δs indicates that there is an increase in randomness between solid solution interface during the adsorption process 3 6 adsorption mechanism the ftir spectroscopy is used to determine the interaction mechanism of adsorbed molecule in the adsorbent and help in understanding the adsorption mechanism hoffmann 1983 hsia et al 1993 the ftir spectra of goethite calcined at 300 c is compared with that of after adsorption as maximum adsorption capacity is shown in this sample in fig 11 it is noticed that there is slight shifting splitting and appearance of new peaks after adsorption of cr vi onto the calcined sample the peaks at 3380 and 1630 cm 1 have shifted to 3370 and 1626 cm 1 after cr vi adsorption suggesting that the bonded oh groups played an important role in adsorption process jia et al 2012 deng et al 2015 the peak at 874 cm 1 which represents the oh group is disappeared after the reaction with cr vi a set of two new peaks are appeared at 920 and 869 cm 1 instead which can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of cr o bonds hu et al 2007 johnston and chrysochoou 2012 huang et al 2016 lei et al 2017 this indicates that the oh bending frequency of calcined goethite is replaced by cr o bond which further ascertain that cr vi forms complexes with oh functional groups and forming inner spheric complex to further confirm the adsorption of cr vi onto the calcined sample at 300 c the haadf stem images before adsorption fig 12 a d and after adsorption fig 12e h are analyzed the haadf stem imaging is a mapping technique which detects the elastically scattered electron by the sample through high angle the haadf stem has proved as an excellent technique for directly imaging adsorption of metals chang et al 2013 peng et al 2018 the haadf stem is useful in study surface reactions that occur in the mineral skovbjerg et al 2006 ling and zhang 2014 ling et al 2017 the haadf stem images show the mapping of fe o and cr fig 12 dominant of fe and o is due to hematite as the calcined product at 300 c before adsorption it is seen that the adsorbent contains very small amounts of cr fig 12d however it is clear that after adsorption of cr vi the cr abundance is enhanced and evenly distributed in the adsorbent fig 12h thus it provides a direct evidence of the incorporation of cr vi inside the structure of the calcined goethite 4 conclusion the thermally modified goethite can be effectively used for the removal of cr vi from the aqueous solution natural goethite completely transformed to hematite with development of predominant slit shaped pore at 300 c it might be caused due to the dehydration of goethite at 300 c with a considerable increase of the bet surface area and pore volume the adsorption of cr vi on the goethite from aqueous solutions is greatly improved through thermal modification the adsorption capacity is increased by 3 6 times and reaching maximum at 300 c and decreased with further increase in temperature the adsorption experimental equilibrium data are well described by langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model explained its adsorption process the ftir study confirms the uptake of cr vi by replacing oh group within the structure of hematite and the haadf stem images further ascertained adsorption of cr vi acknowledgements first author acknowledges the teqip ii for financial

12237,natural goethite and thermally treated goethite at different temperature 200 500 c was used for removal of cr vi this study was investigated based on the x ray diffraction xrd n2 adsorption desorption isotherm high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and adsorption experiments the result indicates that goethite was unaltered up to 200 c and transformed to hematite at 300 c natural goethite developed slit shaped pore at 200 c and became dominant at 300 c with further increase in temperature pores became spherical the bet surface area and pore volume also reached maximum at 300 c and decreased further with increase in temperature thus the goethite calcined at 300 c showed greater uptake with capacity of 2 053 mg g as compared to that of natural goethite 0 569 mg g the pseudo second order kinetic model best described the sorption process the ftir and high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron

goswamee et al 1998 xu et al 2010 sungworawongpana and pengprecha 2011 thermal decomposition of natural goethite calcined at different temperatures creates a number of pores after dehydration naono et

efficiency for the removal of as v liu et al 2013 suggested that the goethite transformed completely into hematite after annealing at 300 c the principal objective of this paper is to study the adsorption of cr vi by natural goethite and its calcined product at different temperature further the natural goethite and its calcined product are characterized by xrd bet ftir and hrtem analysis in order to understand the effect of calcination temperature on the morphology mineralogical transformation and the cr vi uptake the adsorption processes are also studied using adsorption isotherm

and representing characteristics of hematite also the bands at 1080 and 1023 cm 1 are present all the bands present in the sample calcined at 300 c also appeared up to 500 c though the intensity of the hematite bands at 540 and 464 cm 1 are slightly diminished the tem images of goethite and its calcined product at 200 300 400 and 500 c are shown in fig 3 the gradual changes in the morphology at different temperatures are clearly visible the natural goethite consists of needle shaped crystals of various sizes fig 3a after calcination at 200 c the goethite particles show the development of minor scale slit shaped pore however at 300 c the slit shaped pores are more prominent and abundance these slit shaped pores form longitudinally and having width varies from about 1 to 10 nm at 300 c liu et al 2013 observed similar porous microstructure upon heating goethite at 300 c and attributed to its dehydroxylation at 400 c the slit shaped pores are no longer retained the pore structure changes to spherical nano shaped pores having diameter nearly 4 22 nm the goethite decomposes and flattens the pores that transform split into large size pores hirokawa et al 1986 as the temperature reaches 500 c the pore boundary diffuses due to the pore coalescence and resulted in subsequent growth into many micropores similar observation with pore structure and pore size is reported earlier pomies et al 1998 the hrtem images and saed pattern show that raw goethite transformed to hematite at 300 c fig 4 the inter planar distance of 0 418 nm corresponding to the 110 plane of goethite is observed similarly the hematite is confirmed by the presence inter plane distance of 0 269 and 0 251 nm corresponding to the 104 and 110 plane respectively the result of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms used for determination of bet surface area is given in fig 5 according to the iupac classification the adsorption desorption isotherms of goethite and its calcined products belong to type iv category which is a indicative of the presence of mesoporosity due to capillary condensation oulego et al 2016 the hysteresis loop can be classified into h3 type which indicates that the adsorbents consist of slit shaped pores the pores are interconnected due to the absence of saturation in hysteresis loop and also the presence of closure point at p po 0 nayak and nayak 2016 cychosz et al 2016 the parameters obtained by means of n2 adsorption desorption method are summarized in table 1 the bet surface area of goethite is found to be 7 m2 g and then it increases to the maximum of 126 m2 g when it is calcined at 300 c the bet surface area started to decrease with calcination temperature beyond 300 c the surface area is found to be 59 and 10 m2 g at 400 and 500 c respectively similar to the variation of surface area total pore volume also follows the same pattern pore volume is 0 013 cm3 g for the goethite at 25 c and increases to 0 196 cm3 g at 300 c followed by sharp decrease to 0 028 cm3 g at 500 c liu et al 2013 proposed that the dramatic increase in surface area at 300 c is due to the dehydroxylation of goethite then there is decrease in surface area on heating goethite above 400 c due to grain coarsening hence the resultant surface area and its total pore volume reveal that goethite calcined at 300 c has maximum number of active surface sites for adsorption of metal ions table 1 the bjh pore size distribution curves for all samples are shown in fig 6 the pore size distribution varies from 3 2 to 3 9 nm the size range also indicates that adsorbents are mesoporous in nature the pore size is around 3 2 nm at 25 c and shown steep increase to 3 7 nm at 200 c followed by slow increase as it reaches 3 9 nm at 500 c these observations are also consistence with the findings of the tem analysis which depicted the increase in pore size with rise in calcined temperature 3 2 adsorption of cr vi the effect of initial concentration on cr vi removal onto goethite and its calcined product at different temperatures is shown in fig 7 it is observed that the cr vi removal decreases with increase in concentration the lower efficiency of removal at higher concentration is due to the higher number of cr vi ions leads to more collisions between them at the fixed available surface sites of adsorbent rivera corredor et al 2014 however the performance for cr vi removal by goethite and its calcine products varies with bet surface area the highest percentage removal of nearly 86 has occurred onto goethite calcined at 300 c the removal of cr vi decreases with calcine temperature above 300 c this is due to the occurrence of maximum surface area in calcined goethite at 300 c hence the variation in cr vi removal seems to be consistent according to their surface area 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the langmuir isotherm is utilized to obtain the adsorption capacity of different adsorbents the langmuir isotherm is applied on a homogeneous surface at the monolayer sorption sites and thereafter no further sorption can take place once the surface is saturated yuan et al 2013 the adsorption isotherm of cr vi onto goethite and its calcine products is shown in fig 8 the linearized form of langmuir isotherm is described by equation 7 7 c e q e 1 q 0 b 1 q 0 c e where ce mg l and qe mg g are the equilibrium concentration of cr vi in solution and the amount of cr vi adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent respectively the q0 mg g is the monolayer adsorption capacity and b l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant the q0 and b are determined from the slope and intercept of the plot between ce qe and ce various parameters obtained from the isotherm study are given in table 2 the adsorption capacities obtained from the langmuir isotherms are 0 569 1 462 2 053 1 506 and 1 295 mg g for the calcined temperature of 25 200 300 400 and 500 c respectively this indicates that adsorption capacity increases with increase in temperature up to 300 c where it becomes maximum then it decreases with increase in temperature thus the equilibrium isotherm demonstrated that the sample calcined at 300 c has considerably higher potential for cr vi adsorption the isotherm study shows a good fit with langmuir isotherm model as the correction coefficient r2 varies from 0 95 to 0 99 the langmuir isotherm can also be expressed in terms of separation factor rl a dimensionless constant jalil et al 2010 it is used to evaluate whether the sorption is favourable or unfavourable using equation 8 idris et al 2013 8 r l 1 1 bc 0 where c0 mg l is the initial cr vi concentration and b l mg is the langmuir constant based on the rl the adsorption process can be classified into i favourable adsorption when it is 0 rl 1 ii unfavourable for rl 1 iii rl 1 the sorption is linear and iv rl 0 for irreversible sorption song and wu 2014 it is found that the value of rl lies between 0 and 1 table 3 this indicates that a favourable cr vi adsorption occurs onto goethite and its calcined products the rl values of calcined goethite at 300 c are minimum for all the concentration which indicates the most favourable adsorption at this particular temperature 3 4 adsorption kinetic study the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models are applied to the adsorption data obtained using the calcined product at 300 c since it shows the maximum adsorption capacity the value of kinetic model parameters and regression coefficients r2 obtained from various kinetic plots fig 9 are given in table 4 the value of r2 of pseudo second order kinetic model is relatively higher 0 997 than that of the pseudo first order model 0 927 besides the calculated equilibrium capacity of pseudo second order model 0 432 mg g is very close to that of the experimental equilibrium capacity 0 429 mg g this implies that the adsorption of cr vi onto the calcined goethite follows the pseudo second order kinetic model thus the adsorption of cr vi involves the chemisorption process as described by the pseudo second order kinetic model ho and mckay 1999 the diffusion kinetic model fig 9c shows that the linear graph does not pass through the origin which indicates the intraparticle diffusion is not the only controlling mechanism thus adsorption process of cr vi onto calcined goethite is controlled by more than one step furthermore the linear plot gives the intercept c1 which provides the measure of the boundary layer thickness as the c1 is very small it suggests that the surface diffusion step plays minor role as the rate determining step during adsorption process 3 5 thermodynamic study to evaluate the feasibility of the adsorption process various thermodynamic parameters such as change in gibb s free energy δg change in enthalpy δh and change in entropy δs are calculated at different temperatures between 298 and 313 k using equations 9 11 romero gonzalez et al 2005 9 k c q e c e 10 δ g rtln k c 11 logk c δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 rt where kc is the equilibrium constant qe is the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium mg g and ce is the equilibrium concentration of cr vi in solution mg l t is temperature in kelvin k and r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k the δh and δs are obtained from the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot between logkc and 1 t respectively fig 10 the calculated value of the thermodynamic parameters is given in table 5 the δg values are found to be negative at all temperatures indicate the spontaneous and feasible cr vi adsorption gorzin and abadi 2018 the decrease in values of δg with an increase in temperature shows more cr vi adsorption at high temperature on calcined goethite the positive value of δh indicates that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature in addition the positive value of δs indicates that there is an increase in randomness between solid solution interface during the adsorption process 3 6 adsorption mechanism the ftir spectroscopy is used to determine the interaction mechanism of adsorbed molecule in the adsorbent and help in understanding the adsorption mechanism hoffmann 1983 hsia et al 1993 the ftir spectra of goethite calcined at 300 c is compared with that of after adsorption as maximum adsorption capacity is shown in this sample in fig 11 it is noticed that there is slight shifting splitting and appearance of new peaks after adsorption of cr vi onto the calcined sample the peaks at 3380 and 1630 cm 1 have shifted to 3370 and 1626 cm 1 after cr vi adsorption suggesting that the bonded oh groups played an important role in adsorption process jia et al 2012 deng et al 2015 the peak at 874 cm 1 which represents the oh group is disappeared after the reaction with cr vi a set of two new peaks are appeared at 920 and 869 cm 1 instead which can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of cr o bonds hu et al 2007 johnston and chrysochoou 2012 huang et al 2016 lei et al 2017 this indicates that the oh bending frequency of calcined goethite is replaced by cr o bond which further ascertain that cr vi forms complexes with oh functional groups and forming inner spheric complex to further confirm the adsorption of cr vi onto the calcined sample at 300 c the haadf stem images before adsorption fig 12 a d and after adsorption fig 12e h are analyzed the haadf stem imaging is a mapping technique which detects the elastically scattered electron by the sample through high angle the haadf stem has proved as an excellent technique for directly imaging adsorption of metals chang et al 2013 peng et al 2018 the haadf stem is useful in study surface reactions that occur in the mineral skovbjerg et al 2006 ling and zhang 2014 ling et al 2017 the haadf stem images show the mapping of fe o and cr fig 12 dominant of fe and o is due to hematite as the calcined product at 300 c before adsorption it is seen that the adsorbent contains very small amounts of cr fig 12d however it is clear that after adsorption of cr vi the cr abundance is enhanced and evenly distributed in the adsorbent fig 12h thus it provides a direct evidence of the incorporation of cr vi inside the structure of the calcined goethite 4 conclusion the thermally modified goethite can be effectively used for the removal of cr vi from the aqueous solution natural goethite completely transformed to hematite with development of predominant slit shaped pore at 300 c it might be caused due to the dehydration of goethite at 300 c with a considerable increase of the bet surface area and pore volume the adsorption of cr vi on the goethite from aqueous solutions is greatly improved through thermal modification the adsorption capacity is increased by 3 6 times and reaching maximum at 300 c and decreased with further increase in temperature the adsorption experimental equilibrium data are well described by langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model explained its adsorption process the ftir study confirms the uptake of cr vi by replacing oh group within the structure of hematite and the haadf stem images further ascertained adsorption of cr vi acknowledgements first author acknowledges the teqip ii for financial

12238,owing to its simple procedures the head guided zonation hgz method can be applied in parameterisation step of groundwater modelling to configure subsurface characteristics of areas where spatial

define empirical recommendations organising position of pilot points into a model in the parameterisation step prior to calibration is still somehow arguable due to subjectivity involved in configuring pilot points location other geostatistics technique is the classical zonation method which in this paper referred as hgz method which spatially divides the model domain into zones of piecewise parameter uniformity the hgz method principally assumes that each zone has similar hydrogeologic properties indicated by similar hydraulic gradient of groundwater flow a low hydraulic gradient referred to faster groundwater flow suggests areas with high conductivity whereas areas with low conductivity are most likely characterised by high hydraulic gradient several studies scanlon et al 2003 panagopoulos 2012 klaas et al 2017e demonstrated that using available groundwater elevation and field observations hgz method can be applied in different catchments and soil type conditions nevertheless although hgz method is potential for wider application little effort has been given to incorporate heuristic recommendations into the method thus the objective of this study is to perform

four different contour spacings 30 m 40 m 50 m and 60 m based on the result a guideline on how to effectively divide the zones using head contours to achieve robust model performance is provided 2

hgz method the hgz method principally aims to spatially split the model domain into zones of piecewise constant where the values of subsurface parameters i e k h and sy are to be allocated and calibrated during calibration step klaas et al 2017c in this study there are two steps of constructing the model firstly using calculated hydraulic gradient from available groundwater level data on 19 april 2011 from 22 dug wells the groundwater level contours were interpolated and delineated fetter 2001 hudak 2005 resulting in a map of groundwater contour as shown in fig 3 secondly using the map the model domain was divided corresponding to the contour interval ci value in this study four models with four distinctive ci values 30 40 50 and 60 were constructed to investigate the effects of spatial distribution of zones on the performance and computational time of groundwater flow model fig 4 the properties of the four models are summarised in table 1 3 3 model calibration and validation in this study two stage calibration was performed firstly the four models were calibrated for the steady state simulation of groundwater flow to calibrate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h in the outlined zones using the maximal rainfall of 86 5 mm day on 19 april 2011 and the corresponding groundwater levels at the seven observation wells secondly the results were used as initial conditions for the transient calibration woessner and anderson 1992 the transient calibration aimed at calibrating k h and specific yield sy values using 8 month duration data input from january august 2011 during both steady state and transient calibration the model parameters were adjusted using parameter estimation pest method doherty 2004 to assess the validity of the groundwater flow models model validation was performed using data input between september 2011 and april 2012 in each transient simulation the period of simulation was discretised into 9 stress periods with a 10 day time step 3 4 model performance criteria during the calibration and validation simulations the parameters were adjusted until reasonable goodness of fit measures are achieved in each simulation two statistical goodness of fit measures i e mean absolute error maeh and root mean squared error of head rmseh were employed to assess the performance of the four models 2 m a e h 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 3 r m s e h 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 2 where n is the number of observed wells h o is the observed head m and h s is the simulated head m 4 results and discussion 4 1 steady state calibration fig 5 presents the result of steady state calibration of the four models from the graphs of comparisons between observed and simulated heads at the seven observation points all the models are able to replicate hydraulic heads to a reasonably acceptable level model performances represented by maeh and rsmeh ranges 0 08 2 06 m and 1 42 3 31 m respectively a well calibrated model indicated by an equivalent direction of groundwater flow between that of the simulated and initial setting is concluded domenico and schwartz 1998 4 2 transient state calibration and validation table 2 recapitulates the results of transient calibration and validation for the four hgz models the distributions of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield values in transient simulation of hzb models are presented in fig 6 overall the model performances of all the models in both calibration and validation steps are satisfactory indicated by relatively small maeh 0 06 0 20 m and rmseh 0 41 0 52 m values the analysis of head residuals shows that the head is generally overestimated with overestimation is higher when ci value is enlarged this indicates that the simulation of hydraulic heads is poorer for zone with bigger contour interval ci 40 and thus the influence of horizontal spacing on hydraulic head simulation in zonation method is obvious when ci is decreased from 60 to 40 m the model performance rmseh in validation step increases by 17 79 adversary the model performance decreases by 6 20 when ci is reduced from 40 to 30 m the decrease of model performance after reaching the lowest error values at the tipping point of 40 m might be associated with model overfitting alcolea et al 2006 this condition is related with erroneous model parameterisation and over smoothing in forcing data fitting fienen et al 2009 the result demonstrates that the optimal subsurface parameterisation using hgz method is attained by hgz2 model at the value of ci 40 m or at a ci h 502 64 x grid ci 250 and y grid ci 125 fig 7 summarises the impact of contour spacing on the statistic results rmseh of the hzb models 4 3 processing time fig 8 shows the processing time needed in the transient calibration as expected the more zone added into the model results in additional computation time in the optimisation process this study demonstrates the processing time increases following a power function 5 conclusions the present study focuses on finding the optimal subsurface parameterisation of physically based groundwater models using hgz method although potential this method is lack of practical guideline on how to effectively divide the zones using head contours to achieve robust model performance accordingly it is crucial to evaluate the influence of spacing interval on model performance this study demonstrates that proper selection of three user friendly ratios of area head contour interval a ci h x grid length head contour interval xgrid ci h and y grid length head contour interval ygrid ci h are significant in parameterisation of groundwater model as it impacts both the simulation times and the accuracy i e simulated head at observation points based on the model simulations developed in this study the following recommendations are proposed a contour interval ci 40 b area head contour interval ratio a ci 502 64 c ratio of x grid length head contour interval xgrid ci 250 d ratio of y grid length head contour interval ygrid ci 125 considering the complexity of parameterising a model not only does gradient of groundwater flow needs to be considered in determining aquifer hydraulic properties other factors e g boundary conditions catchment scale geological attributes are among the essential aspects to be taken into account therefore although head contours can be used when assigning hydraulic parameter zones the recommendation given in this study cannot be utilised as the sole criterion for defining the zones boundaries additional information from prior and expert knowledge doherty 2003 of the area under study and adjacent territories also needs to be collaborated nevertheless the set of recommendation provided in his study can be valuable and constructive to be used as a starting point to guide modellers in the parameterisation step and data collection in order to appropriately infer the overall groundwater system and to validate the model assumptions

hgz method the hgz method principally aims to spatially split the model domain into zones of piecewise constant where the values of subsurface parameters i e k h and sy are to be allocated and calibrated during calibration step klaas et al 2017c in this study there are two steps of constructing the model firstly using calculated hydraulic gradient from available groundwater level data on 19 april 2011 from 22 dug wells the groundwater level contours were interpolated and delineated fetter 2001 hudak 2005 resulting in a map of groundwater contour as shown in fig 3 secondly using the map the model domain was divided corresponding to the contour interval ci value in this study four models with four distinctive ci values 30 40 50 and 60 were constructed to investigate the effects of spatial distribution of zones on the performance and computational time of groundwater flow model fig 4 the properties of the four models are summarised in table 1 3 3 model calibration and validation in this study two stage calibration was performed firstly the four models were calibrated for the steady state simulation of groundwater flow to calibrate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h in the outlined zones using the maximal rainfall of 86 5 mm day on 19 april 2011 and the corresponding groundwater levels at the seven observation wells secondly the results were used as initial conditions for the transient calibration woessner and anderson 1992 the transient calibration aimed at calibrating k h and specific yield sy values using 8 month duration data input from january august 2011 during both steady state and transient calibration the model parameters were adjusted using parameter estimation pest method doherty 2004 to assess the validity of the groundwater flow models model validation was performed using data input between september 2011 and april 2012 in each transient simulation the period of simulation was discretised into 9 stress periods with a 10 day time step 3 4 model performance criteria during the calibration and validation simulations the parameters were adjusted until reasonable goodness of fit measures are achieved in each simulation two statistical goodness of fit measures i e mean absolute error maeh and root mean squared error of head rmseh were employed to assess the performance of the four models 2 m a e h 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 3 r m s e h 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 2 where n is the number of observed wells h o is the observed head m and h s is the simulated head m 4 results and discussion 4 1 steady state calibration fig 5 presents the result of steady state calibration of the four models from the graphs of comparisons between observed and simulated heads at the seven observation points all the models are able to replicate hydraulic heads to a reasonably acceptable level model performances represented by maeh and rsmeh ranges 0 08 2 06 m and 1 42 3 31 m respectively a well calibrated model indicated by an equivalent direction of groundwater flow between that of the simulated and initial setting is concluded domenico and schwartz 1998 4 2 transient state calibration and validation table 2 recapitulates the results of transient calibration and validation for the four hgz models the distributions of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield values in transient simulation of hzb models are presented in fig 6 overall the model performances of all the models in both calibration and validation steps are satisfactory indicated by relatively small maeh 0 06 0 20 m and rmseh 0 41 0 52 m values the analysis of head residuals shows that the head is generally overestimated with overestimation is higher when ci value is enlarged this indicates that the simulation of hydraulic heads is poorer for zone with bigger contour interval ci 40 and thus the influence of horizontal spacing on hydraulic head simulation in zonation method is obvious when ci is decreased from 60 to 40 m the model performance rmseh in validation step increases by 17 79 adversary the model performance decreases by 6 20 when ci is reduced from 40 to 30 m the decrease of model performance after reaching the lowest error values at the tipping point of 40 m might be associated with model overfitting alcolea et al 2006 this condition is related with erroneous model parameterisation and over smoothing in forcing data fitting fienen et al 2009 the result demonstrates that the optimal subsurface parameterisation using hgz method is attained by hgz2 model at the value of ci 40 m or at a ci h 502 64 x grid ci 250 and y grid ci 125 fig 7 summarises the impact of contour spacing on the statistic results rmseh of the hzb models 4 3 processing time fig 8 shows the processing time needed in the transient calibration as expected the more zone added into the model results in additional computation time in the optimisation process this study demonstrates the processing time increases following a power function 5 conclusions the present study focuses on finding the optimal subsurface parameterisation of physically based groundwater models using hgz method although potential this method is lack of practical guideline on how to effectively divide the zones using head contours to achieve robust model performance accordingly it is crucial to evaluate the influence of spacing interval on model performance this study demonstrates that proper selection of three user friendly ratios of area head contour interval a ci h x grid length head contour interval xgrid ci h and y grid length head contour interval ygrid ci h are significant in parameterisation of groundwater model as it impacts both the simulation times and the accuracy i e simulated head at observation points based on the model simulations developed in this study the following recommendations are proposed a contour interval ci 40 b area head contour interval ratio a ci 502 64 c ratio of x grid length head contour interval xgrid ci 250 d ratio of y grid length head contour interval ygrid ci 125 considering the complexity of parameterising a model not only does gradient of groundwater flow needs to be considered in determining aquifer hydraulic properties other factors e g boundary conditions catchment scale geological attributes are among the essential aspects to be taken into account therefore although head contours can be used when assigning hydraulic parameter zones the recommendation given in this study cannot be utilised as the sole criterion for defining the zones boundaries additional information from prior and expert knowledge doherty 2003 of the area under study and adjacent territories also needs to be collaborated nevertheless the set of recommendation provided in his study can be valuable and constructive to be used as a starting point to guide modellers in the parameterisation step and data collection in order to appropriately infer the overall groundwater system and to validate the model assumptions

different parameters for drinking water jacintha et al 2016 it is some time difficult to understand all these standards and suggest the nature of water and also difficult for the authorities to make any decision based on these different parameters hence water quality index wqi method based results are common in use which represents the water quality in terms of a numeric value the wqi is a robust easy to interpret and acts as an important tool for decision makers singh et al 2015 2016 therefore evaluation of groundwater quantity and quality and establishing database are important for the

quality parameters and is calculated from the point of view of suitability for human use although there is no globally accepted composite index of water quality some countries and regions have used or are using aggregated water quality data in the development of water quality indices most water quality indices rely on normalizing or standardizing data parameter by parameter according to expected concentrations and interpret as good versus bad parameters are often then weighted according to their perceived importance to overall water quality and the index is calculated as the weighted average

drinking water quality as recommended by the who 2006 these values were used to calculate wqi using four different modes the weighted arithmetic index method brown et al 1970 was used for the calculation of wqi of the collected samples further quality rating or sub index q n was calculated using the following expressions as given in eqns 1 4 1 q n 100 v n v i v s v i q n quality rating for

basis of overall wqi2 the water quality can be classified as per table 4 2 3 3 nemerows pollution index npi or wqi3 nemerows pollution index npi or wqi3 is a simple pollution index introduced by neme rathod et al 2011 which is also known as raw s pollution index this index is regarded as one of the effective tool to analyze and convey data raw environmental information to public technicians

formation of alkali soils whereas with chloride saline soils are formed neither soil will support plant growth rao 2006 generally na should not exceed 60 in irrigation waters sodium content is generally expressed in terms of percent sodium or soluble sodium percentage na wilcox 1955 explained a method for rating or indices for irrigation water quality the irrigation waters based on percent sodium the percent sodium in water can be calculated by using eqn 7 as follow 7 n a n a 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k sodium percent is an important factor for studying sodium hazard it is also used for adjudging the quality of water for agricultural purposes high percentage sodium water for irrigation purpose may stunt the plant growth and reduces soil permeability joshi et al 2009 singh et al 2013a singh et al 2013b gatuam et al 2015 singh et al 2015 rawat et al 2018c on the basis of na groundwater quality for irrigation can be classified as per table 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 drinking water quality table 7 showed hydrochemical data of groundwater samples at study area groundwater classes are useful for summarizing information in order to obtain regional and national perspective ec and na play a vital role in suitability of water for irrigation higher ec in water creates a saline soil harmful effects of irrigation water increases with the total salt concentration irrespective of the ionic composition singh et al 2015 abbasnia et al 2018b higher salt content in irrigation water causes an increase in soil solution osmotic pressure thorne and peterson 1954 rawat et al 2018c in this study hydrochemical parameters have been tested in the process of proposing an appropriate wqi in industrial cum agricultural area and especially in among activities the wqi equations are more technically sound compared to the existing equations which were developed formulated based on the groundwater quality parameter the wqi for 60 samples ranges from 19 8 to 266 8 wqi1 95 to 3803 7 wqi2 5 2 to 53 4 wqi3 and 60 5 to 93 wqi4 the high value of wqi in study area has been found to be mainly from the higher values of th tds bicarbonate chloride and manganese in the groundwater about 13 7 2 and nil according to wqi1 wqi2 and wqi3 npi and wqi4 na respectively of water samples are poor in quality fig 2 a b c and d wqi of major area was found to be excellent and good according to wqi1 wqi2 and wqi3 as 62 70 and 52 respectively fig 3 the wqi along drainage like katwal a katwal b rewarah c rewarah d anwali b lath a lath d moi d bali d and rabrah c was found to be poor for drinking and irrigation use whereas the wqi of sampling points nagar b and gohana c were found to be poorest because these both points are lying near of small drainage drainage no 8 and under habitation the results indicate that certain parameters such as no3 tds and ca2 were found beyond the permissible limits in areas which are due to drainage no 8 comprehensive sewerage and local drainage residential and rapidly growing industrial sectors the salts apart from affecting the growth of plants also affect the soil structure permeability and aeration which indirectly affect plant growth ratio of dissolved sodium rds as na might be used for calculating a value which can be utilized as quality index of ground water suitability for irrigation purposes shaki and adeloye 2006 singh et al 2015 from fig 3 pattern of all wqi except wqi4 because index is only na dominate are almost same and only magnitudes varies it is also clear from fig 4 these indices also linearly co related strongly bonded with each other with good r2 0 64 for wqi1 wqi2 and 0 73 for wqi3 wqi1 this result revealed that using any method eqs 4 6 for computing wqi the result will be very similar on the basis of eq 7 and literature of review wqi4 also give us a good result and deep insight about condition of groundwater for irrigation because according to raw 2006 excess of na or na 70 in irrigation waters is not suitable for plant growth wilcox 1955 and table 5 shows only 25 groundwater of the study unusable for irrigation due to excess of na 70 in groundwater table 8 has threshold limits for some irrigation water quality parameters wqi has been found useful in assessing the overall quality of water and to get rid of judgment on quality of the water this method appears to be more systematic and gives comparative evaluation of the water quality of sampling points it is also helpful for public to understand the quality of water as well as being a useful tool in many ways in the field of water quality management furthermore the wqi is useful in generating trends demonstrating the importance of maintaining good water quality and disseminating technical water quality information to the general public however the classification has some limitations wqi formulas are not used as absolute measures of the degree of pollution or the actual water quality of groundwater 3 2 irrigation indices water quality assessment plays a major role in irrigation practices groundwater evaluation in the study area was conducted by using different indices na sar rsc mh pi kr k ka cai1 cai2 cr gibb s1 gibb s2 and ps the irrigation standard is given in table 8 these chemically important parameters calculated for irrigation are shown in table 9 3 2 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar is the relative ratio of na ions to ca2 and mg2 ions in the water sample the sar is used to estimate the potential of na to accumulate in the soil primarily it is expressed by eq 8 8 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where na ca2 and mg2 are in meq l on the basis of sar values irrigation water can be classified into four classes as sar 10 ideal or excellent 10 18 good 18 26 doubtful 26 unsuitable a high na in soil has negative impacts on soil structure aeration and infiltration xu et al 2019 in table 9 na of groundwater ranged from 60 3 to 93 0 respectively the corresponding mean value was 81 0 majority of the samples 93 4 samples are falls in the category of unsuitable and remaining 6 6 samples fall in the category of doubtful 3 2 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual alkalinity ra rsc represents as the amount of sodium carbonate naco3 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 present in the irrigation water if the concentration of carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 ions exceeds the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions raghunath 1987 gautam et al 2015 singh et al 2015 rsc is expressed as eq 9 9 r s c h c o 3 c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 a high range of rsc in irrigation water means an increase in the adsorption of sodium on the soil water having rsc 2 5 unsuitable 1 25 2 5 doubtful and 1 25 is considered suitable for agriculture purpose as safe for irrigation purpose soils irrigated with high rsc water can become infertile due to deposition of sodium carbonate xu et al 2019 the high concentration is due to calcite and dolomite and leach substantial amounts of hco3 majority of the samples are not safe for irrigation and 5 samples fall in the category of safe 3 2 3 kelly s ratio kr or kelly s index ki kelly 1940 has introduced another factor to assess quality and classification of water for irrigation purpose based on the concentration of na against ca2 and mg2 it can be calculated using eq 10 10 k r n a c a 2 m g 2 all the ion concentrations are expressed in meq l kr ki 1 indicates an excess level of na in waters therefore water with 1 is not recommended for irrigation due to alkali hazards the groundwater samples were unsuitable for irrigation table 9 which may also be due to intense cation exchange which provides excess na according to ki all the samples falls in the category of unsuitable 3 2 4 permeability index pi pi formula has been developed by doneen 1964 to assess water movement capability in the soil as the suitability of any kind of source of water for irrigation and it is formulated as eq 11 11 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 all the ion concentrations

reduce aeration in the soil and obstruct the growth of seedlings xu et al 2019 according to xu et al 2019 high pi values are related to high levels of na and hco3 which may be due to the cation exchange and carbonate dissolution such as calcite and dolomite majority of the water is suitable for irrigation except at few locations namely namda khan gamri b khanpur kalan a katwal c jauli b saraghta a and puthi b 3 2 5 magnesium hazard mh or magnesium adsorption ratio mar the high value of ca2 and mg2 in water can increase soil ph resulting in decrease in the availability of phosphorous magnesium in groundwater affects the soil quality by converting it into alkaline and decreases the crop yield szabolcs and darab 1964 projected mh values for irrigation water and it is calculated using eq 12 12 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 all the ion concentrations are expressed in meq l mh 50 are not recommended for irrigation purposes singh et al 2015 a high level of mg2 in groundwater leads to soil alkalinity furthermore a large amount of water is absorbed between magnesium and clay particles which reduce the infiltration capability of soil which has adverse effects on crops xu et al 2019 a value of mh 50 indicates harmful groundwater and unsuitable for irrigation while a value of mh 50 indicates suitable groundwater the 50 studied samples are suitable for irrigation 3 2 6 potential salinity ps ps is another water quality parameter based index doneen 1964 for categorization of water for agriculture use ps 3 meq l is an indication of the suitability 3 5 good to injurious

the exchange process of na and k from the rock with mg2 and ca2 in water and vice versa if a direct exchange process dep happening between na and k in water with mg2 and ca2 in rocks cai ratio will positive if a reverse exchange process occurs na and k in water with mg2 and ca2 in rocks then cai ratio will negative as per the cai1 ratio 53 33 samples have positive value direct exchange process whereas 47 77 have negative value reverse exchange process the cai2 indices values at all locations have negative values it means the reverse exchange process is dominant in the study area table 9 3 2

conclusion the use of wqi in determination of water quality corresponds to present tendencies within the field of water resources management thus it is attempted to assign chemical importance to the classical parameters related to chemical quality the advantages of this method are many given the fact that wqi i includes more variables in only one number ii brings to the same measuring unit more parameters related to the water quality iii offers the possibility to compare in temporal and spatial terms of quality of more water or that of a single one iv offers an image of the water usage degree in various fields purposes further the calculated wqi revealed that majority of groundwater samples in study area is suitable for human use there is need for routine monitoring of various human activities within the basin especially at the upstream to check the occurrence of high salinity finding of work suggest four methods are suitable to determine wqi wqi1 wqi2 wqi3 for drinking and wqi4 for irrigation considering technical and practical feasibility of methodology of npi is more suitable for determination of wqi for all the parameters as it gives quick and more accurate results this method is based on simple equation hence it is easy to understand and implement acknowledgements the first author would like to thank sanatan pradhan indian agricultural research institute who has

singh et al 2015 murmu et al 2019 pande et al 2019 it is the major source of drinking water supply for urban and rural area bharose et al 2013 jacintha et al 2016 the land transformation has major impact on water resources amin et al 2014 singh et al 2016 excess use chemical fertilization is resulting in groundwater pollution ayers and westcot 1985 gautam et al 2015 2016 nemčić jurec et al 2017 the evaluation of groundwater quality is important as its quantity since the physical and chemical characteristics of groundwater determines its suitability for agriculture domestic and industrial uses gajbhiye et al 2015 gautam et al 2016 nemčić jurec et al 2017 singh et al 2018 rawat et al 2018a b for all the above mentioned usages the required water should be of the different and specific quality many studies have measured different parameters like ph total dissolved solids hardness major cations and anions rawat et al 2018c risk assessment of groundwater involves identification and understanding of water quality and hazard associated with a particular occurrence action or circumstance and determination of the probability for the occurrence of such hazards smith 2001 srivastava et al 2013 thakur et al 2015 rawat et al 2018a b singh et al 2018 an international organization dealing with the health related matter i e world health organization who has given recommended value of different parameters for drinking water jacintha et al 2016 it is some time difficult to understand all these standards and suggest the nature of water and also difficult for the authorities to make any decision based on these different parameters hence water quality index wqi method based results are common in use which represents the water quality in terms of a numeric value the wqi is a robust easy to interpret and acts as an important tool for decision makers singh et al 2015 2016 therefore evaluation of groundwater quantity and quality and establishing database are important for the development of new strategies wqi is a simple set of mathematical equations and used to transform large number of water quality data into a single number rafiq et al 2018 rawat et al 2017a rawat et al

2018 rawat et al 2015 it solves the water quality issues by integrating complex data and generates a score that describes water quality status in categorical ways the most common index called the wqi was developed by the national sanitation foundation nsf gharibi et al 2012 used fuzzy logic based index and poseidon index pos gautam et al 2018 wqi reflects the composite influence of different water quality parameters and is calculated from the point of view of suitability for human use although there is no globally accepted composite index of water quality some countries and regions have used or are using aggregated water quality data in the development of water quality indices most water quality indices rely on normalizing or standardizing data parameter by parameter according to expected concentrations and interpret as good versus bad parameters are often then weighted according to their perceived importance to overall water quality and the index is calculated as the weighted average

1998 and these values were used to calculate water quality indices 2 3 computation of wqis 2 3 1 weighted arithmetic index wqi in this study for the calculation of water quality indices wqi thirteen parameters were selected the data analysis involved in two steps i a single analysis for each parameter and ii the wqi npi wqi1 wqi2 and na calculation the wqi was calculated using the standards of drinking water quality as recommended by the who 2006 these values were used to calculate wqi using four different modes the weighted arithmetic index method brown et al 1970 was used for the calculation of wqi of the collected samples further quality rating or sub index q n was calculated using the following expressions as given in eqns 1 4 1 q n 100 v n v i v s v i q n quality rating for the nth water quality parameter v n actual value of nth parameter v i ideal value of this parameter v s standard permissible value of the nth parameter consider v i 0 for all except ph where v i 7 for

classify water quality is based on overall water quality index wqi2 which are calculated by aggregating the quality rating qn linearly i e the expression is given by eqn 5 5 w q i 2 q n w n w n on the basis of overall wqi2 the water quality can be classified as per table 4 2 3 3 nemerows pollution index npi or wqi3 nemerows pollution index npi or wqi3 is a simple pollution index introduced by neme rathod et al 2011 which is also known as raw s pollution index this index is regarded as one of the effective tool to analyze and convey data raw environmental information to public technicians managers and decision makers caeiro et al 2005 the expression is given by eqn 6 it is given as 6 n p i v n v s v n actual value or observed concentration of nth parameter v s permissible limit of nth parameter on the basis of nemerows pollution index the water quality has been classified as given in table 5 2 3 4 soluble sodium percentage ssp wqi4 excess na when combines with carbonate leads to formation of alkali soils whereas with chloride saline soils are formed neither soil will support plant growth rao 2006 generally na should not exceed 60 in irrigation waters sodium content is generally expressed in terms of percent sodium or soluble sodium percentage na wilcox 1955 explained a method for rating or indices for irrigation water quality the irrigation waters based on percent sodium the percent sodium in water can be calculated by using eqn 7 as follow 7 n a n a 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k sodium percent is an important factor for studying sodium hazard it is also used for adjudging the quality of water for agricultural purposes high percentage sodium water for irrigation purpose may stunt the plant growth and reduces soil permeability joshi et al 2009 singh et al 2013a singh et al 2013b gatuam et al 2015 singh et al 2015 rawat et al 2018c on the basis of na groundwater quality for irrigation can be classified as per table 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 drinking water quality table 7 showed hydrochemical data of groundwater samples at study area groundwater classes are useful for summarizing information in order to obtain regional and national perspective ec and na play a vital role in suitability of water for irrigation higher ec in water creates a saline soil harmful effects of irrigation water increases with the total salt concentration irrespective of the ionic composition singh et al 2015 abbasnia et al 2018b higher salt content in irrigation water causes an increase in soil solution osmotic pressure thorne and peterson 1954 rawat et al 2018c in this study hydrochemical parameters have been tested in the process of proposing an appropriate wqi in industrial cum agricultural area and especially in among activities the wqi equations are more technically sound compared to the existing equations which were developed formulated based on the groundwater quality parameter the wqi for 60 samples ranges from 19 8 to 266 8 wqi1 95 to 3803 7 wqi2 5 2 to 53 4 wqi3 and 60 5 to 93 wqi4 the high value of wqi in study area has been found to be mainly from the higher values of th tds bicarbonate chloride and manganese in the groundwater about 13 7 2 and nil according to wqi1 wqi2 and wqi3 npi and wqi4 na respectively of water samples are poor in quality fig 2 a b c and d wqi of major area was found to be excellent and good according to wqi1 wqi2 and wqi3 as 62 70 and 52 respectively fig 3 the wqi along drainage like katwal a katwal b rewarah c rewarah d anwali b lath a lath d moi d bali d and rabrah c was found to be poor for drinking and irrigation use whereas the wqi of sampling points nagar b and gohana c were found to be poorest because these both points are lying near of small drainage drainage no 8 and under habitation the results indicate that certain parameters such as no3 tds and ca2 were found beyond the permissible limits in areas which are due to drainage no 8 comprehensive sewerage and local drainage residential and rapidly growing industrial sectors the salts apart from affecting the growth of plants also affect the soil structure permeability and aeration which indirectly affect plant growth ratio of dissolved sodium rds as na might be used for calculating a value which can be utilized as quality index of ground water suitability for irrigation purposes shaki and adeloye 2006 singh et al 2015 from fig 3 pattern of all wqi except wqi4 because index is only na dominate are almost same and only magnitudes varies it is also clear from fig 4 these indices also linearly co related strongly bonded with each other with good r2 0 64 for wqi1 wqi2 and 0 73 for wqi3 wqi1 this result revealed that using any method eqs 4 6 for computing wqi the result will be very similar on the basis of eq 7 and literature of review wqi4 also give us a good result and deep insight about condition of groundwater for irrigation because according to raw 2006 excess of na or na 70 in irrigation waters is not suitable for plant growth wilcox 1955 and table 5 shows only 25 groundwater of the study unusable for irrigation due to excess of na 70 in groundwater table 8 has threshold limits for some irrigation water quality parameters wqi has been found useful in assessing the overall quality of water and to get rid of judgment on quality of the water this method appears to be more systematic and gives comparative evaluation of the water quality of sampling points it is also helpful for public to understand the quality of water as well as being a useful tool in many ways in the field of water quality management furthermore the wqi is useful in generating trends demonstrating the importance of maintaining good water quality and disseminating technical water quality information to the general public however the classification has some limitations wqi formulas are not used as absolute measures of the degree of pollution or the actual water quality of groundwater 3 2 irrigation indices water quality assessment plays a major role in irrigation practices groundwater evaluation in the study area was conducted by using different indices na sar rsc mh pi kr k ka cai1 cai2 cr gibb s1 gibb s2 and ps the irrigation standard is given in table 8 these chemically important parameters calculated for irrigation are shown in table 9 3 2 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar is the relative ratio of na ions to ca2 and mg2 ions in the water sample the sar is used to estimate the potential of na to accumulate in the soil primarily it is expressed by eq 8 8 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where na ca2 and mg2 are in meq l on the basis of sar values irrigation water can be classified into four classes as sar 10 ideal or excellent 10 18 good 18 26 doubtful 26 unsuitable a high na in soil has negative impacts on soil structure aeration and infiltration xu et al 2019 in table 9 na of groundwater ranged from 60 3 to 93 0 respectively the corresponding mean value was 81 0 majority of the samples 93 4 samples are falls in the category of unsuitable and remaining 6 6 samples fall in the category of doubtful 3 2 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual alkalinity ra rsc represents as the amount of sodium carbonate naco3 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 present in the irrigation water if the concentration of carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 ions exceeds the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions raghunath 1987 gautam et al 2015 singh et al 2015 rsc is expressed as eq 9 9 r s c h c o 3 c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 a high range of rsc in irrigation water means an increase in the adsorption of sodium on the soil water having rsc 2 5 unsuitable 1 25 2 5 doubtful and 1 25 is considered suitable for agriculture purpose as safe for irrigation purpose soils irrigated with high rsc water can become infertile due to deposition of sodium carbonate xu et al 2019 the high concentration is due to calcite and dolomite and leach substantial amounts of hco3 majority of the samples are not safe for irrigation and 5 samples fall in the category of safe 3 2 3 kelly s ratio kr or kelly s index ki kelly 1940 has introduced another factor to assess quality and classification of water for irrigation purpose based on the concentration of na against ca2 and mg2 it can be calculated using eq 10 10 k r n a c a 2 m g 2 all the ion concentrations are expressed in meq l kr ki 1 indicates an excess level of na in waters therefore water with 1 is not recommended for irrigation due to alkali hazards the groundwater samples were unsuitable for irrigation table 9 which may also be due to intense cation exchange which provides excess na according to ki all the samples falls in the category of unsuitable 3 2 4 permeability index pi pi formula has been developed by doneen 1964 to assess water movement capability in the soil as the suitability of any kind of source of water for irrigation and it is formulated as eq 11 11 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 all the ion concentrations are expressed in meq l pi can be categorized in three classes class i 75 suitable class ii 25 75 good and class iii 25 unsuitable long term use of minerally rich ca2 mg2 na and hco3 groundwater can reduce aeration in the soil and obstruct the growth of seedlings xu et al 2019 according to xu et al 2019 high pi values are related to high levels of na and hco3 which may be due to the cation exchange and carbonate dissolution such as calcite and dolomite majority of the water is suitable for irrigation except at few locations namely namda khan gamri b khanpur kalan a katwal c jauli b saraghta a and puthi b 3 2 5 magnesium hazard mh or magnesium adsorption ratio mar the high value of ca2 and mg2 in water can increase soil ph resulting in decrease in the availability of phosphorous magnesium in groundwater affects the soil quality by converting it into alkaline and decreases the crop yield szabolcs and darab 1964 projected mh values for irrigation water and it is calculated using eq 12 12 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 all the ion concentrations are expressed in meq l mh 50 are not recommended for irrigation purposes singh et al 2015 a high level of mg2 in groundwater leads to soil alkalinity furthermore a large amount of water is absorbed between magnesium and clay particles which reduce the infiltration capability of soil which has adverse effects on crops xu et al 2019 a value of mh 50 indicates harmful groundwater and unsuitable for irrigation while a value of mh 50 indicates suitable groundwater the 50 studied samples are suitable for irrigation 3 2 6 potential salinity ps ps is another water quality parameter based index doneen 1964 for categorization of water for agriculture use ps 3 meq l is an indication of the suitability 3 5 good to injurious and 5 injurious to unsatisfactory of water for irrigation ps can be calculated using following eq 13 13 p s c l 0 5 s o 4 2 all the samples fall in the category of injurious to unsatisfactory for irrigation use table 9 3 2 7 chloroalkaline indices cai1 and cai2 information about coming changes in chemical composition of the groundwater during underground travel is also vital the chemical reaction in which ion exchange between the groundwater and the aquifer occurs during the movement and rest condition of water can be analyzed through the chloroalkaline indices the cai1 and cai2 are evaluated schoeller 1977 as expressed by eqs 14 and 15 14 c a i 1 c l n a k c l 15 c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 2 c o 3 2 h c o 3 n o 3 the cai1 and cai2 indices may be negative or positive depending on the exchange process of na and k from the rock with mg2 and ca2 in water and vice versa if a direct exchange process dep happening between na and k in water with mg2 and ca2 in rocks cai ratio will positive if a reverse exchange process occurs na and k in water with mg2 and ca2 in rocks then cai ratio will negative as per the cai1 ratio 53 33 samples have positive value direct exchange process whereas 47 77 have negative value reverse exchange process the cai2 indices values at all locations have negative values it means the reverse exchange process is dominant in the study area table 9 3 2 8 corrosivity ratio cr the corrosivity ratio is giving the information about water supply any source of water with cr 1 is recommended to the transport of any source of water in any kind of pipes whereas 1 show corrosive nature of water therefore not to be transported through metal pipes the cr can be estimated using an eq 16 16 c r c l 35 2 s o 4 2 96 c o 3 2 h c o 3 100 all ions are in ppm the rate of corrosion depends upon some physical parameters like pressure temperature and rate of flow of water in addition to the higher value of cl and so4 2 also increases the corrosion rate the total studied water samples have 58 34 have corrosive in nature whereas 41 66 samples are recommended to the transport of any source of water in any kind of pipes for irrigation uses table 9 3 2 9

equations eqns 17 and 18 are given as follows xu et al 2019 17 k 12 4 m s a r 18 k a 288 5 c l i f n a c l 288 n a 4 c l i f c l n a c l 2 s o 4 2 288 10 n a 5 c l 9 s o 4 2 i f n a c l 2 s o 4 2 where m represents the total dissolved solids in g l and sar represents the sodium adsorption ratio all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l according to xu et al 2019 k can comprehensively reflect the salt and alkali hazards based on k values the groundwater for irrigation is classified as follows excellent k 25 good 25 36 injurious 36 44 and unsuitable k 44 the water samples as 5 are good and 3 33 samples are falls in injurious categories whereas 91 77 samples are not suitable for irrigation according to xu et al 2019 ka can be obtained by studying the strongest harm of alkaline solution and the relative harm of sodium salt to 40 types of crops if ka 18 excellent 6 8 permissible 1 2 6 doubtful and 1 2 unsuitable all the samples fall in the unsuitable categories table 9 4 conclusion the use of wqi in determination of water quality corresponds to present tendencies within the field of water resources management thus it is attempted to assign chemical importance to the classical parameters related to chemical quality the advantages of this method are many given the fact that wqi i includes more variables in only one number ii brings to the same measuring unit more parameters related to the water quality iii offers the possibility to compare in temporal and spatial terms of quality of more water or that of a single one iv offers an image of the water usage degree in various fields purposes further the calculated wqi revealed that majority of groundwater samples in study area is suitable for human use there is need for routine monitoring of various human activities within the basin especially at the upstream to check the occurrence of high salinity finding of work suggest four methods are suitable to determine wqi wqi1 wqi2 wqi3 for drinking and wqi4 for irrigation considering technical and practical feasibility of methodology of npi is more suitable for determination of wqi for all the parameters as it gives quick and more accurate results this method is based on simple equation hence it is easy to understand and implement acknowledgements the first author would like to thank sanatan pradhan indian agricultural research institute who has
