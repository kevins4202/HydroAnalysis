23905,internal tides generated from multiple sites create complicated interference patterns often making it difficult to identify the origin direction of propagation and dissipation of individual waves to identify these constituent waves we apply a directional fourier filter dff method to analyse multimodal broad wavenumber internal wave fields found over varying topography we apply the method to data derived from both a numerical model and satellite remote sensing observations using a series of two dimensional i e x z simulations we first demonstrate the capability of the dff method to separate incoming and reflected internal tides emanating from a supercritical slope the results show the dff method requires model sampling rates of δ t t 0 15 and horizontal cell sizes of δ x λ 0 2 where t is the wave period and λ is the wavelength remote internal tides can significantly affect the generation and propagation of local internal tides in regional ocean simulations using a gridded satellite altimetry product at three globally diverse regions we demonstrate how the dff method can be used to specify the internal tide boundary conditions at the open boundaries of regional ocean models lastly we apply the dff method to a three dimensional hydrostatic numerical simulation of the southern australian north west shelf to estimate the energy decay characteristics of internal tides the energy decay length scale for offshore propagating waves from the continental slope in the model was estimated to be two mode 1 wavelengths i e 240 km in close agreement with an estimate derived from a satellite derived sea surface height anomaly keywords internal tides directional decomposition directional fourier filter energy decay remote internal tides 1 introduction three dimensional 3d numerical simulations have become one of the most important methods for investigating internal tide dynamics in the ocean and internal tides can now be modelled on a global scale e g arbic et al 2012 buijsman et al 2017 2020 savage et al 2017 satellite altimetry derived products also provide a global view of internal tide characteristics e g zhao et al 2016 zaron 2019 however the output from both model simulations and satellite products is often complicated by the presence of multiple generation sites within the domain of interest e g philippine sea southern australian north west shelf resulting in complicated wave wave interference patterns that are often difficult to interpret kerry et al 2013 gong et al 2019 important processes such as the origin propagation and dissipation of internal tides are thus often difficult to quantify while often ignored for simplicity in regional simulation models of coastal and shelf process models e g niwa and hibiya 2004 zhang et al 2011 rayson et al 2018 information about the internal tides is needed to correctly specify the open boundary conditions for these regional models to investigate complicated internal tide processes a number of approaches have been described to separate internal tides propagating in different directions the first method involves two dimensional 2d plane wave fits to either satellite altimetry data over different regions containing multiple ground tracks or regional numerical simulations e g zhao and alford 2009 zhao et al 2011 2016 2019 waterhouse et al 2018 applied this method to examine the internal tide beam in the tasman sea rainville et al 2010 and wang et al 2018c used an ideal line source method at the hawaiian ridge and in the philippine sea respectively the coupling equations for linear tides explicitly discriminate between incident and reflected waves in a 2d transect kelly et al 2013 other studies have estimated energy fluxes from continental shelf reflection of internal tides by subtracting results from a control or reference run of the simulation without topography e g klymak et al 2011 hall et al 2013 wang et al 2018a almar et al 2014 applied the radon transform method to separate the incoming and transmitted waves and obtained a root mean square error lower than 10 these different methods were generally applied in the open ocean e g zhao et al 2011 wang et al 2018c and assume that the internal tides have a weakly varying horizontal wavenumber here we propose a directional fourier filter dff method that removes the requirement to specify a horizontal wavenumber a priori the dff method is a more general version of the hilbert transform filter also called complex demodulation which was first applied to internal gravity wave data by mercier et al 2008 to decompose incident transmitted and reflected internal wave beams in a 2d i e x z laboratory experiment with a sloping bottom the hilbert transform filter was subsequently used to separate upward propagating and downward propagating near inertial waves e g winters et al 2011 grisouard and thomas 2015 and internal gravity wave beams zhou and diamessis 2013 here we revisit the hilbert transform method and extend it to a dff method to directionally decompose internal tides from gridded ocean variables model or satellite in x y space the energy of internal tides dissipates as they radiate away from a generation source from in situ observations the dissipation of the internal tide can be calculated from the energy loss between two adjacent moorings sharples et al 2001 nash et al 2012 waterhouse et al 2018 on the basis of topex poseidon altimetry internal tides can radiate energy over 2000 km in the central north pacific ray and mitchum 1996 ray and cartwright 2001 numerical simulations demonstrate that internal tides can propagate over 1500 km in the philippine sea kerry et al 2013 and 700 3000 km in the north pacific alford et al 2019 however interference from multiple internal tide sources can influence the estimation of how much tidal energy is lost over a given distance olbers et al 2020 here we apply the dff method to numerical simulations to directionally filter the propagating internal tides and hence compute the energy decay length scale in a particular direction regional ocean models are commonly used to investigate the whole life cycle of internal tides including on the australian north west shelf holloway 2001 on the california coast ponte and cornuelle 2013 and in the northern south china sea alford et al 2015 however these models can reproduce only internal tides generated by the interaction between barotropic tides with local sloping topography mazloff et al 2020 demonstrate that remote internal tide rit forcing at the boundary must be accounted for in a regional model of the california shelf region in order to obtain an accurate description of the internal tide climatology on the shelf in addition the rits at the boundaries can also significantly influence the formation of nonlinear internal waves on the shelf nash et al 2012 rogers et al 2019 here we apply the dff method to satellite altimetry derived baroclinic sea surface height amplitudes from the high resolution empirical tide hret product zaron 2019 to highlight the importance of rits to shelf internal tide studies note that the satellite altimeter captures only coherent internal tides detectable through harmonic analysis which are about 60 of the total buijsman et al 2020 however this is a global average and nelson et al 2019 found that global satellite altimetry products of s s h b c can underestimate the semidiurnal internal tide by up to 80 in the mid latitude ocean finally we apply the filtering method to a global internal tide dataset to demonstrate how to configure incoming internal tide open boundary conditions for a regional ocean model this article is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the principle of directional decomposition with the dff method and the configuration of the internal tide boundary conditions in section 3 we use a series of 2d analytical models of rightward propagating and leftward propagating sinusoidal internal tides to demonstrate the utility of the decomposition method in section 4 we use the dff method to compute incoming internal wave energy fluxes for different regional modelling studies from the literature in section 5 we apply the dff method to both a 3d regional scale model and a satellite derived product to separate the multidirectional internal tide fields into their components and also compute the energy decay length scales of the shelf generated component a 3d model with internal tide open boundary conditions extracted from satellite altimetry data is used to demonstrate the method and importance of internal tide boundary conditions in regional models conclusions are presented and further uses of the dff technique are discussed in section 6 2 theoretical framework in this section we give an overview of the dff wave separation technique for one dimensional cases in x t space and then 2d x y t space applications 2 1 x t space to introduce the concept we start with a one dimensional problem and define a variable ψ x t which represents any model variable such as sea surface height anomaly or wave induced velocity here we state the filtering processes in the following four steps i first take the discrete fourier transform in time with zero padding 1 ψ ˆ m δ x f n δ t δ t n 0 n 1 ψ m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π n f n f n 2 0 n 2 where ψ ˆ is the fourier transformed variable and δ x and δ t represent the spatial and temporal resolutions ii remove the negative frequencies double the positive frequencies and take the inverse discrete fourier transform to obtain the complex valued variable ψ 2 ψ m δ x n δ t 2 n δ t f 1 n 2 ψ ˆ m δ x f n δ t exp i 2 π n f n n 0 1 n 1 because ψ is for the positive frequency band it is multiplied by a factor of 2 to retain the same amplitude as ψ steps i and ii are hilbert transforms of the original real valued signal see mercier et al 2008 iii repeat this process in the spatial x direction by calculating the discrete fourier transform of the complex valued ψ in the wavenumber domain 3 ψ k m δ x n δ t δ x m 0 m 1 ψ m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π m k m k m 2 0 m 2 where ψ is the spatial fourier transformed variable and k is the wavenumber in the x direction note that now the positive and negative wavenumbers are different and contain information about the different propagation directions iv finally take the inverse discrete fourier transform of the positive and negative wavenumber parts to obtain the rightward propagating ψ r m δ x n δ t and leftward propagating ψ l m δ x n δ t space time components fig 1a ψ r m δ x n δ t 1 m δ x re k 1 m 2 ψ k m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π m k m m 0 1 m 1 4 ψ l m δ x n δ t 1 m δ x re k m 2 1 ψ k m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π m k m m 0 1 m 1 2 2 x y t space we generalize the dff to a 2d spatial coordinate x y to extract internal waves propagating within an arbitrary directional sector fig 1b by following the six operations below i start with a real valued signal in space x x y and time t that is ψ x t ii take the fourier transform of this signal in time to give a spatial field of complex amplitudes for each frequency ψ ˆ x ω note that this is the starting point for output from the satellite derived product hret as it provides the complex amplitudes for each harmonic note that this is different from the steps above in that we are now operating in the frequency domain iii take the fourier transform of the complex amplitudes along all spatial dimensions to give ψ k ω where k k l are horizontal wavenumbers that have both signs iv define a filter function h k which is equal to unity for the wavenumbers of interest and is zero elsewhere for example we select a sector with a lower band l a k and an upper band l b k in the wavenumber space fig 1b the filter function h k is defined as 5 h k 0 tan 1 l k θ l 1 θ l tan 1 l k θ u 0 tan 1 l k θ u where θ l and θ u are the lower and upper angle cut offs namely tan θ l a and tan θ u b v calculate the filtered harmonics ψ ˆ f x ω in space by taking the inverse fourier transform of the filtered amplitude h k ψ k ω vi finally take the inverse fourier transform of the complex ψ ˆ f x ω for each harmonic and compute their sum to give the filtered signal in space and time that is ψ f x t as an example of this general method we divide the wavenumber space into eight sectors spanning 45 fig 1c the eastward propagating wave signals are thus given as the sum of the contributions from two adjacent sectors namely h k l 0 and h k l 0 as another example if we decompose the signal into four components propagating in four quadrants northeast northwest southeast and southwest the positive and negative wavenumbers k will be spatially filtered and ψ x t is shown in fig 1d finally we note that the directional band pass filter in step iv above is an extension of the method described in zhao et al 2019 who used a band pass filter to filter out different horizontal wavenumbers in all directions their filter was designed to separate waves with different vertical modes i e horizontal wavenumber magnitude in contrast our method is designed to separate waves propagating within certain directional regions and retains all of the different vertical modes horizontal wavenumbers 2 3 set up of internal tide boundary conditions previous studies e g kerry et al 2013 mazloff et al 2020 demonstrate that it is important to include rits along the open boundaries of regional models here we present a method to configure rit forcing at regional model boundaries using a global internal tide dataset the global satellite altimetry product hret the steps are as follows i apply the dff method to the sea surface anomaly s s h b c from the hret product to obtain the phase θ s x y of the internal tides e g m 2 propagating in the direction perpendicular to the desired boundary in a region that extends at least two mode 1 wavelengths from each side of the boundary ii we assume the rits always propagate in the direction n x y perpendicular to the contours of phase θ s x y the normalized vector of the propagation direction can then be written as 6 n x y θ s x y θ s x y iii quantify the rits by s s h b c propagating in the direction of n as derived from the dff components of the hret product note s s h b c x varies along the boundary iv convert s s h b c to the vertical displacement η 0 in the ocean interior at the desired boundary via the method described by zhao et al 2016 where 7 η 0 x g s s h b c x h 0 ϕ 1 x z n 2 z d z where n is the buoyancy frequency and ϕ 1 is the vertical structure of the mode 1 eigenfunction at the boundary note that mode 1 internal tides are dominant in the hret product v the amplitude of the baroclinic velocity v b c at the boundary can then be calculated by the method described by rayson et al 2018 where 8 v b c x z c 1 x η 0 x d ϕ 1 x z d z where c 1 x is the phase speed of linear mode 1 internal tides at the boundary vi the baroclinic velocity v b c at the boundary is written as 9 v b c x z t v b c x z n x 3 application of the dff method to 2d plane waves we used an analytical case with two sinusoidal waves propagating in opposite directions to evaluate the effect of the temporal and horizontal sampling rates δ t and δ x respectively on the accuracy of the dff technique the purpose was to define the minimum temporal sampling from the numerical model output or the minimum spatial sampling from satellite derived products in order to use the dff method effectively then we used a 2d numerical model the mit general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 to simulate internal tides reflected from a supercritical slope to demonstrate the utility of the dff method for computing energy decay length scales when there are interacting internal tides 3 1 requirements of sampling rate and cell size a series of models of two analytical sinusoidal waves propagating in opposite directions was used to determine suitable temporal and spatial sampling rates to perform the dff 10 u x t u p o s k cos k x c t u n e g k cos k x c t θ the purpose here was to determine suitable model output rates particularly the temporal rate the rightward propagating wave had an amplitude u p o s k of 20 cm s 1 while the leftward propagating wave had an amplitude u n e g k ranging from 2 5 cm s 1 to 20 cm s 1 shown in table 1 k and c were set as the theoretical wavenumber and mode 1 phase speed of s 2 in a water depth of 1000 m the phase difference θ between two analytical waves was set to 0 5 π we also tested five other sensitivity cases with single direction waves including a rightward propagating case and four leftward propagating cases and compared them with the above mentioned bidirectional cases to examine the requirements of δ t and δ x we evaluated the performance of the dff method by comparing the rightward propagating component from the bidirectional cases with the rightward propagating component from single direction cases for four cases with different wave amplitudes e g posk20 negk10 in table 1 the model output interval varied from 10 min to 6 h a half tidal cycle and the horizontal cell size varied from 1 km to 50 km half the theoretical wavelength for the bidirectional cases we divided u into two parts u p o s k and u n e g k with opposite wavenumber sign for the two corresponding sensitivity cases with only single direction forcing e g single posk20 and single negk10 we defined the result as u right and u l e f t we made quantitative comparisons by calculating the relative root mean square rms velocity differences between the dff variables posk and negk and the single direction model results right and left in all cases the relative rms difference in the positive direction was smaller than 1 when δ t t 0 2 and δ x λ 0 3 fig 2a c e and g additionally the rms difference in the positive direction was smaller than 2 in most regions the rms difference in the negative direction showed some variation for the different cases in cases with comparable leftward and rightward amplitudes fig 2b and d the rms difference in the negative direction was smaller than 1 when δ t t 0 2 and δ x λ 0 2 when u n e g k was much smaller than u p o s k fig 2f and h the rms difference in the negative direction was smaller than 1 providing δ t t 0 15 and δ x λ 0 2 similarly buijsman et al 2020 demonstrate that at a minimum five cells need to be in a wavelength to resolve that mode in addition to the relative rms velocity difference we also calculated the correlation coefficient for the various cases not shown the correlation coefficients were greater than 90 when δ t t 0 2 and δ x λ 0 2 in all cases not shown in summary the dff method was able to separate the leftward propagating and rightward propagating waves if δ t t 0 15 and δ x λ 0 2 in practice this means δ t 1 8 h and δ x 20 km in our flat bottom case with s 2 internal tide forcing for a water depth of 1000 m in addition we evaluated the capability of the dff method by comparing it with the radon transform filter method almar et al 2014 and found a similar result not shown providing further evidence of the ability of the dff method to separate bidirectional waves 3 2 reflection and shoaling processes over a slope to demonstrate the utility of the dff method to diagnose reflection and shoaling processes over a slope we used a 2d mitgcm model with a domain length of 500 km a horizontal grid scale of 1000 m and imposed a 50 km wide sponge boundary condition at both lateral boundaries we only show the model results in the inner domain x 50 450 km the model had 88 vertical layers that were spaced according to a hyperbolic tangent function profile stewart et al 2017 with the layer thickness ranging from 1 m near the surface to 20 m near the seabed maximum 1000 m a 10 s time step was set to satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy conditions in both the vertical direction and the horizontal direction and the model runs were 120 h long i e 10 tidal cycles the initial stratification profile was derived from the ocean forecasting australia model oke et al 2008 fig 3 constant horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity diffusivity coefficients were used to parameterize sub grid scale turbulent dissipation and mixing processes where a h 10 m2 s 1 a v 1 0 4 m2 s 1 k h 10 m2 s 1 and k v 1 0 5 m2 s 1 legg and huijts 2006 nagai and hibiya 2015 bottom stress was parameterized by means of a quadratic drag law with c d 2 5 1 0 3 an incoming mode 1 baroclinic tide was added on the left boundary and reflected from a 2d supercritical slope to demonstrate how to compute energy fluxes with the directionally decomposed physical variables the bottom topography fig 4a followed a hyperbolic tangent function 11 h x 1 2 h 0 h s tanh x x s s 1 2 h 0 h s where h 0 is the maximum water depth and x s and h s are the location and water depth on the slope respectively the width s is configured for a supercritical slope shown in fig 4a the initial stratification was the same as described in gong et al 2019 the 2d model was driven by s 2 baroclinic tides with a small amplitude of 20 cm s 1 on the left boundary which ensured the internal tides were approximately linear across the domain snapshots of p indicated that incoming internal tides maintained a mode 1 structure as they propagated towards the slope fig 5b at t 20 h the only detectable internal tide propagated from the left boundary fig 5a c after t 40 h a reflected component was present near the top of the slope blue shading in fig 5f and by t 60 h the overall internal tide field became more complex because of the reflected components the incoming internal tide however remained linear with a mode 1 structure before reaching the slope where it scattered into higher vertical modes e g fig 5k by t 80 h the rightward propagating high mode internal tide components had dissipated and the mode 1 internal tide kept travelling rightward beyond x 360 km into shallow water fig 5k and leftward beyond x 125 km into deep water fig 5l we estimated energy decay length scales from the directionally decomposed signals by first computing the baroclinic energy flux f u p using only leftward and rightward parts 12 u u l u r p p l p r resulting in a depth integrated energy flux f ˆ composed of three parts 13 f ˆ f ˆ l f ˆ r f ˆ cross h 0 u l p l u r p r u l p r u r p l d z where f ˆ l and f ˆ r are the depth integrated leftward and rightward energy flux respectively after the model had reached a quasi steady state we time averaged each term in eq 13 over 3 days denoted by below the cross term f ˆ cross represents the energy transport associated with the linear interference of superimposed waves propagating leftward and rightward note that this differs from other definitions of the flux cross term that account for interactions between coherent and incoherent velocity and pressure signals see nash et al 2012 buijsman et al 2017 in our case the cross terms are between two identical frequencies the incident and reflected waves so there is no temporal variation large values of f ˆ cross usually occurred near the left boundary and over the slope however the magnitude of f ˆ cross was negligible compared with the other terms see fig 5m in the inner domain of the 2d numerical experiments the magnitude of the leftward offshore propagating time averaged energy flux f ˆ l decreased after being reflected over the slope and we used an energy decay length scale to quantify the internal tide energy dissipation processes we assumed the flux followed an exponential function 14 f ˆ l f ˆ max exp x 0 x l where f ˆ l represents the offshore propagating leftward energy flux at location x zhao 2017 we least squares fit eq 14 to find l from the model output energy flux decay for the region spanning from the slope x 0 250 km to the boundary of the inner domain x 50 km the maximum energy flux f ˆ max occurred at x 0 250 km and the energy decay length scale l was approximately 280 km see the blue line in fig 5o the energy decay rate in the unit of watts per square metre was inferred by assuming a balance between the energy flux divergence f ˆ l and the bulk energy decay ε i e setting the internal tide generation and the nonlinear flux divergence terms to zero 15 c f ˆ l ε 0 3 3 ability of the dff method to directionally separate multimodal internal tides the 2d plane wave fit decomposition method was developed by zhao and alford 2009 to decompose single mode internal tides with a roughly known horizontal wavelength i e in the open ocean with weakly varying water depth in zhao et al 2019 this filter method was further developed to separate mode 1 and mode 2 internal tides i e discrete prespecified horizontal wavenumbers and directions in contrast the dff method can separate multidirectional waves over varying topography in coastal regions i e shelf and slope topography and retain all of the different vertical modes to demonstrate the ability of the dff method to directionally separate multimodal internal tides over the shelf we calculated the horizontal wavenumber spectra of the complex s s h b c amplitude at the tidal forcing frequency extracted from the 2d model see section 3 2 the spectral energy levels of the positive wavenumbers black line in fig 6 were always greater than the levels of the negative wavenumbers red line in fig 6 as the internal tides lost energy during the propagation and reflection process we solved the hydrostatic shear free taylor goldstein equation gill 1982 to estimate the theoretical wavenumbers for internal tides in different modes in a water depth of z h o and z h s respectively the vertical dashed lines in fig 6 for the mode 1 internal tides in the deep basin the peaks of both the positive wavenumber spectra and the negative wavenumber spectra exceeded levels of 10 cm2 cpkm 1 suggesting mode 1 internal tides were always dominant in deep water regardless of the direction note that cpkm means cycle per kilometre for the mode 1 internal tides on the shelf there was another peak for the rightward propagating component but a significant trough for the leftward propagating component this was due to the lack of a reflected internal tide on the shelf for the mode 2 internal tide in the deep basin the spectral peak was much smaller than that for the mode 1 internal tide the mode 2 internal tide on the shelf displayed similar characteristics to the mode 1 internal tide which had a peak in the positive wavenumber spectra and a trough in the negative wavenumber spectra note also that the leftward and rightward propagating mode 3 internal tides in the basin were resolved in the spectra and were likely a signature of the internal beam emanating from the supercritical shelf break fig 6 in summary the dff method was able to directionally decompose multimodal internal tides over varying topography 4 application of the dff method to a satellite altimetry product we applied the dff method to the satellite derived product of zaron 2019 to separate the incoming and outgoing internal tide energy flux at the open boundaries of several regional model studies from recent literature the purpose here was to demonstrate the importance of rit forcing to regional internal tide dynamics 4 1 satellite altimetry product hret a new open source high resolution empirical tide hret model estimates the sea level anomaly s s h b c induced by internal tides zaron 2019 this dataset uses nearly all available exact repeated altimetry data from 1992 to 2015 to extract tidal harmonic sea surface height amplitudes including data from the topex poseidon geosat follow on jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 ers 2 envisat and saral missions it then filters the barotropic tide signal from the along track harmonics and performs a spatial interpolation to map the complex amplitudes onto a 0 05 horizontal resolution grid from 66 s to 66 n it includes four phase locked harmonics namely m 2 s 2 k 1 and o 1 and the annual modulations of m 2 denoted ma2 and mb2 near coastal regions where water depths are shallower than 200 m and regions of low signal to noise ratio are masked out of the hret model to investigate the application of the dff method to the satellite altimetry product we first considered the northeast indian ocean 104 e to 124 e 3 s to 23 s note that the temporal sampling rate criterion was not applicable to the hret data as the amplitude and phase for each harmonic were provided rather than a time series therefore we skipped the frequency filtering processes steps i and ii in section 2 2 and directly applied the spatial filter to the complex spatial variables as the cell size δ x of the hret model was 5 km the dff was able to decompose internal tides with wavelengths greater than 50 km on the basis of the wentzel kramers brillouin approximation for examples see gill 1982 pedlosky 2003 the mode 1 semidiurnal internal tide wavelength is greater than 50 km in the domain where the water depth is greater than 350 m in the northeast indian ocean a complicated horizontal distribution of s s h b c was evident in the hret data due to the standing wave patterns associated with the locally dominant m 2 internal tides fig 7a following the dff procedure in section 2 2 we decomposed the harmonic amplitudes into four propagation quadrants i e 90 directional bins we masked land regions by filling the amplitudes with zeros before applying the directional fourier transform this worked well because internal tides were weak near the land boundaries and the discontinuity of values between shallow water and land was not significant we verified the treatment of the land regions by summing the four directional components which agreed well with the original wave signal relative differences of s s h b c 1 m 2 internal tides propagated with varying amplitudes and phases offshore from four dominant generation sites in the northeast indian ocean see alternating positive and negative bands of s s h b c in fig 7b internal tides propagated a distance of approximately o 100 km from the southern australian north west shelf pilbara region and they propagated approximately o 1000 km from the northern australian north west shelf to the indonesian archipelago similarly internal tides generated in the lombok strait 116 e 9 s propagated southward through deep water for almost 1000 km with only slight energy loss and eventually reached the northern australian north west shelf fig 7e we used the method described by zhao and alford 2009 to calculate the depth averaged energy flux of the mode 1 m 2 internal tides from the satellite product hret in zhao and alford 2009 energy flux is calculated from the baroclinic sea surface height using the local water depth stratification tidal frequency local inertial frequency and mode number which is given as 16 f 1 2 h 0 u z p z d z 1 2 s s h b c 2 ρ 0 g 2 ω k 1 ω 2 f 2 h 0 π 1 2 z d z where π 1 z is the normalized mode 1 baroclinic eigenfunction for pressure p z and horizontal velocity u z see eq 7 in buijsman et al 2020 the hret inferred fluxes represent only the coherent fraction and thus the remote fluxes would be underestimated in these examples we used this method to quantify the incoming and outgoing internal tide energy flux in three different regions the australian north west shelf the california coast and the northern south china sea more examples of hret decomposition and the associated matlab dff scripts are available in the github repository https github com gongy93 dff hret 4 2 australian north west shelf the australian north west shelf is a region with ubiquitous and energetic internal waves holloway 1984 1985 jones and ivey 2017 however previous studies holloway 2001 van gastel et al 2009 numerically reproduced the internal wave field of the australian north west shelf with a limited spatial model domain excluding the indonesian region to the north or the exmouth plateau to the west holloway 2001 used the princeton ocean model to investigate the internal tide generation by the continental shelf topography shown as a black rectangle in fig 8 by forcing the model open boundaries with only the m 2 barotropic tides here we computed the energy flux derived from the hret in four directions fig 8 the high value locations occurred mainly over critical topography i e continental slopes and shelves and ridges in the deeper ocean for example there was a large energy flux over the continental slope where tidal beams have previously been reported fig 8a and a large energy flux was located in a water depth of 500 m near the lombok strait another generation site fig 8c holloway 2001 predicted the m 2 internal tides produced 1 01 gw boundary averaged 652 w m 1 of energy flux going northwest through the offshore boundary of the model which ran roughly parallel with the continental shelf break the northwestern m 2 energy flux from the hret product was 0 77 gw 499 w m 1 fig 8a which was smaller than the estimate of holloway 2001 with a model forced only with the local barotropic tides at the southwestern boundary the northeastern and southwestern energy fluxes from hret were 61 3 mw 101 w m 1 and 28 4 mw 47 w m 1 respectively yielding a net incoming flux of about 33 mw 54 w m 1 fig 8b and c the exmouth plateau was notably absent from the domain of holloway 2001 but it was subsequently shown to be a prominent generation site of internal tides on the lower australian north west shelf by gong et al 2019 as described by kelly and nash 2010 buijsman et al 2010 and gong et al 2019 rits not only influence the interference patterns of propagating internal tides but also significantly influence the local barotropic to baroclinic conversion by altering the pressure perturbation near generation sites p we therefore implemented a 3d numerical model in this region and compared the results with the satellite altimetry results in section 5 4 3 california coast a recent study of the california coast by mazloff et al 2020 concluded that a regional model without remote internal wave forcing was unable to reproduce the internal tides on the shelf when compared with a global internal tide resolving model mazloff et al 2020 compared the energy flux at the boundaries from two regional models mitgcm and the regional ocean modelling system with a global mitgcm model their regional models suggested that there was a net flux from the model domain of 70 mw 60 mw and 52 mw 50 w m 1 50 w m 1 and 37 w m 1 through the northern western and southern boundaries respectively in contrast the global model showed the region was an internal wave energy sink with an outgoing 337 mw 241 w m 1 incoming 227 mw 189 w m 1 and incoming 649 mw 464 w m 1 crossing the domain at the northern western and southern boundaries respectively to quantify the energy flux of m 2 internal tides going both in and out of this californian shelf region we selected the same domain as mazloff et al 2020 shown in fig 9 and directionally decomposed the hret data into four components propagating northward southward westward and eastward via the dff method described in section 2 2 the net energy fluxes at the boundaries were outgoing 126 mw 90 w m 1 incoming 21 mw 18 w m 1 and outgoing 95 mw 68 w m 1 at the northern western and southern boundaries respectively these fluxes differ by an order of magnitude to the fluxes computed by mazloff et al 2020 note that the global mitgcm solution used by mazloff et al 2020 overestimates the tidal energy because of errors in the model yu et al 2019 and the hret likely underestimates the fluxes because it contains only the stationary phase locked portion of the signal 4 4 northern south china sea the northern south china sea is another well studied region with energetic internal waves e g simmons et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 buijsman et al 2012 alford et al 2015 these numerical studies reproduced the internal waves generated in the luzon strait by forcing the model with only barotropic tides however kerry et al 2013 ran a regional ocean modelling system model including the luzon strait and mariana arc generation sites and concluded the local conversion and propagation patterns of internal tides in the luzon strait can be greatly altered in the presence of remotely generated internal tide flux from the mariana arc we therefore examined this region to estimate the effects of rits fig 10 jan et al 2008 suggested approximately 2 0 gw 4 0 kw m 1 energy flux of m 2 internal tides propagated eastward from the eastern ridge in the luzon strait however our decomposed hret results showed only 815 mw 1 63 kw m 1 of m 2 energy flux left the domain at the eastern boundary which indicated either strong tidal energy decay of the waves after radiating from the generation site in the luzon strait or the scattering of tidal frequency energy to higher harmonics due to nonlinear steepening buijsman et al 2010 additionally 268 mw 536 w m 1 of energy flux entered the eastern boundary likely from the mariana arc at the western boundary the incoming energy flux 184 mw 368 w m 1 was greater than the outgoing energy flux 104 mw 208 w m 1 as internal tides originating from the xisha islands propagated eastward liang et al 2019 incoming internal tides at the northern and southern boundaries were also nonnegligible fig 10a and c in summary we have demonstrated that remotely generated internal tides can make a significant contribution at the boundaries of regional model domains at three different geographic locations suggesting it is often necessary to use incoming internal tides at the boundaries of regional models 5 application of the dff method to 3d regional models as discussed in section 4 internal tide forcing is important for the boundary conditions in a regional model here we apply the dff method to quantify the importance of rits at the offshore boundary in a 3d numerical model as an example we used a model in the pilbara region on the australian north west shelf one of many regions globally where internal tides from multiple generation sites interfere with each other gong et al 2019 we further evaluated the role of rits by comparing two simulations one with and one without rit boundary forcing see section 5 3 we simplified the tidal forcing by using a single harmonic in both cases and not including any atmospheric forcing 5 1 3d hydrostatic mitgcm model we implemented a 3d hydrostatic mitgcm model to investigate the energy decay of offshore propagating internal tides in the pilbara region 110 n to 118 5 n 17 s to 24 s by forcing the model with only barotropic tides and compared it with the hret product we also used the model to demonstrate the effects of adding remotely generated baroclinic tidal forcing along the open boundaries as discussed in section 5 3 we used geoscience australia bathymetry data with a horizontal resolution of 250 m the horizontal grid spacing was 1000 m in both the longitudinal direction and the latitudinal direction the model domain consisted of 888 630 grid cells there were 138 layers in the vertical direction ranging from 1 m near the surface to 100 m on the bottom horizontally uniform density and stratification profiles were derived from the ocean forecasting australia model fig 2a and b by temporally and spatially averaging output from april 2012 as semidiurnal barotropic tides are dominant in the pilbara region the model was driven by m 2 tides only on the boundaries with values taken from the oregon state university topex poseidon solution tpxo8 atlas data with 1 30 resolution egbert and erofeeva 2002 a 50 km wide sponge layer was imposed on each lateral boundary to absorb internal tides and avoid reflection back to the inner region the model results were analysed after 10 days once equilibrium had been reached more details of the model configuration can be found in gong et al 2019 5 1 1 baroclinic sea surface height the baroclinic sea surface height s s h b c was given by 17 s s h b c x y p x y z 0 ρ c g where ρ c is the reference density g is the gravitational acceleration and p x y z 0 is the surface pressure perturbation which is extracted from the numerical model for direct comparison with the satellite altimetry derived internal tide amplitude decay estimates the m 2 internal tide dynamics on the australian north west shelf consist of standing wave patterns in deep water 114 e 19 s fig 11a and gong et al 2019 we therefore used the dff method to separate s s h b c into four components ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ 3 and ψ 4 corresponding to the compass quadrant directions in x y space see section 2 2 alternating positive and negative bands of the northeast component ψ 1 indicated m 2 internal tides were generated at the western portion of the exmouth plateau fig 11c and propagated northeast as found by gong et al 2019 after propagating 200 km the internal tide amplitude decreased and we examine this process of energy decay in section 5 2 the two continental slope locations also generated offshore propagating northeast internal tides marked as regions b and c in fig 11b the banded pattern of s s h b c indicated the slope generated internal tides propagated offshore in the northeast quadrant as suggested by the numerical model results of van gastel et al 2009 note that internal tides from region c propagated only a short distance 150 km before they were absorbed by the sponge boundary region d generated a relatively weak offshore propagating internal tide fig 11b the interference between internal tides from regions b and d became obvious at the location green dashed box in fig 11b offshore of the respective generations sites internal tides from the western portion of the exmouth plateau also propagated shoreward as seen in the southwest component ψ 3 fig 11d a source of internal tides from region b was also highlighted in the southwest component although the magnitude of s s h b c was smaller than that of the northwest component fig 11b compared with the offshore propagating internal tides from region c the inshore internal tides were much weaker shown in fig 11e the wavelengths became shorter as the internal tides propagated inshore from water depths of 1000 m to 100 m highlighting the ability of the dff method to decompose directions for a broad spectrum of horizontal wavenumbers this is in contrast to the 2d plane wave fitting method zhao et al 2016 2019 which explicitly specifies wavenumbers and hence is of limited use in regions such as this with highly variable water depths 5 1 2 energy flux the baroclinic velocity u and pressure fields p from the 3d model were divided into four components northwest northeast southwest and southeast and used to compute energy fluxes see eq 13 for the calculation with 2d model data for each layer of the 3d model output we decomposed the tidal energy flux into five components and then depth integrated them to obtain 18 f ˆ f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 f ˆ 3 f ˆ 4 f ˆ cross where f ˆ represents h 0 f d z the resulting horizontal distribution of the total energy flux f ˆ illustrated the complicated internal tide climatology due to the multiple generation sites fig 12a the energy flux showed internal tides propagating from different locations and their interference cross term similar to the baroclinic sea surface height fig 11 the fate of the internal tides propagating northeast from the western portion of the exmouth plateau was difficult to determine from the total energy flux f ˆ the largest energy flux occurred in regions b and c over the continental slope where fluxes reached 2 0 kw m 1 the dff method separated internal tides propagating from multiple generation sites fig 12c f the energy flux magnitude of offshore propagating internal tides from region b decayed from 1 0 kw m 1 close to the generation site to 0 3 kw m 1 near the northern boundary a distance of roughly 200 km fig 12c in addition offshore propagating and onshore propagating components from region c had energy flux magnitudes of 1 5 kw m 1 and 1 3 kw m 1 respectively fig 12c and f in contrast internal tides propagating northeast and southwest from the western portion of the exmouth plateau region a had a relatively small energy flux 0 5 kw m 1 fig 12d and e the cross terms in eq 18 highlighted regions where there was interference between internal tides generated from multiple sources fig 12b the cross terms are between two identical frequencies so there is no temporal variation which differs from a broad frequency spectrum of internal waves interacting see nash et al 2012 buijsman et al 2017 the large values as much as 1 0 kw m 1 of f ˆ cross were comparable to the values of other terms particularly between regions a and b suggesting there was significant interference between the internal tides from region a and the continental slope in region b the cross flux term suggested that remote internal tides were likely to significantly alter the energy flux at single mooring stations in time which has been observed in the ocean e g alford et al 2007 rayson et al 2012 the nearby location of region c on the continental slope was another hotspot of internal tide interference 5 2 energy decay length scale the propagation distance of an internal tide is an important quantity as it can be used to infer energy decay rates due to turbulent dissipation and hence potentially mixing kerry et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the energy decay was revealed in the directionally decomposed signal from the satellite altimetry product section 4 note that only stationary internal tides are extracted from the satellite altimetry using harmonic analysis we compared the energy decay produced in the 3d mitgcm model with the satellite derived hret energy decay in the mitgcm model we first quantified the decrease in internal tide energy from the generation site region b towards the deep basin fig 12c by estimating the energy decay length scale l for the northwest component ψ 2 using eq 13 we selected several parallel transects between the two dashed red lines shown in fig 12c and e to calculate the offshore propagating component f ˆ 2 fig 13a the magnitude of f ˆ 2 decreased monotonically focusing on the inner domain x 80 358 km and excluding the model sponge boundary where the baroclinic energy was absorbed we estimated the energy decay length scale following the same exponential fitting method as described in section 3 2 the maximum energy flux f ˆ max occurred at x 0 80 km and the energy decay length scale l was 240 km which suggested that the internal tides lost 60 of their energy within this distance i e two mode 1 wavelengths resulting in a bulk energy decay rate of approximately o 10 3 w m 2 in addition the simulation revealed that the energy flux decayed more rapidly near the generation sites than in the far field in agreement with laboratory experiments wang et al 2018b next we calculated the divergence of the energy flux f ˆ 2 along the red line in fig 13c noting that f ˆ 2 was negative around x 200 km indicating a potential generation site we then extracted the hret dataset for the northeast indian ocean region covering our mitgcm domain blue box in fig 7a to compare the offshore propagating internal tide energy decay internal tides were observed on the western portion of the exmouth plateau and propagated northeast and southwest fig 7c and d respectively in agreement with the mitgcm results note that onshore propagating internal tides fig 7e were not resolved by the satellite product due to depth limitations so we were not able to compare the tides in the shelf region with the mitgcm results as the mitgcm model did not include rit forcing on the outer boundary of the computational domain we focused only on the offshore propagating internal tide in terms of the energy flux from the satellite product hret large offshore energy fluxes fig 13b occurred near the continental slope consistent with the mitgcm results fig 13a and at x 80 km in fig 13c there was a peak energy flux 1 3 kw m 1 region near region b fig 12a in the mitgcm that did not occur in the hret probably due to high mode internal tides dissipating rapidly in the mitgcm that were not resolved by hret we estimated the offshore propagating energy flux f ˆ 2 using parallel transects between the two dashed red lines in fig 13a least squares fit the exponential decay function eq 14 and obtained an energy decay length scale l of 249 km this is in good agreement with the length scale calculated from the mitgcm solution 240 km in addition the spatial variations in flux divergence f ˆ 2 were similar to the mitgcm solution with a negative value occurring at x 200 km the two examples demonstrate the utility of the dff method to isolate the decaying signal and the close agreement hints at the reason for the internal tide energy loss three potential reasons can lead to a loss of internal tide energy including frequency smearing due to doppler shifting by the background flow transfer of energy to other frequencies due to nonlinear interactions or turbulent dissipation we can rule out doppler shifting because the mitgcm was forced with a single harmonic and included no background flow we cannot eliminate nonlinear interactions in the mitgcm other than noting that the forcing was monochromatic and the wave amplitudes were not extremely large therefore the agreement of the decay length scale derived from the two independent data sources suggests that the decay of the hret signal is likely due to turbulent dissipation in this region 5 3 internal tide open boundary forcing to demonstrate the use of the dff method for determining the rit boundary forcing set up section 2 3 we ran the 3d mitgcm model in the pilbara region with the incoming internal tides specified along the boundary conditions 3d withrits there were two offshore boundaries in this regional simulation a northern and a western boundary the southward propagating m 2 tidal energy flux at the northern boundary was approximately five times the magnitude of the eastward propagating m 2 tidal energy flux at the western boundary in the pilbara model fig 8 we therefore focused on the southward propagating m 2 internal tides at the northern boundary and first computed the phase of these southward propagating internal tides step i in section 2 3 fig 14a and hence obtained their propagation direction vector n at the northern boundary step ii in section 2 3 fig 14b the magnitude of the southward propagating s s h b c at the northern boundary was then extracted step iii in section 2 3 fig 14c note that the projection of v b c perpendicular to the northern boundary was dominant fig 14b and was used as the rit boundary condition the model might slightly underestimate the remote internal tide energy without the orthogonal components as discussed by nelson et al 2019 the global satellite altimetry s s h b c data does not capture the nonstationary component and hence they can underestimate the semidiurnal internal tide by approximately 80 in the mid latitude ocean to compensate for this we multiplied v b c by a factor of 2 to obtain more realistic semidiurnal signals fig 14d as southward propagating internal tides were added at the northern boundary the primary effect on local internal tide climatology in the domain will be in the southward direction we therefore used the dff method to extract the southward components of m 2 internal tides fig 15 from the two mitgcm cases firstly with the inclusion of rits 3d withrits and secondly without the inclusion of rits 3d norits for s s h b c the maximum amplitude difference between the two cases was 1 5 cm 50 in the areas close to the northern boundary additionally the phase of the southward component of s s h b c was significantly different in the two cases particularly near the northern boundary see fig 15b the phase difference reached up to 90 on the continental slope where internal tides were generated by the barotropic tide therefore both the amplitude and the phase of the barotropic to baroclinic conversion rates over the shelf were significantly affected by rits at the boundary to quantify the effect of adding rits at the northern boundary we computed the area integrated conversion rates in four regions marked in fig 15a previously identified as the key local generation sites gong et al 2019 area integrated conversion rates in regions a and b did not show large differences between the two cases 3d norits versus 3d withrits in particular 199 0 mw versus 190 3 mw in region a and 208 6 mw versus 206 7 mw in region b both of these generation sites are relatively far from the northern boundary and the rits lost most of their energy before they arrived in either region a or region b see stripes in fig 7d in contrast regions c1 and c2 are closer to the northern boundary but they were affected inversely by the presence of rits table 2 because these two regions were located in the path of rit beams see fig 7e because of the internal tide boundary forcing there was a 4 7 decrease in the conversion rate decrease of 9 7 mw from 206 1 mw in region c1 and a 10 6 increase in the conversion rate increase of 20 7 mw from 195 6 mw in region c2 the decreases in the integrated conversion rates due to the presence of the rits were the result of the phase difference between the rits and local barotropic tides resulting in destructive interference e g gong et al 2019 in summary inclusion of the internal tide forcing at the boundary of a regional model was important for both the generation and the propagation of local internal tides as well as the net energy fluxes in the regional model domain 6 summary and conclusions we have demonstrated the utility of the dff method for directionally decomposing internal tide signals from both 2d and 3d numerical models of stratified tidal flow over supercritical topography and also from satellite altimetry data the dff method optimally separated internal tides propagating in two directions when the normalized sampling rate δ t t 0 15 and the normalized horizontal cell size δ x λ 0 2 in 2d numerical solutions incoming and reflected internal tides were completely decomposed demonstrating the capability of the dff technique the wavenumber spectra of the complex s s h b c demonstrated the ability of the dff method to directionally decompose multimodal internal tides over regions with varying topography the offshore energy decay length scale e folding length was estimated to be two mode 1 wavelengths i e 240 250 km from the continental slope generation region on the australian north west shelf both in the 3d mitgcm model and in the satellite data product hret this consistency suggests that satellite derived directionally decomposed internal wave energy dynamics could inform the parameterization of internal tide dissipation within global ocean models that do not resolve internal tides at least at sites where internal tides are coherent e g zhao et al 2016 the cross term contributions to energy flux demonstrated the wave wave interference patterns resulting from internal tides propagating in different directions the dff is a useful tool for extracting information about internal tides propagating in different directions in complicated wave fields the technique allows quantification of important processes such as internal wave dissipation we plan to extend the directional decomposition method and compute the energy decay length or time scales for individual modes as per vic et al 2019 and de lavergne et al 2019 such a decomposition would help quantify whether energy decay of low modes is due to wave scattering or physical turbulent dissipation the dff technique also stresses the importance of specifying incoming internal tides at the boundaries in regional models an important but often neglected process the application of the dff method to the satellite derived product hret helps to determine whether stationary rits are required at the boundaries of a regional model we note that the hret product cannot be used to define nonstationary rit boundary conditions the dff also represents a method for defining incoming boundary velocities from internal tides using either hret or a global ocean model in a future study we will examine the role of rit forcing in generating nonlinear internal waves on the shelf by implementing a nonhydrostatic model with rits at the boundaries and we will apply the dff technique to directionally decompose nonlinear internal waves credit authorship contribution

23905,internal tides generated from multiple sites create complicated interference patterns often making it difficult to identify the origin direction of propagation and dissipation of individual waves to identify these constituent waves we apply a directional fourier filter dff method to analyse multimodal broad wavenumber internal wave fields found over varying topography we apply the method to data derived from both a numerical model and satellite remote sensing observations using a series of two dimensional i e x z simulations we first demonstrate the capability of the dff method to separate incoming and reflected internal tides emanating from a supercritical slope the results show the dff method requires model sampling rates of δ t t 0 15 and horizontal cell sizes of δ x λ 0 2 where t is the wave period and λ is the wavelength remote internal tides can significantly affect the generation and propagation of local internal tides in regional ocean simulations using a gridded satellite altimetry product at three globally diverse regions we demonstrate how the dff method can be used to specify the internal tide boundary conditions at the open boundaries of regional ocean models lastly we apply the dff method to a three dimensional hydrostatic numerical simulation of the southern australian north west shelf to estimate the energy decay characteristics of internal tides the energy decay length scale for offshore propagating waves from the continental slope in the model was estimated to be two mode 1 wavelengths i e 240 km in close agreement with an estimate derived from a satellite derived sea surface height anomaly keywords internal tides directional decomposition directional fourier filter energy decay remote internal tides 1 introduction three dimensional 3d numerical simulations have become one of the most important methods for investigating internal tide dynamics in the ocean and internal tides can now be modelled on a global scale e g arbic et al 2012 buijsman et al 2017 2020 savage et al 2017 satellite altimetry derived products also provide a global view of internal tide characteristics e g zhao et al 2016 zaron 2019 however the output from both model simulations and satellite products is often complicated by the presence of multiple generation sites within the domain of interest e g philippine sea southern australian north west shelf resulting in complicated wave wave interference patterns that are often difficult to interpret kerry et al 2013 gong et al 2019 important processes such as the origin propagation and dissipation of internal tides are thus often difficult to quantify while often ignored for simplicity in regional simulation models of coastal and shelf process models e g niwa and hibiya 2004 zhang et al 2011 rayson et al 2018 information about the internal tides is needed to correctly specify the open boundary conditions for these regional models to investigate complicated internal tide processes a number of approaches have been described to separate internal tides propagating in different directions the first method involves two dimensional 2d plane wave fits to either satellite altimetry data over different regions containing multiple ground tracks or regional numerical simulations e g zhao and alford 2009 zhao et al 2011 2016 2019 waterhouse et al 2018 applied this method to examine the internal tide beam in the tasman sea rainville et al 2010 and wang et al 2018c used an ideal line source method at the hawaiian ridge and in the philippine sea respectively the coupling equations for linear tides explicitly discriminate between incident and reflected waves in a 2d transect kelly et al 2013 other studies have estimated energy fluxes from continental shelf reflection of internal tides by subtracting results from a control or reference run of the simulation without topography e g klymak et al 2011 hall et al 2013 wang et al 2018a almar et al 2014 applied the radon transform method to separate the incoming and transmitted waves and obtained a root mean square error lower than 10 these different methods were generally applied in the open ocean e g zhao et al 2011 wang et al 2018c and assume that the internal tides have a weakly varying horizontal wavenumber here we propose a directional fourier filter dff method that removes the requirement to specify a horizontal wavenumber a priori the dff method is a more general version of the hilbert transform filter also called complex demodulation which was first applied to internal gravity wave data by mercier et al 2008 to decompose incident transmitted and reflected internal wave beams in a 2d i e x z laboratory experiment with a sloping bottom the hilbert transform filter was subsequently used to separate upward propagating and downward propagating near inertial waves e g winters et al 2011 grisouard and thomas 2015 and internal gravity wave beams zhou and diamessis 2013 here we revisit the hilbert transform method and extend it to a dff method to directionally decompose internal tides from gridded ocean variables model or satellite in x y space the energy of internal tides dissipates as they radiate away from a generation source from in situ observations the dissipation of the internal tide can be calculated from the energy loss between two adjacent moorings sharples et al 2001 nash et al 2012 waterhouse et al 2018 on the basis of topex poseidon altimetry internal tides can radiate energy over 2000 km in the central north pacific ray and mitchum 1996 ray and cartwright 2001 numerical simulations demonstrate that internal tides can propagate over 1500 km in the philippine sea kerry et al 2013 and 700 3000 km in the north pacific alford et al 2019 however interference from multiple internal tide sources can influence the estimation of how much tidal energy is lost over a given distance olbers et al 2020 here we apply the dff method to numerical simulations to directionally filter the propagating internal tides and hence compute the energy decay length scale in a particular direction regional ocean models are commonly used to investigate the whole life cycle of internal tides including on the australian north west shelf holloway 2001 on the california coast ponte and cornuelle 2013 and in the northern south china sea alford et al 2015 however these models can reproduce only internal tides generated by the interaction between barotropic tides with local sloping topography mazloff et al 2020 demonstrate that remote internal tide rit forcing at the boundary must be accounted for in a regional model of the california shelf region in order to obtain an accurate description of the internal tide climatology on the shelf in addition the rits at the boundaries can also significantly influence the formation of nonlinear internal waves on the shelf nash et al 2012 rogers et al 2019 here we apply the dff method to satellite altimetry derived baroclinic sea surface height amplitudes from the high resolution empirical tide hret product zaron 2019 to highlight the importance of rits to shelf internal tide studies note that the satellite altimeter captures only coherent internal tides detectable through harmonic analysis which are about 60 of the total buijsman et al 2020 however this is a global average and nelson et al 2019 found that global satellite altimetry products of s s h b c can underestimate the semidiurnal internal tide by up to 80 in the mid latitude ocean finally we apply the filtering method to a global internal tide dataset to demonstrate how to configure incoming internal tide open boundary conditions for a regional ocean model this article is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the principle of directional decomposition with the dff method and the configuration of the internal tide boundary conditions in section 3 we use a series of 2d analytical models of rightward propagating and leftward propagating sinusoidal internal tides to demonstrate the utility of the decomposition method in section 4 we use the dff method to compute incoming internal wave energy fluxes for different regional modelling studies from the literature in section 5 we apply the dff method to both a 3d regional scale model and a satellite derived product to separate the multidirectional internal tide fields into their components and also compute the energy decay length scales of the shelf generated component a 3d model with internal tide open boundary conditions extracted from satellite altimetry data is used to demonstrate the method and importance of internal tide boundary conditions in regional models conclusions are presented and further uses of the dff technique are discussed in section 6 2 theoretical framework in this section we give an overview of the dff wave separation technique for one dimensional cases in x t space and then 2d x y t space applications 2 1 x t space to introduce the concept we start with a one dimensional problem and define a variable ψ x t which represents any model variable such as sea surface height anomaly or wave induced velocity here we state the filtering processes in the following four steps i first take the discrete fourier transform in time with zero padding 1 ψ ˆ m δ x f n δ t δ t n 0 n 1 ψ m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π n f n f n 2 0 n 2 where ψ ˆ is the fourier transformed variable and δ x and δ t represent the spatial and temporal resolutions ii remove the negative frequencies double the positive frequencies and take the inverse discrete fourier transform to obtain the complex valued variable ψ 2 ψ m δ x n δ t 2 n δ t f 1 n 2 ψ ˆ m δ x f n δ t exp i 2 π n f n n 0 1 n 1 because ψ is for the positive frequency band it is multiplied by a factor of 2 to retain the same amplitude as ψ steps i and ii are hilbert transforms of the original real valued signal see mercier et al 2008 iii repeat this process in the spatial x direction by calculating the discrete fourier transform of the complex valued ψ in the wavenumber domain 3 ψ k m δ x n δ t δ x m 0 m 1 ψ m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π m k m k m 2 0 m 2 where ψ is the spatial fourier transformed variable and k is the wavenumber in the x direction note that now the positive and negative wavenumbers are different and contain information about the different propagation directions iv finally take the inverse discrete fourier transform of the positive and negative wavenumber parts to obtain the rightward propagating ψ r m δ x n δ t and leftward propagating ψ l m δ x n δ t space time components fig 1a ψ r m δ x n δ t 1 m δ x re k 1 m 2 ψ k m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π m k m m 0 1 m 1 4 ψ l m δ x n δ t 1 m δ x re k m 2 1 ψ k m δ x n δ t exp i 2 π m k m m 0 1 m 1 2 2 x y t space we generalize the dff to a 2d spatial coordinate x y to extract internal waves propagating within an arbitrary directional sector fig 1b by following the six operations below i start with a real valued signal in space x x y and time t that is ψ x t ii take the fourier transform of this signal in time to give a spatial field of complex amplitudes for each frequency ψ ˆ x ω note that this is the starting point for output from the satellite derived product hret as it provides the complex amplitudes for each harmonic note that this is different from the steps above in that we are now operating in the frequency domain iii take the fourier transform of the complex amplitudes along all spatial dimensions to give ψ k ω where k k l are horizontal wavenumbers that have both signs iv define a filter function h k which is equal to unity for the wavenumbers of interest and is zero elsewhere for example we select a sector with a lower band l a k and an upper band l b k in the wavenumber space fig 1b the filter function h k is defined as 5 h k 0 tan 1 l k θ l 1 θ l tan 1 l k θ u 0 tan 1 l k θ u where θ l and θ u are the lower and upper angle cut offs namely tan θ l a and tan θ u b v calculate the filtered harmonics ψ ˆ f x ω in space by taking the inverse fourier transform of the filtered amplitude h k ψ k ω vi finally take the inverse fourier transform of the complex ψ ˆ f x ω for each harmonic and compute their sum to give the filtered signal in space and time that is ψ f x t as an example of this general method we divide the wavenumber space into eight sectors spanning 45 fig 1c the eastward propagating wave signals are thus given as the sum of the contributions from two adjacent sectors namely h k l 0 and h k l 0 as another example if we decompose the signal into four components propagating in four quadrants northeast northwest southeast and southwest the positive and negative wavenumbers k will be spatially filtered and ψ x t is shown in fig 1d finally we note that the directional band pass filter in step iv above is an extension of the method described in zhao et al 2019 who used a band pass filter to filter out different horizontal wavenumbers in all directions their filter was designed to separate waves with different vertical modes i e horizontal wavenumber magnitude in contrast our method is designed to separate waves propagating within certain directional regions and retains all of the different vertical modes horizontal wavenumbers 2 3 set up of internal tide boundary conditions previous studies e g kerry et al 2013 mazloff et al 2020 demonstrate that it is important to include rits along the open boundaries of regional models here we present a method to configure rit forcing at regional model boundaries using a global internal tide dataset the global satellite altimetry product hret the steps are as follows i apply the dff method to the sea surface anomaly s s h b c from the hret product to obtain the phase θ s x y of the internal tides e g m 2 propagating in the direction perpendicular to the desired boundary in a region that extends at least two mode 1 wavelengths from each side of the boundary ii we assume the rits always propagate in the direction n x y perpendicular to the contours of phase θ s x y the normalized vector of the propagation direction can then be written as 6 n x y θ s x y θ s x y iii quantify the rits by s s h b c propagating in the direction of n as derived from the dff components of the hret product note s s h b c x varies along the boundary iv convert s s h b c to the vertical displacement η 0 in the ocean interior at the desired boundary via the method described by zhao et al 2016 where 7 η 0 x g s s h b c x h 0 ϕ 1 x z n 2 z d z where n is the buoyancy frequency and ϕ 1 is the vertical structure of the mode 1 eigenfunction at the boundary note that mode 1 internal tides are dominant in the hret product v the amplitude of the baroclinic velocity v b c at the boundary can then be calculated by the method described by rayson et al 2018 where 8 v b c x z c 1 x η 0 x d ϕ 1 x z d z where c 1 x is the phase speed of linear mode 1 internal tides at the boundary vi the baroclinic velocity v b c at the boundary is written as 9 v b c x z t v b c x z n x 3 application of the dff method to 2d plane waves we used an analytical case with two sinusoidal waves propagating in opposite directions to evaluate the effect of the temporal and horizontal sampling rates δ t and δ x respectively on the accuracy of the dff technique the purpose was to define the minimum temporal sampling from the numerical model output or the minimum spatial sampling from satellite derived products in order to use the dff method effectively then we used a 2d numerical model the mit general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 to simulate internal tides reflected from a supercritical slope to demonstrate the utility of the dff method for computing energy decay length scales when there are interacting internal tides 3 1 requirements of sampling rate and cell size a series of models of two analytical sinusoidal waves propagating in opposite directions was used to determine suitable temporal and spatial sampling rates to perform the dff 10 u x t u p o s k cos k x c t u n e g k cos k x c t θ the purpose here was to determine suitable model output rates particularly the temporal rate the rightward propagating wave had an amplitude u p o s k of 20 cm s 1 while the leftward propagating wave had an amplitude u n e g k ranging from 2 5 cm s 1 to 20 cm s 1 shown in table 1 k and c were set as the theoretical wavenumber and mode 1 phase speed of s 2 in a water depth of 1000 m the phase difference θ between two analytical waves was set to 0 5 π we also tested five other sensitivity cases with single direction waves including a rightward propagating case and four leftward propagating cases and compared them with the above mentioned bidirectional cases to examine the requirements of δ t and δ x we evaluated the performance of the dff method by comparing the rightward propagating component from the bidirectional cases with the rightward propagating component from single direction cases for four cases with different wave amplitudes e g posk20 negk10 in table 1 the model output interval varied from 10 min to 6 h a half tidal cycle and the horizontal cell size varied from 1 km to 50 km half the theoretical wavelength for the bidirectional cases we divided u into two parts u p o s k and u n e g k with opposite wavenumber sign for the two corresponding sensitivity cases with only single direction forcing e g single posk20 and single negk10 we defined the result as u right and u l e f t we made quantitative comparisons by calculating the relative root mean square rms velocity differences between the dff variables posk and negk and the single direction model results right and left in all cases the relative rms difference in the positive direction was smaller than 1 when δ t t 0 2 and δ x λ 0 3 fig 2a c e and g additionally the rms difference in the positive direction was smaller than 2 in most regions the rms difference in the negative direction showed some variation for the different cases in cases with comparable leftward and rightward amplitudes fig 2b and d the rms difference in the negative direction was smaller than 1 when δ t t 0 2 and δ x λ 0 2 when u n e g k was much smaller than u p o s k fig 2f and h the rms difference in the negative direction was smaller than 1 providing δ t t 0 15 and δ x λ 0 2 similarly buijsman et al 2020 demonstrate that at a minimum five cells need to be in a wavelength to resolve that mode in addition to the relative rms velocity difference we also calculated the correlation coefficient for the various cases not shown the correlation coefficients were greater than 90 when δ t t 0 2 and δ x λ 0 2 in all cases not shown in summary the dff method was able to separate the leftward propagating and rightward propagating waves if δ t t 0 15 and δ x λ 0 2 in practice this means δ t 1 8 h and δ x 20 km in our flat bottom case with s 2 internal tide forcing for a water depth of 1000 m in addition we evaluated the capability of the dff method by comparing it with the radon transform filter method almar et al 2014 and found a similar result not shown providing further evidence of the ability of the dff method to separate bidirectional waves 3 2 reflection and shoaling processes over a slope to demonstrate the utility of the dff method to diagnose reflection and shoaling processes over a slope we used a 2d mitgcm model with a domain length of 500 km a horizontal grid scale of 1000 m and imposed a 50 km wide sponge boundary condition at both lateral boundaries we only show the model results in the inner domain x 50 450 km the model had 88 vertical layers that were spaced according to a hyperbolic tangent function profile stewart et al 2017 with the layer thickness ranging from 1 m near the surface to 20 m near the seabed maximum 1000 m a 10 s time step was set to satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy conditions in both the vertical direction and the horizontal direction and the model runs were 120 h long i e 10 tidal cycles the initial stratification profile was derived from the ocean forecasting australia model oke et al 2008 fig 3 constant horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity diffusivity coefficients were used to parameterize sub grid scale turbulent dissipation and mixing processes where a h 10 m2 s 1 a v 1 0 4 m2 s 1 k h 10 m2 s 1 and k v 1 0 5 m2 s 1 legg and huijts 2006 nagai and hibiya 2015 bottom stress was parameterized by means of a quadratic drag law with c d 2 5 1 0 3 an incoming mode 1 baroclinic tide was added on the left boundary and reflected from a 2d supercritical slope to demonstrate how to compute energy fluxes with the directionally decomposed physical variables the bottom topography fig 4a followed a hyperbolic tangent function 11 h x 1 2 h 0 h s tanh x x s s 1 2 h 0 h s where h 0 is the maximum water depth and x s and h s are the location and water depth on the slope respectively the width s is configured for a supercritical slope shown in fig 4a the initial stratification was the same as described in gong et al 2019 the 2d model was driven by s 2 baroclinic tides with a small amplitude of 20 cm s 1 on the left boundary which ensured the internal tides were approximately linear across the domain snapshots of p indicated that incoming internal tides maintained a mode 1 structure as they propagated towards the slope fig 5b at t 20 h the only detectable internal tide propagated from the left boundary fig 5a c after t 40 h a reflected component was present near the top of the slope blue shading in fig 5f and by t 60 h the overall internal tide field became more complex because of the reflected components the incoming internal tide however remained linear with a mode 1 structure before reaching the slope where it scattered into higher vertical modes e g fig 5k by t 80 h the rightward propagating high mode internal tide components had dissipated and the mode 1 internal tide kept travelling rightward beyond x 360 km into shallow water fig 5k and leftward beyond x 125 km into deep water fig 5l we estimated energy decay length scales from the directionally decomposed signals by first computing the baroclinic energy flux f u p using only leftward and rightward parts 12 u u l u r p p l p r resulting in a depth integrated energy flux f ˆ composed of three parts 13 f ˆ f ˆ l f ˆ r f ˆ cross h 0 u l p l u r p r u l p r u r p l d z where f ˆ l and f ˆ r are the depth integrated leftward and rightward energy flux respectively after the model had reached a quasi steady state we time averaged each term in eq 13 over 3 days denoted by below the cross term f ˆ cross represents the energy transport associated with the linear interference of superimposed waves propagating leftward and rightward note that this differs from other definitions of the flux cross term that account for interactions between coherent and incoherent velocity and pressure signals see nash et al 2012 buijsman et al 2017 in our case the cross terms are between two identical frequencies the incident and reflected waves so there is no temporal variation large values of f ˆ cross usually occurred near the left boundary and over the slope however the magnitude of f ˆ cross was negligible compared with the other terms see fig 5m in the inner domain of the 2d numerical experiments the magnitude of the leftward offshore propagating time averaged energy flux f ˆ l decreased after being reflected over the slope and we used an energy decay length scale to quantify the internal tide energy dissipation processes we assumed the flux followed an exponential function 14 f ˆ l f ˆ max exp x 0 x l where f ˆ l represents the offshore propagating leftward energy flux at location x zhao 2017 we least squares fit eq 14 to find l from the model output energy flux decay for the region spanning from the slope x 0 250 km to the boundary of the inner domain x 50 km the maximum energy flux f ˆ max occurred at x 0 250 km and the energy decay length scale l was approximately 280 km see the blue line in fig 5o the energy decay rate in the unit of watts per square metre was inferred by assuming a balance between the energy flux divergence f ˆ l and the bulk energy decay ε i e setting the internal tide generation and the nonlinear flux divergence terms to zero 15 c f ˆ l ε 0 3 3 ability of the dff method to directionally separate multimodal internal tides the 2d plane wave fit decomposition method was developed by zhao and alford 2009 to decompose single mode internal tides with a roughly known horizontal wavelength i e in the open ocean with weakly varying water depth in zhao et al 2019 this filter method was further developed to separate mode 1 and mode 2 internal tides i e discrete prespecified horizontal wavenumbers and directions in contrast the dff method can separate multidirectional waves over varying topography in coastal regions i e shelf and slope topography and retain all of the different vertical modes to demonstrate the ability of the dff method to directionally separate multimodal internal tides over the shelf we calculated the horizontal wavenumber spectra of the complex s s h b c amplitude at the tidal forcing frequency extracted from the 2d model see section 3 2 the spectral energy levels of the positive wavenumbers black line in fig 6 were always greater than the levels of the negative wavenumbers red line in fig 6 as the internal tides lost energy during the propagation and reflection process we solved the hydrostatic shear free taylor goldstein equation gill 1982 to estimate the theoretical wavenumbers for internal tides in different modes in a water depth of z h o and z h s respectively the vertical dashed lines in fig 6 for the mode 1 internal tides in the deep basin the peaks of both the positive wavenumber spectra and the negative wavenumber spectra exceeded levels of 10 cm2 cpkm 1 suggesting mode 1 internal tides were always dominant in deep water regardless of the direction note that cpkm means cycle per kilometre for the mode 1 internal tides on the shelf there was another peak for the rightward propagating component but a significant trough for the leftward propagating component this was due to the lack of a reflected internal tide on the shelf for the mode 2 internal tide in the deep basin the spectral peak was much smaller than that for the mode 1 internal tide the mode 2 internal tide on the shelf displayed similar characteristics to the mode 1 internal tide which had a peak in the positive wavenumber spectra and a trough in the negative wavenumber spectra note also that the leftward and rightward propagating mode 3 internal tides in the basin were resolved in the spectra and were likely a signature of the internal beam emanating from the supercritical shelf break fig 6 in summary the dff method was able to directionally decompose multimodal internal tides over varying topography 4 application of the dff method to a satellite altimetry product we applied the dff method to the satellite derived product of zaron 2019 to separate the incoming and outgoing internal tide energy flux at the open boundaries of several regional model studies from recent literature the purpose here was to demonstrate the importance of rit forcing to regional internal tide dynamics 4 1 satellite altimetry product hret a new open source high resolution empirical tide hret model estimates the sea level anomaly s s h b c induced by internal tides zaron 2019 this dataset uses nearly all available exact repeated altimetry data from 1992 to 2015 to extract tidal harmonic sea surface height amplitudes including data from the topex poseidon geosat follow on jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 ers 2 envisat and saral missions it then filters the barotropic tide signal from the along track harmonics and performs a spatial interpolation to map the complex amplitudes onto a 0 05 horizontal resolution grid from 66 s to 66 n it includes four phase locked harmonics namely m 2 s 2 k 1 and o 1 and the annual modulations of m 2 denoted ma2 and mb2 near coastal regions where water depths are shallower than 200 m and regions of low signal to noise ratio are masked out of the hret model to investigate the application of the dff method to the satellite altimetry product we first considered the northeast indian ocean 104 e to 124 e 3 s to 23 s note that the temporal sampling rate criterion was not applicable to the hret data as the amplitude and phase for each harmonic were provided rather than a time series therefore we skipped the frequency filtering processes steps i and ii in section 2 2 and directly applied the spatial filter to the complex spatial variables as the cell size δ x of the hret model was 5 km the dff was able to decompose internal tides with wavelengths greater than 50 km on the basis of the wentzel kramers brillouin approximation for examples see gill 1982 pedlosky 2003 the mode 1 semidiurnal internal tide wavelength is greater than 50 km in the domain where the water depth is greater than 350 m in the northeast indian ocean a complicated horizontal distribution of s s h b c was evident in the hret data due to the standing wave patterns associated with the locally dominant m 2 internal tides fig 7a following the dff procedure in section 2 2 we decomposed the harmonic amplitudes into four propagation quadrants i e 90 directional bins we masked land regions by filling the amplitudes with zeros before applying the directional fourier transform this worked well because internal tides were weak near the land boundaries and the discontinuity of values between shallow water and land was not significant we verified the treatment of the land regions by summing the four directional components which agreed well with the original wave signal relative differences of s s h b c 1 m 2 internal tides propagated with varying amplitudes and phases offshore from four dominant generation sites in the northeast indian ocean see alternating positive and negative bands of s s h b c in fig 7b internal tides propagated a distance of approximately o 100 km from the southern australian north west shelf pilbara region and they propagated approximately o 1000 km from the northern australian north west shelf to the indonesian archipelago similarly internal tides generated in the lombok strait 116 e 9 s propagated southward through deep water for almost 1000 km with only slight energy loss and eventually reached the northern australian north west shelf fig 7e we used the method described by zhao and alford 2009 to calculate the depth averaged energy flux of the mode 1 m 2 internal tides from the satellite product hret in zhao and alford 2009 energy flux is calculated from the baroclinic sea surface height using the local water depth stratification tidal frequency local inertial frequency and mode number which is given as 16 f 1 2 h 0 u z p z d z 1 2 s s h b c 2 ρ 0 g 2 ω k 1 ω 2 f 2 h 0 π 1 2 z d z where π 1 z is the normalized mode 1 baroclinic eigenfunction for pressure p z and horizontal velocity u z see eq 7 in buijsman et al 2020 the hret inferred fluxes represent only the coherent fraction and thus the remote fluxes would be underestimated in these examples we used this method to quantify the incoming and outgoing internal tide energy flux in three different regions the australian north west shelf the california coast and the northern south china sea more examples of hret decomposition and the associated matlab dff scripts are available in the github repository https github com gongy93 dff hret 4 2 australian north west shelf the australian north west shelf is a region with ubiquitous and energetic internal waves holloway 1984 1985 jones and ivey 2017 however previous studies holloway 2001 van gastel et al 2009 numerically reproduced the internal wave field of the australian north west shelf with a limited spatial model domain excluding the indonesian region to the north or the exmouth plateau to the west holloway 2001 used the princeton ocean model to investigate the internal tide generation by the continental shelf topography shown as a black rectangle in fig 8 by forcing the model open boundaries with only the m 2 barotropic tides here we computed the energy flux derived from the hret in four directions fig 8 the high value locations occurred mainly over critical topography i e continental slopes and shelves and ridges in the deeper ocean for example there was a large energy flux over the continental slope where tidal beams have previously been reported fig 8a and a large energy flux was located in a water depth of 500 m near the lombok strait another generation site fig 8c holloway 2001 predicted the m 2 internal tides produced 1 01 gw boundary averaged 652 w m 1 of energy flux going northwest through the offshore boundary of the model which ran roughly parallel with the continental shelf break the northwestern m 2 energy flux from the hret product was 0 77 gw 499 w m 1 fig 8a which was smaller than the estimate of holloway 2001 with a model forced only with the local barotropic tides at the southwestern boundary the northeastern and southwestern energy fluxes from hret were 61 3 mw 101 w m 1 and 28 4 mw 47 w m 1 respectively yielding a net incoming flux of about 33 mw 54 w m 1 fig 8b and c the exmouth plateau was notably absent from the domain of holloway 2001 but it was subsequently shown to be a prominent generation site of internal tides on the lower australian north west shelf by gong et al 2019 as described by kelly and nash 2010 buijsman et al 2010 and gong et al 2019 rits not only influence the interference patterns of propagating internal tides but also significantly influence the local barotropic to baroclinic conversion by altering the pressure perturbation near generation sites p we therefore implemented a 3d numerical model in this region and compared the results with the satellite altimetry results in section 5 4 3 california coast a recent study of the california coast by mazloff et al 2020 concluded that a regional model without remote internal wave forcing was unable to reproduce the internal tides on the shelf when compared with a global internal tide resolving model mazloff et al 2020 compared the energy flux at the boundaries from two regional models mitgcm and the regional ocean modelling system with a global mitgcm model their regional models suggested that there was a net flux from the model domain of 70 mw 60 mw and 52 mw 50 w m 1 50 w m 1 and 37 w m 1 through the northern western and southern boundaries respectively in contrast the global model showed the region was an internal wave energy sink with an outgoing 337 mw 241 w m 1 incoming 227 mw 189 w m 1 and incoming 649 mw 464 w m 1 crossing the domain at the northern western and southern boundaries respectively to quantify the energy flux of m 2 internal tides going both in and out of this californian shelf region we selected the same domain as mazloff et al 2020 shown in fig 9 and directionally decomposed the hret data into four components propagating northward southward westward and eastward via the dff method described in section 2 2 the net energy fluxes at the boundaries were outgoing 126 mw 90 w m 1 incoming 21 mw 18 w m 1 and outgoing 95 mw 68 w m 1 at the northern western and southern boundaries respectively these fluxes differ by an order of magnitude to the fluxes computed by mazloff et al 2020 note that the global mitgcm solution used by mazloff et al 2020 overestimates the tidal energy because of errors in the model yu et al 2019 and the hret likely underestimates the fluxes because it contains only the stationary phase locked portion of the signal 4 4 northern south china sea the northern south china sea is another well studied region with energetic internal waves e g simmons et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 buijsman et al 2012 alford et al 2015 these numerical studies reproduced the internal waves generated in the luzon strait by forcing the model with only barotropic tides however kerry et al 2013 ran a regional ocean modelling system model including the luzon strait and mariana arc generation sites and concluded the local conversion and propagation patterns of internal tides in the luzon strait can be greatly altered in the presence of remotely generated internal tide flux from the mariana arc we therefore examined this region to estimate the effects of rits fig 10 jan et al 2008 suggested approximately 2 0 gw 4 0 kw m 1 energy flux of m 2 internal tides propagated eastward from the eastern ridge in the luzon strait however our decomposed hret results showed only 815 mw 1 63 kw m 1 of m 2 energy flux left the domain at the eastern boundary which indicated either strong tidal energy decay of the waves after radiating from the generation site in the luzon strait or the scattering of tidal frequency energy to higher harmonics due to nonlinear steepening buijsman et al 2010 additionally 268 mw 536 w m 1 of energy flux entered the eastern boundary likely from the mariana arc at the western boundary the incoming energy flux 184 mw 368 w m 1 was greater than the outgoing energy flux 104 mw 208 w m 1 as internal tides originating from the xisha islands propagated eastward liang et al 2019 incoming internal tides at the northern and southern boundaries were also nonnegligible fig 10a and c in summary we have demonstrated that remotely generated internal tides can make a significant contribution at the boundaries of regional model domains at three different geographic locations suggesting it is often necessary to use incoming internal tides at the boundaries of regional models 5 application of the dff method to 3d regional models as discussed in section 4 internal tide forcing is important for the boundary conditions in a regional model here we apply the dff method to quantify the importance of rits at the offshore boundary in a 3d numerical model as an example we used a model in the pilbara region on the australian north west shelf one of many regions globally where internal tides from multiple generation sites interfere with each other gong et al 2019 we further evaluated the role of rits by comparing two simulations one with and one without rit boundary forcing see section 5 3 we simplified the tidal forcing by using a single harmonic in both cases and not including any atmospheric forcing 5 1 3d hydrostatic mitgcm model we implemented a 3d hydrostatic mitgcm model to investigate the energy decay of offshore propagating internal tides in the pilbara region 110 n to 118 5 n 17 s to 24 s by forcing the model with only barotropic tides and compared it with the hret product we also used the model to demonstrate the effects of adding remotely generated baroclinic tidal forcing along the open boundaries as discussed in section 5 3 we used geoscience australia bathymetry data with a horizontal resolution of 250 m the horizontal grid spacing was 1000 m in both the longitudinal direction and the latitudinal direction the model domain consisted of 888 630 grid cells there were 138 layers in the vertical direction ranging from 1 m near the surface to 100 m on the bottom horizontally uniform density and stratification profiles were derived from the ocean forecasting australia model fig 2a and b by temporally and spatially averaging output from april 2012 as semidiurnal barotropic tides are dominant in the pilbara region the model was driven by m 2 tides only on the boundaries with values taken from the oregon state university topex poseidon solution tpxo8 atlas data with 1 30 resolution egbert and erofeeva 2002 a 50 km wide sponge layer was imposed on each lateral boundary to absorb internal tides and avoid reflection back to the inner region the model results were analysed after 10 days once equilibrium had been reached more details of the model configuration can be found in gong et al 2019 5 1 1 baroclinic sea surface height the baroclinic sea surface height s s h b c was given by 17 s s h b c x y p x y z 0 ρ c g where ρ c is the reference density g is the gravitational acceleration and p x y z 0 is the surface pressure perturbation which is extracted from the numerical model for direct comparison with the satellite altimetry derived internal tide amplitude decay estimates the m 2 internal tide dynamics on the australian north west shelf consist of standing wave patterns in deep water 114 e 19 s fig 11a and gong et al 2019 we therefore used the dff method to separate s s h b c into four components ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ 3 and ψ 4 corresponding to the compass quadrant directions in x y space see section 2 2 alternating positive and negative bands of the northeast component ψ 1 indicated m 2 internal tides were generated at the western portion of the exmouth plateau fig 11c and propagated northeast as found by gong et al 2019 after propagating 200 km the internal tide amplitude decreased and we examine this process of energy decay in section 5 2 the two continental slope locations also generated offshore propagating northeast internal tides marked as regions b and c in fig 11b the banded pattern of s s h b c indicated the slope generated internal tides propagated offshore in the northeast quadrant as suggested by the numerical model results of van gastel et al 2009 note that internal tides from region c propagated only a short distance 150 km before they were absorbed by the sponge boundary region d generated a relatively weak offshore propagating internal tide fig 11b the interference between internal tides from regions b and d became obvious at the location green dashed box in fig 11b offshore of the respective generations sites internal tides from the western portion of the exmouth plateau also propagated shoreward as seen in the southwest component ψ 3 fig 11d a source of internal tides from region b was also highlighted in the southwest component although the magnitude of s s h b c was smaller than that of the northwest component fig 11b compared with the offshore propagating internal tides from region c the inshore internal tides were much weaker shown in fig 11e the wavelengths became shorter as the internal tides propagated inshore from water depths of 1000 m to 100 m highlighting the ability of the dff method to decompose directions for a broad spectrum of horizontal wavenumbers this is in contrast to the 2d plane wave fitting method zhao et al 2016 2019 which explicitly specifies wavenumbers and hence is of limited use in regions such as this with highly variable water depths 5 1 2 energy flux the baroclinic velocity u and pressure fields p from the 3d model were divided into four components northwest northeast southwest and southeast and used to compute energy fluxes see eq 13 for the calculation with 2d model data for each layer of the 3d model output we decomposed the tidal energy flux into five components and then depth integrated them to obtain 18 f ˆ f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 f ˆ 3 f ˆ 4 f ˆ cross where f ˆ represents h 0 f d z the resulting horizontal distribution of the total energy flux f ˆ illustrated the complicated internal tide climatology due to the multiple generation sites fig 12a the energy flux showed internal tides propagating from different locations and their interference cross term similar to the baroclinic sea surface height fig 11 the fate of the internal tides propagating northeast from the western portion of the exmouth plateau was difficult to determine from the total energy flux f ˆ the largest energy flux occurred in regions b and c over the continental slope where fluxes reached 2 0 kw m 1 the dff method separated internal tides propagating from multiple generation sites fig 12c f the energy flux magnitude of offshore propagating internal tides from region b decayed from 1 0 kw m 1 close to the generation site to 0 3 kw m 1 near the northern boundary a distance of roughly 200 km fig 12c in addition offshore propagating and onshore propagating components from region c had energy flux magnitudes of 1 5 kw m 1 and 1 3 kw m 1 respectively fig 12c and f in contrast internal tides propagating northeast and southwest from the western portion of the exmouth plateau region a had a relatively small energy flux 0 5 kw m 1 fig 12d and e the cross terms in eq 18 highlighted regions where there was interference between internal tides generated from multiple sources fig 12b the cross terms are between two identical frequencies so there is no temporal variation which differs from a broad frequency spectrum of internal waves interacting see nash et al 2012 buijsman et al 2017 the large values as much as 1 0 kw m 1 of f ˆ cross were comparable to the values of other terms particularly between regions a and b suggesting there was significant interference between the internal tides from region a and the continental slope in region b the cross flux term suggested that remote internal tides were likely to significantly alter the energy flux at single mooring stations in time which has been observed in the ocean e g alford et al 2007 rayson et al 2012 the nearby location of region c on the continental slope was another hotspot of internal tide interference 5 2 energy decay length scale the propagation distance of an internal tide is an important quantity as it can be used to infer energy decay rates due to turbulent dissipation and hence potentially mixing kerry et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the energy decay was revealed in the directionally decomposed signal from the satellite altimetry product section 4 note that only stationary internal tides are extracted from the satellite altimetry using harmonic analysis we compared the energy decay produced in the 3d mitgcm model with the satellite derived hret energy decay in the mitgcm model we first quantified the decrease in internal tide energy from the generation site region b towards the deep basin fig 12c by estimating the energy decay length scale l for the northwest component ψ 2 using eq 13 we selected several parallel transects between the two dashed red lines shown in fig 12c and e to calculate the offshore propagating component f ˆ 2 fig 13a the magnitude of f ˆ 2 decreased monotonically focusing on the inner domain x 80 358 km and excluding the model sponge boundary where the baroclinic energy was absorbed we estimated the energy decay length scale following the same exponential fitting method as described in section 3 2 the maximum energy flux f ˆ max occurred at x 0 80 km and the energy decay length scale l was 240 km which suggested that the internal tides lost 60 of their energy within this distance i e two mode 1 wavelengths resulting in a bulk energy decay rate of approximately o 10 3 w m 2 in addition the simulation revealed that the energy flux decayed more rapidly near the generation sites than in the far field in agreement with laboratory experiments wang et al 2018b next we calculated the divergence of the energy flux f ˆ 2 along the red line in fig 13c noting that f ˆ 2 was negative around x 200 km indicating a potential generation site we then extracted the hret dataset for the northeast indian ocean region covering our mitgcm domain blue box in fig 7a to compare the offshore propagating internal tide energy decay internal tides were observed on the western portion of the exmouth plateau and propagated northeast and southwest fig 7c and d respectively in agreement with the mitgcm results note that onshore propagating internal tides fig 7e were not resolved by the satellite product due to depth limitations so we were not able to compare the tides in the shelf region with the mitgcm results as the mitgcm model did not include rit forcing on the outer boundary of the computational domain we focused only on the offshore propagating internal tide in terms of the energy flux from the satellite product hret large offshore energy fluxes fig 13b occurred near the continental slope consistent with the mitgcm results fig 13a and at x 80 km in fig 13c there was a peak energy flux 1 3 kw m 1 region near region b fig 12a in the mitgcm that did not occur in the hret probably due to high mode internal tides dissipating rapidly in the mitgcm that were not resolved by hret we estimated the offshore propagating energy flux f ˆ 2 using parallel transects between the two dashed red lines in fig 13a least squares fit the exponential decay function eq 14 and obtained an energy decay length scale l of 249 km this is in good agreement with the length scale calculated from the mitgcm solution 240 km in addition the spatial variations in flux divergence f ˆ 2 were similar to the mitgcm solution with a negative value occurring at x 200 km the two examples demonstrate the utility of the dff method to isolate the decaying signal and the close agreement hints at the reason for the internal tide energy loss three potential reasons can lead to a loss of internal tide energy including frequency smearing due to doppler shifting by the background flow transfer of energy to other frequencies due to nonlinear interactions or turbulent dissipation we can rule out doppler shifting because the mitgcm was forced with a single harmonic and included no background flow we cannot eliminate nonlinear interactions in the mitgcm other than noting that the forcing was monochromatic and the wave amplitudes were not extremely large therefore the agreement of the decay length scale derived from the two independent data sources suggests that the decay of the hret signal is likely due to turbulent dissipation in this region 5 3 internal tide open boundary forcing to demonstrate the use of the dff method for determining the rit boundary forcing set up section 2 3 we ran the 3d mitgcm model in the pilbara region with the incoming internal tides specified along the boundary conditions 3d withrits there were two offshore boundaries in this regional simulation a northern and a western boundary the southward propagating m 2 tidal energy flux at the northern boundary was approximately five times the magnitude of the eastward propagating m 2 tidal energy flux at the western boundary in the pilbara model fig 8 we therefore focused on the southward propagating m 2 internal tides at the northern boundary and first computed the phase of these southward propagating internal tides step i in section 2 3 fig 14a and hence obtained their propagation direction vector n at the northern boundary step ii in section 2 3 fig 14b the magnitude of the southward propagating s s h b c at the northern boundary was then extracted step iii in section 2 3 fig 14c note that the projection of v b c perpendicular to the northern boundary was dominant fig 14b and was used as the rit boundary condition the model might slightly underestimate the remote internal tide energy without the orthogonal components as discussed by nelson et al 2019 the global satellite altimetry s s h b c data does not capture the nonstationary component and hence they can underestimate the semidiurnal internal tide by approximately 80 in the mid latitude ocean to compensate for this we multiplied v b c by a factor of 2 to obtain more realistic semidiurnal signals fig 14d as southward propagating internal tides were added at the northern boundary the primary effect on local internal tide climatology in the domain will be in the southward direction we therefore used the dff method to extract the southward components of m 2 internal tides fig 15 from the two mitgcm cases firstly with the inclusion of rits 3d withrits and secondly without the inclusion of rits 3d norits for s s h b c the maximum amplitude difference between the two cases was 1 5 cm 50 in the areas close to the northern boundary additionally the phase of the southward component of s s h b c was significantly different in the two cases particularly near the northern boundary see fig 15b the phase difference reached up to 90 on the continental slope where internal tides were generated by the barotropic tide therefore both the amplitude and the phase of the barotropic to baroclinic conversion rates over the shelf were significantly affected by rits at the boundary to quantify the effect of adding rits at the northern boundary we computed the area integrated conversion rates in four regions marked in fig 15a previously identified as the key local generation sites gong et al 2019 area integrated conversion rates in regions a and b did not show large differences between the two cases 3d norits versus 3d withrits in particular 199 0 mw versus 190 3 mw in region a and 208 6 mw versus 206 7 mw in region b both of these generation sites are relatively far from the northern boundary and the rits lost most of their energy before they arrived in either region a or region b see stripes in fig 7d in contrast regions c1 and c2 are closer to the northern boundary but they were affected inversely by the presence of rits table 2 because these two regions were located in the path of rit beams see fig 7e because of the internal tide boundary forcing there was a 4 7 decrease in the conversion rate decrease of 9 7 mw from 206 1 mw in region c1 and a 10 6 increase in the conversion rate increase of 20 7 mw from 195 6 mw in region c2 the decreases in the integrated conversion rates due to the presence of the rits were the result of the phase difference between the rits and local barotropic tides resulting in destructive interference e g gong et al 2019 in summary inclusion of the internal tide forcing at the boundary of a regional model was important for both the generation and the propagation of local internal tides as well as the net energy fluxes in the regional model domain 6 summary and conclusions we have demonstrated the utility of the dff method for directionally decomposing internal tide signals from both 2d and 3d numerical models of stratified tidal flow over supercritical topography and also from satellite altimetry data the dff method optimally separated internal tides propagating in two directions when the normalized sampling rate δ t t 0 15 and the normalized horizontal cell size δ x λ 0 2 in 2d numerical solutions incoming and reflected internal tides were completely decomposed demonstrating the capability of the dff technique the wavenumber spectra of the complex s s h b c demonstrated the ability of the dff method to directionally decompose multimodal internal tides over regions with varying topography the offshore energy decay length scale e folding length was estimated to be two mode 1 wavelengths i e 240 250 km from the continental slope generation region on the australian north west shelf both in the 3d mitgcm model and in the satellite data product hret this consistency suggests that satellite derived directionally decomposed internal wave energy dynamics could inform the parameterization of internal tide dissipation within global ocean models that do not resolve internal tides at least at sites where internal tides are coherent e g zhao et al 2016 the cross term contributions to energy flux demonstrated the wave wave interference patterns resulting from internal tides propagating in different directions the dff is a useful tool for extracting information about internal tides propagating in different directions in complicated wave fields the technique allows quantification of important processes such as internal wave dissipation we plan to extend the directional decomposition method and compute the energy decay length or time scales for individual modes as per vic et al 2019 and de lavergne et al 2019 such a decomposition would help quantify whether energy decay of low modes is due to wave scattering or physical turbulent dissipation the dff technique also stresses the importance of specifying incoming internal tides at the boundaries in regional models an important but often neglected process the application of the dff method to the satellite derived product hret helps to determine whether stationary rits are required at the boundaries of a regional model we note that the hret product cannot be used to define nonstationary rit boundary conditions the dff also represents a method for defining incoming boundary velocities from internal tides using either hret or a global ocean model in a future study we will examine the role of rit forcing in generating nonlinear internal waves on the shelf by implementing a nonhydrostatic model with rits at the boundaries and we will apply the dff technique to directionally decompose nonlinear internal waves credit authorship contribution

23906,in recent years high resolution global ocean circulation models have begun to include astronomical tidal forcing to concurrently simulate ocean circulation barotropic and internal tides the inclusion of tides is of great significance for understanding three dimensional 3 d ocean mixing and developing internal tide prediction however due to uncertainty in topography and damping terms improper representation of the self attraction and loading term barotropic tidal estimate cannot match that in the data constrained barotropic tidal model in this study the tpxo8 data are assimilated to optimize the tides embedded in a global 9 km 3 d general circulation model of mitgcm as follows for each time step of the mitgcm the previous 25 hour averaged sea surface height ssh is subtracted from the instantaneous ssh to obtain the mitgcm surface tidal elevation then the difference of surface tidal elevation between the mitgcm and tpxo8 together with a damping coefficient acts as an additional term for the right hand side of the ssh equation in order to correct the ssh field results show that the global m 2 k 1 error of the corrected surface tidal elevation relative to the tpxo8 reaches 2 12 cm 0 89 cm compared with tide gauge data the accuracy of surface tidal elevation after using the correction scheme is almost the same as that of tpxo8 for all areas except for some continental shelf and coastal areas the internal tidal signals are subsequently improved compared to the along track altimetry and tao observations compared to previous tidal assimilation scheme the implementation of the correction scheme used in this study is simple and more suitable for realistic applications keywords high resolution model internal tide tidal assimilation 1 introduction a number of scientific topics can be addressed using a high resolution global model that can simultaneously simulate oceanic general circulations mesoscale eddies and barotropic and internal tides for example it can be used for understanding higher frequency motions analyzing ocean tidal mixing and interactions between tides and low frequency motions developing the prediction of internal tides arbic et al 2012 2018 müller et al 2012 2015 ansong et al 2015 2017 rocha et al 2016a b buijsman et al 2016 wang et al 2016 savage et al 2017a b the first global three dimensional 3 d high resolution general circulation model gcm that can simulate internal tides is the hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model with a horizontal resolution of 1 12 5 driven by simultaneously atmospheric and astronomical tidal forcing arbic et al 2010 it included parameterized topographic internal wave drag and self attraction and loading to improve tidal precision in the model the atmospheric forcing sets up the background large scale circulation and stratification and the astronomical tidal forcing produces internal tides via barotropic tidal flows over topography since then a small but growing number of wind plus tides simulations has been done in global 3 d high resolution 1 10 or finer models such as the german stormtide model müller et al 2012 and the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm rocha et al 2016a b the concurrent atmospheric and tidal forcing will become increasingly common in global eddy resolving ocean models in the future arbic et al 2018 the tidal elevation accuracy in the above mentioned ocean models is comparable to that in the other non assimilative shallow water tide models but does not yet match that in the data assimilated barotropic tidal models stammer et al 2014 ngodock et al 2016 results showed that this might be caused by model resolution improper representation of the self attraction and loading sal term inaccurate bathymetry and parameterized internal wave drag for example arbic et al 2010 and shriver et al 2012 used a so called scalar approximation to represent sal term in early hycom simulations which is simple and has low computational cost relative to the full sal of hendershott 1972 and ray 1998 employing internal wave drag in baroclinic tide models is more complex due to the following reasons first whether one should parameterize internal wave damping in a high resolution model that resolves some of the internal wave spectrum is controversial some modeling experts argued that using internal wave drag parameterization in the model that resolves the spectrum constitutes can lead to double counting some researchers insisted that numerical models cannot resolve the actual breaking of internal tides and therefore require the damping of low mode internal tides to make up for this deficiency arbic et al 2004 2010 ansong et al 2015 buijsman et al 2015 2016 second even if it is necessary to employ the internal wave damping term the current parameterization schemes are still imperfect in the real ocean internal tide loses its energy by a variety of mechanisms including upper ocean wave wave interactions interaction between mean flow and eddies and scattering into higher vertical modes and dissipation by bottom friction on continental shelves for simplicity the early hycom employed a coarse resolution topographic internal wave drag based upon garner 2005 while no parameterization of internal wave damping was employed in the mitgcm tide simulations rocha et al 2016a b more recent hycom simulations used a rigorous iterated sal and a tuned high resolution jsl jayne and laurent 2001 wave drag instead of the approximate scalar sal and coarse resolution topographic internal wave drags ngodock et al 2016 although these changes resulted in some improvements in the barotropic tides errors are still greater than those of the data assimilated tide models as a result data assimilation provides a way to improve the simulation accuracy of the tides embedded in a fully nonlinear ocean general circulation model the schemes of assimilating tide observations into a hydrodynamic barotropic tide model have received much attention egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 lyard et al 2006 stammer et al 2014 taguchi et al 2014 but they cannot be applied directly to 3 d hydrodynamic models niwa and hibiya 2001 used the nudging technique to assimilate surface tidal elevation obtained from a global barotropic tide model into a 3 d hydrodynamic model but the hydrodynamic model only included realistic bottom topography average density stratification and tidal forcing it did not consider realistic temperature and salinity structures and atmospheric forcing ngodock et al 2016 suggested another tide assimilation scheme for a fully 3 d hycom which concurrently simulated barotropic and internal tide fields with the ocean circulation they assumed that the cumulative effects of error sources mentioned above can be represented by a single forcing correction term and used an augmented state ensemble kalman filter to gain an optimal estimate of the forcing correction term results indicated that this dynamic correct can significantly improve the accuracy of the tides in the hycom in this study we use this idea for reference and add a simple correction term to the right hand side of sea surface height ssh equation in the high resolution global ocean circulation model of mitgcm to optimize tidal simulation this paper is organized as follows the data are described in section 2 the model and method are described in sections 3 and 4 respectively we describe experiment setup used to conduct the application of the correction scheme in section 5 results of experiments are analyzed in section 6 conclusion and discussion are presented in section 7 2 data the harmonic constants amplitude and phase of the tpxo8 atlas are extracted from the tidal solutions elevation plus barotropic current produced by using the representer based variational scheme to assimilate altimetry and other data into a global shallow water model egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 the tpxo8 atlas with the resolution of 1 30 is used to generate surface tidal elevation to constrain the mitgcm three tidal gauge data sets in stammer et al 2014 are used one in deep water one in shelf water and shallow seas and one along coastlines of continents the 25 year 1992 2016 along track topex poseidon and jason satellite altimetry data are also used in this study the tao observations are used to validate internal tide which are made freely available by the noaa ndbc and can be downloaded through the website https www pmel noaa gov tao drupal disdel 3 model the ocean model used in this study is the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 which solves the 3 d primitive equations with the implicit linear free surface under the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations the model domain covers the globe it employs a cube sphere grid projection which permits a relatively even grid spacing throughout the model domain and avoids polar singularities adcroft et al 2004 each face of the cube comprises 1020 by 1020 grid cells for a mean horizontal grid spacing of 9 km the model has 50 vertical levels ranging in thickness from 10 m near the surface to approximately 450 m at the maximum model depth of 6150 m the topography comes from the general bathymetric chart of the ocean gebco08 bathymetry data with the high resolution of 30 arc seconds the atmospheric forcing is from the japanese 25 year reanalysis jra 25 including surface air temperature specific humidity precipitation 10 m wind velocity downward longwave and shortwave radiation the wind stress over the ocean is calculated following the bulk formulas of large and pond 1981 for runoff the seasonal climatology from fekete et al 2002 is used the model only employs the quadratic bottom boundary layer drag and does not include any parameterized topographic internal wave drag term the governing equations are as follows 1 d v h d t f k v h h p g h η η e q f 2 η t h z fixed η v h d z p e r β η tpxo η model

hendershott 1972 arbic et al 2004 4 methodology niwa and hibiya 2001 directly modified the modeled surface tidal elevation at each point deeper than 3000 m at the end of each time step using the difference between modeled surface tidal elevation and barotropic tidal elevation with a factor i e η model t i d e new η model t i d e β η t p x o η model t i d e in this study the difference β η t p x o η model t i d e is introduced on the right hand side of the ssh equation eq 2 as a correction term η t p x o is the barotropic tidal elevation calculated by the tidal prediction scheme based on the tpxo8 harmonic constants pawlowicz et al 2002 η model t i d e is the modeled surface tidal elevation at time t computed as follows first we compute the 25 h average of the modeled surface elevation during the previous 25 h for the mitgcm the time step is 1 min thus 25 h include 1500 time steps then η model t i d e is obtained by subtracting the 25 h averaged value from the instantaneous surface elevation at current time t this process can roughly extract the tidal signal and give the modeled surface tidal elevation at time t arbic et al 2010 β is the coefficient controlling the effect of the correction term note that only the smallest possible value of β should be assumed if ssh is overly constrained say by assigning β 1 00 ocean surface effects of underlying internal tides cannot be retained in the model result in niwa and hibiya 2001 β 0 25 here the four experiments with β 0 06 0 12 0 25 and 1 00 are respectively carried out to analyze the sensitivity to β all the experiments are the same except for the β value the initial field comes from the model result without the tidal assimilation on january 1 2011 all experiments are forced by the atmospheric forcing from the jra 25 during january 2011 fig 1 shows the time series of the rms error of global surface tidal elevation with respect to tpxo8 in β 0 12 experiment which is the square root of the spatial mean of η t p x o η model t i d e 2 the error tends to be stationary after about several days of the assimilation which means that the assimilation solution can converge rapidly to the observation at the same time the rms error decreases from 0 0294 to 0 018 m when β increases from 0 06 to 1 00 table 1 the m 2 amplitude along 130 46 e for each experiment is shown in fig 2 whose small scale perturbation represents the underlying internal tides effect obviously the perturbations are weakened with the increase of β when β increases to 1 00 the amplitude curve is almost as smooth as that of the tpxo8 so considering the two factors of the internal tide effect and tidal precision β is set to 0 12 in this study in addition we analyzed the sensitivity of model results to the time window of filtering out tides here five experiments with the 22 23 24 25 and 26 h windows are respectively carried out their initial fields and atmospheric forcing are the same as that used in above mentioned four experiments all the experiments are the same except for different time window the m 2 amplitude of the surface tidal elevation along 130 46 e for different experiments is shown in fig 3 their averages in the 22 23 24 25 and 26 h experiments are 0 48 0 49 0 51 0 53 and 0 55 cm respectively because the result in the 25 h experiment is the closest to the tpxo8 it is reasonable to set the time window as 25 h in this study 5 experiment setup the mitgcm is first initialized using the january climatology of woa13 world ocean atlas 2013 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 and forced by the climatological atmospheric forcing from the jra 25 then the model is integrated for 10 years to generate the initial condition for the following experiments in this study we designed two experiments with the same initial condition integration period i e two years from january 1 2010 to december 31 2011 tidal forcing term and atmospheric forcing from the jra 25 one is the experiment named simulation without the correction term and the other is the experiment named assimilation with the correction term for simplicity both experiments use the largest amplitude semidiurnal constituent m 2 and diurnal constituent k 1 to compute surface tidal elevation for the analysis of model results it is desirable to save information hourly however due to the high vertical and horizontal resolutions of the mitgcm we save the global hourly 2 d ssh output for the two years but only save the global hourly 3 d fields for two months of january february 2011 fig 4 shows snapshots of ssh and steric ssh in the northwest pacific in the assimilation experiment the ssh in fig 4a is dominated by the large scale barotropic tides the eddying general circulations feature smaller horizontal scales and are easily discernible in fig 4b internal tides are also visible as small scale speckled patterns in the steric plot of fig 4b the meso and gyre scale general circulation features are removed in the global map of differences between two steric height fields 6h apart fig 5 instead we can more clearly see internal tide signals which show up as beams as in previous hycom results arbic et al 2010 so these results demonstrate the coexistence of general ocean circulations eddies barotropic tides and internal tides in the mitgcm simulation 6 results in this section we analyze the differences between the two experiments and the impact of the correction term on the accuracy of barotropical and internal tides using the data from the tpxo8 tide gauges altimeter and mooring buoy 6 1 comparison with tpxo8 atlas based on the time series of modeled hourly ssh during jan 1 st to dec 31 th 2011 the amplitudes and phases of m 2 and k 1 at each model grid can be obtained using the standard harmonic analysis method foreman 1977 figs 6 and 7 show the amplitude and phase of the tpxo8 the simulation and assimilation experiments for m 2 and k 1 respectively the tide induced internal wave i e the internal tidal wave results in small horizontal scale perturbations to the amplitudes and phases in the two experiments results of the simulation experiment are noticeably different with those of tpxo8 which might be caused by the absence of the sal and topography wave drag in the mitgcm the amplitude and phase in the assimilation experiment are significantly improved over the simulation experiment and are very similar to those of the tpxo8 especially in the southern ocean where the early hycom did not perform well arbic et al 2010 shriver et al 2012 this demonstrates the correction term can well constrain the surface tidal elevation of mitgcm to that of tpxo8 although results might be significantly improved by ameliorating model bathymetry sal and topographic internal wave drag scheme ngodock et al 2016 these processes make the calculation more complicated first we need to tune the drag scheme to minimize the elevation error which is time consuming second applying them to a high resolution 3 d global ocean model requires high computational cost moreover even if these changes can reduce the tidal error the error level is still much greater than that in the data assimilated tide models stammer et al 2014 in contrast the correction scheme used in this study can not only significantly improve the tidal accuracy but also be easily implemented to quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two experiments we use the rms error of m 2 k 1 surface tidal elevation at each grid given by a t p x cos ω t ϕ t p x a model cos ω t ϕ model 2 1 2 where the overbar is computed over one full cycle of the constituent in question e g ω t varying from 0 to 2 π a is amplitude ω is frequency t is time ϕ denotes phase subscript model denotes the value in each experiment subscript tpx denotes the tpxo8 value just as shown in figs 8 and 9 the rms errors in the assimilation experiment are significantly lower than those in the simulation experiment at the same time two measures describing the error in a specified region are also computed one is the rms error in a specified region where the overbar means it is calculated over one full cycle of the constituent in question as well as over the grid points in the specified region the other is the median rms error which is the spatial median of the rms errors at all grid points of the specified region the median rms error can remove the impact of outliers table 2 gives the rms and median rms errors of m 2 and k 1 for the globe 66 s 66 n and southern ocean south of 66 s the error in the southern ocean is larger than that in the global ocean which is consistent with figs 8 and 9 due to the existence of some outliers figs 8 and 9 the median rms errors are smaller than the rms errors thus we use the median rms errors to compare the performance of two experiments with the introduction of the correction term the median rms error of m 2 k 1 for the global ocean can be reduced by 96 3 93 7 i e from 21 77 cm 5 67 cm to 0 81 cm 0 36 cm for the southern ocean the median rms error of m 2 k 1 can be reduced by 97 9 94 2 i e from 36 01 cm 14 4 cm to 0 74 cm 0 84 cm here the m 2 median global rms error in the assimilation experiment is lower than that in the data assimilated hycom described in ngodock et al 2016 whose minimum is 1 7 cm 6 2 comparison with tide gauge data in this subsection we use tide gauge data in stammer et al 2014 to perform an evaluation of the two experiments these data consist of harmonic constants from 151 stations in deep oceans 195 stations in shelf waters and shallow seas and 56 stations along coastlines of continents of the 195 stations in shelf waters and shallow seas 76 are on the northwest european shelf and 119 are elsewhere tide signal and rms error at each station are respectively calculated as follows 7 a station cos ω t ϕ station 2 1 2 8 a station cos ω t ϕ station a model t p x cos ω t ϕ model t p x 2 1 2 where the overbar represents an average over one full cycle of the constituent in question e g ω t varying from 0 to 2 π subscript station denotes the station value subscript model tpx denotes an experiment or tpxo8 value at each station tidal constants from the models tpxo8 are interpolated to the station location using bilinear interpolation for coastal tide gauges some station locations were deemed by the models tpxo8 to be land and a small amount of extrapolation was necessary to obtain valid model tpxo8 amplitude and phase the errors of the simulation experiment are large in coastal areas or in areas with large tidal signals fig 10 when the correction term is added the error decreases obviously and is very close to that of tpxo8 except for a few coastal stations we compute the time and station averaged rms errors for deep oceans european shelf shelves elsewhere and coastal areas using 8 where the overbar represents an average over one full cycle of the constituent as well as over all the station locations table 3 just as in stammer et al 2014 median rms errors in coastal areas are given to prevent one or two poor stations from dominating the statistical result the rms error of tpxo8 in deep oceans is the same as that in stammer et al 2014 tpxo8 errors in the remainder area are slightly different from the results of stammer et al 2014 one reason is that stammer et al 2014 rejected the tide gauges in a location where the good observation should have been made by altimetry and yet models differed unusually from gauge estimates but we do not consider this another reason is that the extrapolation method used in coastal areas is different from that in stammer et al 2014 however in general the error level of tpxo8 obtained in this study is similar to that in stammer et al 2014 although the error in the simulation experiment is very large the error decreases sharply after assimilating the tpxo8 so that rms errors in the assimilation experiment are close to the level of the tpxo8 for all areas except for the european shelf large errors are mainly concentrated in the continental shelf areas around the united kingdom and ireland fig 11 which are characterized by complex topography and strong tide signals 6 3 comparison with along track satellite altimeter data in this subsection we compare the sea surface internal tide signals simulated by the mitgcm to those in along track satellite altimeter data east of the philippines and hawaii which are hot spots for generating semidiurnal internal tides shriver et al 2012 we focus on the m 2 internal tide the 25 year 1992 2016 along track topex poseidon and jason satellite altimetry data are used to estimate the amplitude and phase of the altimetric m 2 tide using the standard harmonic analysis method fig 12 shows the altimeter tracks used in the comparison where the red curve represents the 8th track we interpolate the amplitude and phase of the mitgcm m 2 constituent to the along track altimeter data locations the red curves in fig 13 show the amplitude and phase of the m 2 surface elevation along the 8th altimeter track for the altimeter the assimilation and simulation experiments for comparison the amplitude and phase of m 2 in the tpxo8 are plotted in fig 13 green curves the consistency between tpxo8 and altimetry in the large scale justifies that the barotropic signal dominates the altimetric m 2 tide the small scale perturbations represent the baroclinic signal which is not contained in the tpxo8 from fig 13 we can see that although the simulation experiment can simulate some baroclinic signal the modeled barotropic tidal signal is much different from that in the tpxo8 atlas in contrast the assimilation experiment can not only simulate the barotropic tidal signal well but also produce the perturbations at the sea surface induced by the internal tides to investigate the capability of the mitgcm in simulating m 2 internal tide a 50 400 km band pass filter is applied to extract the perturbations to the m 2 amplitude and phase due to internal tides this range spans the length scale of the low mode internal waves that the model with a horizontal resolution of 9 km is able to resolve shriver et al 2012 fig 14 displays the internal tide perturbations to the m 2 amplitude and phase along the 8th altimeter track for the altimetry and the two experiments compared to the simulation experiment the assimilation experiment can better match peaks and troughs in the perturbations observed by the altimeter for quantitatively assessment we compute rms values of internal tide perturbations to m 2 amplitudes phases over all the tracks shown in fig 12 for observation and the two experiments table 4 respectively the rms value of the differences in perturbations model minus observations is given in parentheses in table 4 the internal tide in the simulation experiment is very strong as evidenced by the higher rms value of perturbations compared to the observation in contrast the magnitude of perturbations in the assimilation experiment is closer to that seen in the observation the better match of the perturbation s peaks and troughs in the assimilation experiment and observation can also be seen in terms of rms values of the differences of perturbations between model and observation thus the correction scheme can improve not only the accuracy of barotropic tides but also the accuracy of surface internal tides 6 4 comparison with tao observations in this subsection we validate the performances of the two experiments with the temperature of tao observation at 165 e 8 s the black star in fig 6b the temporal resolution of the data is 10 min and the vertical levels are 1 25 50 75 100 125 150 200 250 300 and 500 m the modeled 3 d temperatures are horizontally interpolated to the tao site and vertically interpolated to the observation levels fig 15a c and e show time series of temperature profiles of the tao observation the assimilation experiment and simulation experiment at the tao site from the 1st to 10th of january 2011 fig 15b d and f display the 25 h running mean of fig 15a c and e respectively compared to fig 15b d and f the small scale perturbations in fig 15a c and e may be caused by internal tides although the temperature perturbation in the assimilation experiment fig 15c is weaker than that in the simulation experiment fig 15e the temperature profile after filtering out tides in the assimilation experiment fig 15d is very similar to that in the simulation experiment fig 15f it means that the assimilation of surface barotropic tides has little effect on the non tidal signals in terms of subsurface temperature profile the time averaged temperature profiles which can represent the mean stratification to some extent almost overlap among the tao and two experiments fig 16a it confirms that the correction scheme has little effect on the non tidal signal and modeled mean stratification blue and black lines is very close to the tao observation red dots fig 17 shows the time series of temperature perturbations obtained by subtracting the 25 h running mean from the instantaneous values for the tao observation the assimilation and simulation experiments all show obvious tidal cycle variation characteristics the strongest tidal signal is located at the depth of about 200 m for the tao observation and two experiments there are obvious differences of tidal signals between the assimilation and simulation experiments which further confirms that assimilating surface tidal elevation can significantly affect the subsurface tidal signal at the same time compared with the simulation result the perturbation intensity in the assimilation experiment is weaker than to the tao observation during the period of january 1 5 2011 fig 17 considering that the tao observation contains many small scale phenomenon and processes that cannot be solved by the mitgcm in the two experiments as well as all the tidal constituents it is acceptable that the perturbation intensity of the assimilation experiment is weaker than that of the tao observation to further investigate the m 2 internal tide the harmonic analysis is applied to the time series of temperature perturbations from jan 1st to feb 28th 2011 for each depth to obtain the amplitude and phase of the m 2 internal tide fig 16b shows the profiles of m 2 amplitude for the tao observation red dots the assimilation experiment black and simulation experiment blue the vertical structures of m 2 amplitude is very similar for the three with the maximum at the thermocline the maximum of m 2 amplitude in the assimilation experiment is more consistent with that in the tao observation than that in the simulation experiment therefore in terms of m 2 signal contained in the perturbation the assimilation results are closer to the tao observation than the simulation results 7 summary and discussion in this study the correction scheme that assimilates tpxo8 produced barotropic tides is introduced into the global mitgcm which has a horizontal resolution of 9 km to improve the simulation accuracy of barotropic and internal tides results indicate that the correction scheme can significantly reduce tidal errors not only at the sea surface but also below the sea surface and consequently improve the accuracy of barotropic and internal tides compared to the tpxo8 the correction scheme can reduce rms error of m 2 k 1 surface tidal elevation in the global ocean by 93 4 89 i e from 32 33 cm 8 09 cm to 2 12 cm 0 89 cm comparison with the independent observations of tide gauges demonstrates that the accuracy of surface tidal elevation is close to the level of tpxo8 after using the correction scheme for all areas except for the european shelf the surface m 2 barotropic tide and related m 2 internal tide perturbations in the assimilation experiment are more consistent with the altimeter observation than those in the simulation experiment the subsurface especially the thermocline signal of m 2 internal tide produced by the assimilation experiment is closer to the tao observation than that produced by the simulation experiment although the correction scheme can make up for the inaccuracy of topography and the lack of sal and topography wave drag term in the mitgcm and improve the tide accuracy its impacts on mesoscale eddies and general circulation are still unclear which need to be analyzed in the future the global internal tides provide important information

23906,in recent years high resolution global ocean circulation models have begun to include astronomical tidal forcing to concurrently simulate ocean circulation barotropic and internal tides the inclusion of tides is of great significance for understanding three dimensional 3 d ocean mixing and developing internal tide prediction however due to uncertainty in topography and damping terms improper representation of the self attraction and loading term barotropic tidal estimate cannot match that in the data constrained barotropic tidal model in this study the tpxo8 data are assimilated to optimize the tides embedded in a global 9 km 3 d general circulation model of mitgcm as follows for each time step of the mitgcm the previous 25 hour averaged sea surface height ssh is subtracted from the instantaneous ssh to obtain the mitgcm surface tidal elevation then the difference of surface tidal elevation between the mitgcm and tpxo8 together with a damping coefficient acts as an additional term for the right hand side of the ssh equation in order to correct the ssh field results show that the global m 2 k 1 error of the corrected surface tidal elevation relative to the tpxo8 reaches 2 12 cm 0 89 cm compared with tide gauge data the accuracy of surface tidal elevation after using the correction scheme is almost the same as that of tpxo8 for all areas except for some continental shelf and coastal areas the internal tidal signals are subsequently improved compared to the along track altimetry and tao observations compared to previous tidal assimilation scheme the implementation of the correction scheme used in this study is simple and more suitable for realistic applications keywords high resolution model internal tide tidal assimilation 1 introduction a number of scientific topics can be addressed using a high resolution global model that can simultaneously simulate oceanic general circulations mesoscale eddies and barotropic and internal tides for example it can be used for understanding higher frequency motions analyzing ocean tidal mixing and interactions between tides and low frequency motions developing the prediction of internal tides arbic et al 2012 2018 müller et al 2012 2015 ansong et al 2015 2017 rocha et al 2016a b buijsman et al 2016 wang et al 2016 savage et al 2017a b the first global three dimensional 3 d high resolution general circulation model gcm that can simulate internal tides is the hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model with a horizontal resolution of 1 12 5 driven by simultaneously atmospheric and astronomical tidal forcing arbic et al 2010 it included parameterized topographic internal wave drag and self attraction and loading to improve tidal precision in the model the atmospheric forcing sets up the background large scale circulation and stratification and the astronomical tidal forcing produces internal tides via barotropic tidal flows over topography since then a small but growing number of wind plus tides simulations has been done in global 3 d high resolution 1 10 or finer models such as the german stormtide model müller et al 2012 and the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm rocha et al 2016a b the concurrent atmospheric and tidal forcing will become increasingly common in global eddy resolving ocean models in the future arbic et al 2018 the tidal elevation accuracy in the above mentioned ocean models is comparable to that in the other non assimilative shallow water tide models but does not yet match that in the data assimilated barotropic tidal models stammer et al 2014 ngodock et al 2016 results showed that this might be caused by model resolution improper representation of the self attraction and loading sal term inaccurate bathymetry and parameterized internal wave drag for example arbic et al 2010 and shriver et al 2012 used a so called scalar approximation to represent sal term in early hycom simulations which is simple and has low computational cost relative to the full sal of hendershott 1972 and ray 1998 employing internal wave drag in baroclinic tide models is more complex due to the following reasons first whether one should parameterize internal wave damping in a high resolution model that resolves some of the internal wave spectrum is controversial some modeling experts argued that using internal wave drag parameterization in the model that resolves the spectrum constitutes can lead to double counting some researchers insisted that numerical models cannot resolve the actual breaking of internal tides and therefore require the damping of low mode internal tides to make up for this deficiency arbic et al 2004 2010 ansong et al 2015 buijsman et al 2015 2016 second even if it is necessary to employ the internal wave damping term the current parameterization schemes are still imperfect in the real ocean internal tide loses its energy by a variety of mechanisms including upper ocean wave wave interactions interaction between mean flow and eddies and scattering into higher vertical modes and dissipation by bottom friction on continental shelves for simplicity the early hycom employed a coarse resolution topographic internal wave drag based upon garner 2005 while no parameterization of internal wave damping was employed in the mitgcm tide simulations rocha et al 2016a b more recent hycom simulations used a rigorous iterated sal and a tuned high resolution jsl jayne and laurent 2001 wave drag instead of the approximate scalar sal and coarse resolution topographic internal wave drags ngodock et al 2016 although these changes resulted in some improvements in the barotropic tides errors are still greater than those of the data assimilated tide models as a result data assimilation provides a way to improve the simulation accuracy of the tides embedded in a fully nonlinear ocean general circulation model the schemes of assimilating tide observations into a hydrodynamic barotropic tide model have received much attention egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 lyard et al 2006 stammer et al 2014 taguchi et al 2014 but they cannot be applied directly to 3 d hydrodynamic models niwa and hibiya 2001 used the nudging technique to assimilate surface tidal elevation obtained from a global barotropic tide model into a 3 d hydrodynamic model but the hydrodynamic model only included realistic bottom topography average density stratification and tidal forcing it did not consider realistic temperature and salinity structures and atmospheric forcing ngodock et al 2016 suggested another tide assimilation scheme for a fully 3 d hycom which concurrently simulated barotropic and internal tide fields with the ocean circulation they assumed that the cumulative effects of error sources mentioned above can be represented by a single forcing correction term and used an augmented state ensemble kalman filter to gain an optimal estimate of the forcing correction term results indicated that this dynamic correct can significantly improve the accuracy of the tides in the hycom in this study we use this idea for reference and add a simple correction term to the right hand side of sea surface height ssh equation in the high resolution global ocean circulation model of mitgcm to optimize tidal simulation this paper is organized as follows the data are described in section 2 the model and method are described in sections 3 and 4 respectively we describe experiment setup used to conduct the application of the correction scheme in section 5 results of experiments are analyzed in section 6 conclusion and discussion are presented in section 7 2 data the harmonic constants amplitude and phase of the tpxo8 atlas are extracted from the tidal solutions elevation plus barotropic current produced by using the representer based variational scheme to assimilate altimetry and other data into a global shallow water model egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 the tpxo8 atlas with the resolution of 1 30 is used to generate surface tidal elevation to constrain the mitgcm three tidal gauge data sets in stammer et al 2014 are used one in deep water one in shelf water and shallow seas and one along coastlines of continents the 25 year 1992 2016 along track topex poseidon and jason satellite altimetry data are also used in this study the tao observations are used to validate internal tide which are made freely available by the noaa ndbc and can be downloaded through the website https www pmel noaa gov tao drupal disdel 3 model the ocean model used in this study is the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 which solves the 3 d primitive equations with the implicit linear free surface under the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations the model domain covers the globe it employs a cube sphere grid projection which permits a relatively even grid spacing throughout the model domain and avoids polar singularities adcroft et al 2004 each face of the cube comprises 1020 by 1020 grid cells for a mean horizontal grid spacing of 9 km the model has 50 vertical levels ranging in thickness from 10 m near the surface to approximately 450 m at the maximum model depth of 6150 m the topography comes from the general bathymetric chart of the ocean gebco08 bathymetry data with the high resolution of 30 arc seconds the atmospheric forcing is from the japanese 25 year reanalysis jra 25 including surface air temperature specific humidity precipitation 10 m wind velocity downward longwave and shortwave radiation the wind stress over the ocean is calculated following the bulk formulas of large and pond 1981 for runoff the seasonal climatology from fekete et al 2002 is used the model only employs the quadratic bottom boundary layer drag and does not include any parameterized topographic internal wave drag term the governing equations are as follows 1 d v h d t f k v h h p g h η η e q f 2 η t h z fixed η v h d z p e r β η tpxo η model

hendershott 1972 arbic et al 2004 4 methodology niwa and hibiya 2001 directly modified the modeled surface tidal elevation at each point deeper than 3000 m at the end of each time step using the difference between modeled surface tidal elevation and barotropic tidal elevation with a factor i e η model t i d e new η model t i d e β η t p x o η model t i d e in this study the difference β η t p x o η model t i d e is introduced on the right hand side of the ssh equation eq 2 as a correction term η t p x o is the barotropic tidal elevation calculated by the tidal prediction scheme based on the tpxo8 harmonic constants pawlowicz et al 2002 η model t i d e is the modeled surface tidal elevation at time t computed as follows first we compute the 25 h average of the modeled surface elevation during the previous 25 h for the mitgcm the time step is 1 min thus 25 h include 1500 time steps then η model t i d e is obtained by subtracting the 25 h averaged value from the instantaneous surface elevation at current time t this process can roughly extract the tidal signal and give the modeled surface tidal elevation at time t arbic et al 2010 β is the coefficient controlling the effect of the correction term note that only the smallest possible value of β should be assumed if ssh is overly constrained say by assigning β 1 00 ocean surface effects of underlying internal tides cannot be retained in the model result in niwa and hibiya 2001 β 0 25 here the four experiments with β 0 06 0 12 0 25 and 1 00 are respectively carried out to analyze the sensitivity to β all the experiments are the same except for the β value the initial field comes from the model result without the tidal assimilation on january 1 2011 all experiments are forced by the atmospheric forcing from the jra 25 during january 2011 fig 1 shows the time series of the rms error of global surface tidal elevation with respect to tpxo8 in β 0 12 experiment which is the square root of the spatial mean of η t p x o η model t i d e 2 the error tends to be stationary after about several days of the assimilation which means that the assimilation solution can converge rapidly to the observation at the same time the rms error decreases from 0 0294 to 0 018 m when β increases from 0 06 to 1 00 table 1 the m 2 amplitude along 130 46 e for each experiment is shown in fig 2 whose small scale perturbation represents the underlying internal tides effect obviously the perturbations are weakened with the increase of β when β increases to 1 00 the amplitude curve is almost as smooth as that of the tpxo8 so considering the two factors of the internal tide effect and tidal precision β is set to 0 12 in this study in addition we analyzed the sensitivity of model results to the time window of filtering out tides here five experiments with the 22 23 24 25 and 26 h windows are respectively carried out their initial fields and atmospheric forcing are the same as that used in above mentioned four experiments all the experiments are the same except for different time window the m 2 amplitude of the surface tidal elevation along 130 46 e for different experiments is shown in fig 3 their averages in the 22 23 24 25 and 26 h experiments are 0 48 0 49 0 51 0 53 and 0 55 cm respectively because the result in the 25 h experiment is the closest to the tpxo8 it is reasonable to set the time window as 25 h in this study 5 experiment setup the mitgcm is first initialized using the january climatology of woa13 world ocean atlas 2013 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 and forced by the climatological atmospheric forcing from the jra 25 then the model is integrated for 10 years to generate the initial condition for the following experiments in this study we designed two experiments with the same initial condition integration period i e two years from january 1 2010 to december 31 2011 tidal forcing term and atmospheric forcing from the jra 25 one is the experiment named simulation without the correction term and the other is the experiment named assimilation with the correction term for simplicity both experiments use the largest amplitude semidiurnal constituent m 2 and diurnal constituent k 1 to compute surface tidal elevation for the analysis of model results it is desirable to save information hourly however due to the high vertical and horizontal resolutions of the mitgcm we save the global hourly 2 d ssh output for the two years but only save the global hourly 3 d fields for two months of january february 2011 fig 4 shows snapshots of ssh and steric ssh in the northwest pacific in the assimilation experiment the ssh in fig 4a is dominated by the large scale barotropic tides the eddying general circulations feature smaller horizontal scales and are easily discernible in fig 4b internal tides are also visible as small scale speckled patterns in the steric plot of fig 4b the meso and gyre scale general circulation features are removed in the global map of differences between two steric height fields 6h apart fig 5 instead we can more clearly see internal tide signals which show up as beams as in previous hycom results arbic et al 2010 so these results demonstrate the coexistence of general ocean circulations eddies barotropic tides and internal tides in the mitgcm simulation 6 results in this section we analyze the differences between the two experiments and the impact of the correction term on the accuracy of barotropical and internal tides using the data from the tpxo8 tide gauges altimeter and mooring buoy 6 1 comparison with tpxo8 atlas based on the time series of modeled hourly ssh during jan 1 st to dec 31 th 2011 the amplitudes and phases of m 2 and k 1 at each model grid can be obtained using the standard harmonic analysis method foreman 1977 figs 6 and 7 show the amplitude and phase of the tpxo8 the simulation and assimilation experiments for m 2 and k 1 respectively the tide induced internal wave i e the internal tidal wave results in small horizontal scale perturbations to the amplitudes and phases in the two experiments results of the simulation experiment are noticeably different with those of tpxo8 which might be caused by the absence of the sal and topography wave drag in the mitgcm the amplitude and phase in the assimilation experiment are significantly improved over the simulation experiment and are very similar to those of the tpxo8 especially in the southern ocean where the early hycom did not perform well arbic et al 2010 shriver et al 2012 this demonstrates the correction term can well constrain the surface tidal elevation of mitgcm to that of tpxo8 although results might be significantly improved by ameliorating model bathymetry sal and topographic internal wave drag scheme ngodock et al 2016 these processes make the calculation more complicated first we need to tune the drag scheme to minimize the elevation error which is time consuming second applying them to a high resolution 3 d global ocean model requires high computational cost moreover even if these changes can reduce the tidal error the error level is still much greater than that in the data assimilated tide models stammer et al 2014 in contrast the correction scheme used in this study can not only significantly improve the tidal accuracy but also be easily implemented to quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two experiments we use the rms error of m 2 k 1 surface tidal elevation at each grid given by a t p x cos ω t ϕ t p x a model cos ω t ϕ model 2 1 2 where the overbar is computed over one full cycle of the constituent in question e g ω t varying from 0 to 2 π a is amplitude ω is frequency t is time ϕ denotes phase subscript model denotes the value in each experiment subscript tpx denotes the tpxo8 value just as shown in figs 8 and 9 the rms errors in the assimilation experiment are significantly lower than those in the simulation experiment at the same time two measures describing the error in a specified region are also computed one is the rms error in a specified region where the overbar means it is calculated over one full cycle of the constituent in question as well as over the grid points in the specified region the other is the median rms error which is the spatial median of the rms errors at all grid points of the specified region the median rms error can remove the impact of outliers table 2 gives the rms and median rms errors of m 2 and k 1 for the globe 66 s 66 n and southern ocean south of 66 s the error in the southern ocean is larger than that in the global ocean which is consistent with figs 8 and 9 due to the existence of some outliers figs 8 and 9 the median rms errors are smaller than the rms errors thus we use the median rms errors to compare the performance of two experiments with the introduction of the correction term the median rms error of m 2 k 1 for the global ocean can be reduced by 96 3 93 7 i e from 21 77 cm 5 67 cm to 0 81 cm 0 36 cm for the southern ocean the median rms error of m 2 k 1 can be reduced by 97 9 94 2 i e from 36 01 cm 14 4 cm to 0 74 cm 0 84 cm here the m 2 median global rms error in the assimilation experiment is lower than that in the data assimilated hycom described in ngodock et al 2016 whose minimum is 1 7 cm 6 2 comparison with tide gauge data in this subsection we use tide gauge data in stammer et al 2014 to perform an evaluation of the two experiments these data consist of harmonic constants from 151 stations in deep oceans 195 stations in shelf waters and shallow seas and 56 stations along coastlines of continents of the 195 stations in shelf waters and shallow seas 76 are on the northwest european shelf and 119 are elsewhere tide signal and rms error at each station are respectively calculated as follows 7 a station cos ω t ϕ station 2 1 2 8 a station cos ω t ϕ station a model t p x cos ω t ϕ model t p x 2 1 2 where the overbar represents an average over one full cycle of the constituent in question e g ω t varying from 0 to 2 π subscript station denotes the station value subscript model tpx denotes an experiment or tpxo8 value at each station tidal constants from the models tpxo8 are interpolated to the station location using bilinear interpolation for coastal tide gauges some station locations were deemed by the models tpxo8 to be land and a small amount of extrapolation was necessary to obtain valid model tpxo8 amplitude and phase the errors of the simulation experiment are large in coastal areas or in areas with large tidal signals fig 10 when the correction term is added the error decreases obviously and is very close to that of tpxo8 except for a few coastal stations we compute the time and station averaged rms errors for deep oceans european shelf shelves elsewhere and coastal areas using 8 where the overbar represents an average over one full cycle of the constituent as well as over all the station locations table 3 just as in stammer et al 2014 median rms errors in coastal areas are given to prevent one or two poor stations from dominating the statistical result the rms error of tpxo8 in deep oceans is the same as that in stammer et al 2014 tpxo8 errors in the remainder area are slightly different from the results of stammer et al 2014 one reason is that stammer et al 2014 rejected the tide gauges in a location where the good observation should have been made by altimetry and yet models differed unusually from gauge estimates but we do not consider this another reason is that the extrapolation method used in coastal areas is different from that in stammer et al 2014 however in general the error level of tpxo8 obtained in this study is similar to that in stammer et al 2014 although the error in the simulation experiment is very large the error decreases sharply after assimilating the tpxo8 so that rms errors in the assimilation experiment are close to the level of the tpxo8 for all areas except for the european shelf large errors are mainly concentrated in the continental shelf areas around the united kingdom and ireland fig 11 which are characterized by complex topography and strong tide signals 6 3 comparison with along track satellite altimeter data in this subsection we compare the sea surface internal tide signals simulated by the mitgcm to those in along track satellite altimeter data east of the philippines and hawaii which are hot spots for generating semidiurnal internal tides shriver et al 2012 we focus on the m 2 internal tide the 25 year 1992 2016 along track topex poseidon and jason satellite altimetry data are used to estimate the amplitude and phase of the altimetric m 2 tide using the standard harmonic analysis method fig 12 shows the altimeter tracks used in the comparison where the red curve represents the 8th track we interpolate the amplitude and phase of the mitgcm m 2 constituent to the along track altimeter data locations the red curves in fig 13 show the amplitude and phase of the m 2 surface elevation along the 8th altimeter track for the altimeter the assimilation and simulation experiments for comparison the amplitude and phase of m 2 in the tpxo8 are plotted in fig 13 green curves the consistency between tpxo8 and altimetry in the large scale justifies that the barotropic signal dominates the altimetric m 2 tide the small scale perturbations represent the baroclinic signal which is not contained in the tpxo8 from fig 13 we can see that although the simulation experiment can simulate some baroclinic signal the modeled barotropic tidal signal is much different from that in the tpxo8 atlas in contrast the assimilation experiment can not only simulate the barotropic tidal signal well but also produce the perturbations at the sea surface induced by the internal tides to investigate the capability of the mitgcm in simulating m 2 internal tide a 50 400 km band pass filter is applied to extract the perturbations to the m 2 amplitude and phase due to internal tides this range spans the length scale of the low mode internal waves that the model with a horizontal resolution of 9 km is able to resolve shriver et al 2012 fig 14 displays the internal tide perturbations to the m 2 amplitude and phase along the 8th altimeter track for the altimetry and the two experiments compared to the simulation experiment the assimilation experiment can better match peaks and troughs in the perturbations observed by the altimeter for quantitatively assessment we compute rms values of internal tide perturbations to m 2 amplitudes phases over all the tracks shown in fig 12 for observation and the two experiments table 4 respectively the rms value of the differences in perturbations model minus observations is given in parentheses in table 4 the internal tide in the simulation experiment is very strong as evidenced by the higher rms value of perturbations compared to the observation in contrast the magnitude of perturbations in the assimilation experiment is closer to that seen in the observation the better match of the perturbation s peaks and troughs in the assimilation experiment and observation can also be seen in terms of rms values of the differences of perturbations between model and observation thus the correction scheme can improve not only the accuracy of barotropic tides but also the accuracy of surface internal tides 6 4 comparison with tao observations in this subsection we validate the performances of the two experiments with the temperature of tao observation at 165 e 8 s the black star in fig 6b the temporal resolution of the data is 10 min and the vertical levels are 1 25 50 75 100 125 150 200 250 300 and 500 m the modeled 3 d temperatures are horizontally interpolated to the tao site and vertically interpolated to the observation levels fig 15a c and e show time series of temperature profiles of the tao observation the assimilation experiment and simulation experiment at the tao site from the 1st to 10th of january 2011 fig 15b d and f display the 25 h running mean of fig 15a c and e respectively compared to fig 15b d and f the small scale perturbations in fig 15a c and e may be caused by internal tides although the temperature perturbation in the assimilation experiment fig 15c is weaker than that in the simulation experiment fig 15e the temperature profile after filtering out tides in the assimilation experiment fig 15d is very similar to that in the simulation experiment fig 15f it means that the assimilation of surface barotropic tides has little effect on the non tidal signals in terms of subsurface temperature profile the time averaged temperature profiles which can represent the mean stratification to some extent almost overlap among the tao and two experiments fig 16a it confirms that the correction scheme has little effect on the non tidal signal and modeled mean stratification blue and black lines is very close to the tao observation red dots fig 17 shows the time series of temperature perturbations obtained by subtracting the 25 h running mean from the instantaneous values for the tao observation the assimilation and simulation experiments all show obvious tidal cycle variation characteristics the strongest tidal signal is located at the depth of about 200 m for the tao observation and two experiments there are obvious differences of tidal signals between the assimilation and simulation experiments which further confirms that assimilating surface tidal elevation can significantly affect the subsurface tidal signal at the same time compared with the simulation result the perturbation intensity in the assimilation experiment is weaker than to the tao observation during the period of january 1 5 2011 fig 17 considering that the tao observation contains many small scale phenomenon and processes that cannot be solved by the mitgcm in the two experiments as well as all the tidal constituents it is acceptable that the perturbation intensity of the assimilation experiment is weaker than that of the tao observation to further investigate the m 2 internal tide the harmonic analysis is applied to the time series of temperature perturbations from jan 1st to feb 28th 2011 for each depth to obtain the amplitude and phase of the m 2 internal tide fig 16b shows the profiles of m 2 amplitude for the tao observation red dots the assimilation experiment black and simulation experiment blue the vertical structures of m 2 amplitude is very similar for the three with the maximum at the thermocline the maximum of m 2 amplitude in the assimilation experiment is more consistent with that in the tao observation than that in the simulation experiment therefore in terms of m 2 signal contained in the perturbation the assimilation results are closer to the tao observation than the simulation results 7 summary and discussion in this study the correction scheme that assimilates tpxo8 produced barotropic tides is introduced into the global mitgcm which has a horizontal resolution of 9 km to improve the simulation accuracy of barotropic and internal tides results indicate that the correction scheme can significantly reduce tidal errors not only at the sea surface but also below the sea surface and consequently improve the accuracy of barotropic and internal tides compared to the tpxo8 the correction scheme can reduce rms error of m 2 k 1 surface tidal elevation in the global ocean by 93 4 89 i e from 32 33 cm 8 09 cm to 2 12 cm 0 89 cm comparison with the independent observations of tide gauges demonstrates that the accuracy of surface tidal elevation is close to the level of tpxo8 after using the correction scheme for all areas except for the european shelf the surface m 2 barotropic tide and related m 2 internal tide perturbations in the assimilation experiment are more consistent with the altimeter observation than those in the simulation experiment the subsurface especially the thermocline signal of m 2 internal tide produced by the assimilation experiment is closer to the tao observation than that produced by the simulation experiment although the correction scheme can make up for the inaccuracy of topography and the lack of sal and topography wave drag term in the mitgcm and improve the tide accuracy its impacts on mesoscale eddies and general circulation are still unclear which need to be analyzed in the future the global internal tides provide important information on ocean mixing an accurate simulation of internal tides contributes to our understanding of energy transport and dissipation mechanism through ocean mixing in this study the internal mixing physical processes in the dynamic model e g topography internal wave drag are compensated by the correction scheme whether it is appropriate to investigate the mixing mechanism of internal tides by using the model with the correction scheme remains to be seen declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

23907,in order to estimate the spatially varying bottom friction coefficients bfcs in the bohai yellow and east china seas byecs multi mission satellite observations from topex poseidon jason 1 and jason 2 are assimilated into a two dimensional tidal model with an adjoint method this work aims to 1 study the characteristics of spatially varying bfcs in byecs and 2 find out the possible sources and mechanisms of spatially varying bfcs in the numerical experiment the m 2 tide is simulated and the spatially varying bfcs in byecs are estimated by assimilating observations from tidal gauge stations and multi mission altimeters the simulated m 2 tide matches well with the tide gauge data indicating the reasonability of present methodology of spatially varying bfcs the characteristics and possible mechanisms of the spatially varying bfcs in byecs are concluded and discussed and the main conclusions include 1 the values of bfcs in shallow water are usually larger than those in deep water which can reach the order of 10 2 in shallow areas 2 the values of bfcs generally decrease with the strengthened depth averaged tidal current velocity in byecs 3 the high value bfc areas near the coasts always appear in the downstream sides of headlands or peninsulas which are possibly caused by the propagation of tidal waves 4 the high value bfc area along jiangsu coast is affected by the bottom morphology of radially distributed tidal sand ridges which might enhance the form drag 5 the high value bfc areas in the middle of the south yellow sea and fujian coast correspond to the muddy areas where the mixture of different sediment types changes the bottom roughness keywords bottom friction coefficient adjoint method two dimensional tide model bohai yellow and east china seas spatially varying 1 introduction bottom friction plays an important role in coastal processes and in the performance of numerical models in shallow seas therefore it is necessary to find out a method that can evaluate the effects of bottom friction effectively and accurately at present one of the main difficulties in parameterizing the bottom friction is its spatial variance ullman and wilson 1998 nicolle and karpytchev 2007 kagan et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 frictional effects between ocean water and seabed can be divided into skin friction and form drag due to different mechanisms form drag is closely related to the topography and skin friction is usually determined by the sediment types both leading to large spatial variations the relation between these two parts is also complex warner and maccready 2009 performed a deep study on the mechanisms of form drag and found that the magnitude of form drag not only depended on the tidal excursion but also on the topography feature by measuring skin friction and near bed velocity profiles over movable ripples li 1994 studied the relations among skin friction geometries of ripples and flow strength and concluded that skin friction tended to decrease when ripples had larger height and length yet the ratio of skin friction to total shear stress increased through the improved flow strength overall the parameterization of bottom friction is a multi scale problem and still needs further studying especially on the characteristics and explanations of its spatial variations and how to realize it in ocean modeling to improve the simulation and prediction with the development of observing technology bottom friction can be calculated from high resolution field measurements such as acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and acoustic doppler velocimetry adv li et al 2004 lozovatsky et al 2008b xu et al 2017 fan et al 2019 however this type of in situ measurements is usually sparse due to the cost other methods also have been developed to evaluate the bottom friction by using satellite data especially its spatial distributions lu and zhang 2006 zhang et al 2011 guo et al 2017 the bottom friction effect is usually represented by the bottom friction coefficient bfc multiplying the velocity in linear or nonlinear e g quadratic form traditionally the bfc is taken as a constant value in a given study region lee and jung 1999 egbert et al 2004 or different constants in sub domains lardner et al 1993 lee et al 2002 he et al 2004 with these two methods the determination of bfc becomes much easier however the relatively low accuracy makes it not a good choice in order to represent the process more reasonably in physics a methodology was then proposed that the bfc was spatially varying and data assimilation methods were used to develop and realize this methodology das and lardner 1991 1992 ullman and wilson 1998 heemink et al 2002 the combination of four dimensional variational 4dvar data assimilation and adjoint method has been proven to be effective in the optimization or estimation of initial conditions and control variables in oceanic and atmospheric models with this methodology a large amount of observations in time and space can be directly assimilated into the model under the constraint of dynamical equations thacker and long 1988 li et al 1994 navon 1998 navon 1998 presented a comprehensive overview of parameter estimation in meteorology and oceanography in view of applications of 4dvar data assimilation techniques to inverse parameter estimation problems ullman and wilson 1998 assimilated adcp data into a tidal model and used adjoint method to investigate the variability of the spatially varying bfcs in the lower hudson estuary lu and zhang 2006 studied the spatial distribution of bfcs in the east china seas by assimilating topex poseidon t p altimeter data zhang et al 2011 found that the parameterizations of linear bottom friction were applicable to a regional ocean tidal model with the combination of spatially varying parameters and an adjoint method guo et al 2017 applied surface spline interpolation for bfcs inversion in the bohai sea while the constructed surface was smoother than traditional methods due to the large amount of satellite observations such as t p and jason series jason 1 jason 2 etc the understanding on ocean processes including tide egbert et al 2004 ocean circulation lázaro et al 2005 and mesoscale eddies chelton et al 2011 etc has been improved significantly egbert and ray 2000 moreover with the primary and interleaved missions of t p jason 1 j1 and jason 2 j2 the distance of adjacent ground tracks was reduced by half while the number of available observations was almost doubled in a given domain subrahmanyam et al 2009 detected rossby waves with multi mission satellite observations in the indian ocean pujol et al 2010 investigated the differences after assimilating sea level observations from multi altimeters into the mediterranean forecasting model with the increased amount of satellite data and enhanced resolution of observations the differences between modeling results and observations were also reduced cheng et al 2016 confirmed the feasibility of increasing altimeter observations for the simulation of principal tides in the bohai yellow and east china seas byecs they compared the differences in tidal simulation using observations from different missions the results showed that observations from t p jason primary and interleaved missions led to the best simulation results as indicated above the spatial variation of bfcs is a rather complex problem which is important for the ocean modeling and calculation of energy dissipation consequently the present paper will focus on the estimation of spatially varying bfcs in byecs in previous papers on this topic lu and zhang 2006 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 the quantity of satellite observations employed in the parameter estimation and the spatial resolution of their numerical models were limited while satellite observations from multi missions are assimilated during the bfc optimization in this study with an enhancement in the spatial resolution of numerical model the main purposes of this study are that 1 obtaining the spatial distribution of bfcs in the bohai yellow and east china seas and concluding the distributing characteristics and 2 finding the possible sources and mechanisms of the estimated spatially varying bfcs the organization of this paper is as follows the two dimensional adjoint tidal model and datasets are described in section 2 section 3 analyzes and discusses the results of the numerical experiment section 4 discusses the characteristics and possible mechanisms of

boundary conditions and empirical parameters the cost function which measures the differences between observations and simulation results will be minimized by optimizing the control variables the cost function decreases along the opposite direction of the gradients with respect to the control variables and this gradient is calculated by solving the adjoint equations in order to construct the governing equations of the adjoint model the cost function is defined as 2 j ζ 1 2 k ζ ω t s ζ ζ ˆ 2 d s d t and the lagrangian function is defined as 3 l ω t s μ u t u a u λ ν r u φ u ν tan φ r f ν k

section are both based on lu and zhang 2006 2 3 estimation algorithm of spatially varying bfcs in the estimation of bfcs only some selected nodes independent points will be optimized and the values of the rest nodes are obtained by interpolation therefore the target parameters being optimized are defined at the independent points this way the dimension of the parameter space is reduced thereby reducing the ill posedness of inverse problems zhang and wang 2014 in this study the cressman linear interpolation is applied to obtain the bfcs for the entire domain let b m n be a series of independent bfc and k j k is the result of linear interpolation with b m n then the cressman interpolation is defined as follows 6 k j k m n ϕ j k m n b m n where ϕ j k m n is the coefficient of linear interpolation with the form 7 ϕ j k m n w j k m n m n w j k m n in which w j k m n is the weight coefficient in cressman form cressman 1959 8 w j k m n d 2 r j k m n 2 d 2 r j k m n 2 where r j k m n is the distance between a grid node j k and an independent node m n and d is the influencing radius of independent node the gradient of lagrangian function with respect to the independent bfcs is given as 9 l b m n i j k ω t s ϕ j k m n ϕ j 1 k m n 2 μ j k i 1 u j k i 2 ν j k i 2 α u j k i 1 1 α u j k i h j 1 2 k ζ j 1 2 k i i j k ω t s ϕ j k m n ϕ j k 1 m n 2 υ j k i 1 ν j k i 2 u j k i 2 α ν j k i 1 1 α ν j k i h j 1 2 k ζ j 1 2 k i where i is the index of timestep and α is a constant and α 0 1 u j k and ν j k are the spatially averaged four point average velocity in order to obtain a smooth numerical result they have the following expressions in arakawa c grid u j k u j k u j 1 k u j k 1 u j 1 k 1 4 ν j k ν j k ν j k 1 ν j 1 k ν j 1 k 1 4 as the cost function decreases along the opposite direction of the gradient the correction of independent bfcs can be obtained as 10 k c b m n b ˆ m n l b m n l b 2 0 i e b m n b ˆ m n 1 k c l b m n l b 2 and l b 2 m n l b m n 2 1 2 where b ˆ m n and b m n are the prior and optimized values of independent bfcs respectively and k c is an empirical constant controlling the smoothness of bfc in the iterative process l b m n the gradient of lagrangian function with respect to the independent bfcs is unitized first which means only the direction of the gradient is used in optimization in this paper in order to ensure the cost function can decrease continuously and without fluctuations 1 k c is obtained through a trial and error procedure and finally taken as 10 4 2 4 datasets the observations employed in this study are divided into three groups the first group is the primary missions of altimeters including the tidal harmonic constants derived from ten years t p seven years j1 and eight years j2 primary missions the second group is the interleaved missions of altimeters including the joint of three years t p and j1 interleaved missions tpn and j1n respectively and the last group is in situ measurements from tidal gauge stations hereafter the first group and the second group are simplified as prim and intlm respectively the combination of prim and intlm not only increases the number of available satellite observations but also improves the spatial resolution of observations as the distance of adjacent ground tracks is reduced by half the distribution of ground tracks and other details of prim and intlm are shown in fig 1a and table 1 respectively these datasets have been proven to be useful in tidal research cheng and andersen 2011 applied multi mission satellite observations into a global tide model to improve oceanic tidal results in shallow water all satellite datasets used in this study are developed validated and distributed by the ctoh legos france http ctoh legos obs mip fr the observations of the third group are from 89 tidal gauge stations mainly concentrated along coasts and islands 2 5 model configuration the computing area is the byecs covered from 23 5 n to 41 n and 117 e to 131 e the spatial and temporal resolution of the two dimensional model is 1 12 1 12 and 18 631 s 1 2400 of the m 2 tide period respectively the gridded topography is based on etopo1 and some in situ measurements fig 1 while the deepest water depth of the computing area is 2322 meters m the open boundary conditions are obtained from the global ocean tide model dtu10 cheng and andersen 2011 and the open boundary conditions are fixed during the optimization of bfcs the effect of horizontal viscosity coefficient is taken as a constant with a value of 5 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 the efficiency of the two dimensional tidal adjoint model on tide simulation and parameter optimization has been proven in zhang et al 2011 and wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 applied adjoint method to examine the linear and nonlinear parameterizations of bottom friction for the two dimensional tidal model they implemented a series of ideal experiments to test and validate the numerical model in which they studied the influencing factors of the bottom friction parameterizations e g the prescribed bfc shape the choice of bfc initial value and the addition of artificial error in the assimilated observation the results proved the efficiency of the numerical model on the bfc optimization with the same method wang et al 2014 estimated the bfcs of byecs by assimilating observations from t p and concluded an empirical expression of bfc value and water depth 3 numerical experiment 3 1 numerical experiment setup in this section a numerical experiment is implemented to estimate the spatially varying bfcs in byecs the iterative process of the parameter estimation with the adjoint method in oceanic modeling can be summarized as follows 1 providing open boundary conditions and initial guess values of model parameters 2 assimilating the observations to estimate model parameter 3 judging whether the criterion pertinent to the differences between model outputs and observations is satisfied the iteration is terminated if the criterion is satisfied otherwise the adjoint variables are computed by running the backward model through which the gradients of cost functions with respect to the target parameters can be calculated 4 based on the gradients the target parameters are estimated and updated in order to apply the estimation algorithm of spatially varying bfcs a series of independent points are selected and optimized values of other grid points are obtained by linearly interpolating the values at these independent points for independent points the influencing radius is 0 5 and the initial guesses are 0 002 because the empirical values of bfcs in byecs are in the interval of 0 001 0 003 the observations from prim intlm and tidal gauge stations are all assimilated in the numerical experiment the differences between simulated results and observed data in terms of amplitude and phase lag are calculated 3 2 analysis of the numerical experiment the error statistics between model results and observed data in the numerical experiment are listed in table 2 the mean absolute errors maes between simulated results and observed data from altimeters are 6 4 cm in amplitude and 6 7 in phase lag comparing the simulated results with observed data from tidal gauge stations the maes are 8 5 cm in amplitude and 8 2 in phase lag the differences between observed and simulated values in previous studies lu and zhang 2006 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 are exhibited in table 2 as well the data misfit between model output and observations in our study is similar with theirs the co tidal chart of the simulated m 2 tide shown in fig 2a illustrates the propagation pattern of m 2 tide in byecs fig 2b shows the strength of the tidal currents by depicting the tidal ellipses at independent points tidal currents along the gyeongg bay west korea bay liaodong bay jiangsu coast zhejiang coast and fujian coast are relatively strong in byecs the m 2 tidal waves from the pacific propagate into the east china sea and separate into two branches the majority spreads into the yellow sea in the form of a progressive wave and then separates into two standing wave systems rotating counterclockwise under the influence of coriolis force and shandong peninsula the other branch spreading to the zhejiang coast and fujian coast also transforms into a standing wave system for the propagation of m2 tide there are four rotating systems located in the liaodong bay yellow river mouth north yellow sea and south yellow sea which are similar with the simulated results of fang et al 2004 a detailed description of the tidal dynamics from the point of view of kelvin and poincaré waves is presented in the next section the propagation pattern of the simulated m 2 tide in byecs from the numerical experiment agrees with cheng et al 2007 and the following analysis will focus on the spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs the spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs is depicted in fig 3 and the statistical values are listed in table 3 the average value of bfcs of the whole study area byecs is 2 2 10 3 the bfcs at 42 of the grid points are smaller than 0 001 while 2 are larger than 0 01 53 and 3 grid points fall in the interval 0 001 0 005 and 0 005 0 01 respectively the average values of bfcs are 0 0025 0 0027 0 0029 and 0 0022 for the bohai sea the north yellow sea the south yellow sea and the east china sea respectively specifically there are three high value bfc areas in the bohai sea i e the maximum value of bfcs in liaodong bay v3 is 0 0126 0 0094 in bohai bay v4 and 0 0036 in laizhou bay v5 these spatial features of bfcs in the bohai sea correspond well with guo et al 2017 the maximum bfc value of the yellow sea is 0 03 west of korea peninsula v1 v2 while the values in haizhou bay v8 and jiangsu coast v9 are the second largest there is a relatively high value area in the center of the south yellow sea v10 similar to the distributions given by zhang et al 2011 and pringle et al 2018 in the east china sea the values of bfcs near the zhejiang coast v11 fujian coast v7 and northwest of the okinawa trough v12 are relatively high as well the inversed bfcs in byecs are compared with calculation results from field measurements and other model results to evaluate the accuracy of the present spatial distribution respectively fan et al 2019 studied the time variations of bfcs from eight mooring stations in byecs and analyzed the contributions from currents and waves respectively in their study the average values of current induced bfcs in the bohai bay the south yellow sea and the east china sea were 0 0021 0 0033 and 0 0022 respectively while the maximum values reached 0 0064 0 0141 and 0 0083 during the observing period comparing to their estimations there is a good coherence between our inversed bfcs and theirs while the inversed bfcs in byecs from other previous works e g lu and zhang 2006 and wang et al 2014 were underestimated pringle et al 2018 proposed a semidata informed method that the spatially varying bfc was calculated as a function of some parameters of the seabed and physical properties of the flow e g median sediment grain diameter sediment density mean current speed etc the spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs from their work showed that there was a high value bfc area in the south yellow sea as well and the values of bfcs were 0 004 the spatially distributing characteristics of bfcs in byecs can be concluded as follows 1 the high value bfc areas mainly concentrate along the coasts while there are two exceptions in the middle of the south yellow sea and northwest of the okinawa trough 2 the maximum values of the high value bfc areas are on order of 10 2 while the empirical value of bfc is assigned with an order of 10 3 3 the values of bfcs in v1 v7 v10 and v11 are larger than those in the previous work lu and zhang 2006 4 discussions of the spatiality of bfcs 4 1 sources of the spatiality of bfcs according to soulsby 1983 the total seabed shear stress τ is made up from three parts due to 1 the skin friction produced by and acting on the sediment grains 2 the form drag produced by the pressure field associated with the flow over ripples and or large features over the bed warner and maccready 2009 and 3 a sediment transport contributed by momentum transfer to mobilize the grains damgaard et al 1997 the bed shear stress can be calculated in terms of depth averaged velocity or bottom layer velocity with a nonlinear quadratic friction law of the form zhang et al 2011 11 τ n l ρ c d u 2 or with a linear law with the form 12 τ l ρ c s u where ρ is the density of water c d and c s are the bfcs which are key parameters for the parameterization of bottom friction effect the optimized bfcs of byecs from numerical experiment in section 3 are the quadratic form of friction coefficient by assuming the current velocity u varies with the height z above the seabed according to the logarithmic velocity profile the most commonly used assumption based on logarithmic relationship gives c d as green and mccave 1995 bricker et al 2005 liu and wei 2007 lozovatsky et al 2008b trowbridge and lentz 2018 13 c d κ 1 ln z 0 h 2 where z 0 is the bed roughness length and κ is von karman s constant and usually with value of 0 4 according to eq 13 the value of c d is determined by the bed roughness length z 0 and the water depth h which are the two sources of the complex spatiality of c d in most studies c d is usually assigned as a simple constant with an order of 10 3 however it is arbitrary because the spatial variations might introduce more complexity to the hydrodynamics damgaard et al 1997 nicolle and karpytchev 2007 kagan et al 2012 song et al 2013 the flow field can contribute to the spatiality of bfcs as well especially in the coastal ocean the bottom boundary layer is significantly affected by surface gravity waves which can produce apparent velocity fluctuations and influence the seafloor damgaard et al 1997 consequently the bed shear stress not only depends on currents but also on waves and wave current interaction which increases the complexity of bfcs therefore the characteristics of the spatial distribution of bfcs and the possible reasons for the locations of high value bfc areas are discussed 4 2 possible relation with water depth in the field of engineering the chezy coefficient c and manning s n are commonly used which gives the formula as 14 c d g c 2 g n 2 h 1 3 eqs 13 and 14 both indicate that water depth is a key variable in calculating c d fig 4 shows the values of bfcs versus the water depth at independent points in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea respectively in order to examine the relations between bfcs and water depth the average values of bfcs at each specific depth are calculated in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea individually fig 5 the most notable pattern is that the values of bfcs in shallow water are usually larger than those in deep water especially in the bohai sea and the yellow sea in the east china sea the average value of bfcs first decreases within water depth less than 50 m and then increases to a constant value usually the values of bfcs are assigned with the order of 10 3 however figs 3 4 show that they can reach the order of 10 2 in some shallow areas in all three seas table 3 similarly the drag coefficients in the forest of cu lao dung island in the mekong delta vietnam were 10 30 times larger than usual observations i e 0 032 in the forest 0 041 in the fringe and 0 002 in sand and mudflat environments mullarney et al 2017 in the study of mofjeld 1988 a level 2 5 turbulence closure model was used to investigate the dependence on water depth of bottom stress and quadratic drag coefficient for a steady barotropic pressure driven current in un stratified water when the current was the primary source of turbulence he found that the depth averaged bfc depended primarily on the ratio h z 0 and the bfc varied inversely with the ratio above in johns et al 1990 similar relation between c d and relative roughness z 0 h had been shown in the study of ullman and wilson 1998 the temporal and spatial variability of the bfc was studied and they also found larger bfc in shallower water the negative correlation between bfc and water depth in this paper agrees well with the conclusions indicated above however a positive correlation between bfc and water depth is found in the water depth interval 50 m 160 m which is similar with the varying pattern of li et al 2004 they found that the values of bfcs in james river estuary first showed a negative correlation with the water depth less than 9 m then the correlation became positive when the water depth was larger than 9 m the non uniform bottom roughness had been used to account for the pattern of positive correlation and they also found that in deeper water stratification might affect the bfc as well in the following discussion the changes of bottom roughness caused by topography and sediment types are considered to explain the spatial variability of bfcs in byecs 4 3 possible relation with depth averaged tidal current velocity in the previous studies there was a negative relation between bfcs and flow velocity cheng et al 1999 liu and wei 2007 fan et al 2019 with the field investigation implemented in san francisco bay california cheng et al 1999 proposed a critical flow velocity ranged from 0 25 m s to 0 30 m s and found that c d decreased linearly when the flow velocity was larger than the critical value bricker et al 2005 studied the variations of c d under wind waves at a shallow site when mean current velocity was much greater than the maximum near bed wave induced orbital velocity c d converged to a canonical value of 0 0025 if the mean current velocity was much less than the near bed orbital velocity there was an increase in c d of an order of magnitude over the canonical value in jiaozhou bay of the yellow sea liu and wei 2007 found that the maximum minimum values of c d corresponded to the minimum maximum values of flow velocity fig 6 shows the relations between the inversed bfcs and the depth averaged tidal current velocity at independent points in the bohai yellow and east china seas respectively for the byecs and the east china sea the values of bfcs generally decrease with the strengthened tidal current velocity which corresponds with the previous conclusions for the bohai sea and the yellow sea there are small fluctuations in 0 03 m s and 0 10 m s respectively that bfcs slightly increase with the increasing velocity there are differences between the previous studies and our results in the correlation of bfcs and the reference velocity it needs to be referred that the field investigation of cheng et al 1999 was carried out in a semi enclosed tidal basin with water depth around 16 m while the broadband acoustic doppler current profilers were used to measure the turbulent averaged velocity profile within 1 5 m above seabed therefore the reference velocity in their conclusion was the time averaged current velocity of the bottom boundary layer under the effects of diurnal and semidiurnal tides and stratification while the reference velocity in fig 6 of our study is the depth averaged tidal current velocity under the simulation of m2 tide only based on the simulated m2 tide in byecs fig 2b the correlation of high value bfc areas and depth averaged tidal current velocity is exhibited in table 5 while the high value bfc areas v1 v2 v3 v7 v8 v9 v10 v11 and v12 are related with strengthened tidal currents 4 4 possible relation with form drag on non flat seabed with limited sediment transport the total bed shear stress is composed of two contributions the skin friction and the form drag while form drag is substantially larger than frictional drag damgaard et al 1997 wijesekera et al 2014 according to the simulated results of tidal flow field fig 2 and the morphology of byecs the theory of form drag warner and maccready 2009 is used to explain the larger values of bfcs along the coasts for example the western coast of korea peninsula v1 fig 3 the mechanism for the generation and propagation of kelvin and poincaré waves can be traced back to taylor 1919 and hendershott and speranza 1971 for byecs they were recently studied in jung et al 2005 and xing et al 2012 as shown in fig 7a the incoming rotating shallow water wave from the east china sea propagates into the yellow sea with two branches the right branch propagates along the western coast of korea peninsula in the form of kelvin wave kw 1 the left branch enters the south yellow sea in the form of the incoming tidal frequency plane poincaré wave pw kw 1 continues to travel along the coast of korea and china into the bohai sea kw 2 then it passes the shandong peninsula and reaches jiangsu coast which is in the north of yangtze river estuary the traveling pw in the south yellow sea meets the shandong peninsula and reflects in the form of counter propagating kelvin wave kw 3 together with the kw 2 from shandong peninsula kw 3 and kw 2 form the kelvin waves along jiangsu coast kw 3 kw 3 and pw joint together near the area of 32 n 33 5 n and are trapped off the jiangsu coast in order to characterize the features of headlands t1 t7 in byecs the nondimensional parameter ϒ the aspect ratio of the headland is used to define how sharp or streamlined each headland is table 4 15 ϒ across channel headland width along channel e folding headland length l a c l a l which was first introduced by warner and maccready 2009 comparing the propagation of tidal waves headland features and the locations of high value bfc areas figs 2 3 the most apparent pattern is that the high value bfc areas always appear in the downstream side of a headland or a peninsula mccabe et al 2006 estimated the form drag with the measurements from drifters and adcp on a headland located in a tidal channel of puget sound washington they found that the major contributors to the form drag concentrated in the lee of headland because of the localized nature of the low in the eddy center the distributing characteristic of form drag of mccabe et al 2006 ensures the spatial distribution of our inversed bfcs and the hypothesis that the progressive tidal currents traveled along the coasts and impeded by headlands can strengthen the form drag and then enlarge the bfcs the examples of this kind include 1 gyeonggi bay v1 2 western korea bay v2 3 liaodong bay v3 4 bohai bay v4 5 laizhou bay v5 and 6 the south coast of shandong peninsula v6 and v8 according to hui et al 2010 and zu et al 2008 the tidal waves from the northwestern pacific propagate and pass taiwan island and then turn in southwest direction therefore the high value bfc area along the fujian coast in the western side of taiwan straight v7 can also be attributed to the form drag introduced by the taiwan island the relation between the headland features and the relevant average values of bfcs listed in table 4 shows that the sharpest headland t3 has the largest average value of bfcs v3 the larger aspect ratio of the headland generally corresponds to the higher bfc fig 8 which agrees with the variation trend obtained by warner and maccready 2009 offshore sand banks are characterized by strong tidal currents typically 0 5 2 5 ms 1 on a spatial scale of 3 23 km in length and 7 5 30 m in height off 1963 such sand banks occur as a geomorphological feature in the south yellow sea between the changjiang yangtze river estuary and the abandoned yellow river mouth fig 7b area v9 locates in these radial sand ridges rsr off jiangsu coast which is characterized by multiple underwater sand ridges the rsr system consists of more than 70 sand ridges and tidal channels ranging up to about 25 m in depth xing et al 2012 concluded that the locally trapped poincaré waves induced the convergent and divergent radial tidal flows that controlled the depositional processes maintaining the radial ridge pattern the correspondence between high value bfc areas and tidal sand ridges tsr are shown in fig 7b the high value bfc areas v1 v2 v9 and v12 overlap with tsr4 tsr3 tsr6 and tsr8 table 5 the average values of bfcs of v1 v2 v3 and v9 are nearly 2 8 3 9 4 2 3 2 times larger than the constant value of bfc used in egbert et al 2004 and nearly 5 1 7 3 7 8 6 0 times larger compared to the average values of bfcs in he et al 2004 sand ridges may enhance the friction effect under the strong tidal currents which can explain the distribution of these large bfc areas the water depth of the okinawa trough varies from shallow to 2334 m comparing the variability of the seabed topography in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea individually the greatly varying topography around okinawa trough probably is one reason for the increasing values of bfcs v12 on the other hand the internal tide induced energy conversion from barotropic to baroclinic is one plausible explanation for v12 as well 4 5 possible relation with sediment type roughness length z 0 depends not only on the viscosity of the water and the current speed but also on the dimensions of the physical roughness of the seabed bricker et al 2005 lacy et al 2005 ganju and sherwood 2010 mullarney et al 2017 the value of z 0 can vary greatly with the different mixture of sediment types soulsby 1983 several previous works have tried to realize the spatiality of bfcs by correlating them with z 0 dyer 1986 nicolle and karpytchev 2007 mayo et al 2014 the generation of the relatively high value bfc areas in the middle of the south yellow sea v10 and zhejiang coast v11 is still a mystery the topography of these areas is relatively flat compared with the tsr and they are not in the lee side of kelvin waves it is assumed that the varying sediment types and the corresponding bottom roughness contribute to their large bfc values the positions of high value bfc areas in byecs are compared with the sediment types and environments reviewed by li et al 2014 based on the ocean circulation system li et al 2006 in byecs fig 9a sands and other suspended materials transferred by coastal currents and warm currents sink in the eddy areas and the pathways of coastal currents forming muddy areas fig 9b shows the centers longitudinal and latitudinal ranges of muddy areas according to li et al 2014 the transportation and accumulation of sediments are likely to change the bottom roughness ripples and dunes etc resulting in the high value bfcs the high value bfc areas v4 v10 v11 and v12 overlap with muddy areas m1 m3 m6 and m5 respectively table 5 the discharged fine sediments from korea peninsula s rivers sink in the western coast and the thickness of muddy zones can reach 50 m li et al 2014 for areas v10 and v11 the mixture of different sediments might have two effects 1 it might increase the value of z 0 h which leads to the increasing value of bfcs soulsby 1983 and 2 the sediments are rippled which then increases the value of z 0 h because of the enlarged form drag warner and maccready 2009 according to the distribution of bfcs in byecs obtained by pringle et al 2018 the yellow sea was designated as a mud sediment type in the census sediment database and leaded to small values of bottom drag coefficient between 7 5 10 4 and 2 0 10 3 while there was a sand zone in the south yellow sea and made drag coefficient to exceed 4 0 10 3 the different sediment type of the south yellow sea compared with other areas of the yellow sea presumably allowed for the formation of mega dunes and ripples and increased the drag coefficient eventually the unexplained area v13 is very close to the open boundaries therefore the estimation may be influenced with errors it cannot be explained with the hypothesizes above 5 summary the two dimensional adjoint tidal model has been shown to be efficient for tides and oceanic parameters estimation after increasing the spatial resolution of the model to 1 12 1 12 and assimilating the satellite observations from multi missions the main purposes of this study are to unveil the spatiality of bfcs in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea and find out the relationships between the value of bfc and water depth depth averaged tidal current velocity topography and sediment type in the numerical experiment observations from altimeters and tidal gauge stations are assimilated to simulate the m 2 tide and estimate the bfcs in byecs the average and maximum values of bfcs in the bohai sea are 2 5 10 3 and 0 013 respectively 2 7 10 3 and 0 025 for the north yellow sea 2 9 10 3 and 0 030 for the south yellow sea and 2 2 10 3 and 0 019 for the east china sea the characteristics of spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs are 1 the values of bfcs in shallow water are usually larger than those in deep water and they are not necessarily on the order of 10 3 but can reach the order of 10 2 in some shallow areas 2 the values of bfcs generally decrease with the strengthened depth averaged tidal current velocity 3 the high value bfc areas along the coasts always appear in the downstream side of a headland or a peninsula because of the generation of pressure difference and the increasing form drag when flows pass through bulged shaped terrain i e the high value bfc areas in the western coast of korea peninsula and southern coast of shandong peninsula are both influenced by the headlands 4 the radially distributing sand ridges caused by strong tidal currents may enhance the form drag and the value of bfc i e the high value bfc area in jiangsu coast overlaps with the tidal sand ridges 5 the mixture of different sediment types can change the bottom roughness and affect the value of bfc i e the corresponding positions between the high value bfc area in the middle of the south yellow sea and the muddy area the bfc can be influenced by the water depth current velocity varying topography and sediment types and environments however the major influencing factors of bfcs in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea are different this work has shown the feasibility of the methodology of spatially varying parameters and has obtained a more specific spatial distribution of bfcs in the bohai yellow and east china seas while the plausible sources of the high value bfcs

23907,in order to estimate the spatially varying bottom friction coefficients bfcs in the bohai yellow and east china seas byecs multi mission satellite observations from topex poseidon jason 1 and jason 2 are assimilated into a two dimensional tidal model with an adjoint method this work aims to 1 study the characteristics of spatially varying bfcs in byecs and 2 find out the possible sources and mechanisms of spatially varying bfcs in the numerical experiment the m 2 tide is simulated and the spatially varying bfcs in byecs are estimated by assimilating observations from tidal gauge stations and multi mission altimeters the simulated m 2 tide matches well with the tide gauge data indicating the reasonability of present methodology of spatially varying bfcs the characteristics and possible mechanisms of the spatially varying bfcs in byecs are concluded and discussed and the main conclusions include 1 the values of bfcs in shallow water are usually larger than those in deep water which can reach the order of 10 2 in shallow areas 2 the values of bfcs generally decrease with the strengthened depth averaged tidal current velocity in byecs 3 the high value bfc areas near the coasts always appear in the downstream sides of headlands or peninsulas which are possibly caused by the propagation of tidal waves 4 the high value bfc area along jiangsu coast is affected by the bottom morphology of radially distributed tidal sand ridges which might enhance the form drag 5 the high value bfc areas in the middle of the south yellow sea and fujian coast correspond to the muddy areas where the mixture of different sediment types changes the bottom roughness keywords bottom friction coefficient adjoint method two dimensional tide model bohai yellow and east china seas spatially varying 1 introduction bottom friction plays an important role in coastal processes and in the performance of numerical models in shallow seas therefore it is necessary to find out a method that can evaluate the effects of bottom friction effectively and accurately at present one of the main difficulties in parameterizing the bottom friction is its spatial variance ullman and wilson 1998 nicolle and karpytchev 2007 kagan et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 frictional effects between ocean water and seabed can be divided into skin friction and form drag due to different mechanisms form drag is closely related to the topography and skin friction is usually determined by the sediment types both leading to large spatial variations the relation between these two parts is also complex warner and maccready 2009 performed a deep study on the mechanisms of form drag and found that the magnitude of form drag not only depended on the tidal excursion but also on the topography feature by measuring skin friction and near bed velocity profiles over movable ripples li 1994 studied the relations among skin friction geometries of ripples and flow strength and concluded that skin friction tended to decrease when ripples had larger height and length yet the ratio of skin friction to total shear stress increased through the improved flow strength overall the parameterization of bottom friction is a multi scale problem and still needs further studying especially on the characteristics and explanations of its spatial variations and how to realize it in ocean modeling to improve the simulation and prediction with the development of observing technology bottom friction can be calculated from high resolution field measurements such as acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and acoustic doppler velocimetry adv li et al 2004 lozovatsky et al 2008b xu et al 2017 fan et al 2019 however this type of in situ measurements is usually sparse due to the cost other methods also have been developed to evaluate the bottom friction by using satellite data especially its spatial distributions lu and zhang 2006 zhang et al 2011 guo et al 2017 the bottom friction effect is usually represented by the bottom friction coefficient bfc multiplying the velocity in linear or nonlinear e g quadratic form traditionally the bfc is taken as a constant value in a given study region lee and jung 1999 egbert et al 2004 or different constants in sub domains lardner et al 1993 lee et al 2002 he et al 2004 with these two methods the determination of bfc becomes much easier however the relatively low accuracy makes it not a good choice in order to represent the process more reasonably in physics a methodology was then proposed that the bfc was spatially varying and data assimilation methods were used to develop and realize this methodology das and lardner 1991 1992 ullman and wilson 1998 heemink et al 2002 the combination of four dimensional variational 4dvar data assimilation and adjoint method has been proven to be effective in the optimization or estimation of initial conditions and control variables in oceanic and atmospheric models with this methodology a large amount of observations in time and space can be directly assimilated into the model under the constraint of dynamical equations thacker and long 1988 li et al 1994 navon 1998 navon 1998 presented a comprehensive overview of parameter estimation in meteorology and oceanography in view of applications of 4dvar data assimilation techniques to inverse parameter estimation problems ullman and wilson 1998 assimilated adcp data into a tidal model and used adjoint method to investigate the variability of the spatially varying bfcs in the lower hudson estuary lu and zhang 2006 studied the spatial distribution of bfcs in the east china seas by assimilating topex poseidon t p altimeter data zhang et al 2011 found that the parameterizations of linear bottom friction were applicable to a regional ocean tidal model with the combination of spatially varying parameters and an adjoint method guo et al 2017 applied surface spline interpolation for bfcs inversion in the bohai sea while the constructed surface was smoother than traditional methods due to the large amount of satellite observations such as t p and jason series jason 1 jason 2 etc the understanding on ocean processes including tide egbert et al 2004 ocean circulation lázaro et al 2005 and mesoscale eddies chelton et al 2011 etc has been improved significantly egbert and ray 2000 moreover with the primary and interleaved missions of t p jason 1 j1 and jason 2 j2 the distance of adjacent ground tracks was reduced by half while the number of available observations was almost doubled in a given domain subrahmanyam et al 2009 detected rossby waves with multi mission satellite observations in the indian ocean pujol et al 2010 investigated the differences after assimilating sea level observations from multi altimeters into the mediterranean forecasting model with the increased amount of satellite data and enhanced resolution of observations the differences between modeling results and observations were also reduced cheng et al 2016 confirmed the feasibility of increasing altimeter observations for the simulation of principal tides in the bohai yellow and east china seas byecs they compared the differences in tidal simulation using observations from different missions the results showed that observations from t p jason primary and interleaved missions led to the best simulation results as indicated above the spatial variation of bfcs is a rather complex problem which is important for the ocean modeling and calculation of energy dissipation consequently the present paper will focus on the estimation of spatially varying bfcs in byecs in previous papers on this topic lu and zhang 2006 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 the quantity of satellite observations employed in the parameter estimation and the spatial resolution of their numerical models were limited while satellite observations from multi missions are assimilated during the bfc optimization in this study with an enhancement in the spatial resolution of numerical model the main purposes of this study are that 1 obtaining the spatial distribution of bfcs in the bohai yellow and east china seas and concluding the distributing characteristics and 2 finding the possible sources and mechanisms of the estimated spatially varying bfcs the organization of this paper is as follows the two dimensional adjoint tidal model and datasets are described in section 2 section 3 analyzes and discusses the results of the numerical experiment section 4 discusses the characteristics and possible mechanisms of estimated spatially varying bfcs and section 5 lists the conclusions of this work 2 methods and numerical model 2 1 governing equations of forward model the governing equations for vertically

boundary conditions and empirical parameters the cost function which measures the differences between observations and simulation results will be minimized by optimizing the control variables the cost function decreases along the opposite direction of the gradients with respect to the control variables and this gradient is calculated by solving the adjoint equations in order to construct the governing equations of the adjoint model the cost function is defined as 2 j ζ 1 2 k ζ ω t s ζ ζ ˆ 2 d s d t and the lagrangian function is defined as 3 l ω t s μ u t u a u λ ν r u φ u ν tan φ r f ν k

section are both based on lu and zhang 2006 2 3 estimation algorithm of spatially varying bfcs in the estimation of bfcs only some selected nodes independent points will be optimized and the values of the rest nodes are obtained by interpolation therefore the target parameters being optimized are defined at the independent points this way the dimension of the parameter space is reduced thereby reducing the ill posedness of inverse problems zhang and wang 2014 in this study the cressman linear interpolation is applied to obtain the bfcs for the entire domain let b m n be a series of independent bfc and k j k is the result of linear interpolation with b m n then the cressman interpolation is defined as follows 6 k j k m n ϕ j k m n b m n where ϕ j k m n is the coefficient of linear interpolation with the form 7 ϕ j k m n w j k m n m n w j k m n in which w j k m n is the weight coefficient in cressman form cressman 1959 8 w j k m n d 2 r j k m n 2 d 2 r j k m n 2 where r j k m n is the distance between a grid node j k and an independent node m n and d is the influencing radius of independent node the gradient of lagrangian function with respect to the independent bfcs is given as 9 l b m n i j k ω t s ϕ j k m n ϕ j 1 k m n 2 μ j k i 1 u j k i 2 ν j k i 2 α u j k i 1 1 α u j k i h j 1 2 k ζ j 1 2 k i i j k ω t s ϕ j k m n ϕ j k 1 m n 2 υ j k i 1 ν j k i 2 u j k i 2 α ν j k i 1 1 α ν j k i h j 1 2 k ζ j 1 2 k i where i is the index of timestep and α is a constant and α 0 1 u j k and ν j k are the spatially averaged four point average velocity in order to obtain a smooth numerical result they have the following expressions in arakawa c grid u j k u j k u j 1 k u j k 1 u j 1 k 1 4 ν j k ν j k ν j k 1 ν j 1 k ν j 1 k 1 4 as the cost function decreases along the opposite direction of the gradient the correction of independent bfcs can be obtained as 10 k c b m n b ˆ m n l b m n l b 2 0 i e b m n b ˆ m n 1 k c l b m n l b 2 and l b 2 m n l b m n 2 1 2 where b ˆ m n and b m n are the prior and optimized values of independent bfcs respectively and k c is an empirical constant controlling the smoothness of bfc in the iterative process l b m n the gradient of lagrangian function with respect to the independent bfcs is unitized first which means only the direction of the gradient is used in optimization in this paper in order to ensure the cost function can decrease continuously and without fluctuations 1 k c is obtained through a trial and error procedure and finally taken as 10 4 2 4 datasets the observations employed in this study are divided into three groups the first group is the primary missions of altimeters including the tidal harmonic constants derived from ten years t p seven years j1 and eight years j2 primary missions the second group is the interleaved missions of altimeters including the joint of three years t p and j1 interleaved missions tpn and j1n respectively and the last group is in situ measurements from tidal gauge stations hereafter the first group and the second group are simplified as prim and intlm respectively the combination of prim and intlm not only increases the number of available satellite observations but also improves the spatial resolution of observations as the distance of adjacent ground tracks is reduced by half the distribution of ground tracks and other details of prim and intlm are shown in fig 1a and table 1 respectively these datasets have been proven to be useful in tidal research cheng and andersen 2011 applied multi mission satellite observations into a global tide model to improve oceanic tidal results in shallow water all satellite datasets used in this study are developed validated and distributed by the ctoh legos france http ctoh legos obs mip fr the observations of the third group are from 89 tidal gauge stations mainly concentrated along coasts and islands 2 5 model configuration the computing area is the byecs covered from 23 5 n to 41 n and 117 e to 131 e the spatial and temporal resolution of the two dimensional model is 1 12 1 12 and 18 631 s 1 2400 of the m 2 tide period respectively the gridded topography is based on etopo1 and some in situ measurements fig 1 while the deepest water depth of the computing area is 2322 meters m the open boundary conditions are obtained from the global ocean tide model dtu10 cheng and andersen 2011 and the open boundary conditions are fixed during the optimization of bfcs the effect of horizontal viscosity coefficient is taken as a constant with a value of 5 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 the efficiency of the two dimensional tidal adjoint model on tide simulation and parameter optimization has been proven in zhang et al 2011 and wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 applied adjoint method to examine the linear and nonlinear parameterizations of bottom friction for the two dimensional tidal model they implemented a series of ideal experiments to test and validate the numerical model in which they studied the influencing factors of the bottom friction parameterizations e g the prescribed bfc shape the choice of bfc initial value and the addition of artificial error in the assimilated observation the results proved the efficiency of the numerical model on the bfc optimization with the same method wang et al 2014 estimated the bfcs of byecs by assimilating observations from t p and concluded an empirical expression of bfc value and water depth 3 numerical experiment 3 1 numerical experiment setup in this section a numerical experiment is implemented to estimate the spatially varying bfcs in byecs the iterative process of the parameter estimation with the adjoint method in oceanic modeling can be summarized as follows 1 providing open boundary conditions and initial guess values of model parameters 2 assimilating the observations to estimate model parameter 3 judging whether the criterion pertinent to the differences between model outputs and observations is satisfied the iteration is terminated if the criterion is satisfied otherwise the adjoint variables are computed by running the backward model through which the gradients of cost functions with respect to the target parameters can be calculated 4 based on the gradients the target parameters are estimated and updated in order to apply the estimation algorithm of spatially varying bfcs a series of independent points are selected and optimized values of other grid points are obtained by linearly interpolating the values at these independent points for independent points the influencing radius is 0 5 and the initial guesses are 0 002 because the empirical values of bfcs in byecs are in the interval of 0 001 0 003 the observations from prim intlm and tidal gauge stations are all assimilated in the numerical experiment the differences between simulated results and observed data in terms of amplitude and phase lag are calculated 3 2 analysis of the numerical experiment the error statistics between model results and observed data in the numerical experiment are listed in table 2 the mean absolute errors maes between simulated results and observed data from altimeters are 6 4 cm in amplitude and 6 7 in phase lag comparing the simulated results with observed data from tidal gauge stations the maes are 8 5 cm in amplitude and 8 2 in phase lag the differences between observed and simulated values in previous studies lu and zhang 2006 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 are exhibited in table 2 as well the data misfit between model output and observations in our study is similar with theirs the co tidal chart of the simulated m 2 tide shown in fig 2a illustrates the propagation pattern of m 2 tide in byecs fig 2b shows the strength of the tidal currents by depicting the tidal ellipses at independent points tidal currents along the gyeongg bay west korea bay liaodong bay jiangsu coast zhejiang coast and fujian coast are relatively strong in byecs the m 2 tidal waves from the pacific propagate into the east china sea and separate into two branches the majority spreads into the yellow sea in the form of a progressive wave and then separates into two standing wave systems rotating counterclockwise under the influence of coriolis force and shandong peninsula the other branch spreading to the zhejiang coast and fujian coast also transforms into a standing wave system for the propagation of m2 tide there are four rotating systems located in the liaodong bay yellow river mouth north yellow sea and south yellow sea which are similar with the simulated results of fang et al 2004 a detailed description of the tidal dynamics from the point of view of kelvin and poincaré waves is presented in the next section the propagation pattern of the simulated m 2 tide in byecs from the numerical experiment agrees with cheng et al 2007 and the following analysis will focus on the spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs the spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs is depicted in fig 3 and the statistical values are listed in table 3 the average value of bfcs of the whole study area byecs is 2 2 10 3 the bfcs at 42 of the grid points are smaller than 0 001 while 2 are larger than 0 01 53 and 3 grid points fall in the interval 0 001 0 005 and 0 005 0 01 respectively the average values of bfcs are 0 0025 0 0027 0 0029 and 0 0022 for the bohai sea the north yellow sea the south yellow sea and the east china sea respectively specifically there are three high value bfc areas in the bohai sea i e the maximum value of bfcs in liaodong bay v3 is 0 0126 0 0094 in bohai bay v4 and 0 0036 in laizhou bay v5 these spatial features of bfcs in the bohai sea correspond well with guo et al 2017 the maximum bfc value of the yellow sea is 0 03 west of korea peninsula v1 v2 while the values in haizhou bay v8 and jiangsu coast v9 are the second largest there is a relatively high value area in the center of the south yellow sea v10 similar to the distributions given by zhang et al 2011 and pringle et al 2018 in the east china sea the values of bfcs near the zhejiang coast v11 fujian coast v7 and northwest of the okinawa trough v12 are relatively high as well the inversed bfcs in byecs are compared with calculation results from field measurements and other model results to evaluate the accuracy of the present spatial distribution respectively fan et al 2019 studied the time variations of bfcs from eight mooring stations in byecs and analyzed the contributions from currents and waves respectively in their study the average values of current induced bfcs in the bohai bay the south yellow sea and the east china sea were 0 0021 0 0033 and 0 0022 respectively while the maximum values reached 0 0064 0 0141 and 0 0083 during the observing period comparing to their estimations there is a good coherence between our inversed bfcs and theirs while the inversed bfcs in byecs from other previous works e g lu and zhang 2006 and wang et al 2014 were underestimated pringle et al 2018 proposed a semidata informed method that the spatially varying bfc was calculated as a function of some parameters of the seabed and physical properties of the flow e g median sediment grain diameter sediment density mean current speed etc the spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs from their work showed that there was a high value bfc area in the south yellow sea as well and the values of bfcs were 0 004 the spatially distributing characteristics of bfcs in byecs can be concluded as follows 1 the high value bfc areas mainly concentrate along the coasts while there are two exceptions in the middle of the south yellow sea and northwest of the okinawa trough 2 the maximum values of the high value bfc areas are on order of 10 2 while the empirical value of bfc is assigned with an order of 10 3 3 the values of bfcs in v1 v7 v10 and v11 are larger than those in the previous work lu and zhang 2006 4 discussions of the spatiality of bfcs 4 1 sources of the spatiality of bfcs according to soulsby 1983 the total seabed shear stress τ is made up from three parts due to 1 the skin friction produced by and acting on the sediment grains 2 the form drag produced by the pressure field associated with the flow over ripples and or large features over the bed warner and maccready 2009 and 3 a sediment transport contributed by momentum transfer to mobilize the grains damgaard et al 1997 the bed shear stress can be calculated in terms of depth averaged velocity or bottom layer velocity with a nonlinear quadratic friction law of the form zhang et al 2011 11 τ n l ρ c d u 2 or with a linear law with the form 12 τ l ρ c s u where ρ is the density of water c d and c s are the bfcs which are key parameters for the parameterization of bottom friction effect the optimized bfcs of byecs from numerical experiment in section 3 are the quadratic form of friction coefficient by assuming the current velocity u varies with the height z above the seabed according to the logarithmic velocity profile the most commonly used assumption based on logarithmic relationship gives c d as green and mccave 1995 bricker et al 2005 liu and wei 2007 lozovatsky et al 2008b trowbridge and lentz 2018 13 c d κ 1 ln z 0 h 2 where z 0 is the bed roughness length and κ is von karman s constant and usually with value of 0 4 according to eq 13 the value of c d is determined by the bed roughness length z 0 and the water depth h which are the two sources of the complex spatiality of c d in most studies c d is usually assigned as a simple constant with an order of 10 3 however it is arbitrary because the spatial variations might introduce more complexity to the hydrodynamics damgaard et al 1997 nicolle and karpytchev 2007 kagan et al 2012 song et al 2013 the flow field can contribute to the spatiality of bfcs as well especially in the coastal ocean the bottom boundary layer is significantly affected by surface gravity waves which can produce apparent velocity fluctuations and influence the seafloor damgaard et al 1997 consequently the bed shear stress not only depends on currents but also on waves and wave current interaction which increases the complexity of bfcs therefore the characteristics of the spatial distribution of bfcs and the possible reasons for the locations of high value bfc areas are discussed 4 2 possible relation with water depth in the field of engineering the chezy coefficient c and manning s n are commonly used which gives the formula as 14 c d g c 2 g n 2 h 1 3 eqs 13 and 14 both indicate that water depth is a key variable in calculating c d fig 4 shows the values of bfcs versus the water depth at independent points in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea respectively in order to examine the relations between bfcs and water depth the average values of bfcs at each specific depth are calculated in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea individually fig 5 the most notable pattern is that the values of bfcs in shallow water are usually larger than those in deep water especially in the bohai sea and the yellow sea in the east china sea the average value of bfcs first decreases within water depth less than 50 m and then increases to a constant value usually the values of bfcs are assigned with the order of 10 3 however figs 3 4 show that they can reach the order of 10 2 in some shallow areas in all three seas table 3 similarly the drag coefficients in the forest of cu lao dung island in the mekong delta vietnam were 10 30 times larger than usual observations i e 0 032 in the forest 0 041 in the fringe and 0 002 in sand and mudflat environments mullarney et al 2017 in the study of mofjeld 1988 a level 2 5 turbulence closure model was used to investigate the dependence on water depth of bottom stress and quadratic drag coefficient for a steady barotropic pressure driven current in un stratified water when the current was the primary source of turbulence he found that the depth averaged bfc depended primarily on the ratio h z 0 and the bfc varied inversely with the ratio above in johns et al 1990 similar relation between c d and relative roughness z 0 h had been shown in the study of ullman and wilson 1998 the temporal and spatial variability of the bfc was studied and they also found larger bfc in shallower water the negative correlation between bfc and water depth in this paper agrees well with the conclusions indicated above however a positive correlation between bfc and water depth is found in the water depth interval 50 m 160 m which is similar with the varying pattern of li et al 2004 they found that the values of bfcs in james river estuary first showed a negative correlation with the water depth less than 9 m then the correlation became positive when the water depth was larger than 9 m the non uniform bottom roughness had been used to account for the pattern of positive correlation and they also found that in deeper water stratification might affect the bfc as well in the following discussion the changes of bottom roughness caused by topography and sediment types are considered to explain the spatial variability of bfcs in byecs 4 3 possible relation with depth averaged tidal current velocity in the previous studies there was a negative relation between bfcs and flow velocity cheng et al 1999 liu and wei 2007 fan et al 2019 with the field investigation implemented in san francisco bay california cheng et al 1999 proposed a critical flow velocity ranged from 0 25 m s to 0 30 m s and found that c d decreased linearly when the flow velocity was larger than the critical value bricker et al 2005 studied the variations of c d under wind waves at a shallow site when mean current velocity was much greater than the maximum near bed wave induced orbital velocity c d converged to a canonical value of 0 0025 if the mean current velocity was much less than the near bed orbital velocity there was an increase in c d of an order of magnitude over the canonical value in jiaozhou bay of the yellow sea liu and wei 2007 found that the maximum minimum values of c d corresponded to the minimum maximum values of flow velocity fig 6 shows the relations between the inversed bfcs and the depth averaged tidal current velocity at independent points in the bohai yellow and east china seas respectively for the byecs and the east china sea the values of bfcs generally decrease with the strengthened tidal current velocity which corresponds with the previous conclusions for the bohai sea and the yellow sea there are small fluctuations in 0 03 m s and 0 10 m s respectively that bfcs slightly increase with the increasing velocity there are differences between the previous studies and our results in the correlation of bfcs and the reference velocity it needs to be referred that the field investigation of cheng et al 1999 was carried out in a semi enclosed tidal basin with water depth around 16 m while the broadband acoustic doppler current profilers were used to measure the turbulent averaged velocity profile within 1 5 m above seabed therefore the reference velocity in their conclusion was the time averaged current velocity of the bottom boundary layer under the effects of diurnal and semidiurnal tides and stratification while the reference velocity in fig 6 of our study is the depth averaged tidal current velocity under the simulation of m2 tide only based on the simulated m2 tide in byecs fig 2b the correlation of high value bfc areas and depth averaged tidal current velocity is exhibited in table 5 while the high value bfc areas v1 v2 v3 v7 v8 v9 v10 v11 and v12 are related with strengthened tidal currents 4 4 possible relation with form drag on non flat seabed with limited sediment transport the total bed shear stress is composed of two contributions the skin friction and the form drag while form drag is substantially larger than frictional drag damgaard et al 1997 wijesekera et al 2014 according to the simulated results of tidal flow field fig 2 and the morphology of byecs the theory of form drag warner and maccready 2009 is used to explain the larger values of bfcs along the coasts for example the western coast of korea peninsula v1 fig 3 the mechanism for the generation and propagation of kelvin and poincaré waves can be traced back to taylor 1919 and hendershott and speranza 1971 for byecs they were recently studied in jung et al 2005 and xing et al 2012 as shown in fig 7a the incoming rotating shallow water wave from the east china sea propagates into the yellow sea with two branches the right branch propagates along the western coast of korea peninsula in the form of kelvin wave kw 1 the left branch enters the south yellow sea in the form of the incoming tidal frequency plane poincaré wave pw kw 1 continues to travel along the coast of korea and china into the bohai sea kw 2 then it passes the shandong peninsula and reaches jiangsu coast which is in the north of yangtze river estuary the traveling pw in the south yellow sea meets the shandong peninsula and reflects in the form of counter propagating kelvin wave kw 3 together with the kw 2 from shandong peninsula kw 3 and kw 2 form the kelvin waves along jiangsu coast kw 3 kw 3 and pw joint together near the area of 32 n 33 5 n and are trapped off the jiangsu coast in order to characterize the features of headlands t1 t7 in byecs the nondimensional parameter ϒ the aspect ratio of the headland is used to define how sharp or streamlined each headland is table 4 15 ϒ across channel headland width along channel e folding headland length l a c l a l which was first introduced by warner and maccready 2009 comparing the propagation of tidal waves headland features and the locations of high value bfc areas figs 2 3 the most apparent pattern is that the high value bfc areas always appear in the downstream side of a headland or a peninsula mccabe et al 2006 estimated the form drag with the measurements from drifters and adcp on a headland located in a tidal channel of puget sound washington they found that the major contributors to the form drag concentrated in the lee of headland because of the localized nature of the low in the eddy center the distributing characteristic of form drag of mccabe et al 2006 ensures the spatial distribution of our inversed bfcs and the hypothesis that the progressive tidal currents traveled along the coasts and impeded by headlands can strengthen the form drag and then enlarge the bfcs the examples of this kind include 1 gyeonggi bay v1 2 western korea bay v2 3 liaodong bay v3 4 bohai bay v4 5 laizhou bay v5 and 6 the south coast of shandong peninsula v6 and v8 according to hui et al 2010 and zu et al 2008 the tidal waves from the northwestern pacific propagate and pass taiwan island and then turn in southwest direction therefore the high value bfc area along the fujian coast in the western side of taiwan straight v7 can also be attributed to the form drag introduced by the taiwan island the relation between the headland features and the relevant average values of bfcs listed in table 4 shows that the sharpest headland t3 has the largest average value of bfcs v3 the larger aspect ratio of the headland generally corresponds to the higher bfc fig 8 which agrees with the variation trend obtained by warner and maccready 2009 offshore sand banks are characterized by strong tidal currents typically 0 5 2 5 ms 1 on a spatial scale of 3 23 km in length and 7 5 30 m in height off 1963 such sand banks occur as a geomorphological feature in the south yellow sea between the changjiang yangtze river estuary and the abandoned yellow river mouth fig 7b area v9 locates in these radial sand ridges rsr off jiangsu coast which is characterized by multiple underwater sand ridges the rsr system consists of more than 70 sand ridges and tidal channels ranging up to about 25 m in depth xing et al 2012 concluded that the locally trapped poincaré waves induced the convergent and divergent radial tidal flows that controlled the depositional processes maintaining the radial ridge pattern the correspondence between high value bfc areas and tidal sand ridges tsr are shown in fig 7b the high value bfc areas v1 v2 v9 and v12 overlap with tsr4 tsr3 tsr6 and tsr8 table 5 the average values of bfcs of v1 v2 v3 and v9 are nearly 2 8 3 9 4 2 3 2 times larger than the constant value of bfc used in egbert et al 2004 and nearly 5 1 7 3 7 8 6 0 times larger compared to the average values of bfcs in he et al 2004 sand ridges may enhance the friction effect under the strong tidal currents which can explain the distribution of these large bfc areas the water depth of the okinawa trough varies from shallow to 2334 m comparing the variability of the seabed topography in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea individually the greatly varying topography around okinawa trough probably is one reason for the increasing values of bfcs v12 on the other hand the internal tide induced energy conversion from barotropic to baroclinic is one plausible explanation for v12 as well 4 5 possible relation with sediment type roughness length z 0 depends not only on the viscosity of the water and the current speed but also on the dimensions of the physical roughness of the seabed bricker et al 2005 lacy et al 2005 ganju and sherwood 2010 mullarney et al 2017 the value of z 0 can vary greatly with the different mixture of sediment types soulsby 1983 several previous works have tried to realize the spatiality of bfcs by correlating them with z 0 dyer 1986 nicolle and karpytchev 2007 mayo et al 2014 the generation of the relatively high value bfc areas in the middle of the south yellow sea v10 and zhejiang coast v11 is still a mystery the topography of these areas is relatively flat compared with the tsr and they are not in the lee side of kelvin waves it is assumed that the varying sediment types and the corresponding bottom roughness contribute to their large bfc values the positions of high value bfc areas in byecs are compared with the sediment types and environments reviewed by li et al 2014 based on the ocean circulation system li et al 2006 in byecs fig 9a sands and other suspended materials transferred by coastal currents and warm currents sink in the eddy areas and the pathways of coastal currents forming muddy areas fig 9b shows the centers longitudinal and latitudinal ranges of muddy areas according to li et al 2014 the transportation and accumulation of sediments are likely to change the bottom roughness ripples and dunes etc resulting in the high value bfcs the high value bfc areas v4 v10 v11 and v12 overlap with muddy areas m1 m3 m6 and m5 respectively table 5 the discharged fine sediments from korea peninsula s rivers sink in the western coast and the thickness of muddy zones can reach 50 m li et al 2014 for areas v10 and v11 the mixture of different sediments might have two effects 1 it might increase the value of z 0 h which leads to the increasing value of bfcs soulsby 1983 and 2 the sediments are rippled which then increases the value of z 0 h because of the enlarged form drag warner and maccready 2009 according to the distribution of bfcs in byecs obtained by pringle et al 2018 the yellow sea was designated as a mud sediment type in the census sediment database and leaded to small values of bottom drag coefficient between 7 5 10 4 and 2 0 10 3 while there was a sand zone in the south yellow sea and made drag coefficient to exceed 4 0 10 3 the different sediment type of the south yellow sea compared with other areas of the yellow sea presumably allowed for the formation of mega dunes and ripples and increased the drag coefficient eventually the unexplained area v13 is very close to the open boundaries therefore the estimation may be influenced with errors it cannot be explained with the hypothesizes above 5 summary the two dimensional adjoint tidal model has been shown to be efficient for tides and oceanic parameters estimation after increasing the spatial resolution of the model to 1 12 1 12 and assimilating the satellite observations from multi missions the main purposes of this study are to unveil the spatiality of bfcs in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea and find out the relationships between the value of bfc and water depth depth averaged tidal current velocity topography and sediment type in the numerical experiment observations from altimeters and tidal gauge stations are assimilated to simulate the m 2 tide and estimate the bfcs in byecs the average and maximum values of bfcs in the bohai sea are 2 5 10 3 and 0 013 respectively 2 7 10 3 and 0 025 for the north yellow sea 2 9 10 3 and 0 030 for the south yellow sea and 2 2 10 3 and 0 019 for the east china sea the characteristics of spatial distribution of bfcs in byecs are 1 the values of bfcs in shallow water are usually larger than those in deep water and they are not necessarily on the order of 10 3 but can reach the order of 10 2 in some shallow areas 2 the values of bfcs generally decrease with the strengthened depth averaged tidal current velocity 3 the high value bfc areas along the coasts always appear in the downstream side of a headland or a peninsula because of the generation of pressure difference and the increasing form drag when flows pass through bulged shaped terrain i e the high value bfc areas in the western coast of korea peninsula and southern coast of shandong peninsula are both influenced by the headlands 4 the radially distributing sand ridges caused by strong tidal currents may enhance the form drag and the value of bfc i e the high value bfc area in jiangsu coast overlaps with the tidal sand ridges 5 the mixture of different sediment types can change the bottom roughness and affect the value of bfc i e the corresponding positions between the high value bfc area in the middle of the south yellow sea and the muddy area the bfc can be influenced by the water depth current velocity varying topography and sediment types and environments however the major influencing factors of bfcs in the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea are different this work has shown the feasibility of the methodology of spatially varying parameters and has obtained a more specific spatial distribution of bfcs in the bohai yellow and east china seas while the plausible sources of the high value bfcs

23908,two and three dimensional models are proposed for ocean wave attenuation due to scattering by ice floes in the marginal ice zone in which the attenuation rate depends on the horizontal size of the individual floes the scattering models are shown to reproduce the behaviour of wave attenuation over short wave periods however it is shown that scattering alone cannot explain the observed asymptotic dependence of attenuation at long wave periods based on these findings it is proposed that attenuation models consist of a scattering component supplemented by an empirical damping term based on measurements so that attenuation over all periods is correctly modelled computer code to calculate wave attenuation through a field of ice floes is provided in the supplementary material keywords sea ice ocean waves scattering 1 introduction understanding the interaction between ocean waves and the sea ice covered ocean has applications ranging from predicting sea ice extent to safe navigation ocean waves are frequently observed to impact the sea ice cover and to be attenuated by the ice cover 32 39 there is evidence that ocean waves modulate sea ice extent 4 7 13 54 55 79 and that attenuation of waves by sea ice protects ice shelves 15 35 a concerted effort has emerged to include and evolve the coupled representation of sea ice and ocean surface waves into large scale models for improved ice ocean physics and prediction 4 14 22 27 28 41 54 74 76 this effort has been focused mainly on the marginal ice zone miz where sea ice is highly fragmented mobile and in contact with ocean waves models include a parameterisation of the wave attenuation coefficient i e the exponential rate of wave attenuation over distance travelled generically written α a t h a where a is the wave amplitude t is wave period h is sea ice thickness and a is the floe radius measurements of wave attenuation by sea ice began with pioneering work by members of the scott polar institute 61 70 in recent years technological developments have allowed more detailed measurements of wave attenuation 1 17 20 26 32 39 40 53 56 57 63 65 and better constraints on the form of α the data collected show the attenuation coefficient for long period waves above 10 s is approximately proportional to the wave period to the power of minus two i e α t 2 for t 10 s theoretical modelling of wave attenuation by sea ice has been the subject of parallel research advances squire 2020 models can be broadly divided into two categories those treating sea ice as a viscous layer weber 1987 keller 1998 wang and shen 2010a sutherland et al 2019 chen et al 2019b cheng et al 2020 and those treating it as a scattering medium meylan et al 1997 kohout and meylan 2009 bennetts et al 2010 bennetts and squire 2012 montiel et al 2016 viscous layer models idealise the field of floes in the miz as a continuum and are intuitively applicable in the long wavelength limit the layer models have been extended beyond viscosity for example 69 considered attenuation due to turbulence in contrast scattering models involve a large collection of individual floes where the standard model for wave scattering by a single floe is based on a floating elastic thin plate model and accounts for the compliant bending of large floes while preserving the rigidity of small floes meylan and squire 1994 meylan 2002 bennetts and williams 2010 with the exception of perrie and hu 1996 and the recent work 41 only two dimensional one horizontal dimension and one depth dimension scattering models that have been implemented in large scale prediction models and often assuming floe lengths are much larger than the wavelength to avoid artificial resonance effects 10 30 74 contemporary three dimensional scattering models of wave attenuation peter and meylan 2009 bennetts and squire 2009 bennetts et al 2010 montiel et al 2016 have not yet produced a formula for α suitable for inclusion in large scale models and this is the subject of ongoing research meylan and bennetts 2018 scattering of ocean waves by ice floes only occurs when there is a momentum exchange between the ice floe and ocean waves in turn the momentum exchange implies that a force is applied to the ice floe and hence it is liable to fracture therefore the effect of scattering is central to understanding ice pack break up due to waves and other processes kohout et al 2016 herman et al 2018 after the ice pack has been broken into smaller floes scattering is likely to have a weaker effect especially for the long period waves which persist far into the miz collins et al 2015 dolatshah et al 2018 there is clear evidence from experiments that the ice cover causes energy to be removed from waves at a much greater rate than for an ocean without an ice cover however there is no evidence to show what the mechanism is that removes this energy there is evidence to suggest that it is caused by under ice friction liu and mollo christensen 1988 ardhuin et al 2016 boutin et al 2018 floe collisions shen and squire 1998 bennetts and williams 2015 yiew et al 2017 overwash toffoli et al 2015 nelli et al 2017 2020 or viscoelastic bending wang and shen 2010b mosig et al 2015 there is also evidence that the wave action breaks the floes in a highly active breaking region which scattering is probably dominant until the floes are sufficiently fractured that scattering is negligible and other mechanisms then dominate the wave attenuation ardhuin et al 2020 further evidence of this can be recent results on floe breaking voermans et al 2019 despite the need to model wave attenuation and sea ice fracture accurately a model including all required features of attenuation is lacking this paper proposes an open source model that captures both the short and the long period wave attenuation through the sea ice cover for short periods we use scattering theory to account for the strong attenuation of small floes including the effect of floe size variability for long periods we propose an extra term which is based on experimental measurements which can easily be updated with additional experimental data or appropriate theory the computer code required to run the model is provided as supplementary material 2 attenuation scattering and dissipation there is some ambiguity in the terms attenuation scattering and dissipation and we want to be clear here what we mean by these words attenuation is the observed decrease in wave height as it propagates through the miz scattering is the process that changes the direction of propagation without removing energy and dissipation is a process which removes wave energy both scattering and dissipation can lead to attenuation a critical difference between scattering and dissipation is that scattering will lead to broadening of the wave direction and eventually to an isotropic wave field if there is no significant dissipation this is attested to in models montiel et al 2016 although there is no clear observational evidence scattering must involve momentum exchange and hence high forces and is likely to cause fracture or melting scattering models have clear and straightforward physics which is the basis for offshore engineering and ship design and which has been well validated in laboratory experiments meylan et al 2015 montiel et al 2013a it is possible that scattering only plays a significant role in the active breaking region but we believe its influence is more comprehensive than this however we acknowledge that evidence to prove this is lacking 3 wave scattering by individual ice floes the scattering model treats an ice floe as a floating elastic plate which behaves as a rigid body in the case of long waves or large thickness we present a simple numerical method that works in two and three dimensions to high accuracy and efficiency based on eigenfunction matching the solution in three dimensions was first given by peter et al 2004 and the solution in two dimensions was first given by fox and squire 1994 for the semi infinite case floating elastic plates have been the subject of laboratory experiments to validate and show limitations of the model in terms of the plate motion montiel et al 2013a b meylan et al 2015 yiew et al 2016 and of the scattered wave field bennetts et al 2015 nelli et al 2017 sree et al 2017 while the solution to our problem has appeared previously the simplified numerical solution in two dimensions given below which is based on symmetry has not appeared previously to our knowledge we give detailed descriptions to help to understand the computer code which accompanies the paper we begin by stating the governing equations for the floe water system we assume that the floe has a uniform thickness of h the seafloor is flat and that all motions are time harmonic with radian frequency ω the velocity potential in the water φ can be expressed as 1 φ x z t re ϕ x z e i ω t where the reduced velocity potential ϕ is complex valued and x is the horizontal spatial variable such that x x in two dimensions and x x y in three dimensions and z is the depth variable which points upwards with the water surface at z 0 and the seafloor at z h the ice floe is on the free surface z 0 and occupies the domain ω where 2 ω x x a a is the ice floe radius strictly in two dimensions 2 a is the ice floe length the reduced

areal concentration of the ice cover and α is the attenuation coefficient for simplicity the chosen form of s i c e neglects nonlinear dissipative phenomena believed to occur during wave ice interactions in the scattering regime particularly overwash skene et al 2015 nelli et al 2020 and floe floe collisions shen and squire 1998 bennetts and williams 2015 yiew et al 2017 4 1 attenuation coefficient for two dimensional scattering for the two dimensional scattering model the attenuation coefficient is expressed as α α ˆ 2 a where α ˆ is the attenuation per floe which is 39 α ˆ log t 2 where t 2 represents the energy transmitted by an individual floe the attenuation coefficient 39 is based on the assumption that all reflected energy is removed from the wave field which is equivalent to incoherent wave interactions between the floes this formula is based on results from scattering theory which show how the scattering from a large number of randomly spaced scatterers is connected with individual scattering details of this derivation can be found in bennetts and squire 2012 this formula only works in two dimensions resonance occurs for certain combinations of wave period and floe length such that t 1 and this leads to unrealistic values of the attenuation coefficient α ˆ 0 williams et al 2013a therefore it is typical to average the transmitted energy over a distribution of floe lengths so that 40 α ˆ log t 2 where denotes average which is chosen to be normally distributed with a standard deviation 2 a 5 the choice of standard deviation is somewhat arbitrary but the results presented in section 5 are largely insensitive to the variations in the standard deviation 4 2 attenuation coefficient for three dimensional scattering for the three dimensional scattering model we propose the attenuation coefficient is 41 α 1 a f 0 2 π d θ 2 d θ where a f π a 2 is the area of the ocean surface occupied by an individual floe and the integral is proportional to the energy scattered by the floe meylan et al 1997 attenuation coefficient 41 is based on the assumption that all scattered energy is removed from the wave field this is an approximation that sets an upper bound on the effect of scattering more complicated scattering models are possible meylan et al 2020 4 3 floe size distribution to keep the model simple and easy to implement and evaluate the results we present here and the accompanying code assume all floes are the same size it would be possible to extend the model to a distribution of floe sizes by a suitably weighted average of the results calculated here this would of course also depend on having a suitable floe size distribution this is different from the averaging used in the two dimensional calculations where the floe size distribution was assumed to be normal 5 results 5 1 comparison of two and three dimensional attenuation coefficients we present a few representative figures for the attenuation coefficient comparing the two and three dimensional scattering models we choose the water depth to be the wavelength of the open water wave to approximate infinite depth and set m n 10 in the expansion formulae fig 1 shows the attenuation coefficient as a function of wave period for thickness h 0 5 m and for floe radius a 5 m 10m 25m and 50m the sharp drops in the attenuation coefficient at certain periods for the two dimensional case without averaging is caused by resonance more resonances occur as the floe length increases the resonance is caused by constructive interference of waves reflected at the ends of the ice floe analogous to a fabry perot interferometer it occurs because waves propagate through the flexible ice floe this is a two dimensional phenomenon and does not occur for the three dimensional model in the same simple manner since waves are not restricted to travelling in only the forward and backward direction the resonances are primarily eliminated by averaging although inflexions in the attenuation coefficient still occur at the resonant periods we average by sampling with the mean floe length specified and with a standard deviation one tenth the mean floe length for our calculations here there is some evidence of weak resonance for the three dimensional case with inflexions for the two largest radii the averaging over angle also helps to reduce resonant effects in the three dimensional case note that the resonance occurs at multiples of the wavelength to floe length as the floes become larger there is more possibility for resonances for the wave periods we consider there is no simple formula for these resonances because the wavelength under the ice changes from that of open water and there is no simple value for the reflection figs 2 3 and 4 show similar results for floe thickness h 1 m 1 5m and 2m respectively away from resonances the attenuation coefficient for the two dimensional model is higher than the attenuation coefficient for the three dimensional model for relatively long periods i e periods corresponding to wavelengths much greater than the floe radius the difference is up to two orders of magnitude for long periods and the smallest floes a 5 m more typically the two and three dimensional scattering models give attenuation coefficients of the same order of magnitude and the three dimensional case often exceeds the two dimensional case for the larger floe radii from now on results for the three dimensional case only will be considered 5 2 power laws fig 5 shows log log plots of the attenuation coefficient as a function of wave period for different ice thicknesses for relatively long periods wavelengths greater than the floe radius the attenuation coefficient versus wave period is a straight line with a negative slope in log log space therefore in the long period regime the attenuation coefficient obeys a power law of the form 42 α t p and the best fit values of p for the different thicknesses are shown in the legends the value of p is 8 which is much greater than the values obtained from field measurements i e p 2 meylan et al 2014 or 3 thomson et al 2021 fig 6 shows log log plots of the attenuation coefficient as a function of ice thickness for different values of wave period and floe radius for relatively long periods the attenuation is a straight line with positive slope and therefore 43 α h q for t large the legends show the best fit values of q from which we observe that q is generally insensitive to the wave period and floe radius and q 2 the complicated curves for small floes seen in fig 6 a are caused by resonance effect for rigid floes at short periods such as a resonant bobbing motion 5 3 extending the model to heterogeneous distributions of floes a single floe size cannot describe ice floes in the miz it would be possible to extend the model to the case of floe size distributions by averaging the effects of each floe size we do not attempt that here but note that this would be the logical next step if the scattering model is proven to be suitable 6 comparison with experiments results fig 7 shows a comparison of the attenuation coefficient given by the three dimensional scattering model with attenuation coefficient 44 as given by meylan et al 2014 attenuation due to scattering dominates for short periods and the empirical attenuation coefficient dominates for long periods in field measurements only long period attenuation is likely observed because the scattering attenuation has removed the short periods over a short distance close to the ice edge fig 7 shows a comparison of the attenuation coefficient given by the three dimensional scattering model with experimental data figs 7 a shows a comparison with the analysis presented in 56 in which the fitting is based on wave prediction computational code we believe this is likely the most accurate experimental results the four different lines were based on the sorting of the profiles by their length used in 56 the length is closely related to the wave intensity as a noise floor cut off was used we also note that the negative results were discarded so that a possible upward bias was introduced into the mean values for the low intensity cases the estimated values for the ice thickness were 0 51 m 0 50 m 047 m and 0 37 m for the shortest to longest respectively we run the comparison with a thickness of 0 5 m and a radius of 5 m 10 m and 25 m assuming concentration is 100 the agreement with the 25 m radius and the longest results is remarkable however we do not claim that this is sufficient comparison to validate our model or conclusively prove it we also note that there is a clear divergence in the attenuation for long periods figs 7 b shows a comparison with the results first presented in 39 but updated with a recent analysis which takes into account the noise floor of the wave buoys thomson et al 2021 in this case the comparison is nowhere near as good and the clear problem for long periods is apparent we note that there is no tuning in these results 7 long period dissipation it is clear from the comparison with measurements that scattering cannot account for the dissipation at long periods we propose that the attenuation due to scattering be augmented by the empirical model 44 α c 1 t 2 c 2 t 4 where c 1 2 12 1 0 3 s 2 m and c 2 4 59 1 0 2 s 4 m which is based on measurements reported by meylan et al 2014 note that the coefficients c 1 and c 2 are likely to depend on the ice conditions but the dependencies have not yet been resolved by measurements or theory note also that the evidence for the second t 4 term is not as strong as for the first t 2 term we also note that recent evidence rogers et al 2020 thomson et al 2021 suggest that t 3 may be more appropriate we also note the numerical study of 24 which supports the idea that for short waves scattering dominates while for long waves it is viscous damping which dominates 8 summary and discussion attenuation of waves due to scattering by ice floes has been investigated a comparison of the two and three dimensional models showed that the models generally agree in the regime where scattering dominates notwithstanding resonances that occur primarily on the two dimensional model in general it was shown that the three dimensional model does not require averaging to eliminate resonances as in the two dimensional model the long period asymptotic behaviour of the attenuation coefficient for the three dimensional scattering model was shown to be approximately t 8 i e attenuation due to scattering dies out quickly as period increases it was deduced that scattering could not account for observed long period attenuation where the exponent has been 2 we believe this is due to a viscous damping type model or similar but note that no model or physical process has been found which reproduces this behaviour we therefore propose that the scattering model includes an additional parameterised scattering term based on measurements we have provided the computer code as supplementary material and we anticipate that further developments can be made to it as our understanding advances we hypothesise that the scattering model will be necessary during breakup events when the ice cover transitions from quasi continuous to a field of relatively small floes at this point the long period dissipation model will prevail we note that the key parameters required for models are the floe thickness and floe size distributions both of these are difficult to measure over large areas of the miz

23908,two and three dimensional models are proposed for ocean wave attenuation due to scattering by ice floes in the marginal ice zone in which the attenuation rate depends on the horizontal size of the individual floes the scattering models are shown to reproduce the behaviour of wave attenuation over short wave periods however it is shown that scattering alone cannot explain the observed asymptotic dependence of attenuation at long wave periods based on these findings it is proposed that attenuation models consist of a scattering component supplemented by an empirical damping term based on measurements so that attenuation over all periods is correctly modelled computer code to calculate wave attenuation through a field of ice floes is provided in the supplementary material keywords sea ice ocean waves scattering 1 introduction understanding the interaction between ocean waves and the sea ice covered ocean has applications ranging from predicting sea ice extent to safe navigation ocean waves are frequently observed to impact the sea ice cover and to be attenuated by the ice cover 32 39 there is evidence that ocean waves modulate sea ice extent 4 7 13 54 55 79 and that attenuation of waves by sea ice protects ice shelves 15 35 a concerted effort has emerged to include and evolve the coupled representation of sea ice and ocean surface waves into large scale models for improved ice ocean physics and prediction 4 14 22 27 28 41 54 74 76 this effort has been focused mainly on the marginal ice zone miz where sea ice is highly fragmented mobile and in contact with ocean waves models include a parameterisation of the wave attenuation coefficient i e the exponential rate of wave attenuation over distance travelled generically written α a t h a where a is the wave amplitude t is wave period h is sea ice thickness and a is the floe radius measurements of wave attenuation by sea ice began with pioneering work by members of the scott polar institute 61 70 in recent years technological developments have allowed more detailed measurements of wave attenuation 1 17 20 26 32 39 40 53 56 57 63 65 and better constraints on the form of α the data collected show the attenuation coefficient for long period waves above 10 s is approximately proportional to the wave period to the power of minus two i e α t 2 for t 10 s theoretical modelling of wave attenuation by sea ice has been the subject of parallel research advances squire 2020 models can be broadly divided into two categories those treating sea ice as a viscous layer weber 1987 keller 1998 wang and shen 2010a sutherland et al 2019 chen et al 2019b cheng et al 2020 and those treating it as a scattering medium meylan et al 1997 kohout and meylan 2009 bennetts et al 2010 bennetts and squire 2012 montiel et al 2016 viscous layer models idealise the field of floes in the miz as a continuum and are intuitively applicable in the long wavelength limit the layer models have been extended beyond viscosity for example 69 considered attenuation due to turbulence in contrast scattering models involve a large collection of individual floes where the standard model for wave scattering by a single floe is based on a floating elastic thin plate model and accounts for the compliant bending of large floes while preserving the rigidity of small floes meylan and squire 1994 meylan 2002 bennetts and williams 2010 with the exception of perrie and hu 1996 and the recent work 41 only two dimensional one horizontal dimension and one depth dimension scattering models that have been implemented in large scale prediction models and often assuming floe lengths are much larger than the wavelength to avoid artificial resonance effects 10 30 74 contemporary three dimensional scattering models of wave attenuation peter and meylan 2009 bennetts and squire 2009 bennetts et al 2010 montiel et al 2016 have not yet produced a formula for α suitable for inclusion in large scale models and this is the subject of ongoing research meylan and bennetts 2018 scattering of ocean waves by ice floes only occurs when there is a momentum exchange between the ice floe and ocean waves in turn the momentum exchange implies that a force is applied to the ice floe and hence it is liable to fracture therefore the effect of scattering is central to understanding ice pack break up due to waves and other processes kohout et al 2016 herman et al 2018 after the ice pack has been broken into smaller floes scattering is likely to have a weaker effect especially for the long period waves which persist far into the miz collins et al 2015 dolatshah et al 2018 there is clear evidence from experiments that the ice cover causes energy to be removed from waves at a much greater rate than for an ocean without an ice cover however there is no evidence to show what the mechanism is that removes this energy there is evidence to suggest that it is caused by under ice friction liu and mollo christensen 1988 ardhuin et al 2016 boutin et al 2018 floe collisions shen and squire 1998 bennetts and williams 2015 yiew et al 2017 overwash toffoli et al 2015 nelli et al 2017 2020 or viscoelastic bending wang and shen 2010b mosig et al 2015 there is also evidence that the wave action breaks the floes in a highly active breaking region which scattering is probably dominant until the floes are sufficiently fractured that scattering is negligible and other mechanisms then dominate the wave attenuation ardhuin et al 2020 further evidence of this can be recent results on floe breaking voermans et al 2019 despite the need to model wave attenuation and sea ice fracture accurately a model including all required features of attenuation is lacking this paper proposes an open source model that captures both the short and the long period wave attenuation through the sea ice cover for short periods we use scattering theory to account for the strong attenuation of small floes including the effect of floe size variability for long periods we propose an extra term which is based on experimental measurements which can easily be updated with additional experimental data or appropriate theory the computer code required to run the model is provided as supplementary material 2 attenuation scattering and dissipation there is some ambiguity in the terms attenuation scattering and dissipation and we want to be clear here what we mean by these words attenuation is the observed decrease in wave height as it propagates through the miz scattering is the process that changes the direction of propagation without removing energy and dissipation is a process which removes wave energy both scattering and dissipation can lead to attenuation a critical difference between scattering and dissipation is that scattering will lead to broadening of the wave direction and eventually to an isotropic wave field if there is no significant dissipation this is attested to in models montiel et al 2016 although there is no clear observational evidence scattering must involve momentum exchange and hence high forces and is likely to cause fracture or melting scattering models have clear and straightforward physics which is the basis for offshore engineering and ship design and which has been well validated in laboratory experiments meylan et al 2015 montiel et al 2013a it is possible that scattering only plays a significant role in the active breaking region but we believe its influence is more comprehensive than this however we acknowledge that evidence to prove this is lacking 3 wave scattering by individual ice floes the scattering model treats an ice floe as a floating elastic plate which behaves as a rigid body in the case of long waves or large thickness we present a simple numerical method that works in two and three dimensions to high accuracy and efficiency based on eigenfunction matching the solution in three dimensions was first given by peter et al 2004 and the solution in two dimensions was first given by fox and squire 1994 for the semi infinite case floating elastic plates have been the subject of laboratory experiments to validate and show limitations of the model in terms of the plate motion montiel et al 2013a b meylan et al 2015 yiew et al 2016 and of the scattered wave field bennetts et al 2015 nelli et al 2017 sree et al 2017 while the solution to our problem has appeared previously the simplified numerical solution in two dimensions given below which is based on symmetry has not appeared previously to our knowledge we give detailed descriptions to help to understand the computer code which accompanies the paper we begin by stating the governing equations for the floe water system we assume that the floe has a uniform thickness of h the seafloor is flat and that all motions are time harmonic with radian frequency ω the velocity potential in the water φ can be expressed as 1 φ x z t re ϕ x z e i ω t where the reduced velocity potential ϕ is complex valued and x is the horizontal spatial variable such that x x in two dimensions and x x y in three dimensions and z is the depth variable which points upwards with the water surface at z 0 and the seafloor at z h the ice floe is on the free surface z 0 and occupies the domain ω where 2 ω x x a a is the ice floe radius strictly in two dimensions 2 a is the ice floe length the reduced

floe with attenuation for a large number of floes we begin with a simplified model for wave energy transport in the miz using the model which only considers the terms due to ice 37 t c g n x t θ s i c e eq 37 is solved for the wave action density n x t θ where θ denotes wave direction on the left hand side of 37 c g is the group velocity and x y is the gradient operator the term on the right hand side s i c e is the source term for wave ice interactions which similar to dumont et al 2011 and williams et al 2013a b we express as 38 s i c e c g a i c e α n x t θ where c g c g a i c e is the areal concentration of the ice cover and α is the attenuation coefficient for simplicity the chosen form of s i c e neglects nonlinear dissipative phenomena believed to occur during wave ice interactions in the scattering regime particularly overwash skene et al 2015 nelli et al 2020 and floe floe collisions shen and squire 1998 bennetts and williams 2015 yiew et al 2017 4 1 attenuation coefficient for two dimensional scattering for the two dimensional scattering model the attenuation coefficient is expressed as α α ˆ 2 a where α ˆ is the attenuation per floe which is 39 α ˆ log t 2 where t 2 represents the energy transmitted by an individual floe the attenuation coefficient 39 is based on the assumption that all reflected energy is removed from the wave field which is equivalent to incoherent wave interactions between the floes this formula is based on results from scattering theory which show how the scattering from a large number of randomly spaced scatterers is connected with individual scattering details of this derivation can be found in bennetts and squire 2012 this formula only works in two dimensions resonance occurs for certain combinations of wave period and floe length such that t 1 and this leads to unrealistic values of the attenuation coefficient α ˆ 0 williams et al 2013a therefore it is typical to average the transmitted energy over a distribution of floe lengths so that 40 α ˆ log t 2 where denotes average which is chosen to be normally distributed with a standard deviation 2 a 5 the choice of standard deviation is somewhat arbitrary but the results presented in section 5 are largely insensitive to the variations in the standard deviation 4 2 attenuation coefficient for three dimensional scattering for the three dimensional scattering model we propose the attenuation coefficient is 41 α 1 a f 0 2 π d θ 2 d θ where a f π a 2 is the area of the ocean surface occupied by an individual floe and the integral is proportional to the energy scattered by the floe meylan et al 1997 attenuation coefficient 41 is based on the assumption that all scattered energy is removed from the wave field this is an approximation that sets an upper bound on the effect of scattering more complicated scattering models are possible meylan et al 2020 4 3 floe size distribution to keep the model simple and easy to implement and evaluate the results we present here and the accompanying code assume all floes are the same size it would be possible to extend the model to a distribution of floe sizes by a suitably weighted average of the results calculated here this would of course also depend on having a suitable floe size distribution this is different from the averaging used in the two dimensional calculations where the floe size distribution was assumed to be normal 5 results 5 1 comparison of two and three dimensional attenuation coefficients we present a few representative figures for the attenuation coefficient comparing the two and three dimensional scattering models we choose the water depth to be the wavelength of the open water wave to approximate infinite depth and set m n 10 in the expansion formulae fig 1 shows the attenuation coefficient as a function of wave period for thickness h 0 5 m and for floe radius a 5 m 10m 25m and 50m the sharp drops in the attenuation coefficient at certain periods for the two dimensional case without averaging is caused by resonance more resonances occur as the floe length increases the resonance is caused by constructive interference of waves reflected at the ends of the ice floe analogous to a fabry perot interferometer it occurs because waves propagate through the flexible ice floe this is a two dimensional phenomenon and does not occur for the three dimensional model in the same simple manner since waves are not restricted to travelling in only the forward and backward direction the resonances are primarily eliminated by averaging although inflexions in the attenuation coefficient still occur at the resonant periods we average by sampling with the mean floe length specified and with a standard deviation one tenth the mean floe length for our calculations here there is some evidence of weak resonance for the three dimensional case with inflexions for the two largest radii the averaging over angle also helps to reduce resonant effects in the three dimensional case note that the resonance occurs at multiples of the wavelength to floe length as the floes become larger there is more possibility for resonances for the wave periods we consider there is no simple formula for these resonances because the wavelength under the ice changes from that of open water and there is no simple value for the reflection figs 2 3 and 4 show similar results for floe thickness h 1 m 1 5m and 2m respectively away from resonances the attenuation coefficient for the two dimensional model is higher than the attenuation coefficient for the three dimensional model for relatively long periods i e periods corresponding to wavelengths much greater than the floe radius the difference is up to two orders of magnitude for long periods and the smallest floes a 5 m more typically the two and three dimensional scattering models give attenuation coefficients of the same order of magnitude and the three dimensional case often exceeds the two dimensional case for the larger floe radii from now on results for the three dimensional case only will be considered 5 2 power laws fig 5 shows log log plots of the attenuation coefficient as a function of wave period for different ice thicknesses for relatively long periods wavelengths greater than the floe radius the attenuation coefficient versus wave period is a straight line with a negative slope in log log space therefore in the long period regime the attenuation coefficient obeys a power law of the form 42 α t p and the best fit values of p for the different thicknesses are shown in the legends the value of p is 8 which is much greater than the values obtained from field measurements i e p 2 meylan et al 2014 or 3 thomson et al 2021 fig 6 shows log log plots of the attenuation coefficient as a function of ice thickness for different values of wave period and floe radius for relatively long periods the attenuation is a straight line with positive slope and therefore 43 α h q for t large the legends show the best fit values of q from which we observe that q is generally insensitive to the wave period and floe radius and q 2 the complicated curves for small floes seen in fig 6 a are caused by resonance effect for rigid floes at short periods such as a resonant bobbing motion 5 3 extending the model to heterogeneous distributions of floes a single floe size cannot describe ice floes in the miz it would be possible to extend the model to the case of floe size distributions by averaging the effects of each floe size we do not attempt that here but note that this would be the logical next step if the scattering model is proven to be suitable 6 comparison with experiments results fig 7 shows a comparison of the attenuation coefficient given by the three dimensional scattering model with attenuation coefficient 44 as given by meylan et al 2014 attenuation due to scattering dominates for short periods and the empirical attenuation coefficient dominates for long periods in field measurements only long period attenuation is likely observed because the scattering attenuation has removed the short periods over a short distance close to the ice edge fig 7 shows a comparison of the attenuation coefficient given by the three dimensional scattering model with experimental data figs 7 a shows a comparison with the analysis presented in 56 in which the fitting is based on wave prediction computational code we believe this is likely the most accurate experimental results the four different lines were based on the sorting of the profiles by their length used in 56 the length is closely related to the wave intensity as a noise floor cut off was used we also note that the negative results were discarded so that a possible upward bias was introduced into the mean values for the low intensity cases the estimated values for the ice thickness were 0 51 m 0 50 m 047 m and 0 37 m for the shortest to longest respectively we run the comparison with a thickness of 0 5 m and a radius of 5 m 10 m and 25 m assuming concentration is 100 the agreement with the 25 m radius and the longest results is remarkable however we do not claim that this is sufficient comparison to validate our model or conclusively prove it we also note that there is a clear divergence in the attenuation for long periods figs 7 b shows a comparison with the results first presented in 39 but updated with a recent analysis which takes into account the noise floor of the wave buoys thomson et al 2021 in this case the comparison is nowhere near as good and the clear problem for long periods is apparent we note that there is no tuning in these results 7 long period dissipation it is clear from the comparison with measurements that scattering cannot account for the dissipation at long periods we propose that the attenuation due to scattering be augmented by the empirical model 44 α c 1 t 2 c 2 t 4 where c 1 2 12 1 0 3 s 2 m and c 2 4 59 1 0 2 s 4 m which is based on measurements reported by meylan et al 2014 note that the coefficients c 1 and c 2 are likely to depend on the ice conditions but the dependencies have not yet been resolved by measurements or theory note also that the evidence for the second t 4 term is not as strong as for the first t 2 term we also note that recent evidence rogers et al 2020 thomson et al 2021 suggest that t 3 may be more appropriate we also note the numerical study of 24 which supports the idea that for short waves scattering dominates while for long waves it is viscous damping which dominates 8 summary and discussion attenuation of waves due to scattering by ice floes has been investigated a comparison of the two and three dimensional models showed that the models generally agree in the regime where scattering dominates notwithstanding resonances that occur primarily on the two dimensional model in general it was shown that the three dimensional model does not require averaging to eliminate resonances as in the two dimensional model the long period asymptotic behaviour of the attenuation coefficient for the three dimensional scattering model was shown to be approximately t 8 i e attenuation due to scattering dies out quickly as period increases it was deduced that scattering could not account for observed long period attenuation where the exponent has been 2 we believe this is due to a viscous damping type model or similar but note that no model or physical process has been found which reproduces this behaviour we therefore propose that the scattering model includes an additional parameterised scattering term based on measurements we have provided the computer code as supplementary material and we anticipate that further developments can be made to it as our understanding advances we hypothesise that the scattering model will be necessary during breakup events when the ice cover transitions from quasi continuous to a field of relatively small floes at this point the long period dissipation model will prevail we note that the key parameters required for models are the floe thickness and floe size distributions both of these are difficult to measure over large areas of the miz

23909,the influence of ocean surface currents on the global wind wave field is revisited state of the art numerical spectral wave model simulations with and without surface currents taken from an eddy resolving global ocean reanalysis were compared as a global average simulations forced with currents display significantly better agreement with altimeter derived wave heights the bias and root mean square error in significant wave heights are mostly reduced when including current forcing especially in the southern ocean an overall improvement in wave periods and wave direction is also seen when comparing model outputs with the australian and united states buoy network observations including surface ocean current forcing in wave simulations reduces the simulated wave heights in most areas of the world due to a decreased relative wind given by co flowing winds and currents current induced refraction generates important changes in wave direction in western boundary current and tropical regions furthermore large and broad changes in friction velocity atmosphere to ocean energy flux whitecap cover and stokes drift velocities are observed in equatorial regions finally the importance of the wave model resolution for representing wave current interactions was tested by comparing results from eddy permitting lower resolution and eddy resolving higher resolution configurations we conclude that the main patterns of current induced refraction are well represented in both cases albeit that the higher resolution simulation represents these in a more detailed manner finally the implications that the observed wave current interactions have on several ocean processes are discussed keywords wind wave modelling wave current interaction ocean currents wave refraction wavewatch iii bran reanalysis 1 introduction since the pioneering studies of longuet higgins and stewart 1960 1961 1964 it has been understood that there are complex non linear interactions and energy transfers between ocean wind waves and the mean flow these are two way interactions i e wind waves can influence surface currents and in turn currents can modify wave properties in this study we focus on the influence of ocean surface currents on wind waves across the globe indeed there are various ways in which currents can affect waves waves can change their properties such as their steepness or frequency due to exchanges of energy with the mean flow via the radiation stress besides non uniform currents can refract wave trains in a manner analogous to the way in which changes in depth induce wave refraction further the transfer of energy from the atmosphere to the ocean can be modified in the presence of currents the effective wind that acts on waves propagating on a moving medium might be different than the real wind while these effects have been investigated generally at local scales such as the effects of tidal circulation on coastal wave fields e g jones 2000 ardhuin et al 2012 rapizo et al 2015 lewis et al 2019 and the understanding of more theoretical aspects of this interaction is in constant progress e g constantin and monismith 2017 the broad scale implications of ocean circulation on the observed global wave field are still mostly unknown this study uses state of the art numerical wave modelling to investigate and improve understanding of wave current interactions at the global scale and its implications wave current interaction plays an important role in a broad range of ocean processes first and most importantly including surface ocean current data from global reanalysis as an additional input in wave simulations leads to an overall improvement in wave model performance rapizo et al 2018 this has direct implications for improving wave forecasting capabilities which are critical for industry based applications navigation operations at sea and wave based research wave current coupling can produce non linear interactions that induce wave breaking in deep waters that modify ocean roughness which affects satellite remote sensing products like ocean colour and radar imaging romero et al 2017 in addition it is believed that wave current interactions may be one of the processes responsible for the formation of extreme wave heights lavrenov 1998 toffoli et al 2015 that can have drastic consequences for navigation another potential application is the tracking of swell waves across ocean basins using an array of three pressure gauges moored off shore of san clemente island munk et al 1963 measured the arriving swell waves and through backtracking techniques and assuming swell waves follow great circle paths inferred the position of the storm that had generated them they concluded that intense storms in the southern ocean produced waves that travelled across the pacific ocean in 5 to 15 days before reaching the coasts of california however on occasions the method of munk et al 1963 yielded errors of up to 1000 km in the position of the originating storms placing them in the antarctic continent kenyon 1971 studied the wave refraction produced by the shear in ocean currents and using an idealized model of the antarctic circumpolar current acc found it to be plausible that the acc could deflect the direction of swell waves and thus explain the errors in munk s measurements gallet and young 2014 took up this idea by using modern satellite derived ocean currents products to demonstrate that mesoscale vorticity in the ocean can significantly deflect the direction of waves and thereby providing a compelling explanation for munk s errors many studies using different methodologies and across a range of spatial scales have shown the indubitable sensitivity of waves to ocean currents using sar data from the sir b mission irvine and tilley 1988 gave initial accounts on how waves can be refracted and even trapped by the agulhas current and how this could translate into extreme wave generation ardhuin et al 2017 carrying out wave simulations with and without current forcing showed that wave height variability in the open ocean is modulated by currents at scales of 10 100 km and that the spectrum of spatial variations of currents is proportional to that of wave heights wandres et al 2017 using a coupled ocean circulation and wave model showed that the leeuwin current especially its eddies and meanders has a significant impact on the wave climate of western australia being able to produce a change of 25 in significant wave height and 20 in mean direction more recently rapizo et al 2018 showed that a significant improvement in the performance of global wave simulations can be achieved by including surface current forcing from a global reanalysis they showed that the main effect of including currents is the reduction of wave heights due to a diminished relative wind in the presence of co flowing current fields this is especially evident in the southern ocean where the westerly winds blow in the same direction as the acc however there are also current induced refraction and energy convergence processes that occur in localized areas such as the agulhas current or the equatorial current and counter current systems when comparing model results with observations taken from a moored buoy in the southern ocean rapizo et al 2018 observed that the current forced wave simulation performed better than the simulation without currents in terms of wave heights and period in terms of wave direction they found a small improvement for peak direction and a slight worsening for mean direction they attributed this worsening to the coarse resolution of their simulation and the current forcing product 0 5 presumably incapable of effectively capturing the ocean circulation features that modify wave direction through current induced refraction likewise quilfen et al 2018 found that their wave model simulations underestimated the magnitude of the wave height variability which they also attributed to their model resolution 0 25 being too coarse as well as to errors in the ocean current data overall these recent studies suggest that increased wave model resolution is an important factor to consider in order to properly represent wave current interactions this paper revisits and challenges the current view on the importance of model resolution for wave current interaction research it builds on previous studies extending and improving some of their aspects specifically we analyse a three year high resolution 0 1 wave model simulation across the southern ocean with and without current forcing to assess the importance of using an eddy resolving resolution to properly represent wave current interaction we investigate the role of wave current interaction on other processes such as energy and momentum fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean stokes drift velocities stokes 1847 of critical importance for search and rescue activities and tracking of particles in the ocean whitecap coverage among others the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the configuration of the wave and current models and the altimeter and buoy datasets used to validate the wave simulations section 3 1 presents a comprehensive validation of wave parameters from the simulations with and without currents against altimeter and moored buoys observations section 3 2 presents an analysis of the effects that ocean currents have on different wave parameters and section 3 3 discusses the importance of wave model resolution by comparing results from two sets of wave simulations with high and low resolutions finally section 4 discusses key aspects of the main results together with the main conclusions extracted from this study 2 data and methods 2 1 wave model configuration a multi grid implementation of wavewatch iii v5 16 was utilized tolman 2009 consisting of two grids a global grid from 78 s to 78 n with 0 4 spatial resolution i e at the margins of being eddy permitting and a regional sub grid spanning the southern ocean around the globe from 65 s 28 s with a 0 1 spatial resolution eddy resolving the atmospheric forcing for the wave model was the 10 m above the mean sea level wind data from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsrv2 saha et al 2010 which has a spatial resolution of approximately 0 2 in the horizontal and a temporal resolution of 1 h the model considers the temporally varying sea ice concentration also taken from cfsr following the approach described by tolman 2003 default threshold concentrations were considered 0 25 ice has no effect on wave propagation 0 75 ice is treated as land 0 25 and 0 75 dampening of the wave energy depending on the ice concentration value the obstruction masks used to account for small islands not resolved by the model grid tolman 2003 were constructed using the global self consistent hierarchical high resolution shoreline gshhs dataset water level effects were not incorporated in the wave simulations in this study some of the most relevant features of the model s configuration are the ardhuin et al 2010 source term parametrizations st4 specifically configured for utilization with the cfsr winds the discrete interaction approximation dia hasselmann et al 1985 for nonlinear wave wave interactions the third order ultimate quickest propagation scheme leonard 1979 1991 including the garden sprinkler effect correction tolman 2002 jonswap bottom friction and battjes and janssen 1978 shallow water depth breaking the model is spectrally discretized in 29 frequencies varying from 0 035 to 0 5 hz with an increment factor of 1 1 and directions taken every 15 with this configuration we run two sets of simulations one including ocean surface current data taken from the bluelink reanalysis bran oke et al 2013 as an additional forcing for the wave model and another simulation without any surface current forcing bran is an eddy resolving ocean reanalysis more specifically bran is 0 1 x 0 1 in the horizontal that uses data assimilation to produce a realistic quantitative description of the three dimensional ocean circulation for the last three decades we have used the surface current product from bran at 2 5 m depth by comparing the differences in these two sets of simulations with and without current forcing we assess the sensitivity of wind wave modelling to the inclusion of surface currents in both eddy permitting and eddy resolving model grid configurations we have run three years of wave simulations from january 2014 until december 2016 december 2013 was run but considered as a spin up month as mentioned earlier one of the main effects of the inclusion of surface current forcing in wave simulations is a modification of the relative wind wavewatch iii incorporates this process in a rather simple fashion balancing wind and current vectors the relative wind vector from which wind speed and direction are determined in the presence of currents is computed as 1 w r e l w a b s a u where w a b s represents the absolute wind vector with units of m s u is the ocean current vector in m s and a is a dimensionless coefficient wavewatch iii considers a 1 which implies the largest effect of currents e g if the measured 10 m absolute wind speed and direction are the same as the surface currents the relative wind input to the model is null 2 2 altimeter wave dataset altimetric satellites orbit the earth measuring significant wave heights with an almost global coverage altimeter observations represent an outstanding data source to assess a global wave model s performance rascle and ardhuin 2013 durrant et al 2014 roland and ardhuin 2014 hemer et al 2017 here we have used altimeter derived significant wave heights to evaluate the performance of the current forced and non current forced wave simulations the altimeter dataset was calibrated quality controlled and assessed by ribal and young 2019 it comprises all the available altimeter missions from 1985 to the present we have selected the along track significant wave height data of those missions that operated during the period 2014 2016 jason 2 cryosat 2 hy 2 a saral jason 3 and sentinel 3 a we have mapped these data onto the global 0 4 resolution grid of our model that is for each bin of our model grid we selected the satellite data that fell into that bin and averaged it over the course of an hour in this way we compared the significant wave height at each grid point of the model with all the available satellite observations that corresponded to that grid point with this approach the comparisons were localized and excessive averaging avoided however the availability of altimeter data is inhomogeneous i e it is higher close to the satellite tracks but there are areas in which the amount of data points is much lower 2 3 wave buoy data wave buoy measurements are usually regarded as the most accurate wave information available and they are often used to validate altimeter wave height products zieger et al 2009 ribal and young 2019 for this study we have selected a representative set of buoys from australia and the united states us publicly available through the australian ocean data network aodn https portal aodn org au and us national data buoy center ndbc https www ndbc noaa gov portals respectively all the buoys have significant wave height information however some of them compute it from a wave to wave analysis and others from spectral analysis most of the buoys also measure wave direction peak direction for some of them and peak direction for sea and swell separately for others in every case the wavewatch iii parameters were computed via spectral analysis and the necessary processing filtering such as removing bad data or averaging buoy observations with a higher sampling frequency than the model output was applied to match the observations with the model s results the wave parameters selected for comparison significant wave height h s peak period t p and peak direction θ p were computed from modelled wavewatch iii directional wave spectra as follows 2 h s 0 2 π 0 e f θ d f d θ 3 t p 1 f p 4 θ p atan b a with e f θ being the wave spectral density as a function of frequency f and direction θ 2d spectrum f p the peak frequency computed from the 1d spectrum frequency at which the highest energy level is attained a 0 2 π cos θ e f p θ d θ and b 0 2 π sin θ e f p θ d θ it is important to note that wavewatch iii outputs the spectrum in terms of intrinsic and not absolute frequency therefore for a correct comparison against buoy measurements a doppler shift correction should be applied to the output of the current forced simulation to compute the absolute frequency the conversion from intrinsic to absolute frequency was done using the dispersion relationship of wind waves 5 ω σ k u with ω and σ the absolute and intrinsic angular frequency respectively k the wavenumber vector and u the surface current vector the inner product in eq 5 was approximated using the mean wavelength and mean wave direction 3 results 3 1 comparison against observations in the first instance the significant wave heights h s simulated by the model were evaluated against those derived from the satellite altimeter observations the following statistical parameters were used to evaluate the model runs as indicators of the degree of similarity between observed o and modelled m values the pearson linear correlation coefficient r the mean bias 1 n m o and the root mean square error rmse 1 n m o 2 the normalized bias was computed as 100 m o o while the normalized rmse is 100 1 n m o 2 1 n o for wave direction the linear correlation coefficient formula was taken from jammalamadaka and sengupta 2001 and the bias and rmse were computed keeping in mind that wave direction is an angular variable treating the direction values as points in a circumference of unit radius the difference between two given direction values is defined not as the arithmetic subtraction between the two as we would do for wave height or period but as the smaller arclength along the circumference this way the difference between 350 and 10 is 20 not 340 conversely the difference between 10 and 350 is 20 likewise the mean direction was computed treating the direction values as unit vectors and calculating the direction of their resultant vector i e dividing the direction values dataset in x and y components computing the average of each component separately and forming the resulting vector with them thus the mean direction between 10 and 350 would be 0 and not 180 when comparing with buoy measurements the bias in wave direction is defined as the average of all the differences in direction values model minus observations therefore a positive bias in direction shows that the model represents waves in a more clockwise direction relative to north than the observations fig 1 shows the pearson s linear correlation coefficient left panels mean bias middle panels and rmse right panels of h s for the simulation without currents a d g for the current forced simulation b e h and the difference between those statistics c f i the correlation coefficient between altimeter derived and modelled significant wave heights is 0 9 at high latitudes of both hemispheres and it is lower 0 7 at low latitudes and in coastal areas the bias and rmse distributions observed in fig 1 are a common feature of global wave models the mean bias is mostly positive meaning that the model overestimates the observed wave heights except in the western equatorial pacific where the model simulates lower wave heights than the observed ones the highest absolute errors are found at high latitudes especially in the southern ocean these errors are related to several factors such as a positive bias in the reanalysis winds used to force the model the fact that the wave model does not incorporate information about drifting icebergs which block the wave energy among others there are also high errors close to the ice edge presumably related to the parameterization of wave propagation over areas partially covered with ice being too simple by visual comparison of the performance of both simulations with and without currents it can be seen that incorporating current forcing in the wave model significantly increases the correlation at low latitudes and reduces the mean bias and rmse especially in the southern ocean the bottom panels show the difference in correlation bias and rmse computed as the value of the current forced simulation minus that of the simulation without currents in this way a positive value in fig 1 c means that the correlation coefficient in the current forced simulation is higher than in the simulation without currents indeed there are substantial improvements in correlation i e higher values in the current forced simulation at low latitudes especially at the eastern side of ocean basins in the south eastern african coasts and to a lesser extent in the antarctic circumpolar current and east australian current regions regarding the bias because it is a signed quantity when comparing bias values from different simulations we decided to take the difference in their absolute values e g a bias of 0 2 m is regarded more accurate than a bias of 0 3 m wherever the difference in bias or rmse is negative blue in fig 1 f and or fig 1 i it means that the absolute bias or rmse of the current forced simulation is lower than that of the simulation in the absence of currents in general most areas of the world show a reduction of the mean bias or the rmse and hence an improvement of the wave model performance when including current forcing however there are also some areas where the mean absolute bias or the rmse of the current forced simulation is higher than that of the simulation without currents these areas are mainly the western pacific and the waters surrounding the antarctic shelf as a global average including current forcing in the model reduces the bias from 0 21 m to 0 17 m reduces the rmse from 0 29 m to 0 27 m and increases the correlation between modelled and observed wave heights from 0 906 to 0 911 on the other hand similar results are obtained comparing the observed and simulated extreme wave heights figure s1 of the supporting information section si shows the observed 90th percentile h s top panel and the differences in simulated 90th percentile h s from the wave simulations with and without currents bottom panel as expected the extreme wave heights are reduced in most areas of the world particularly in the southern ocean due to co flowing winds and currents lowering the energy transfer from the atmosphere however including current forcing increases the 90th percentile h s in the agulhas current east australian current equatorial counter currents and gulf stream regions likely due to exchanges of energy between the waves and the main flow in conditions of opposing waves and currents the same comparison against altimeter data was carried out for the 90th percentile h s figure s2 the correlation values of 90th percentile wave heights are significantly lower than for the total h s further although there is an overall improvement in the correlation values of the 90th percentile wave heights some areas reveal a decrease in correlation for the current forced simulation figure s2 c in terms of bias and rmse there is a substantial improvement in the current forced simulation especially at high latitudes as well as in the agulhas current east australian current and equatorial counter current regions however the mean absolute bias and rmse of the 90th percentile h s increase i e become worse with the inclusion of current forcing in the tropics except in the equatorial counter current areas particularly in the western pacific basin fig 2 shows the performance of both wave model simulations in terms of r bias and rmse throughout the year and separated by regions the bias and rmse are expressed here as percentages of the mean observed wave heights the correlation values for the current forced simulation are consistently higher than those of the simulation without currents for each month of the year likewise the mean bias and rmse are consistently lower throughout the seasons the wave simulation in the absence of currents performs reasonably well globally with total r values 0 85 a mean bias 10 of the average observed wave heights and rmse 20 the current forced simulation always performs better with correlation values approximately 0 005 0 01 larger mean bias values 1 5 smaller and rmse 1 smaller the performance of the current forced simulation is also improved in each ocean basin with the improvement being slightly greater for the southern hemisphere basins while these differences are small it should be considered that these statistics are computed over long periods of time and over large areas while the effects of wave current interaction can be more localized as observed in fig 1 e g if only a portion of the southern ocean or of the agulhas current is selected the differences will be larger it is also worth noticing that the improvement in h s estimates is seen at each ocean basin throughout the year figure s3 next a comparison against buoy data is presented with the aim of evaluating the performances of both wave simulations with and without currents in representing the observed wave heights periods and directions close to the coast first we show the evaluation of the wavewatch iii runs against the australian buoys a total of 15 australian buoys was selected three in western australia wa one in south australia sa one in tasmania tas eight in new south wales nsw two in queensland qld and finally one in deep waters of the southern ocean table s1 see si shows the correlation bias and rmse values for h s t p and θ p between the australian buoy measurements and wavewatch iii output for both simulations with and without currents good agreement was found in terms of h s with r 0 9 mean biases ranging between 2 cm and 30 cm and rmse values generally between 30 cm and 40 cm the t p has correlation values 0 5 a mean bias 1 5s for the wa sa and tas buoys but lower than 0 8s for the nsw and qld buoys and rmse 2 4s in terms of θ p we found r 0 6 the mean bias ranges from 16 to 26 across locations and rmse 40 a similar performance of the model is found when comparing against ndbc buoys table s2 here only the differences in the performances of both simulations are shown to highlight the potential improvement achieved by considering current forcing in the wave simulations panel a of fig 3 shows the australian buoys that were selected for this comparison whereas panels b c and d show the differences in correlation absolute value of the bias and rmse in h s θ p and t p respectively as in fig 1 a positive difference in correlation or a negative difference in absolute bias or rmse represents an improvement in the wave model performance when including currents as before the difference in the absolute value of bias is presented in fig 3 in terms of h s there is a statistically significant at the 95 confidence level improvement in correlation in all the nsw buoys except tweed heads and in brisbane the rmse improves for all locations except for cape du couedic tweed heads and gold coast the absolute bias average of the differences improves only for the wa buoys cape sorell crowdy head brisbane and the southern ocean flux station sofs buoy nevertheless the average wave height for the whole period is better represented by the current forced simulation in most locations not shown in terms of peak period there is a general statistically significant at the 95 confidence level improvement in the wa nsw and qld buoys except tweed heads and a broad reduction of the bias and rmse across all sites finally in terms of peak direction there is a significant improvement for rottnest island albany all the nsw buoys except eden byron bay and tweed heads and brisbane whereas in eden and gold coast there is a statistically significant worsening the rmse of the current forced simulation is substantially lower for the nsw buoys the mean bias improves for 8 of the 14 stations and worsens for rottnest island cape naturaliste crowdy head coffs harbour tweed heads and gold coast fig 4 presents a comparison analogous to that in fig 3 but for the ndbc buoys in terms of h s there is an overall increase in the correlation values when adding currents although not statistically significant at the 95 confidence level and a substantial decrease in the absolute value of the bias except for buoys 46078 and 46025 and rmse in terms of peak period there is a statistically significant improvement in the correlation values the difference in correlation is not statistically significant for buoys 46073 46012 42055 42002 and 42057 and a substantial decrease in the absolute bias and rmse except for buoys 46073 and 42055 the differences in the performance statistics of θ p estimates are more variable while there is an overall increase in the correlation values although statistically significant only for 6 buoys some locations show a decrease in correlation not significant the absolute bias in peak direction decreases at 8 buoy locations and increases at 10 locations whereas the rmse shows a general decrease in the current forced simulation although differences in bulk statistics between simulations appear small the inclusion of currents as a forcing of the wave model produces major changes during specific wave events e g like the one shown in fig 5 during the last week of march 2016 in sydney the measured significant wave heights were consistently 1 5 m and 3 5 m in the last day of the month the current forced wave simulation agrees much better with the observations and has substantial differences with the simulation without currents of up to 1 2 m in wave heights 5s in period and 80 in direction during that event during that day the meandering southward flow of the east australian current generated two very intense anticyclonic eddies centred around 152 e 36 s and around 152 e 39 s which had a significant impact on h s the mean periods and direction estimates in the tasman sea with the maximum differences being near sydney the directional wave spectrum at the sydney buoy location for 2016 03 27t12 00z of the simulation without currents shows a northward propagating wave mode with a frequency of around 0 07 hz period of 14 s and a westward propagating mode with a frequency of around 0 09 hz period of 11 s for the simulation with currents the energy in the northward propagating mode is greatly increased while the westward propagating mode decreases its intensity the one dimensional spectra reveal that including current forcing shifts the peak in the spectrum towards lower frequencies due to the increased energy in the northward propagating mode the spatial patterns of differences in wave height period and direction show a positive difference in areas where the currents and the northward propagating wave mode travel in opposite directions and negative differences when they travel in the same direction while undoubtedly the ocean circulation at the coast e g tidal currents not accounted for in the bluelink reanalysis will have a significant impact on the measured wave properties nearer the coast the results presented in fig 5 allow us to conclude that the larger scale ocean circulation as seen by the bluelink reanalysis and presumably other ocean circulation reanalysis products can also have a significant influence on the wave climate at the coast therefore current forcing should be an important consideration for coastal wave modelling studies in east australia 3 2 changes in wave properties due to currents in this section a comparison between the output from simulations with and without currents is presented differences in several wave parameters were analysed to further understand the effects of ocean surface currents on the global wind wave climate results here should be interpreted in light of those presented also in section 3 1 that is any conclusion drawn in this section is valid in those areas where the inclusion of currents as a forcing in the wave model translates into an improvement of the model s performance these include most areas of the world with the exception of the western pacific and waters surrounding the antarctic continent and the arctic for brevity and convenience we use the following acronyms for the major ocean currents antarctic circumpolar current acc agulhas current ac madagascar current mc east african coast current eacc east australian current eac indonesian throughflow itf equatorial currents ec i e the north equatorial current and south equatorial current equatorial counter current ecc brazil current bc north brazil current nbc caribbean current cc gulf stream gs and kuroshio current kc fig 6 outlines the regions associated with these ocean currents together with the spatial structure in their average speeds from 2014 2016 computed with data from the bran reanalysis in addition fig 6 presents the time averaged relative vorticity for that period for the major ocean current systems described in the paper fig 7 shows the time averaged percental changes in significant wave height h s mean period t m 01 and changes in mean direction θ m for the three year period in which the simulations were run 2014 2016 in each case the difference in wave parameters was computed as the value of the variable in the current forced simulation minus that of the simulation without currents the inclusion of current forcing in the model leads to an overall decrease in the significant wave height in most areas of the world this is mostly due to a diminished relative wind in areas with co flowing winds and currents the highest absolute changes in h s are observed in the southern ocean not shown although they represent less than 8 of the average wave heights in that region fig 7 a here the acc flowing in the same general direction as the predominant westerlies makes the relative wind lower than the real wind rapizo et al 2018 in the ac region east of the african coast there is a dipole of increasing wave heights close to the coast and decreasing heights further offshore a similar feature is observed in the cc region and it is also present in the mc and eac although with less intensity this pattern of increase and decrease in h s could be related to both exchanges of energy between the waves and the currents and or to convergence and divergence of wave energy due to current induced refraction however we do not identify the relative contribution of each processes to the observed differences in wave parameters in this study in the agulhas retroflection a prominent turnabout of the southern end of the agulhas current system where the current direction reverses and flows back into the indian ocean a pattern of alternating positive and negative differences in wave height arises which is a consequence of the intense mesoscale eddy activity that characterizes this area eddies can refract the incoming wave trains in very complex manners since the change in wave direction is determined by the sign of the current s shear it is different on each side of the eddy hence redistributing the wave energy and generating energy convergence and divergence areas which in turn translate into higher and lower wave heights respectively e g mathiesen 1987 the reduced relative wind in the southern ocean generates waves of lower amplitude these waves will propagate away from their generation area and since they have lower heights in the southern ocean they will also present reduced wave heights in the southern hemisphere ocean basins that is why on average the wave heights are reduced in most parts of the ocean basins when incorporating currents into the model important differences are observed in the equatorial region with an average decrease in wave heights in the north and south ec of around 8 of the mean h s and a slight increase in wave heights in the ecc region in the northern hemisphere little or no change is observed in the kc and the gs however there is an observed decrease in h s in the north pacific and north atlantic oceans centred around 50 n also related to a lower relative wind the most conspicuous percental changes in wave height are observed in the nbc cc itf and at the eastern african coasts the nbc and cc significantly reduce h s by up to 15 of the mean values and in the nbc retroflection area there is a slight increase in h s the circulation in the gulf of mexico increases the wave heights at the eastern side of the gulf in addition the florida current increases h s by more than 15 of their mean values the itf is an ocean current system located in an area with extremely complicated geography it is composed of a complex suite of currents that bifurcate and converge but collectively describe a net east to west transport from the pacific into the indian ocean as such there are alternating increases and decreases of wave heights due to the inclusion of currents the most important changes occur north of sulawesi island where h s is reduced by more than 15 of the mean h s in this area the southernmost part of the itf affects the wave climate off northwest australia increasing the wave heights close to the coast and decreasing them further offshore the south indian ocean ec flowing northward of madagascar significantly reduces h s by more than 15 of the mean values in this region close to the coast the flow is split into the southward flowing ac which increases the wave heights close to the coast and the eacc which decreases the wave heights the changes in wave height due to the inclusion of current forcing in the wave simulation can explain the improvements in the simulated h s observed in fig 1 f for example the mean bias in h s for the simulation without currents in the western pacific is mainly negative fig 1 d therefore if the inclusion of currents increases the wave heights in this area this will translate into an improvement of h s estimates indeed fig 7 a shows that the wave heights are increased in a narrow band in the western equatorial pacific where a reduction of the mean bias and rmse is observed fig 1 f and i similarly in the nbc region close to the coast the mean bias in h s for the simulation without currents is negative fig 1 d including currents reduces the wave height in this area fig 7 a therefore exacerbating the negative bias which is deemed as a worsening of h s estimates in this area fig 1 f nevertheless the correspondence between fig 1 f and fig 7 a is not absolute possibly due to altimeter under sampling in the equatorial region to better understand the conditions that lead to an increase or decrease in wave height and mean period fig 8 shows the time averaged changes in h s and mean period t m 01 as a function of the current speed and the wave propagation relative to the currents direction a value of 0 in the x axis of fig 8 indicates that waves propagate in the same direction as the currents and a value of 180 or 180 indicates that waves and currents are propagating in opposite directions fig 8 a and b show the differences in significant wave height for the december january february and june july august months respectively when wave propagation is in the same direction as the currents there is an overall decrease in wave height conversely when waves propagate against the currents there is an overall increase in wave heights something analogous happens with the mean wave period there is a general decrease increase in wave period when waves propagate with against the currents these results are well in agreement with those presented by barnes and rautenbach 2020 for the south african region however it remains unclear what are the physical mechanisms that lead to these differences while a reduced relative wind for winds and currents flowing in the same direction should decrease the wave period the change in intrinsic wavenumber magnitude the concertina effect should increase the wave period for waves going in the same direction as the currents in addition current induced refraction can significantly alter the wave climate of regions otherwise unaffected fig 7 b shows the percental differences in t m 01 between the simulations with and without currents there is an average decrease of mean wave periods in the southern ocean which could also be related to a less intense relative wind e g a jonswap spectra will become narrower in frequency and the peak will move to lower frequencies with increasing wind speeds hasselmann et al 1973 further these differences are propagated throughout the ocean basins producing lower period waves in the south indian pacific and atlantic oceans similar to the h s differences there is a dipole of increasing wave periods close to the coast and decreasing periods off shore in the ac mc cc and eac regions fig 8 c and d shows that on average waves tend to decrease increase their periods when they propagate in the same direction as opposite to the currents this would be particularly true in the ac mc and eac regions which receive southerly waves from the southern ocean furthermore this is supported by figure s4 which shows the average differences in mean wave period off shore of eastern australia for the june july august months together with the one dimensional frequency spectra of both wave simulations for two distinct locations one where the waves propagate in the same direction as the current where there is a decrease in the wave energy in the spectrum and the peak shifts towards higher frequencies and another one where waves oppose the flow where there is an increase of energy in the spectrum with a shift towards lower frequencies these differences in wave spectral density levels could be produced by exchanges of energy with the mean flow mediated by the radiation stress longuet higgins and stewart 1964 or by current induced refraction affecting areas that in the absence of currents would present a different wave climate the substantial increase in wave period for current speeds of 1 1 75 m s for waves propagating approximately between 50 and 120 of the currents direction observed in fig 8 can be traced back to the interaction of southern ocean swell waves with the ec see figure s6 in the equatorial regions there is a time average increase in the mean wave period here the wave climate is highly complex with multiple wave modes presenting different frequencies and directions and being affected differently by the ocean circulation figures s5 and s6 for example the inclusion of currents increases the wave period of the southern ocean swell at location 120 w 0 mostly in the june july august months whereas it reduces the period of the south easterly equatorial waves during this time on the other hand the northern hemisphere generated waves increase their periods due to currents throughout the year figures s5 and s6 in this case the swell waves propagate opposite to the currents direction and the south easterly waves travel in the same direction as the local currents in the north indian ocean there is also a decrease in wave periods that can be traced back to the lower period waves coming from the southern ocean however at the western side of the arabian sea and the bay of bengal there is a significant increase in wave periods of around 7 these changes seem to reach the coasts of pakistan india and myanmar in addition a reduction of more than 10 of the mean period is observed to the north of sulawesi island off northwest australia the wave period is increased by around 8 importantly there are significant changes in mean wave direction due to the inclusion of currents in the model here a positive difference in direction means that the waves of the current forced simulation propagate in a more clockwise direction than in the simulation without currents for example the wave direction in the simulation without currents could be 90 to the e and the direction in the case with currents 135 to the sse likewise a negative difference implies an anti clockwise rotation of waves with the inclusion of currents kenyon 1971 stated that waves which propagate against a variable current will be deflected in the direction of increasing current speed conversely waves propagating in the same direction as the currents will be deflected in the direction of decreasing current speed in the southern ocean there are positive differences in wave direction which means that currents refract the eastward propagating waves on average a few degrees to the south there are very strong directional differences close to the southeast african and east australian coasts once more evidencing the dipole of positive differences clockwise rotation to the right of the current s flow direction and negative differences anti clockwise rotation to the left of the current this pattern is also evident in the bc offshore of uruguay and south brazil in the kc and to a lesser extent in the gs and nbc given the exposure of the south african coasts to southern ocean generated swell the ac can induce a clockwise rotation of these waves if they are close to the coast and an anti clockwise rotation if they are further offshore this could translate into a swell wave focusing in the central axis of the ac as well as in the eac in deep waters at around 30 40 latitude on average there are insignificant changes in mean direction hence current induced refraction is less important in these areas however waves in the tropics are significantly refracted by the ec and ecc in the eastern equatorial pacific there are time averaged changes in mean wave direction of around 10 as shown in figures s5 and s6 the equatorial pacific is an area with a very complex and multi modal wave climate and therefore examining changes in the direction of individual wave modes will be more accurate nevertheless we can conclude that significant wave refraction occurs in this area in the western pacific complex refraction patterns are observed with clockwise and anti clockwise rotations induced by the currents however this is an area where the performance of the wave model worsens when including currents therefore the changes in wave direction might not be a real feature but may be a consequence of a poorer representation of the ocean circulation in this area by the bluelink reanalysis at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere although small the main changes in mean direction are negative meaning that the currents refract waves to a more northward direction the patterns of differences in mean wave direction approximately follow the patterns of relative vorticity in western boundary currents and the acc negative positive vorticity values match with clockwise anticlockwise differences in wave direction in the ac or eac regions the main currents flow poleward and the prevalent waves propagate in the opposite direction equatorward according to kenyon 1971 waves will be deflected in the direction of increasing current speed hence producing clockwise rotations in the western side of the ac or eac and anticlockwise rotations in their eastern sides fig 7 c fig 9 shows the time averaged percental differences in wind friction velocity a wave energy flux cge b stokes drift speed c and the changes in stokes drift direction d the friction velocity is a parameter used to characterize the stress transmitted from the wind to the ocean surface and it can be modified under different sea surface roughness states e g waves the parameterization of wind friction velocity in wavewatch iii depends on the source term physics choice for st4 it is an adaptation of janssen 1991 that includes a sheltering term s u designed to reduce the drag coefficient at high winds including current forcing in the wave model reduces the friction velocity in most areas of the world particularly the ec acc eacc nbc and cc and increases it mainly in the ecc florida current and nbc retroflection area fig 9 a the signs of the changes in h s in these areas approximately match those of the friction velocity for example in the ec regions a diminished relative wind due to co flowing winds and currents reduces the surface stress and consequently the friction velocity values are lower as a result the energy and momentum fluxes from the atmosphere to the ocean decreases figure s7 b and with it the generated wave heights fig 7 a the opposite occurs in the ecc regions where the currents and the wind flow in opposite directions and therefore the relative wind computed by the wave model and hence the wind friction velocity and the transfer of energy from the atmosphere to the ocean is greater in addition the whitecap coverage is also reduced figure s7 c due to a decreased wind stress acting on this area whitecaps arise from waves breaking in deep waters entraining air bubbles and forming patches of foam in the surface of the ocean leckler et al 2013 scanlon et al 2016 in short the wind friction velocity atmosphere to ocean energy and momentum flux and whitecap cover changes due to the inclusion of currents follow the same pattern their most salient features are a decrease in the north and south ec an increase in the ecc and florida current and a decrease in the central north indian ocean and in the eacc region the changes in friction velocity range between 10 fig 9 a in the tropics whereas the changes in whitecap cover and energy flux from the atmosphere vary between 50 of their mean values figure s7 we find that the wave energy flux cge fig 9 b decreases in most areas of the world especially in the ac eacc nbc and cc regions however there is a slight increase in the ecc region and close to the southeast african and australian coasts this increase can be linked to the increases in the spectral energy levels and therefore in significant wave height and wave period observed in these areas e g fig 7 s4 s5 and s6 the wave energy flux is an important variable for assessing the potential force of the waves on coastal processes and on coastal or offshore infrastructure we find that ignoring current forcing in wave simulations can lead to inaccurate estimates of the wave energy flux in many coastal regions around the world for example 25 mean difference in the coast of mozambique 10 in the east coast of australia madagascar and india 20 difference in the coasts of somalia the decrease in cge in the southern coast of australia and the increase in the eastern coast due to the inclusion of current forcing could help to improve the bias in cge observed by hemer et al 2017 finally differences in stokes drift speed and direction are shown in panels 9 c and 9 d respectively as mentioned earlier the stokes drift is an important consideration for search and rescue activities and tracking of particles in the ocean such as plastics plankton or drifting debris van den bremer and breivik 2018 dobler et al 2019 recent theoretical developments have been made regarding the solution for stokes drift velocities in the presence of ocean currents henry 2019 here we analyse the differences in the stokes drift representation by our simulations with and without current forcing interestingly the time averaged differences in stokes drift speed present an analogous pattern to that of the friction velocity decreasing values in the acc a maximum absolute average change of 0 25 cm s eacc central region of the north indian ocean ec nbc and cc and an increase in the ecc and florida current the changes in stokes drift speed range between 30 in low latitudes in terms of stokes drift direction there are significant differences in the ac mc itf eac nbc kc gs and especially in the equatorial region as seen in the mean wave direction in this case there is also a dipole of positive differences in stokes drift direction clockwise rotation to the right of the mean flow direction and negative differences anti clockwise rotation to the left of the current s direction in the major western boundary currents ac mc eacc eac kc bc bc nbc cc ad gs the differences in stokes drift direction can also be linked to the differences in the wind friction velocity direction figure s7 a however these are eulerian differences in the sense that they are computed as the time average at each grid point a lagrangian difference following the particle as it moves might have a significantly different impact on the tracking of particles in the ocean 3 3 importance of wave model resolution rapizo et al 2018 showed that a significant improvement in h s estimates is attained by considering current forcing in wave simulations however when comparing with buoy observations sofs they concluded that despite the improvements in estimates of wave height and period only a slight improvement in peak wave direction estimates and a slight worsening in mean direction were found for the current forced simulation they attributed this to the current forcing product and model resolution being too coarse 0 5 presumably incapable of representing current induced refraction properly the change in wave direction is proportional to the magnitude of the current shear in a direction perpendicular to the waves propagation dysthe 2001 which would be better represented in an eddy resolving simulation rather than eddy permitting rapizo et al 2018 using two distinct surface current products cfsr currents with a resolution of 0 5 and hycom currents with a resolution of 1 12 studied the spatial patterns of differences in h s between simulations with and without currents they found that the differences in h s were significantly greater in the simulation with hycom currents pointing to the importance of the resolution and the accuracy of the current forcing dataset in correctly representing wave current interactions here we use the bluelink reanalysis surface current dataset with a resolution of 0 1 as forcing for our simulations to test the importance of the wave model resolution on representing wave current interaction processes apart from the simulations described in section 2 1 i e a global grid of 0 4 resolution with another grid of 0 1 resolution across the southern ocean another set of simulations with and without currents was undertaken using only a global grid with a 0 4 spatial resolution but otherwise keeping the same configuration described in section 2 1 the significant wave height output from the model in both current forced simulations with and without the higher resolution grid in the southern ocean was compared against altimeter observations as in section 3 1 in each simulation we found a significant improvement in the h s estimations with the inclusion of currents however when we explored the result sensitivity to increased resolution in the southern ocean any improvements due to this higher resolution were much less obvious fig 10 shows the difference in performance metrics linear correlation coefficient mean bias and rmse between the simulations with and without the higher resolution grid in each case surface currents were included as a forcing of the model analogously to fig 1 a positive value in the correlation differences fig 10 a means that the correlation is increased when using the higher resolution grid and a negative value in fig 10 b or c represents a reduction in the mean bias or rmse and hence an improvement in the model performance as expected there are no changes in the model performance in the northern hemisphere in the southern ocean the average of the mean bias absolute value across all grid points is reduced from 29 cm to 27 5 cm and the rmse from 35 5 cm to 34 9 cm many regions in deep waters of the southern ocean show a reduction of the mean bias by up to 10 cm and of rmse by up to 5 cm however in various coastal areas and downstream of them the current forced simulation with the higher resolution grid performs worse than the simulation with the global grid only this issue could be related to the fact that the higher resolution grid reaches shallower areas where presumably our global model can incur errors and misrepresent bathymetric features and transformations of shoaling waves on the other hand errors in the current data from the bluelink reanalysis in coastal areas could also contribute to this effect nonetheless deep water areas show an overall slight improvement in h s estimates rapizo et al 2018 previously found the inclusion of current forcing improved the estimates of peak wave direction only slightly and worsened the mean wave direction estimations at the sofs buoy location and they related this issue to the accuracy and resolution of the current forcing the rationale is that a wave model with a spatial resolution that is too coarse will incorporate current data in an eddy permitting manner it would only represent eddies when the rossby radius of deformation is much larger than the grid spacing whereas an eddy resolving model would be expected to be more accurate while the accuracy of the current forcing is paramount the wave model resolution is also an important consideration this would be especially true for representing current induced refraction and changes in wave direction here we tested the differences in the performance of wave models forced with currents but with model grids of differing resolution 0 4 and 0 1 first we selected the same storm event in sydney shown in fig 5 and analysed how both simulations with and without the high resolution southern ocean grid represented the differences in wave height and direction when including currents in an area surrounding the south part of australia fig 11 this was the most intense wave current interaction event at the sydney buoy location for 2014 2016 fig 11 shows that significant changes in h s higher than 1 m occurred in the tasman sea and the southern ocean that day as well as complex changes although of lower amplitude off western australia off eastern australia the current induced refraction was particularly intense that day producing changes in wave direction of more than 20 the acc and the leeuwin current also produced changes of wave direction although of lower magnitude while undoubtedly these features are resolved in a more detailed manner in the higher resolution simulation the lower resolution simulation does not fail to represent the general current induced refraction patterns nor the changes in wave height besides the intensity of the changes is very similar in both cases fig 11 shows the differences in the representation of current induced refraction between the higher and lower resolution simulations in terms of h s in panel c and θ m in panel f the differences in wave direction are generally smaller than 4 and differences in h s are well below 15 cm for current induced changes in wave height of more than 1 m this represents a maximum difference of 10 for the most intense wave current interaction event at the sydney location a comparison of these current forced simulations with and without the higher resolution grid in the southern ocean with the australian buoy network reveals that while some improvements are attained with the high resolution simulation especially in terms of wave period statistics and also correlation in wave direction off eastern australia there are also areas where there is a worsening of wave estimates figure s8 in short depending on the application running a current forced wave simulation with a 0 4 grid provides a reasonable representation of wave current interaction processes some areas will result in improvements in certain wave parameters when using a high resolution grid 4 discussion and conclusions in this study we have shown that a significant improvement in the performance of wave simulations can be achieved by including ocean surface current data from a global reanalysis as an additional forcing to the wave model the correlation values for the current forced simulation are statistically larger at the 95 confidence level than those of the simulation without currents for every month of the year and for every ocean basin fig 2 and s3 we found there is an important reduction of the mean bias and rmse in most areas of the world and particularly in the southern ocean here global wave models tend to overestimate the observed wave heights in part due to biases in the wind data used as input drifting icebergs that block the wave energy but not accounted for in the model and not considering surface current forcing since the westerly winds blow in the same direction as the acc the relative wind that acts on the surface of the ocean is lower than the real wind wavewatch iii incorporates this effect by balancing current and wind vectors assuming a proportionality coefficient of 1 a in eq 1 in reality the wind waves and currents will interact and modify the boundary layer profile and hence the relative wind will be different to the one given by eq 1 in this implementation the choice of a 1 most likely produces an overestimation of the relative wind in most conditions a fully coupled ocean wave atmosphere model would be necessary to represent these interactions more accurately see for example renault et al 2016 nevertheless this simplistic approach partially captures this process and helps to reduce the bias in wave heights other areas with improvement in the wave model performance are the ac and eacc regions and the south indonesian islands a large area eastward of the drake passage also exhibits a substantial improvement in wave heights in the agulhas retroflection area there are alternating bands of improvement and worsening in terms of mean bias and rmse which suggest errors in the spatio temporal location of the mean current meanders and eddies in the bluelink reanalysis data used as input the model performance in the western pacific region is also worse when incorporating currents this is a very challenging area for ocean modelling because of its complex geography with multiple atolls and small islands covering this region a global simulation with a relatively coarse grid resolution is unable to capture the complex geographic and bathymetric features of this area nevertheless as a global average the current forced simulation performs better than the simulation without currents in terms of correlation bias and rmse throughout the year moreover the improvement is also seen if separating the data into different ocean basins this improvement can yield major benefits for a broad range of practicalities that involve wave modelling such as wave forecasts industry based applications coastal studies future wave projections among others in addition many wave modelling studies have historically disregarded the influence of ocean currents e g coastal studies harley et al 2009 swell climate analysis semedo et al 2011 assessments of projected changes of wave climate morim et al 2019 although that trend has been reversing in recent years ardhuin et al 2017 rapizo et al 2018 hegermiller et al 2019 a comparison was carried out between the simulation outputs and buoy observations from the australian and ndbc buoy networks although most buoys are in intermediate and even shallow waters and the spatial resolution of the global grid used in this study 0 4 globally and 0 1 in the southern ocean is too coarse to properly capture the wave processes and transformations that occur at the coast this comparison is helpful to evaluate how the large scale wave current interactions influence the coastal wave climate in addition the model suitably represents the observed wave parameters with average correlation values of 0 91 0 57 and 0 57 for h s t p and θ p respectively for the australian buoy network table s1 of the supporting information section si for the ndbc buoy network the average correlation values are 0 94 0 58 and 0 68 for h s t p and θ p respectively table s2 of the si the main conclusion we draw from this comparison is that introducing current forcing into wave simulations produces a substantial improvement in the model estimates of wave height period and direction albeit some statistics are made worse in a few locations it has been previously shown that tidal currents not included in the bluelink reanalysis can modulate the coastal wave climate here we see that the large scale circulation of the east australian current also has a significant impact on the wave properties measured at the east coast of australia however as noted by oke et al 2013 and chiswell and rickard 2014 the ocean surface currents from the bluelink reanalysis present significant differences with the observations in the eac and aac these errors in the current forcing dataset can be a factor that contributes to the worsening in the representation of wave parameters observed for some buoys e g figure 17 of chiswell and rickard 2014 shows large discrepancies in the ocean surface velocities in south east australia close to the eden buoy location where we observe a statistically significant worsening in the wave direction estimates for the simulation with currents on the other hand while the average improvement is small and not statistically significant for some locations currents can have a significant impact on waves on short intervals of time fig 5 shows the h s t p and θ p measured by the sydney buoy during the last days of march 2016 at this location between 2014 and 2016 the wave heights of the simulation without currents were changed by 5 of their value during 50 of the time due to the inclusion of current forcing for 80 of the time the changes in h s were 10 however during the event shown in fig 5 in the last days of 2016 there were significant changes in wave height of up to 1 2 m 2 8 m in the current forced simulation 75 higher than 1 6 m in the simulation without currents 5s in peak period a 50 change from 11s to 16s and 80 in direction further the current forced simulation output values are substantially closer to the observed wave conditions than the simulation without currents this has direct implications for coastal management studies not considering currents led to a significant underestimation of wave heights during this event which can impact other wave derived quantities such as wave energy fluxes or estimations of wave setup in the long term wave current interactions could affect estimates of wave contributions to coastal sea levels maximum and return period wave heights design parameters of coastal structures among many others importantly wave direction is substantially misrepresented and this variable plays a critical role in many important coastal processes such as alongshore sediment transport komar 1971 moreover harley et al 2017 investigated the june 2016 collaroy beach storm the most damaging storm in the last 40 years in that area and observed that the anomalous wave direction instead of wave heights was primarily responsible for making this storm so destructive here we show that the meandering flow of the eac can significantly influence the wave climate in the tasman sea and modulate the wave direction at the coast considering that an overall improvement in wave simulation is achieved by introducing current forcing the differences in various wave parameters were analysed to further understand wave current interaction processes and their implications fig 7 shows the percental changes in wave heights mean periods and directions wave heights are reduced in most parts of the world except in the ac and eac close to the coast the ecc and in some regions of the north indian ocean and the northern section of the cc there is also a slight increase in wave heights close to the antarctic continent but since there is not an improvement of the model performance by including currents in this area this feature is disregarded the well known overestimation of observed wave heights by the model is reduced by accounting for the effect of ocean currents on waves waves also have shorter periods in the current forced simulation in most ocean basins and larger periods in the tropics at the east and northwest coasts of australia and southeast coast of africa a correct representation of wave periods is fundamental to improve the propagation of swell waves by numerical wave models because the wave propagation speed in deep waters depends on the wave period the longer wave periods of the simulation without currents on most areas of the world fig 7 b would translate into faster propagating waves and therefore wave models would tend to predict early swell arrival times jiang et al 2016 fig 8 shows that in general waves tend to increase their wave heights and periods when they propagate against the main flow and vice versa this agrees with results shown in fig 7 in the agulhas current or east australian current regions where wave heights and periods are increased decreased where the predominant southerly waves propagate against with the current the changes in wave properties in the equatorial region are more challenging to scrutinize given the complex and multi modal wave climate of the region however the largest increases in wave period seem to arise from the northern and southern hemisphere swell waves figures s5 and s6 there are also large percental changes in wave period in the arabian sea and bay of bengal wave current interactions in this area deserve a more detailed analysis given the complexity of the main wave climate as well as the strong seasonality in the reversing ocean circulation in the area both strongly influenced by the asian monsoon e g shankar et al 2002 although the consideration of current forcing leads to an overall improvement in wave period estimates the physical mechanisms that lead to the observed differences in wave period in many areas of the world are not yet fully understood importantly there are considerable average differences in wave direction particularly in the tropics the itf and the ac and eac regions the positive negative differences at the right left sides of the current s main flow direction in the ac mc eac bc nbc and gs represent clockwise anticlockwise changes in wave direction in agreement with results from kenyon 1971 this suggests that waves propagating opposite to the currents main direction may focus and or be trapped in the central axis of the currents this is most likely to occur in the ac mc and eac which are exposed to southern ocean generated swell waves the changes in wave direction in the ac mc and eac seem at this scale to reach the coast further figs 3 and 5 show that an overall improvement in wave direction is achieved with the current forced simulation along eastern australia given that wave direction has historically been challenging to simulate in wave models these results may be beneficial to improving estimates of wave direction in future studies as well as providing improved understanding and representation of coastal processes for which wave direction plays a critical role e g along shore sediment transport furthermore this will undoubtedly affect global wind wave climate projections studies which so far have been carried out using surface wind fields taken from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip with no ocean surface current forcing hemer et al 2013 morim et al 2019 the changes in wave heights periods and direction due to the inclusion of currents shown in fig 7 are approximately of the same magnitude and in some cases greater than the projected changes in these wave parameters calculated by hemer et al 2013 and morim et al 2019 wave current interactions could be particularly relevant for wave projections near and along the east coast of australia given the significant wave refraction induced by the eac figs 5 and 7 c and the on going and projected increase in eac transport and poleward extension as climate changes into the future oliver and holbrook 2014 oliver et al 2015 the changes in wave conditions by the inclusion of currents also modify the ocean surface roughness which has consequences for the coupled climate system the whitecap cover is reduced by 0 02 0 04 in the acc eacc nbc cc and ec and it is increased by 0 02 in the ecc region the global average whitecap coverage is estimated to be around 3 6 blanchard 1963 in the equatorial region considering current forcing changes the whitecap cover by more than 25 the friction velocity and atmosphere to ocean energy flux show similar patterns although the changes in friction velocity range between 10 and the energy flux into the ocean changes by 50 it should be noted that the atmosphere to ocean momentum flux changes are equivalent to those of the energy flux the generation of whitecaps in deep water plays an important role in the enhancement of heat momentum gas and particle transfer between the ocean and the atmosphere as well as being high sunlight reflectance areas that contribute to increase the planetary albedo and are therefore fundamental in global radiation budget calculations cavaleri et al 2012 the results shown in figs 7 9 and s7 point to the critical importance of wave current interaction for climate modelling in tropical areas the inclusion of currents leads to reduced ocean surface roughness and whitecap coverage in the ec region and reduces the energy and momentum transfers from the atmosphere the contrary happens in the ecc area since waves can also influence surface currents and winds better representation of these processes could be achieved by implementing a fully coupled atmosphere wave ocean model in addition a comparison of the relative wind computed by the wave model with measured winds either in situ or from satellites is necessary to better assess the validity of these results furthermore significant changes in stokes drift speed 30 and direction 10 in western boundary currents and particularly in the equatorial region are attained by incorporating current forcing the changes in stokes drift direction follow a very similar pattern to the changes in friction velocity direction figure s7 a currents are a fundamental consideration in particle tracking studies e g onink et al 2019 which often use independent ocean circulation and stokes drift data as opposed to fully coupled models given the inherent turbulence of the upper ocean particle tracking studies must use a large number of particles to provide statistical consistency to their results hence if the change in stokes drift speed or direction can advect a particle to a slightly different position this could have significant impacts on the final trajectory of the particle finally the sensitivity of the wave current results to wave model resolution was explored in section 3 3 current forced wave simulations with and without the higher resolution 0 1 grid in the southern ocean were compared fig 10 shows that by incorporating an eddy resolving model configuration instead of an eddy permitting one slightly better estimates of significant wave height in deep waters were achieved this is likely a product of a more accurate representation of the surface wind field from the cfsr reanalysis of 0 2 spatial resolution based on fig 11 of rapizo et al 2018 we hypothesized that the patterns of current induced refraction would be radically different in both simulations high and low resolution instead we found fig 11 that changes in the significant wave height and mean wave direction follow the same patterns in both simulations albeit that the higher resolution simulation represents these in a more detailed manner the changes in wave period due to the inclusion of current forcing are also equivalent in both simulations not shown the most extreme wave current interaction event at the sydney buoy location for 2014 2016 was chosen for fig 11 however other time periods were also selected and analysed all yielding similar results figure s8 compares these two simulations against the buoy observations in australia and shows that the improvements achieved when incorporating the high resolution grid are mostly in terms of peak wave period estimates of wave height and direction are improved for some locations but worsened for others while the introduction of current forcing greatly improved the performance of global wave simulations using a high resolution grid did not necessarily translate into significant further improvements rather we found that current induced changes in wave parameters were relatively well represented using the coarser 0 4 model grid in comparison with the eddy resolving 0 1 grid configuration in the southern ocean this is appreciated by examining the representation of wave direction against observations from the australian buoys within the 0 1 grid domain and ndbc buoys within the 0 4 global grid figures 3 and 4 show that there is an improvement in wave direction with the inclusion of currents for most of the buoys while here we have only compared wave simulations with resolutions of 0 4 and 0 1 ocean surface currents of smaller spatial scales can also have a substantial impact on waves e g ardhuin et al 2017 in addition an assessment of the sensitivity of wave modelling to the inclusion of surface current forcing from different ocean reanalysis products could yield a greater understanding of global and regional wave current interaction processes in conclusion surface currents impact wind waves in various ways and wavewatch iii certainly captures these processes in a one way coupling implementation broadly improving simulation performance undoubtedly there will be some errors in the current forcing data taken from the bran reanalysis and a fully coupled modelling approach will be more beneficial to capture the complex interactions between the ocean atmosphere and waves and provide more realistic outputs nevertheless we have shown that global deep water and coastal wave parameter estimates can be significantly improved with the methodology applied in this study and that major benefits can be achieved based on this approach for the wave modelling

23909,the influence of ocean surface currents on the global wind wave field is revisited state of the art numerical spectral wave model simulations with and without surface currents taken from an eddy resolving global ocean reanalysis were compared as a global average simulations forced with currents display significantly better agreement with altimeter derived wave heights the bias and root mean square error in significant wave heights are mostly reduced when including current forcing especially in the southern ocean an overall improvement in wave periods and wave direction is also seen when comparing model outputs with the australian and united states buoy network observations including surface ocean current forcing in wave simulations reduces the simulated wave heights in most areas of the world due to a decreased relative wind given by co flowing winds and currents current induced refraction generates important changes in wave direction in western boundary current and tropical regions furthermore large and broad changes in friction velocity atmosphere to ocean energy flux whitecap cover and stokes drift velocities are observed in equatorial regions finally the importance of the wave model resolution for representing wave current interactions was tested by comparing results from eddy permitting lower resolution and eddy resolving higher resolution configurations we conclude that the main patterns of current induced refraction are well represented in both cases albeit that the higher resolution simulation represents these in a more detailed manner finally the implications that the observed wave current interactions have on several ocean processes are discussed keywords wind wave modelling wave current interaction ocean currents wave refraction wavewatch iii bran reanalysis 1 introduction since the pioneering studies of longuet higgins and stewart 1960 1961 1964 it has been understood that there are complex non linear interactions and energy transfers between ocean wind waves and the mean flow these are two way interactions i e wind waves can influence surface currents and in turn currents can modify wave properties in this study we focus on the influence of ocean surface currents on wind waves across the globe indeed there are various ways in which currents can affect waves waves can change their properties such as their steepness or frequency due to exchanges of energy with the mean flow via the radiation stress besides non uniform currents can refract wave trains in a manner analogous to the way in which changes in depth induce wave refraction further the transfer of energy from the atmosphere to the ocean can be modified in the presence of currents the effective wind that acts on waves propagating on a moving medium might be different than the real wind while these effects have been investigated generally at local scales such as the effects of tidal circulation on coastal wave fields e g jones 2000 ardhuin et al 2012 rapizo et al 2015 lewis et al 2019 and the understanding of more theoretical aspects of this interaction is in constant progress e g constantin and monismith 2017 the broad scale implications of ocean circulation on the observed global wave field are still mostly unknown this study uses state of the art numerical wave modelling to investigate and improve understanding of wave current interactions at the global scale and its implications wave current interaction plays an important role in a broad range of ocean processes first and most importantly including surface ocean current data from global reanalysis as an additional input in wave simulations leads to an overall improvement in wave model performance rapizo et al 2018 this has direct implications for improving wave forecasting capabilities which are critical for industry based applications navigation operations at sea and wave based research wave current coupling can produce non linear interactions that induce wave breaking in deep waters that modify ocean roughness which affects satellite remote sensing products like ocean colour and radar imaging romero et al 2017 in addition it is believed that wave current interactions may be one of the processes responsible for the formation of extreme wave heights lavrenov 1998 toffoli et al 2015 that can have drastic consequences for navigation another potential application is the tracking of swell waves across ocean basins using an array of three pressure gauges moored off shore of san clemente island munk et al 1963 measured the arriving swell waves and through backtracking techniques and assuming swell waves follow great circle paths inferred the position of the storm that had generated them they concluded that intense storms in the southern ocean produced waves that travelled across the pacific ocean in 5 to 15 days before reaching the coasts of california however on occasions the method of munk et al 1963 yielded errors of up to 1000 km in the position of the originating storms placing them in the antarctic continent kenyon 1971 studied the wave refraction produced by the shear in ocean currents and using an idealized model of the antarctic circumpolar current acc found it to be plausible that the acc could deflect the direction of swell waves and thus explain the errors in munk s measurements gallet and young 2014 took up this idea by using modern satellite derived ocean currents products to demonstrate that mesoscale vorticity in the ocean can significantly deflect the direction of waves and thereby providing a compelling explanation for munk s errors many studies using different methodologies and across a range of spatial scales have shown the indubitable sensitivity of waves to ocean currents using sar data from the sir b mission irvine and tilley 1988 gave initial accounts on how waves can be refracted and even trapped by the agulhas current and how this could translate into extreme wave generation ardhuin et al 2017 carrying out wave simulations with and without current forcing showed that wave height variability in the open ocean is modulated by currents at scales of 10 100 km and that the spectrum of spatial variations of currents is proportional to that of wave heights wandres et al 2017 using a coupled ocean circulation and wave model showed that the leeuwin current especially its eddies and meanders has a significant impact on the wave climate of western australia being able to produce a change of 25 in significant wave height and 20 in mean direction more recently rapizo et al 2018 showed that a significant improvement in the performance of global wave simulations can be achieved by including surface current forcing from a global reanalysis they showed that the main effect of including currents is the reduction of wave heights due to a diminished relative wind in the presence of co flowing current fields this is especially evident in the southern ocean where the westerly winds blow in the same direction as the acc however there are also current induced refraction and energy convergence processes that occur in localized areas such as the agulhas current or the equatorial current and counter current systems when comparing model results with observations taken from a moored buoy in the southern ocean rapizo et al 2018 observed that the current forced wave simulation performed better than the simulation without currents in terms of wave heights and period in terms of wave direction they found a small improvement for peak direction and a slight worsening for mean direction they attributed this worsening to the coarse resolution of their simulation and the current forcing product 0 5 presumably incapable of effectively capturing the ocean circulation features that modify wave direction through current induced refraction likewise quilfen et al 2018 found that their wave model simulations underestimated the magnitude of the wave height variability which they also attributed to their model resolution 0 25 being too coarse as well as to errors in the ocean current data overall these recent studies suggest that increased wave model resolution is an important factor to consider in order to properly represent wave current interactions this paper revisits and challenges the current view on the importance of model resolution for wave current interaction research it builds on previous studies extending and improving some of their aspects specifically we analyse a three year high resolution 0 1 wave model simulation across the southern ocean with and without current forcing to assess the importance of using an eddy resolving resolution to properly represent wave current interaction we investigate the role of wave current interaction on other processes such as energy and momentum fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean stokes drift velocities stokes 1847 of critical importance for search and rescue activities and tracking of particles in the ocean whitecap coverage among others the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the configuration of the wave and current models and the altimeter and buoy datasets used to validate the wave simulations section 3 1 presents a comprehensive validation of wave parameters from the simulations with and without currents against altimeter and moored buoys observations section 3 2 presents an analysis of the effects that ocean currents have on different wave parameters and section 3 3 discusses the importance of wave model resolution by comparing results from two sets of wave simulations with high and low resolutions finally section 4 discusses key aspects of the main results together with the main conclusions extracted from this study 2 data and methods 2 1 wave model configuration a multi grid implementation of wavewatch iii v5 16 was utilized tolman 2009 consisting of two grids a global grid from 78 s to 78 n with 0 4 spatial resolution i e at the margins of being eddy permitting and a regional sub grid spanning the southern ocean around the globe from 65 s 28 s with a 0 1 spatial resolution eddy resolving the atmospheric forcing for the wave model was the 10 m above the mean sea level wind data from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsrv2 saha et al 2010 which has a spatial resolution of approximately 0 2 in the horizontal and a temporal resolution of 1 h the model considers the temporally varying sea ice concentration also taken from cfsr following the approach described by tolman 2003 default threshold concentrations were considered 0 25 ice has no effect on wave propagation 0 75 ice is treated as land 0 25 and 0 75 dampening of the wave energy depending on the ice concentration value the obstruction masks used to account for small islands not resolved by the model grid tolman 2003 were constructed using the global self consistent hierarchical high resolution shoreline gshhs dataset water level effects were not incorporated in the wave simulations in this study some of the most relevant features of the model s configuration are the ardhuin et al 2010 source term parametrizations st4 specifically configured for utilization with the cfsr winds the discrete interaction approximation dia hasselmann et al 1985 for nonlinear wave wave interactions the third order ultimate quickest propagation scheme leonard 1979 1991 including the garden sprinkler effect correction tolman 2002 jonswap bottom friction and battjes and janssen 1978 shallow water depth breaking the model is spectrally discretized in 29 frequencies varying from 0 035 to 0 5 hz with an increment factor of 1 1 and directions taken every 15 with this configuration we run two sets of simulations one including ocean surface current data taken from the bluelink reanalysis bran oke et al 2013 as an additional forcing for the wave model and another simulation without any surface current forcing bran is an eddy resolving ocean reanalysis more specifically bran is 0 1 x 0 1 in the horizontal that uses data assimilation to produce a realistic quantitative description of the three dimensional ocean circulation for the last three decades we have used the surface current product from bran at 2 5 m depth by comparing the differences in these two sets of simulations with and without current forcing we assess the sensitivity of wind wave modelling to the inclusion of surface currents in both eddy permitting and eddy resolving model grid configurations we have run three years of wave simulations from january 2014 until december 2016 december 2013 was run but considered as a spin up month as mentioned earlier one of the main effects of the inclusion of surface current forcing in wave simulations is a modification of the relative wind wavewatch iii incorporates this process in a rather simple fashion balancing wind and current vectors the relative wind vector from which wind speed and direction are determined in the presence of currents is computed as 1 w r e l w a b s a u where w a b s represents the absolute wind vector with units of m s u is the ocean current vector in m s and a is a dimensionless coefficient wavewatch iii considers a 1 which implies the largest effect of currents e g if the measured 10 m absolute wind speed and direction are the same as the surface currents the relative wind input to the model is null 2 2 altimeter wave dataset altimetric satellites orbit the earth measuring significant wave heights with an almost global coverage altimeter observations represent an outstanding data source to assess a global wave model s performance rascle and ardhuin 2013 durrant et al 2014 roland and ardhuin 2014 hemer et al 2017 here we have used altimeter derived significant wave heights to evaluate the performance of the current forced and non current forced wave simulations the altimeter dataset was calibrated quality controlled and assessed by ribal and young 2019 it comprises all the available altimeter missions from 1985 to the present we have selected the along track significant wave height data of those missions that operated during the period 2014 2016 jason 2 cryosat 2 hy 2 a saral jason 3 and sentinel 3 a we have mapped these data onto the global 0 4 resolution grid of our model that is for each bin of our model grid we selected the satellite data that fell into that bin and averaged it over the course of an hour in this way we compared the significant wave height at each grid point of the model with all the available satellite observations that corresponded to that grid point with this approach the comparisons were localized and excessive averaging avoided however the availability of altimeter data is inhomogeneous i e it is higher close to the satellite tracks but there are areas in which the amount of data points is much lower 2 3 wave buoy data wave buoy measurements are usually regarded as the most accurate wave information available and they are often used to validate altimeter wave height products zieger et al 2009 ribal and young 2019 for this study we have selected a representative set of buoys from australia and the united states us publicly available through the australian ocean data network aodn https portal aodn org au and us national data buoy center ndbc https www ndbc noaa gov portals respectively all the buoys have significant wave height information however some of them compute it from a wave to wave analysis and others from spectral analysis most of the buoys also measure wave direction peak direction for some of them and peak direction for sea and swell separately for others in every case the wavewatch iii parameters were computed via spectral analysis and the necessary processing filtering such as removing bad data or averaging buoy observations with a higher sampling frequency than the model output was applied to match the observations with the model s results the wave parameters selected for comparison significant wave height h s peak period t p and peak direction θ p were computed from modelled wavewatch iii directional wave spectra as follows 2 h s 0 2 π 0 e f θ d f d θ 3 t p 1 f p 4 θ p atan b a with e f θ being the wave spectral density as a function of frequency f and direction θ 2d spectrum f p the peak frequency computed from the 1d spectrum frequency at which the highest energy level is attained a 0 2 π cos θ e f p θ d θ and b 0 2 π sin θ e f p θ d θ it is important to note that wavewatch iii outputs the spectrum in terms of intrinsic and not absolute frequency therefore for a correct comparison against buoy measurements a doppler shift correction should be applied to the output of the current forced simulation to compute the absolute frequency the conversion from intrinsic to absolute frequency was done using the dispersion relationship of wind waves 5 ω σ k u with ω and σ the absolute and intrinsic angular frequency respectively k the wavenumber vector and u the surface current vector the inner product in eq 5 was approximated using the mean wavelength and mean wave direction 3 results 3 1 comparison against observations in the first instance the significant wave heights h s simulated by the model were evaluated against those derived from the satellite altimeter observations the following statistical parameters were used to evaluate the model runs as indicators of the degree of similarity between observed o and modelled m values the pearson linear correlation coefficient r the mean bias 1 n m o and the root mean square error rmse 1 n m o 2 the normalized bias was computed as 100 m o o while the normalized rmse is 100 1 n m o 2 1 n o for wave direction the linear correlation coefficient formula was taken from jammalamadaka and sengupta 2001 and the bias and rmse were computed keeping in mind that wave direction is an angular variable treating the direction values as points in a circumference of unit radius the difference between two given direction values is defined not as the arithmetic subtraction between the two as we would do for wave height or period but as the smaller arclength along the circumference this way the difference between 350 and 10 is 20 not 340 conversely the difference between 10 and 350 is 20 likewise the mean direction was computed treating the direction values as unit vectors and calculating the direction of their resultant vector i e dividing the direction values dataset in x and y components computing the average of each component separately and forming the resulting vector with them thus the mean direction between 10 and 350 would be 0 and not 180 when comparing with buoy measurements the bias in wave direction is defined as the average of all the differences in direction values model minus observations therefore a positive bias in direction shows that the model represents waves in a more clockwise direction relative to north than the observations fig 1 shows the pearson s linear correlation coefficient left panels mean bias middle panels and rmse right panels of h s for the simulation without currents a d g for the current forced simulation b e h and the difference between those statistics c f i the correlation coefficient between altimeter derived and modelled significant wave heights is 0 9 at high latitudes of both hemispheres and it is lower 0 7 at low latitudes and in coastal areas the bias and rmse distributions observed in fig 1 are a common feature of global wave models the mean bias is mostly positive meaning that the model overestimates the observed wave heights except in the western equatorial pacific where the model simulates lower wave heights than the observed ones the highest absolute errors are found at high latitudes especially in the southern ocean these errors are related to several factors such as a positive bias in the reanalysis winds used to force the model the fact that the wave model does not incorporate information about drifting icebergs which block the wave energy among others there are also high errors close to the ice edge presumably related to the parameterization of wave propagation over areas partially covered with ice being too simple by visual comparison of the performance of both simulations with and without currents it can be seen that incorporating current forcing in the wave model significantly increases the correlation at low latitudes and reduces the mean bias and rmse especially in the southern ocean the bottom panels show the difference in correlation bias and rmse computed as the value of the current forced simulation minus that of the simulation without currents in this way a positive value in fig 1 c means that the correlation coefficient in the current forced simulation is higher than in the simulation without currents indeed there are substantial improvements in correlation i e higher values in the current forced simulation at low latitudes especially at the eastern side of ocean basins in the south eastern african coasts and to a lesser extent in the antarctic circumpolar current and east australian current regions regarding the bias because it is a signed quantity when comparing bias values from different simulations we decided to take the difference in their absolute values e g a bias of 0 2 m is regarded more accurate than a bias of 0 3 m wherever the difference in bias or rmse is negative blue in fig 1 f and or fig 1 i it means that the absolute bias or rmse of the current forced simulation is lower than that of the simulation in the absence of currents in general most areas of the world show a reduction of the mean bias or the rmse and hence an improvement of the wave model performance when including current forcing however there are also some areas where the mean absolute bias or the rmse of the current forced simulation is higher than that of the simulation without currents these areas are mainly the western pacific and the waters surrounding the antarctic shelf as a global average including current forcing in the model reduces the bias from 0 21 m to 0 17 m reduces the rmse from 0 29 m to 0 27 m and increases the correlation between modelled and observed wave heights from 0 906 to 0 911 on the other hand similar results are obtained comparing the observed and simulated extreme wave heights figure s1 of the supporting information section si shows the observed 90th percentile h s top panel and the differences in simulated 90th percentile h s from the wave simulations with and without currents bottom panel as expected the extreme wave heights are reduced in most areas of the world particularly in the southern ocean due to co flowing winds and currents lowering the energy transfer from the atmosphere however including current forcing increases the 90th percentile h s in the agulhas current east australian current equatorial counter currents and gulf stream regions likely due to exchanges of energy between the waves and the main flow in conditions of opposing waves and currents the same comparison against altimeter data was carried out for the 90th percentile h s figure s2 the correlation values of 90th percentile wave heights are significantly lower than for the total h s further although there is an overall improvement in the correlation values of the 90th percentile wave heights some areas reveal a decrease in correlation for the current forced simulation figure s2 c in terms of bias and rmse there is a substantial improvement in the current forced simulation especially at high latitudes as well as in the agulhas current east australian current and equatorial counter current regions however the mean absolute bias and rmse of the 90th percentile h s increase i e become worse with the inclusion of current forcing in the tropics except in the equatorial counter current areas particularly in the western pacific basin fig 2 shows the performance of both wave model simulations in terms of r bias and rmse throughout the year and separated by regions the bias and rmse are expressed here as percentages of the mean observed wave heights the correlation values for the current forced simulation are consistently higher than those of the simulation without currents for each month of the year likewise the mean bias and rmse are consistently lower throughout the seasons the wave simulation in the absence of currents performs reasonably well globally with total r values 0 85 a mean bias 10 of the average observed wave heights and rmse 20 the current forced simulation always performs better with correlation values approximately 0 005 0 01 larger mean bias values 1 5 smaller and rmse 1 smaller the performance of the current forced simulation is also improved in each ocean basin with the improvement being slightly greater for the southern hemisphere basins while these differences are small it should be considered that these statistics are computed over long periods of time and over large areas while the effects of wave current interaction can be more localized as observed in fig 1 e g if only a portion of the southern ocean or of the agulhas current is selected the differences will be larger it is also worth noticing that the improvement in h s estimates is seen at each ocean basin throughout the year figure s3 next a comparison against buoy data is presented with the aim of evaluating the performances of both wave simulations with and without currents in representing the observed wave heights periods and directions close to the coast first we show the evaluation of the wavewatch iii runs against the australian buoys a total of 15 australian buoys was selected three in western australia wa one in south australia sa one in tasmania tas eight in new south wales nsw two in queensland qld and finally one in deep waters of the southern ocean table s1 see si shows the correlation bias and rmse values for h s t p and θ p between the australian buoy measurements and wavewatch iii output for both simulations with and without currents good agreement was found in terms of h s with r 0 9 mean biases ranging between 2 cm and 30 cm and rmse values generally between 30 cm and 40 cm the t p has correlation values 0 5 a mean bias 1 5s for the wa sa and tas buoys but lower than 0 8s for the nsw and qld buoys and rmse 2 4s in terms of θ p we found r 0 6 the mean bias ranges from 16 to 26 across locations and rmse 40 a similar performance of the model is found when comparing against ndbc buoys table s2 here only the differences in the performances of both simulations are shown to highlight the potential improvement achieved by considering current forcing in the wave simulations panel a of fig 3 shows the australian buoys that were selected for this comparison whereas panels b c and d show the differences in correlation absolute value of the bias and rmse in h s θ p and t p respectively as in fig 1 a positive difference in correlation or a negative difference in absolute bias or rmse represents an improvement in the wave model performance when including currents as before the difference in the absolute value of bias is presented in fig 3 in terms of h s there is a statistically significant at the 95 confidence level improvement in correlation in all the nsw buoys except tweed heads and in brisbane the rmse improves for all locations except for cape du couedic tweed heads and gold coast the absolute bias average of the differences improves only for the wa buoys cape sorell crowdy head brisbane and the southern ocean flux station sofs buoy nevertheless the average wave height for the whole period is better represented by the current forced simulation in most locations not shown in terms of peak period there is a general statistically significant at the 95 confidence level improvement in the wa nsw and qld buoys except tweed heads and a broad reduction of the bias and rmse across all sites finally in terms of peak direction there is a significant improvement for rottnest island albany all the nsw buoys except eden byron bay and tweed heads and brisbane whereas in eden and gold coast there is a statistically significant worsening the rmse of the current forced simulation is substantially lower for the nsw buoys the mean bias improves for 8 of the 14 stations and worsens for rottnest island cape naturaliste crowdy head coffs harbour tweed heads and gold coast fig 4 presents a comparison analogous to that in fig 3 but for the ndbc buoys in terms of h s there is an overall increase in the correlation values when adding currents although not statistically significant at the 95 confidence level and a substantial decrease in the absolute value of the bias except for buoys 46078 and 46025 and rmse in terms of peak period there is a statistically significant improvement in the correlation values the difference in correlation is not statistically significant for buoys 46073 46012 42055 42002 and 42057 and a substantial decrease in the absolute bias and rmse except for buoys 46073 and 42055 the differences in the performance statistics of θ p estimates are more variable while there is an overall increase in the correlation values although statistically significant only for 6 buoys some locations show a decrease in correlation not significant the absolute bias in peak direction decreases at 8 buoy locations and increases at 10 locations whereas the rmse shows a general decrease in the current forced simulation although differences in bulk statistics between simulations appear small the inclusion of currents as a forcing of the wave model produces major changes during specific wave events e g like the one shown in fig 5 during the last week of march 2016 in sydney the measured significant wave heights were consistently 1 5 m and 3 5 m in the last day of the month the current forced wave simulation agrees much better with the observations and has substantial differences with the simulation without currents of up to 1 2 m in wave heights 5s in period and 80 in direction during that event during that day the meandering southward flow of the east australian current generated two very intense anticyclonic eddies centred around 152 e 36 s and around 152 e 39 s which had a significant impact on h s the mean periods and direction estimates in the tasman sea with the maximum differences being near sydney the directional wave spectrum at the sydney buoy location for 2016 03 27t12 00z of the simulation without currents shows a northward propagating wave mode with a frequency of around 0 07 hz period of 14 s and a westward propagating mode with a frequency of around 0 09 hz period of 11 s for the simulation with currents the energy in the northward propagating mode is greatly increased while the westward propagating mode decreases its intensity the one dimensional spectra reveal that including current forcing shifts the peak in the spectrum towards lower frequencies due to the increased energy in the northward propagating mode the spatial patterns of differences in wave height period and direction show a positive difference in areas where the currents and the northward propagating wave mode travel in opposite directions and negative differences when they travel in the same direction while undoubtedly the ocean circulation at the coast e g tidal currents not accounted for in the bluelink reanalysis will have a significant impact on the measured wave properties nearer the coast the results presented in fig 5 allow us to conclude that the larger scale ocean circulation as seen by the bluelink reanalysis and presumably other ocean circulation reanalysis products can also have a significant influence on the wave climate at the coast therefore current forcing should be an important consideration for coastal wave modelling studies in east australia 3 2 changes in wave properties due to currents in this section a comparison between the output from simulations with and without currents is presented differences in several wave parameters were analysed to further understand the effects of ocean surface currents on the global wind wave climate results here should be interpreted in light of those presented also in section 3 1 that is any conclusion drawn in this section is valid in those areas where the inclusion of currents as a forcing in the wave model translates into an improvement of the model s performance these include most areas of the world with the exception of the western pacific and waters surrounding the antarctic continent and the arctic for brevity and convenience we use the following acronyms for the major ocean currents antarctic circumpolar current acc agulhas current ac madagascar current mc east african coast current eacc east australian current eac indonesian throughflow itf equatorial currents ec i e the north equatorial current and south equatorial current equatorial counter current ecc brazil current bc north brazil current nbc caribbean current cc gulf stream gs and kuroshio current kc fig 6 outlines the regions associated with these ocean currents together with the spatial structure in their average speeds from 2014 2016 computed with data from the bran reanalysis in addition fig 6 presents the time averaged relative vorticity for that period for the major ocean current systems described in the paper fig 7 shows the time averaged percental changes in significant wave height h s mean period t m 01 and changes in mean direction θ m for the three year period in which the simulations were run 2014 2016 in each case the difference in wave parameters was computed as the value of the variable in the current forced simulation minus that of the simulation without currents the inclusion of current forcing in the model leads to an overall decrease in the significant wave height in most areas of the world this is mostly due to a diminished relative wind in areas with co flowing winds and currents the highest absolute changes in h s are observed in the southern ocean not shown although they represent less than 8 of the average wave heights in that region fig 7 a here the acc flowing in the same general direction as the predominant westerlies makes the relative wind lower than the real wind rapizo et al 2018 in the ac region east of the african coast there is a dipole of increasing wave heights close to the coast and decreasing heights further offshore a similar feature is observed in the cc region and it is also present in the mc and eac although with less intensity this pattern of increase and decrease in h s could be related to both exchanges of energy between the waves and the currents and or to convergence and divergence of wave energy due to current induced refraction however we do not identify the relative contribution of each processes to the observed differences in wave parameters in this study in the agulhas retroflection a prominent turnabout of the southern end of the agulhas current system where the current direction reverses and flows back into the indian ocean a pattern of alternating positive and negative differences in wave height arises which is a consequence of the intense mesoscale eddy activity that characterizes this area eddies can refract the incoming wave trains in very complex manners since the change in wave direction is determined by the sign of the current s shear it is different on each side of the eddy hence redistributing the wave energy and generating energy convergence and divergence areas which in turn translate into higher and lower wave heights respectively e g mathiesen 1987 the reduced relative wind in the southern ocean generates waves of lower amplitude these waves will propagate away from their generation area and since they have lower heights in the southern ocean they will also present reduced wave heights in the southern hemisphere ocean basins that is why on average the wave heights are reduced in most parts of the ocean basins when incorporating currents into the model important differences are observed in the equatorial region with an average decrease in wave heights in the north and south ec of around 8 of the mean h s and a slight increase in wave heights in the ecc region in the northern hemisphere little or no change is observed in the kc and the gs however there is an observed decrease in h s in the north pacific and north atlantic oceans centred around 50 n also related to a lower relative wind the most conspicuous percental changes in wave height are observed in the nbc cc itf and at the eastern african coasts the nbc and cc significantly reduce h s by up to 15 of the mean values and in the nbc retroflection area there is a slight increase in h s the circulation in the gulf of mexico increases the wave heights at the eastern side of the gulf in addition the florida current increases h s by more than 15 of their mean values the itf is an ocean current system located in an area with extremely complicated geography it is composed of a complex suite of currents that bifurcate and converge but collectively describe a net east to west transport from the pacific into the indian ocean as such there are alternating increases and decreases of wave heights due to the inclusion of currents the most important changes occur north of sulawesi island where h s is reduced by more than 15 of the mean h s in this area the southernmost part of the itf affects the wave climate off northwest australia increasing the wave heights close to the coast and decreasing them further offshore the south indian ocean ec flowing northward of madagascar significantly reduces h s by more than 15 of the mean values in this region close to the coast the flow is split into the southward flowing ac which increases the wave heights close to the coast and the eacc which decreases the wave heights the changes in wave height due to the inclusion of current forcing in the wave simulation can explain the improvements in the simulated h s observed in fig 1 f for example the mean bias in h s for the simulation without currents in the western pacific is mainly negative fig 1 d therefore if the inclusion of currents increases the wave heights in this area this will translate into an improvement of h s estimates indeed fig 7 a shows that the wave heights are increased in a narrow band in the western equatorial pacific where a reduction of the mean bias and rmse is observed fig 1 f and i similarly in the nbc region close to the coast the mean bias in h s for the simulation without currents is negative fig 1 d including currents reduces the wave height in this area fig 7 a therefore exacerbating the negative bias which is deemed as a worsening of h s estimates in this area fig 1 f nevertheless the correspondence between fig 1 f and fig 7 a is not absolute possibly due to altimeter under sampling in the equatorial region to better understand the conditions that lead to an increase or decrease in wave height and mean period fig 8 shows the time averaged changes in h s and mean period t m 01 as a function of the current speed and the wave propagation relative to the currents direction a value of 0 in the x axis of fig 8 indicates that waves propagate in the same direction as the currents and a value of 180 or 180 indicates that waves and currents are propagating in opposite directions fig 8 a and b show the differences in significant wave height for the december january february and june july august months respectively when wave propagation is in the same direction as the currents there is an overall decrease in wave height conversely when waves propagate against the currents there is an overall increase in wave heights something analogous happens with the mean wave period there is a general decrease increase in wave period when waves propagate with against the currents these results are well in agreement with those presented by barnes and rautenbach 2020 for the south african region however it remains unclear what are the physical mechanisms that lead to these differences while a reduced relative wind for winds and currents flowing in the same direction should decrease the wave period the change in intrinsic wavenumber magnitude the concertina effect should increase the wave period for waves going in the same direction as the currents in addition current induced refraction can significantly alter the wave climate of regions otherwise unaffected fig 7 b shows the percental differences in t m 01 between the simulations with and without currents there is an average decrease of mean wave periods in the southern ocean which could also be related to a less intense relative wind e g a jonswap spectra will become narrower in frequency and the peak will move to lower frequencies with increasing wind speeds hasselmann et al 1973 further these differences are propagated throughout the ocean basins producing lower period waves in the south indian pacific and atlantic oceans similar to the h s differences there is a dipole of increasing wave periods close to the coast and decreasing periods off shore in the ac mc cc and eac regions fig 8 c and d shows that on average waves tend to decrease increase their periods when they propagate in the same direction as opposite to the currents this would be particularly true in the ac mc and eac regions which receive southerly waves from the southern ocean furthermore this is supported by figure s4 which shows the average differences in mean wave period off shore of eastern australia for the june july august months together with the one dimensional frequency spectra of both wave simulations for two distinct locations one where the waves propagate in the same direction as the current where there is a decrease in the wave energy in the spectrum and the peak shifts towards higher frequencies and another one where waves oppose the flow where there is an increase of energy in the spectrum with a shift towards lower frequencies these differences in wave spectral density levels could be produced by exchanges of energy with the mean flow mediated by the radiation stress longuet higgins and stewart 1964 or by current induced refraction affecting areas that in the absence of currents would present a different wave climate the substantial increase in wave period for current speeds of 1 1 75 m s for waves propagating approximately between 50 and 120 of the currents direction observed in fig 8 can be traced back to the interaction of southern ocean swell waves with the ec see figure s6 in the equatorial regions there is a time average increase in the mean wave period here the wave climate is highly complex with multiple wave modes presenting different frequencies and directions and being affected differently by the ocean circulation figures s5 and s6 for example the inclusion of currents increases the wave period of the southern ocean swell at location 120 w 0 mostly in the june july august months whereas it reduces the period of the south easterly equatorial waves during this time on the other hand the northern hemisphere generated waves increase their periods due to currents throughout the year figures s5 and s6 in this case the swell waves propagate opposite to the currents direction and the south easterly waves travel in the same direction as the local currents in the north indian ocean there is also a decrease in wave periods that can be traced back to the lower period waves coming from the southern ocean however at the western side of the arabian sea and the bay of bengal there is a significant increase in wave periods of around 7 these changes seem to reach the coasts of pakistan india and myanmar in addition a reduction of more than 10 of the mean period is observed to the north of sulawesi island off northwest australia the wave period is increased by around 8 importantly there are significant changes in mean wave direction due to the inclusion of currents in the model here a positive difference in direction means that the waves of the current forced simulation propagate in a more clockwise direction than in the simulation without currents for example the wave direction in the simulation without currents could be 90 to the e and the direction in the case with currents 135 to the sse likewise a negative difference implies an anti clockwise rotation of waves with the inclusion of currents kenyon 1971 stated that waves which propagate against a variable current will be deflected in the direction of increasing current speed conversely waves propagating in the same direction as the currents will be deflected in the direction of decreasing current speed in the southern ocean there are positive differences in wave direction which means that currents refract the eastward propagating waves on average a few degrees to the south there are very strong directional differences close to the southeast african and east australian coasts once more evidencing the dipole of positive differences clockwise rotation to the right of the current s flow direction and negative differences anti clockwise rotation to the left of the current this pattern is also evident in the bc offshore of uruguay and south brazil in the kc and to a lesser extent in the gs and nbc given the exposure of the south african coasts to southern ocean generated swell the ac can induce a clockwise rotation of these waves if they are close to the coast and an anti clockwise rotation if they are further offshore this could translate into a swell wave focusing in the central axis of the ac as well as in the eac in deep waters at around 30 40 latitude on average there are insignificant changes in mean direction hence current induced refraction is less important in these areas however waves in the tropics are significantly refracted by the ec and ecc in the eastern equatorial pacific there are time averaged changes in mean wave direction of around 10 as shown in figures s5 and s6 the equatorial pacific is an area with a very complex and multi modal wave climate and therefore examining changes in the direction of individual wave modes will be more accurate nevertheless we can conclude that significant wave refraction occurs in this area in the western pacific complex refraction patterns are observed with clockwise and anti clockwise rotations induced by the currents however this is an area where the performance of the wave model worsens when including currents therefore the changes in wave direction might not be a real feature but may be a consequence of a poorer representation of the ocean circulation in this area by the bluelink reanalysis at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere although small the main changes in mean direction are negative meaning that the currents refract waves to a more northward direction the patterns of differences in mean wave direction approximately follow the patterns of relative vorticity in western boundary currents and the acc negative positive vorticity values match with clockwise anticlockwise differences in wave direction in the ac or eac regions the main currents flow poleward and the prevalent waves propagate in the opposite direction equatorward according to kenyon 1971 waves will be deflected in the direction of increasing current speed hence producing clockwise rotations in the western side of the ac or eac and anticlockwise rotations in their eastern sides fig 7 c fig 9 shows the time averaged percental differences in wind friction velocity a wave energy flux cge b stokes drift speed c and the changes in stokes drift direction d the friction velocity is a parameter used to characterize the stress transmitted from the wind to the ocean surface and it can be modified under different sea surface roughness states e g waves the parameterization of wind friction velocity in wavewatch iii depends on the source term physics choice for st4 it is an adaptation of janssen 1991 that includes a sheltering term s u designed to reduce the drag coefficient at high winds including current forcing in the wave model reduces the friction velocity in most areas of the world particularly the ec acc eacc nbc and cc and increases it mainly in the ecc florida current and nbc retroflection area fig 9 a the signs of the changes in h s in these areas approximately match those of the friction velocity for example in the ec regions a diminished relative wind due to co flowing winds and currents reduces the surface stress and consequently the friction velocity values are lower as a result the energy and momentum fluxes from the atmosphere to the ocean decreases figure s7 b and with it the generated wave heights fig 7 a the opposite occurs in the ecc regions where the currents and the wind flow in opposite directions and therefore the relative wind computed by the wave model and hence the wind friction velocity and the transfer of energy from the atmosphere to the ocean is greater in addition the whitecap coverage is also reduced figure s7 c due to a decreased wind stress acting on this area whitecaps arise from waves breaking in deep waters entraining air bubbles and forming patches of foam in the surface of the ocean leckler et al 2013 scanlon et al 2016 in short the wind friction velocity atmosphere to ocean energy and momentum flux and whitecap cover changes due to the inclusion of currents follow the same pattern their most salient features are a decrease in the north and south ec an increase in the ecc and florida current and a decrease in the central north indian ocean and in the eacc region the changes in friction velocity range between 10 fig 9 a in the tropics whereas the changes in whitecap cover and energy flux from the atmosphere vary between 50 of their mean values figure s7 we find that the wave energy flux cge fig 9 b decreases in most areas of the world especially in the ac eacc nbc and cc regions however there is a slight increase in the ecc region and close to the southeast african and australian coasts this increase can be linked to the increases in the spectral energy levels and therefore in significant wave height and wave period observed in these areas e g fig 7 s4 s5 and s6 the wave energy flux is an important variable for assessing the potential force of the waves on coastal processes and on coastal or offshore infrastructure we find that ignoring current forcing in wave simulations can lead to inaccurate estimates of the wave energy flux in many coastal regions around the world for example 25 mean difference in the coast of mozambique 10 in the east coast of australia madagascar and india 20 difference in the coasts of somalia the decrease in cge in the southern coast of australia and the increase in the eastern coast due to the inclusion of current forcing could help to improve the bias in cge observed by hemer et al 2017 finally differences in stokes drift speed and direction are shown in panels 9 c and 9 d respectively as mentioned earlier the stokes drift is an important consideration for search and rescue activities and tracking of particles in the ocean such as plastics plankton or drifting debris van den bremer and breivik 2018 dobler et al 2019 recent theoretical developments have been made regarding the solution for stokes drift velocities in the presence of ocean currents henry 2019 here we analyse the differences in the stokes drift representation by our simulations with and without current forcing interestingly the time averaged differences in stokes drift speed present an analogous pattern to that of the friction velocity decreasing values in the acc a maximum absolute average change of 0 25 cm s eacc central region of the north indian ocean ec nbc and cc and an increase in the ecc and florida current the changes in stokes drift speed range between 30 in low latitudes in terms of stokes drift direction there are significant differences in the ac mc itf eac nbc kc gs and especially in the equatorial region as seen in the mean wave direction in this case there is also a dipole of positive differences in stokes drift direction clockwise rotation to the right of the mean flow direction and negative differences anti clockwise rotation to the left of the current s direction in the major western boundary currents ac mc eacc eac kc bc bc nbc cc ad gs the differences in stokes drift direction can also be linked to the differences in the wind friction velocity direction figure s7 a however these are eulerian differences in the sense that they are computed as the time average at each grid point a lagrangian difference following the particle as it moves might have a significantly different impact on the tracking of particles in the ocean 3 3 importance of wave model resolution rapizo et al 2018 showed that a significant improvement in h s estimates is attained by considering current forcing in wave simulations however when comparing with buoy observations sofs they concluded that despite the improvements in estimates of wave height and period only a slight improvement in peak wave direction estimates and a slight worsening in mean direction were found for the current forced simulation they attributed this to the current forcing product and model resolution being too coarse 0 5 presumably incapable of representing current induced refraction properly the change in wave direction is proportional to the magnitude of the current shear in a direction perpendicular to the waves propagation dysthe 2001 which would be better represented in an eddy resolving simulation rather than eddy permitting rapizo et al 2018 using two distinct surface current products cfsr currents with a resolution of 0 5 and hycom currents with a resolution of 1 12 studied the spatial patterns of differences in h s between simulations with and without currents they found that the differences in h s were significantly greater in the simulation with hycom currents pointing to the importance of the resolution and the accuracy of the current forcing dataset in correctly representing wave current interactions here we use the bluelink reanalysis surface current dataset with a resolution of 0 1 as forcing for our simulations to test the importance of the wave model resolution on representing wave current interaction processes apart from the simulations described in section 2 1 i e a global grid of 0 4 resolution with another grid of 0 1 resolution across the southern ocean another set of simulations with and without currents was undertaken using only a global grid with a 0 4 spatial resolution but otherwise keeping the same configuration described in section 2 1 the significant wave height output from the model in both current forced simulations with and without the higher resolution grid in the southern ocean was compared against altimeter observations as in section 3 1 in each simulation we found a significant improvement in the h s estimations with the inclusion of currents however when we explored the result sensitivity to increased resolution in the southern ocean any improvements due to this higher resolution were much less obvious fig 10 shows the difference in performance metrics linear correlation coefficient mean bias and rmse between the simulations with and without the higher resolution grid in each case surface currents were included as a forcing of the model analogously to fig 1 a positive value in the correlation differences fig 10 a means that the correlation is increased when using the higher resolution grid and a negative value in fig 10 b or c represents a reduction in the mean bias or rmse and hence an improvement in the model performance as expected there are no changes in the model performance in the northern hemisphere in the southern ocean the average of the mean bias absolute value across all grid points is reduced from 29 cm to 27 5 cm and the rmse from 35 5 cm to 34 9 cm many regions in deep waters of the southern ocean show a reduction of the mean bias by up to 10 cm and of rmse by up to 5 cm however in various coastal areas and downstream of them the current forced simulation with the higher resolution grid performs worse than the simulation with the global grid only this issue could be related to the fact that the higher resolution grid reaches shallower areas where presumably our global model can incur errors and misrepresent bathymetric features and transformations of shoaling waves on the other hand errors in the current data from the bluelink reanalysis in coastal areas could also contribute to this effect nonetheless deep water areas show an overall slight improvement in h s estimates rapizo et al 2018 previously found the inclusion of current forcing improved the estimates of peak wave direction only slightly and worsened the mean wave direction estimations at the sofs buoy location and they related this issue to the accuracy and resolution of the current forcing the rationale is that a wave model with a spatial resolution that is too coarse will incorporate current data in an eddy permitting manner it would only represent eddies when the rossby radius of deformation is much larger than the grid spacing whereas an eddy resolving model would be expected to be more accurate while the accuracy of the current forcing is paramount the wave model resolution is also an important consideration this would be especially true for representing current induced refraction and changes in wave direction here we tested the differences in the performance of wave models forced with currents but with model grids of differing resolution 0 4 and 0 1 first we selected the same storm event in sydney shown in fig 5 and analysed how both simulations with and without the high resolution southern ocean grid represented the differences in wave height and direction when including currents in an area surrounding the south part of australia fig 11 this was the most intense wave current interaction event at the sydney buoy location for 2014 2016 fig 11 shows that significant changes in h s higher than 1 m occurred in the tasman sea and the southern ocean that day as well as complex changes although of lower amplitude off western australia off eastern australia the current induced refraction was particularly intense that day producing changes in wave direction of more than 20 the acc and the leeuwin current also produced changes of wave direction although of lower magnitude while undoubtedly these features are resolved in a more detailed manner in the higher resolution simulation the lower resolution simulation does not fail to represent the general current induced refraction patterns nor the changes in wave height besides the intensity of the changes is very similar in both cases fig 11 shows the differences in the representation of current induced refraction between the higher and lower resolution simulations in terms of h s in panel c and θ m in panel f the differences in wave direction are generally smaller than 4 and differences in h s are well below 15 cm for current induced changes in wave height of more than 1 m this represents a maximum difference of 10 for the most intense wave current interaction event at the sydney location a comparison of these current forced simulations with and without the higher resolution grid in the southern ocean with the australian buoy network reveals that while some improvements are attained with the high resolution simulation especially in terms of wave period statistics and also correlation in wave direction off eastern australia there are also areas where there is a worsening of wave estimates figure s8 in short depending on the application running a current forced wave simulation with a 0 4 grid provides a reasonable representation of wave current interaction processes some areas will result in improvements in certain wave parameters when using a high resolution grid 4 discussion and conclusions in this study we have shown that a significant improvement in the performance of wave simulations can be achieved by including ocean surface current data from a global reanalysis as an additional forcing to the wave model the correlation values for the current forced simulation are statistically larger at the 95 confidence level than those of the simulation without currents for every month of the year and for every ocean basin fig 2 and s3 we found there is an important reduction of the mean bias and rmse in most areas of the world and particularly in the southern ocean here global wave models tend to overestimate the observed wave heights in part due to biases in the wind data used as input drifting icebergs that block the wave energy but not accounted for in the model and not considering surface current forcing since the westerly winds blow in the same direction as the acc the relative wind that acts on the surface of the ocean is lower than the real wind wavewatch iii incorporates this effect by balancing current and wind vectors assuming a proportionality coefficient of 1 a in eq 1 in reality the wind waves and currents will interact and modify the boundary layer profile and hence the relative wind will be different to the one given by eq 1 in this implementation the choice of a 1 most likely produces an overestimation of the relative wind in most conditions a fully coupled ocean wave atmosphere model would be necessary to represent these interactions more accurately see for example renault et al 2016 nevertheless this simplistic approach partially captures this process and helps to reduce the bias in wave heights other areas with improvement in the wave model performance are the ac and eacc regions and the south indonesian islands a large area eastward of the drake passage also exhibits a substantial improvement in wave heights in the agulhas retroflection area there are alternating bands of improvement and worsening in terms of mean bias and rmse which suggest errors in the spatio temporal location of the mean current meanders and eddies in the bluelink reanalysis data used as input the model performance in the western pacific region is also worse when incorporating currents this is a very challenging area for ocean modelling because of its complex geography with multiple atolls and small islands covering this region a global simulation with a relatively coarse grid resolution is unable to capture the complex geographic and bathymetric features of this area nevertheless as a global average the current forced simulation performs better than the simulation without currents in terms of correlation bias and rmse throughout the year moreover the improvement is also seen if separating the data into different ocean basins this improvement can yield major benefits for a broad range of practicalities that involve wave modelling such as wave forecasts industry based applications coastal studies future wave projections among others in addition many wave modelling studies have historically disregarded the influence of ocean currents e g coastal studies harley et al 2009 swell climate analysis semedo et al 2011 assessments of projected changes of wave climate morim et al 2019 although that trend has been reversing in recent years ardhuin et al 2017 rapizo et al 2018 hegermiller et al 2019 a comparison was carried out between the simulation outputs and buoy observations from the australian and ndbc buoy networks although most buoys are in intermediate and even shallow waters and the spatial resolution of the global grid used in this study 0 4 globally and 0 1 in the southern ocean is too coarse to properly capture the wave processes and transformations that occur at the coast this comparison is helpful to evaluate how the large scale wave current interactions influence the coastal wave climate in addition the model suitably represents the observed wave parameters with average correlation values of 0 91 0 57 and 0 57 for h s t p and θ p respectively for the australian buoy network table s1 of the supporting information section si for the ndbc buoy network the average correlation values are 0 94 0 58 and 0 68 for h s t p and θ p respectively table s2 of the si the main conclusion we draw from this comparison is that introducing current forcing into wave simulations produces a substantial improvement in the model estimates of wave height period and direction albeit some statistics are made worse in a few locations it has been previously shown that tidal currents not included in the bluelink reanalysis can modulate the coastal wave climate here we see that the large scale circulation of the east australian current also has a significant impact on the wave properties measured at the east coast of australia however as noted by oke et al 2013 and chiswell and rickard 2014 the ocean surface currents from the bluelink reanalysis present significant differences with the observations in the eac and aac these errors in the current forcing dataset can be a factor that contributes to the worsening in the representation of wave parameters observed for some buoys e g figure 17 of chiswell and rickard 2014 shows large discrepancies in the ocean surface velocities in south east australia close to the eden buoy location where we observe a statistically significant worsening in the wave direction estimates for the simulation with currents on the other hand while the average improvement is small and not statistically significant for some locations currents can have a significant impact on waves on short intervals of time fig 5 shows the h s t p and θ p measured by the sydney buoy during the last days of march 2016 at this location between 2014 and 2016 the wave heights of the simulation without currents were changed by 5 of their value during 50 of the time due to the inclusion of current forcing for 80 of the time the changes in h s were 10 however during the event shown in fig 5 in the last days of 2016 there were significant changes in wave height of up to 1 2 m 2 8 m in the current forced simulation 75 higher than 1 6 m in the simulation without currents 5s in peak period a 50 change from 11s to 16s and 80 in direction further the current forced simulation output values are substantially closer to the observed wave conditions than the simulation without currents this has direct implications for coastal management studies not considering currents led to a significant underestimation of wave heights during this event which can impact other wave derived quantities such as wave energy fluxes or estimations of wave setup in the long term wave current interactions could affect estimates of wave contributions to coastal sea levels maximum and return period wave heights design parameters of coastal structures among many others importantly wave direction is substantially misrepresented and this variable plays a critical role in many important coastal processes such as alongshore sediment transport komar 1971 moreover harley et al 2017 investigated the june 2016 collaroy beach storm the most damaging storm in the last 40 years in that area and observed that the anomalous wave direction instead of wave heights was primarily responsible for making this storm so destructive here we show that the meandering flow of the eac can significantly influence the wave climate in the tasman sea and modulate the wave direction at the coast considering that an overall improvement in wave simulation is achieved by introducing current forcing the differences in various wave parameters were analysed to further understand wave current interaction processes and their implications fig 7 shows the percental changes in wave heights mean periods and directions wave heights are reduced in most parts of the world except in the ac and eac close to the coast the ecc and in some regions of the north indian ocean and the northern section of the cc there is also a slight increase in wave heights close to the antarctic continent but since there is not an improvement of the model performance by including currents in this area this feature is disregarded the well known overestimation of observed wave heights by the model is reduced by accounting for the effect of ocean currents on waves waves also have shorter periods in the current forced simulation in most ocean basins and larger periods in the tropics at the east and northwest coasts of australia and southeast coast of africa a correct representation of wave periods is fundamental to improve the propagation of swell waves by numerical wave models because the wave propagation speed in deep waters depends on the wave period the longer wave periods of the simulation without currents on most areas of the world fig 7 b would translate into faster propagating waves and therefore wave models would tend to predict early swell arrival times jiang et al 2016 fig 8 shows that in general waves tend to increase their wave heights and periods when they propagate against the main flow and vice versa this agrees with results shown in fig 7 in the agulhas current or east australian current regions where wave heights and periods are increased decreased where the predominant southerly waves propagate against with the current the changes in wave properties in the equatorial region are more challenging to scrutinize given the complex and multi modal wave climate of the region however the largest increases in wave period seem to arise from the northern and southern hemisphere swell waves figures s5 and s6 there are also large percental changes in wave period in the arabian sea and bay of bengal wave current interactions in this area deserve a more detailed analysis given the complexity of the main wave climate as well as the strong seasonality in the reversing ocean circulation in the area both strongly influenced by the asian monsoon e g shankar et al 2002 although the consideration of current forcing leads to an overall improvement in wave period estimates the physical mechanisms that lead to the observed differences in wave period in many areas of the world are not yet fully understood importantly there are considerable average differences in wave direction particularly in the tropics the itf and the ac and eac regions the positive negative differences at the right left sides of the current s main flow direction in the ac mc eac bc nbc and gs represent clockwise anticlockwise changes in wave direction in agreement with results from kenyon 1971 this suggests that waves propagating opposite to the currents main direction may focus and or be trapped in the central axis of the currents this is most likely to occur in the ac mc and eac which are exposed to southern ocean generated swell waves the changes in wave direction in the ac mc and eac seem at this scale to reach the coast further figs 3 and 5 show that an overall improvement in wave direction is achieved with the current forced simulation along eastern australia given that wave direction has historically been challenging to simulate in wave models these results may be beneficial to improving estimates of wave direction in future studies as well as providing improved understanding and representation of coastal processes for which wave direction plays a critical role e g along shore sediment transport furthermore this will undoubtedly affect global wind wave climate projections studies which so far have been carried out using surface wind fields taken from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip with no ocean surface current forcing hemer et al 2013 morim et al 2019 the changes in wave heights periods and direction due to the inclusion of currents shown in fig 7 are approximately of the same magnitude and in some cases greater than the projected changes in these wave parameters calculated by hemer et al 2013 and morim et al 2019 wave current interactions could be particularly relevant for wave projections near and along the east coast of australia given the significant wave refraction induced by the eac figs 5 and 7 c and the on going and projected increase in eac transport and poleward extension as climate changes into the future oliver and holbrook 2014 oliver et al 2015 the changes in wave conditions by the inclusion of currents also modify the ocean surface roughness which has consequences for the coupled climate system the whitecap cover is reduced by 0 02 0 04 in the acc eacc nbc cc and ec and it is increased by 0 02 in the ecc region the global average whitecap coverage is estimated to be around 3 6 blanchard 1963 in the equatorial region considering current forcing changes the whitecap cover by more than 25 the friction velocity and atmosphere to ocean energy flux show similar patterns although the changes in friction velocity range between 10 and the energy flux into the ocean changes by 50 it should be noted that the atmosphere to ocean momentum flux changes are equivalent to those of the energy flux the generation of whitecaps in deep water plays an important role in the enhancement of heat momentum gas and particle transfer between the ocean and the atmosphere as well as being high sunlight reflectance areas that contribute to increase the planetary albedo and are therefore fundamental in global radiation budget calculations cavaleri et al 2012 the results shown in figs 7 9 and s7 point to the critical importance of wave current interaction for climate modelling in tropical areas the inclusion of currents leads to reduced ocean surface roughness and whitecap coverage in the ec region and reduces the energy and momentum transfers from the atmosphere the contrary happens in the ecc area since waves can also influence surface currents and winds better representation of these processes could be achieved by implementing a fully coupled atmosphere wave ocean model in addition a comparison of the relative wind computed by the wave model with measured winds either in situ or from satellites is necessary to better assess the validity of these results furthermore significant changes in stokes drift speed 30 and direction 10 in western boundary currents and particularly in the equatorial region are attained by incorporating current forcing the changes in stokes drift direction follow a very similar pattern to the changes in friction velocity direction figure s7 a currents are a fundamental consideration in particle tracking studies e g onink et al 2019 which often use independent ocean circulation and stokes drift data as opposed to fully coupled models given the inherent turbulence of the upper ocean particle tracking studies must use a large number of particles to provide statistical consistency to their results hence if the change in stokes drift speed or direction can advect a particle to a slightly different position this could have significant impacts on the final trajectory of the particle finally the sensitivity of the wave current results to wave model resolution was explored in section 3 3 current forced wave simulations with and without the higher resolution 0 1 grid in the southern ocean were compared fig 10 shows that by incorporating an eddy resolving model configuration instead of an eddy permitting one slightly better estimates of significant wave height in deep waters were achieved this is likely a product of a more accurate representation of the surface wind field from the cfsr reanalysis of 0 2 spatial resolution based on fig 11 of rapizo et al 2018 we hypothesized that the patterns of current induced refraction would be radically different in both simulations high and low resolution instead we found fig 11 that changes in the significant wave height and mean wave direction follow the same patterns in both simulations albeit that the higher resolution simulation represents these in a more detailed manner the changes in wave period due to the inclusion of current forcing are also equivalent in both simulations not shown the most extreme wave current interaction event at the sydney buoy location for 2014 2016 was chosen for fig 11 however other time periods were also selected and analysed all yielding similar results figure s8 compares these two simulations against the buoy observations in australia and shows that the improvements achieved when incorporating the high resolution grid are mostly in terms of peak wave period estimates of wave height and direction are improved for some locations but worsened for others while the introduction of current forcing greatly improved the performance of global wave simulations using a high resolution grid did not necessarily translate into significant further improvements rather we found that current induced changes in wave parameters were relatively well represented using the coarser 0 4 model grid in comparison with the eddy resolving 0 1 grid configuration in the southern ocean this is appreciated by examining the representation of wave direction against observations from the australian buoys within the 0 1 grid domain and ndbc buoys within the 0 4 global grid figures 3 and 4 show that there is an improvement in wave direction with the inclusion of currents for most of the buoys while here we have only compared wave simulations with resolutions of 0 4 and 0 1 ocean surface currents of smaller spatial scales can also have a substantial impact on waves e g ardhuin et al 2017 in addition an assessment of the sensitivity of wave modelling to the inclusion of surface current forcing from different ocean reanalysis products could yield a greater understanding of global and regional wave current interaction processes in conclusion surface currents impact wind waves in various ways and wavewatch iii certainly captures these processes in a one way coupling implementation broadly improving simulation performance undoubtedly there will be some errors in the current forcing data taken from the bran reanalysis and a fully coupled modelling approach will be more beneficial to capture the complex interactions between the ocean atmosphere and waves and provide more realistic outputs nevertheless we have shown that global deep water and coastal wave parameter estimates can be significantly improved with the methodology applied in this study and that major benefits can be achieved based on this approach for the wave modelling
