artificial grasslands were established in this study melilotus suaveolens medicago sativa panicum virgatum bromus inermis and miscanthus sinensis all forage plants were planted in 2017 and three replicate plots 6 m 6 m were constructed on each grassland type after plantation forage growth completely depended on rainfall without additional fertilizations human interventions or animal disturbances this treatment ensured that the conditions in all the plots were similar and thus any differences were entirely due to the grassland type all experimental processes were conducted in september 2018 the soil infiltration rates were determined by using the double ring infiltrometer nine replicates were performed for each grassland type at each site a flat land was selected for doing the infiltrating experiment later on all plants were cut off at ground level and the litter layer was carefully removed then the pvc pipes which were of 16 cm inner diameter 32 cm outer diameter and 20 cm height were placed concentrically on the soil surface the pipes were gently inserted about 10 cm deep into the soil using a rubber hammer while ensuring that the rings were levelled during the insertion the soil placed outside the pvc pipes was compacted to avoid water leaving out of the pvc pipes after that water was added into the inner and outer rings respectively until the water depth reached 5 cm at the same time afterwards the time required for the water level to drop 0 5 cm in the inner ring was recorded with a stopwatch until three consecutive measured infiltration times remained unchanged and the infiltration rate was considered to be at steady state the water levels of the inner and outer rings were consistent during the infiltration process to calculate the initial infiltration rate iir only the first three minutes of the infiltration process were taken into consideration the average of the last three fairly constant infiltration rates was considered as the steady state infiltration rate sir these rates were calculated following the equation of zhang et al 2017 1 i δi δt 600 where i is the infiltration rate mm h 1 δ i is the cumulative infiltration in the inner ring cm during δ t time of infiltration min and 600 is a unit conversion factor 2 3 soil sampling and analysis in each plot soil samples were collected at the same soil depth intervals of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 50 cm and three replicates were conducted for each soil layer the gravimetric soil water content swc was measured by taking the proportion of the loss of mass after oven drying at 105 c to the constant mass of dry soil the soil bulk density bd g cm 3 was measured using a stainless steel cylindrical ring of 100 cm3 volume to collect the samples the total soil porosity tp was calculated with the formula 2 tp 1 bd ds 100 where ds is the particle density g cm 3 which was assumed to be 2 65 g cm 3 the mean and standard error values of the soil physical properties are shown in table 1 2 4 plant root sampling the vertical soil profiles were excavated at each experimental plot 24 h after finishing the infiltration experiment two soil samples were taken to determine the plant roots distribution in the soil profile with 0 2 m 0 2 m quadrats at each soil depth samples were taken at six intervals up to a depth of 50 cm 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 50 cm in each plot the roots were separated from soil sample by using a 5 mm mesh sieve and then the roots were placed in basins with water to be gently washed so that the soil particles and debris could be removed the roots were scanned and analyzed using the winrhizo root analysis system for morphological parameter measurements the root length density rld defined as the total root length per soil volume mm 100 cm3 1 root surface area rsa cm2 and root volume rv cm3 were estimated 2 5 statistical analysis all data were expressed as mean value standard error and the statistical analyses were performed using spss 22 0 software one way analysis of variance anova and the least significance difference lsd post hoc test were used to analyze the differences of soil properties and the differences in the initial iir steady sir and average air infiltration rates among the different grasslands the differences in rld rsa and rv among the different grasslands and soil depth intervals were assessed by using the same statistic analysis the pearson correlation coefficient was used to express the correlation between the infiltration rates and root parameters the main influence factors of root morphological characteristics on soil infiltration rate were determined by stepwise multiple regression all significant differences were evaluated at 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 soil water infiltration in the different grasslands the infiltration rates decreased significantly at the initial stage and then gradually tended to be stable fig 1 the sir in the m suaveolens 72 70 0 15 mm h 1 grassland showed significant differences with those values in m sativa 66 69 1 12 mm h 1 p virgatum 58 65 0 47 mm h 1 b inermis 52 69 0 21 mm h 1 and m sinensis 44 98 0 49 mm h 1 grasslands p 0 05 table 2 regarding the iir the highest values were observed in the m suaveolens grassland 143 86 15 92 mm h 1 followed by m sativa 138 37 13 54 mm h 1 b inermis 110 65 11 68 mm h 1 and m sinensis 95 24 8 75 mm h 1 while the iir in p virgatum 87 75 10 83 mm h 1 was significantly lower than in the other four grasslands table 2 the air in the m sinensis grassland was significantly lower than in the other four grasslands p 0 05 table 2 3 2 root distribution and root morphological characteristics the roots distribution in the soil was shown in fig 2 the changes in the root length density rld root surface area rsa and root volume rv with increasing the soil depth depicted similar trends from higher to lower values in the three parameters and were similar among the different grasslands fig 3 the largest rld rsa and rv were recorded in the upper soil layers 0 20 cm and the lowest in the subsoil regarding the magnitude of the parameters the rld rsa and rv were different in the distinct grassland types in terms of root length density rld the values of m sinensis were significantly higher than those observed in the other artificial grasslands p 0 05 with respect to the root surface area rsa the m sinensis b inermis and p virgatum grasslands had higher values than those measured in the m sativa and m suaveolens grasslands regarding to root volume rv the values of m sinensis p virgatum and m sativa were significantly higher than those of b inermis and m suaveolens at the soil depth of 0 20 cm p 0 05 3 3 correlation between root morphological characteristics and infiltration rates the correlation analyses showed that the air had highly significant negative correlation with rld and rsa at depth of 0 50 cm p 0 01 table 3 the iir had highly significant negative relationship with the rld at the depth of 0 40 cm and with the rsa at the depth of 0 5 and 20 40 cm p 0 01 the sir was significantly and negatively related to the rld at depth of 0 40 cm p 0 01 moreover the sir was significantly and negatively related to the rsa at the depth of 20 50 cm p 0 05 table 3 the statistical analysis with multiple regression highlighted that the main root factors that affected soil infiltration rates were the rld at the soil intervals of 5 10 cm rld10 10 20 cm rld20 and 20 30 cm rld30 and the rsa at the soil interval of 10 20 cm rsa20 table 4 the rld20 and rld30 were thought to be the negative main influencing factors of air similarly the rld30 was the most important factor for the iir the rld10 rld30 and rsa20 were negative factors for sir 4 discussion root systems determine the spatial distribution of root channel which is closely related to water infiltration in soil this process is essential for soil water recharge and vegetation maintenance in semi arid areas our results found that plant roots density and complexity decreased along the soil depth the largest root length density root surface area and root volume were recorded at the depth of 0 20 cm soil these results can be partially explained by the age of the grasslands plantation younger than 2 years at the time of the field survey plant roots near the surface soil can improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil such as the soil bulk density porosity and soil organic matter leung et al 2015 plant roots also improve soil infiltration capacity by increasing soil porosity and organic matter in topsoil alaoui et al 2015 huang et al 2017 in addition during plant root decomposition plant roots in the upper layer of the soil form more preferential root channels than those in the subsoil jørgensen et al 2002 our results are in accordance with these studies and prove that the distribution of roots in the different soil layers are significantly related to water infiltration which depends on the morphological characteristics of root systems root morphological characteristics are important indicators of plant root growth due to their role in regulating the water and nutrient cycles required for plant growth the root length density can reflect the extent of the distribution interpenetration and interweaving of the root system in the soil affecting the soil water migration li et al 2013 demonstrated that water flow paths appear between the root system surface and the soil contact surface forming biological macropores which have an important influence during the different stages of soil water infiltration this complex system plays a significant role in soil water uptake and nutrient transfer the results of this study showed that the grasslands root morphological characteristics had significant effects on soil infiltration at various infiltration stages a smaller rld rsa and rv increased water infiltration multiple channels formed by fine roots could form preferential flow during infiltration but this promotion decreased with the increase of rld this effect can be explained by the abundant root network that could clog the soil pore space and thus favored a decrease in the soil infiltration rates such as cui et al 2019 observed in grasslands with the increase of rld the squeezing effect of strong root systems on soil caused higher values of soil bulk density and lower of soil porosity which jointly provoked a decrease of water infiltration there is another context to bear in mind too because plant roots can enmesh and realign soil particles and release exudates resulting in changes in soil properties which in turn affect the soil infiltration capacity bronick and lal 2005 plant roots can result in changes in the size distribution and connectivity of soil pores that affect the water infiltration processes root morphological characteristics integrate both chemical and physical properties associated with root development moreover these parameters also reflect basic soil conditions for water infiltration sanders et al 2012 proved that plant roots develop into macropores and generate macropores biopores cracks and burrows during the process of plant root growth the formation of macropores or blocking or squeezing pores in the soil is closely related to the root morphological characteristics archer et al 2002 cui et al 2019 another consideration is that fine plant roots begin to decay at a higher rate because the growth cycle of fine plant roots is short ranging from a few months to several years the longevity of fine plant roots is related to the process of fine plant roots regeneration in which the new roots replace the decayed roots yavitt et al 2011 meanwhile preferential root channel is formed during root decomposition there processes mainly take place in the topsoil where most plant roots are distributed our results also showed that the characteristics of surface root system were significantly correlated with the initial steady and average infiltration rates compared with living roots decayed roots would more effectively create preferential root channels such as zhang and wang 2015 observed in middle latitude areas where fine roots decomposed significantly faster than coarse roots given the importance of plant roots in soil water uptake this study offers relevant data about how plant root characteristics of different grassland types affect soil water infiltration the statistical analysis of our field observations without human disturbances during plant growth allowed to conclude that the main root factors clearly affecting the soil infiltration rates were rld10 rld20 rld30 and rsa20 previous studies reported that the infiltration capacity of different species was different because of the different root characteristics i e root diameter and root distribution leung et al 2017 cui et al 2019 our findings showed that the different soil infiltration rates air iir and sir were negatively correlated with the root length density and root surface area but not with the root volume this discrepancy could be explained by the presence of certain plant functional groups such as grasses forage b inermis and legumes forage m sativa that had a significant impact on soil infiltration wu et al 2014 christine et al 2014 also found that soil infiltration rates were increased by legumes forage and decreased by grasses forage in addition the soil infiltration rates were higher under m sativa and m suaveolens grasslands than under m sinensis grassland however the values of rld and rsa of m sativa and m suaveolens grasslands were smaller than those values measured in the m sinensis grassland this fact may be attributed to the m sinensis grass forage grassland characteristics that have many coarse and rhizomatous roots which tend to compact the soil and block the water flow and thus decrease soil infiltration rate cui et al 2019 in general gramineous forage with fibrous and rhizomatous roots grows densely near the surface soil to form a dense network that blocks the soil pore space reduces water movement and decreases soil infiltration rate archer et al 2002 while legume forage with tap roots would increase water infiltration into the soil 5 conclusions plant root morphological characteristics significantly affected the soil surface water infiltration capacity despite the inherent differences in the root characteristics of the five different artificial grasslands evaluated in this study under semi arid natural conditions the soil infiltration capacity of the artificial grasslands was significantly different between them m suaveolens m sativa p virgatum b inermis m sinensis the density and complexity of the plant root systems decreased with soil depth and roots were mainly distributed near the surface soil up to a depth of 20 cm for the different grasslands the root length density and root surface area were negatively correlated with the infiltration rates while the root volume was not significantly correlated with the infiltration rates the root length density at 5 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depth and the root surface area at 10 20 cm depth were the main factors that had a clear influence on the soil water infiltration rates at the initial steady state and average stages these results contribute to interpret the influence of plant root morphological characteristics on the infiltration processes in dryland forage production and to improve the understanding of the effect of plant roots on soil water supply in dryland agriculture production in water scarce areas further study is necessary to demonstrate the relationships between root characteristics and infiltration response in arid areas

other four grasslands p 0 05 table 2 3 2 root distribution and root morphological characteristics the roots distribution in the soil was shown in fig 2 the changes in the root length density rld root surface area rsa and root volume rv with increasing the soil depth depicted similar trends from higher to lower values in the three parameters and were similar among the different grasslands fig 3 the largest rld rsa and rv were recorded in the upper soil layers 0 20 cm and the lowest in the subsoil regarding the magnitude of the parameters the rld rsa and rv were different in the distinct grassland types in terms of root length density rld the values of m sinensis were significantly higher than those observed in the other artificial grasslands p 0 05 with respect to the root surface area rsa the m sinensis b inermis and p virgatum grasslands had higher values than those measured in the m sativa and m suaveolens grasslands regarding to root volume rv the values of m sinensis p virgatum and m sativa were significantly higher than those of b inermis and m suaveolens at the soil depth of 0 20 cm p 0 05 3 3 correlation between root morphological characteristics and infiltration rates the correlation analyses showed that the air had highly significant negative correlation with rld and rsa at depth of 0 50 cm p 0 01 table 3 the iir had highly significant negative relationship

was significantly and negatively related to the rsa at the depth of 20 50 cm p 0 05 table 3 the statistical analysis with multiple regression highlighted that the main root factors that affected soil infiltration rates were the rld at the soil intervals of 5 10 cm rld10 10 20 cm rld20 and 20 30 cm rld30 and the rsa at the soil interval of 10 20 cm rsa20 table 4 the rld20 and rld30 were thought to be the negative main influencing factors of air similarly the rld30 was the most important factor for the iir the rld10 rld30 and rsa20 were negative factors for sir 4 discussion root systems determine the spatial distribution of root channel which is closely related to water infiltration in soil this process is essential for soil water recharge and vegetation maintenance in semi arid areas our results found that plant roots density and complexity decreased along the soil depth the largest root length density root surface area and root volume were recorded at the depth of 0 20 cm soil these results can be partially explained by the age of the grasslands plantation younger than 2 years at the time of the field survey plant roots near the surface soil can improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil such as the soil bulk density porosity and soil organic matter leung et al 2015 plant roots also improve soil infiltration capacity by increasing soil porosity and organic matter in topsoil alaoui et al 2015 huang et al 2017 in addition during plant root decomposition plant roots in the upper layer of the soil form more preferential root channels than those in the subsoil jørgensen et al 2002 our results are in accordance with these studies and prove that the distribution of roots in the different soil layers are significantly related to water infiltration which depends on the morphological characteristics of root systems root morphological characteristics are important indicators of plant root growth due to their role in regulating the water and nutrient cycles required for plant growth the root length density can reflect the extent of the distribution interpenetration and interweaving of the root system in the soil affecting the soil water migration li et al 2013 demonstrated that water flow paths appear between the root system surface and the soil contact surface forming biological macropores which have an important influence during the different stages of soil water infiltration this complex system plays a significant role in soil water uptake and nutrient transfer the results of this study showed that the grasslands root morphological characteristics had significant effects on soil infiltration at various infiltration stages a smaller rld rsa and rv increased water infiltration multiple channels formed by fine roots could form preferential flow during infiltration but this promotion decreased with the increase of rld this effect can be explained by the abundant root network that could clog the soil pore space and thus favored a decrease in the soil infiltration rates such as cui et al 2019 observed in grasslands with the increase of rld the squeezing effect of strong root systems on soil caused higher values of soil bulk density and lower of soil porosity which jointly provoked a decrease of water infiltration there is another context to bear in mind too because plant roots can enmesh and realign soil particles and release exudates resulting in changes in soil properties which in turn affect the soil infiltration capacity bronick and lal 2005 plant roots can result in changes in the size distribution and connectivity of soil pores that affect the water infiltration processes root morphological characteristics integrate both chemical and physical properties associated with root development moreover these parameters also reflect basic soil conditions for water infiltration sanders et al 2012 proved that plant roots develop into macropores and generate macropores biopores cracks and burrows during the process of plant root growth the formation of macropores or blocking or squeezing pores in the soil is closely related to the root morphological characteristics archer et al 2002 cui et al 2019 another consideration is that fine plant roots begin to decay at a higher rate because the growth cycle of fine plant roots is short ranging from a few months to several years the longevity of fine plant roots is related to the process of fine plant roots regeneration in which the new roots replace the decayed roots yavitt et al 2011 meanwhile preferential root channel is formed during root decomposition there processes mainly take place in the topsoil where most plant roots are distributed our results also showed that the characteristics of surface root system were significantly correlated with the initial steady and average infiltration rates compared with living roots decayed roots would more effectively create preferential root channels such as zhang and wang 2015 observed in middle latitude areas where fine roots decomposed significantly faster than coarse roots given the importance of plant roots in soil water uptake this study offers relevant data about how plant root characteristics of different grassland types affect soil water infiltration the statistical analysis of our field observations without human disturbances during plant growth allowed to conclude that the main root factors clearly affecting the soil infiltration rates were rld10 rld20 rld30 and rsa20 previous studies reported that the infiltration capacity of different species was different because of the different root characteristics i e root diameter and root distribution leung et al 2017 cui et al 2019 our findings showed that the different soil infiltration rates air iir and sir were negatively correlated with the root length density and root surface area but not with the root volume this discrepancy could be explained by the presence of certain plant functional groups such as grasses forage b inermis and legumes forage m sativa that had a significant impact on soil infiltration wu et al 2014 christine et al 2014 also found that soil infiltration rates were increased by legumes forage and decreased by grasses forage in addition the soil infiltration rates were higher under m sativa and m suaveolens grasslands than under m sinensis grassland however the values of rld and rsa of m sativa and m suaveolens grasslands were smaller than those values measured in the m sinensis grassland this fact may be attributed to the m sinensis grass forage grassland characteristics that have many coarse and rhizomatous roots which tend to compact the soil and block the water flow and thus decrease soil infiltration rate cui et al 2019 in general gramineous forage with fibrous and rhizomatous roots grows densely near the surface soil to form a dense network that blocks the soil pore space reduces water movement and decreases soil infiltration rate archer et al 2002 while legume forage with tap roots would increase water infiltration into the soil 5 conclusions plant root morphological characteristics significantly affected the soil surface water infiltration capacity despite the inherent differences in the root characteristics of the five different artificial grasslands evaluated in this study under semi arid natural conditions the soil infiltration capacity of the artificial grasslands was significantly different between them m suaveolens m sativa p virgatum b inermis m sinensis the density and complexity of the plant root systems decreased with soil depth and roots were mainly distributed near the surface soil up to a depth of 20 cm for the different grasslands the root length density and root surface area were negatively correlated with the infiltration rates while the root volume was not significantly correlated with the infiltration rates the root length density at 5 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depth and the root surface area at 10 20 cm depth were the main factors that had a clear influence on the soil water infiltration rates at the initial steady state and average stages these results contribute to interpret the influence of plant root morphological characteristics on the infiltration processes in dryland forage production and to improve the understanding of the effect of plant roots on soil water supply in dryland agriculture production in water scarce areas further study is necessary to demonstrate the relationships between root characteristics and infiltration response in arid areas where water scarcity is common and plants are subjected to more serious water stress than in semiarid areas declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10621,the accurate estimation of plant water needs is the first step for achieving high crop water productivity the main objective of the work was to develop an irrigation scheduling procedure for mandarin orchards under mediterranean conditions based on replacing the amount of consumed water using reference values of soil moisture according to different phenological periods the proposed methodology includes a definition part where the threshold values were established relating the trees stem water potential and the volumetric soil water content measured with frequency domain reflectometry probes a second part includes the steps for standardizing measurements from capacitance probes by using the leachm hydrological simulation model to take into account the sensor to sensor variations finally an extrapolation procedure based on soil water retention curves was used for adapting critical soil water content thresholds to different soil conditions field evaluations were made in a citrus orchard located in eastern spain during two seasons standardize critical soil water contents were i 24 vol for post harvest bloom fruit set and phase iii of fruit growth ii 27 vol for phase i of fruit growth and iii 29 vol for phase ii of fruit growth with average daily air vapour pressure deficit values ranging between 0 2 0 4 0 9 1 1 and 1 1 1 3 kpa respectively when implemented in the orchard the sensor based strategy resulted in water saving of 26 respect to a control treatment irrigated using the standard fao 56 approach without significant differences in yield and increasing the crop water productivity by 33 in conclusion we suggest that the determination and use of the critical soil water content is a useful tool for scheduling irrigation the proposed standardization and extrapolation methodology allows the irrigation strategy to be applied to other mandarin orchards under similar climatic conditions keywords critical soil water content plant water status irrigation scheduling water savings 1 introduction in arid and semi arid zones irrigated agriculture is the main user of water resources reaching a proportion that could exceed 70 80 of the total water abstractions fereres and soriano 2006 citrus trees are widely cultivated in south eastern spain where the predominant climate conditions are those typical of a semi arid zones climate change forecasts an increase in crop water requirements cwr and probably more severe drought periods menenti et al 2013 some scenarios for 2050 predict 30 50 decrease of fresh water availability while its demand on eastern and southern areas could be doubled milano et al 2013 in citrus trees irrigation is essential to guarantee high quality and yield and an effective water management strategy is crucial to cope with this situation of water scarcity garcía tejero et al 2011 and avoid environmental hazards such as groundwater pollution by nitrogen fertilizers quiñones et al 2007 precision irrigation aims to minimize water losses due to deep percolation during the watering events through increasing the efficiency of systems and using a schedule methodology based on the water exchange in the soil plant atmosphere system pérez 2016 nowadays the most widely used system for calculating irrigation needs is based on the water balance proposed in fao paper number 56 allen et al 1998 this method determines the cwr considering the reference evapotranspiration et0 and the crop coefficients kc although some studies have adapted the fao 56 algorithm for irrigation scheduling rallo et al 2011 this strategy has some uncertainty calculating water needs for instance when tree light interception consoli et al 2006 or crop load syvertsen et al 2003 yonemoto et al 2004 change over the seasons therefore a substantial improvement in irrigation management can be achieved if soil and plant water status are used for scheduling irrigation in woody perennial crops indirect methods for monitoring soil water status are based on measuring soil matric potential ψ s o i l or volumetric water content θ campbell and campbell 1982 amongst the wide range of available devices probes based on frequency domain reflectometry fdr are nowadays the most widely used tools to determine the θ because of their relatively affordable price and ease of use fares and polyakov 2006 accuracy of obtained information depends on the probe installation evett et al 2002 which should minimize air gaps between the plastic shell and the soil under these circumstances the accuracy of the fdr sensors can reach values of 1 vol with soil specific calibration muñoz carpena et al 2004 however provenzano et al 2015 found higher differences in a capacitance probe calibration for a range of soils with different particle size distributions the field practices used and particularly those related with the orchard soil management that affects bulk density and organic matter content can play a significant effect on soil properties invalidating the calibration hignett and evett 2008 paraskevas et al 2012 when absolute θ values are used for scheduling irrigation using manufacturer default calibration equations might result in inappropriate θ estimations and a site specific analysis should be then performed evett et al 2006 hydrological simulation could be an alternative tool for calibrating fdr probes and obtaining accurate θ values the leaching estimation and chemistry model leachm is a one dimensional deterministic model that describes the water and solutes regimes in unsaturated or partially saturated soils hutson 2003 leachm model has been widely used for simulating water nitrogen salts and pesticide behavior in soils ramos and carbonell 1991 asada et al 2013 nasri et al 2015 deng et al 2017 the model has been used to evaluate water and nitrogen management in citrus orchards lidón et al 1999 alva et al 2006 lidón et al 2013 it is a mechanistic model that uses the richards equation richards 1931 to simulate soil moisture variation being as valid as other agro hydrological models like spaw fao smcr simodis and hydrus 2d among others minacapilli et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 rallo et al 2011 autovino et al 2018 the usefulness of capacitance probes for scheduling irrigation can be increased if plants water status is included this information integrates the effects of surrounding environmental conditions and the fraction of the water available in the soil for the plant moriana et al 2012 in this sense midday stem water potential ψ s t e m is considered as a benchmark indicator of the degree of plant water stress ruiz sánchez et al 2010 ballester et al 2011 this indicator is obtained through a destructive measurement which is time consuming and needs dedication and currently it is impossible to automate however these measurements can play an essential role for irrigation scheduling when comparing it with a reference value corresponding to an ideal plant water status with full water availability spinelli et al 2017 the aim of the research was to develop an irrigation scheduling strategy for mandarin orchards under mediterranean conditions based on replacing the amount of consumed water using reference values of soil moisture at different phenological periods threshold values to start irrigation were determined using relationships between ψ s t e m and the volumetric soil water content measured with fdr probes θ f d r the methodology includes a procedure for standardizing soil moisture capacitance probes readings and extrapolating scheduling thresholds for plots with different soil characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 general approach the methodology followed for scheduling mandarin irrigation by means of the proposed sensor based strategy comprises three steps definition standardization and extrapolation the goal of the definition phase is to obtain a reference θ for scheduling irrigation with fdr probes ensuring an adequate plant water status the critical soil water content threshold θ c r i t f d r is defined from simultaneous measurements of θ f d r and ψ s t e m in different periods of the crop cycle in which irrigation was withheld secondly the aim of the standardization phase was to gauge fdr probes minimizing sensor to sensor variations for scheduling irrigation with absolute critical soil water content θ c r i t values this step is needed considering that fdr probes might provide for different readings at the same moisture levels due to lack of calibration the chosen methodology consists in comparing the soil water content obtain by means of a hydrological simulation software θ s i m with the θ f d r and computing the differences with a standardization equation and thirdly in the extrapolation phase a methodology based on soil water retention curves swrc and the ψ s o i l was used for adapting θ c r i t to different soil physical conditions the aim of these two last steps standardization and extrapolation are fundamental for applying the sensor based strategy to other mandarin orchards located under similar climatic conditions 2 2 experimental plot the study was carried out during 2015 and 2016 in a commercial citrus orchard located in alberic in the south of the province of valencia spain 39 7 31 33 n 0 33 17 06 w 37 m a m s l the experiment was performed on mature arrufatina mandarin citrus clementina hort ex tan trees grafted onto carrizo citrange citrus sinensis osb poncirus trifoliata raf rootstock with a tree spacing of 5 50 m 4 25 m soil textural class according to the usda classification is loam to sandy clay loam with percentages of clay ranging from 22 to 34 within the orchard soil organic matter was on average 1 3 the climate is semi arid with warm winters and dry summers with average annual precipitation of 400 mm lower than the et0 1000 1300 mm ign 2018 the plot was equipped with a drip irrigation system automatic control valves and flow meters to monitor the amount of water applied water was supplied by two drip laterals with a total 7 emitters per tree 2 2 l h 1 azud premier pc as azud alcantarilla murcia spain emitters were spaced at 1 2 m apart fdr water content profile probes enviroscan sentek stepney australia were used for monitoring θ f d r at 0 2 0 3 and 0 5 m depths where roots are mainly concentrated abouatallah et al 2012 at 30 min time step a total of 6 fdr probes were installed in the experimental plot four probes noted as definition def 1 4 were installed on four contiguous trees used for establishing the θ c r i t f d r thresholds two additional probes noted as validation val 1 and 2 were installed under different trees for implementing the sensor based strategy all probes were located adjacent to the drip irrigation line and at about 0 10 m from the emitter following the installations recommendations by bonet et al 2010 in order to characterize the soils where the 6 fdr probes were installed two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m height and 0 05 m diameter were collected around the access tubes at 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m depths soil organic matter content walkley and black 1934 dry bulk density and soil textural class according usda classification soil survey staff 1975 were determined 2 3 critical soil water content definition the θ c r i t f d r below which plant water stress occurs and it is necessary to start irrigation was obtained by solving linear equations fed with simultaneous measurements of ψ s t e m and θ f d r values of ψ s t e m obtained in previous research carried out in the area for solving these equations ballester et al 2014 martínez gimeno et al 2018 were adapted the onset of plant water stress was established in 0 8 to 1 0 mpa from mid september to may and in 1 0 to 1 2 mpa from june to mid september measurements were made during three drought cycles in two consecutive years irrigation was withheld from may 4th to may 17th days of the year doy 124 137 period a1 july 20th to july 26th doy 201 207 period b1 and november 12th to january 11th doy 316 11 period c1 in 2015 2016 and may 19th to june 8th doy 140 160 period a2 august 5th to august 19th doy 218 232 period b2 and december 1st to january 13th doy 336 13 period c2 in 2016 2017 according to common phenological stages of clementina arrufatina under climatic conditions of mediterranean area along the season period a corresponds with phase i of fruit growth period b with phase ii of fruit growth and period c with phase iii of fruit growth bloom and fruit set and post harvest definition probes 1 4 were used for measuring the θ f d r during these periods the ψ s t e m was measured in the same four trees equipped with the fdr probes by using a schölander pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co usa measurements were carried out with high frequency from daily to weekly during the drought cycles for each tree measurements were made on two leaves that were covered with aluminum foil bags at least one hour before the measurements turner 1981 average air vapour pressure deficit vpd was estimated for each drought cycle 2 4 critical soil water content standardization the adjustment to take into account sensor to sensor variation for using the θ c r i t with any fdr probe was made by contrasting θ s i m and θ f d r differences were quantified by solving the linear regression equation expressed as 1 θ f d r a θ s i m b where a and b are fitting parameters the leachm model was used for obtaining θ s i m input data includes soil physical and chemical properties of the different soil layers texture organic matter bulk density water retention parameters plant data crop cycle data crop cover fraction and weather rain temperature thermal amplitude potential evapotranspiration the leachm model follows the method proposed by childs and hanks 1975 to calculate the et0 from the weekly reference evapotranspiration the partition between evaporation and transpiration is made according to the crop cover fraction and following the equation proposed by nimah and hanks 1973 the soil profile where fdr probes were installed was divided into several horizontal segments the total simulation period was divided into short time intervals and equations were solved for each soil layer and each water flow interval which should be 0 1 day or less it was necessary to know the relations between hydraulic conductivity θ and ψ s o i l those are based on the moisture retention function eq 2 and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function eq 3 proposed by campbell 1974 integrating the modification suggested by hutson and cass 1987 2 ψ s o i l a θ θ s b 3 k k s θ θ s 2 b 2 p where ψ s o i l is the soil matric potential kpa a is the air entry water potential kpa b is an empirically determined constant θs is the volumetric water content at saturation vol θ is the volumetric water content vol k is the hydraulic conductivity mm day 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm day 1 and p is an interaction parameter about pore size the value of which is assumed to be 1 for the leachm model a free draining lower boundary was assumed although the objective of the work was not to assess the leachm model performance indicators were applied to validate simulations and detect anomalous data in the standardization differences between observed values θ f d r and predicted values θ s i m were evaluated by calculating two model evaluation indicators i the root mean square error rmse was selected for quantifying the error in terms of the units of the variable calculated by the model and ii the relative root mean squared error rrmse was used as indicator which is independent of the units of measurement the minimum value is 0 being also the optimal value loague and green 1991 their definitions are given by 4 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n 5 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o where n is the number of measured data oi and pi are the predicted and the measured values and o is the mean of the observed values indeed the approach proposed in the present work offers an alternative methodology to traditional calibration that allows to simulate an unlimited number of water balances from soil samples certainly this standardization methodology proposed could be replaced by any field or laboratory protocols to calibrate fdr sensors provenzano et al 2015 2 5 critical soil water content extrapolation the θ c r i t should be adapted for scheduling mandarin irrigation under different soil physical conditions for instance by relating ψ s o i l and θ using swrcs the swrc allows transferring the θ c r i t from the conditions where they were obtained definition to other locations validation with different soil physical properties using the corresponding ψ s o i l following these steps i to construct and to parameterize swrcs for the surrounding soil where fdr probes where installed ii determination of the ψ s o i l corresponding to the critical soil water content of definition fdr probes θ c r i t d e f and iii determination of the critical soil water content of validation fdr probes θ c r i t v a l corresponding to the ψ s o i l obtained in the previous step data for swrc were generated using the pressure plate method richards 1948 where θ corresponding to ψ s o i l of 0 10 30 60 100 300 and 1000 kpa was determined experimental data were fitted by means of the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 6 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ s o i l n m where θ is the soil water content vol θr is the soil residual water content vol θs is the soil saturated

θ c r i t crop water requirements were estimated according the crop evapotranspiration etc estimated with the single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 et0 was determined with the penman monteith equation in the version modified by fao allen et al 1998 by using the meteorological observations acquired by two automatic agro meteorological stations located nearby the orchard the kc varied among months depending on the crop phenological stage according to the canopy ground cover kc was assumed variable from a minimum of 0 36 in may to a maximum of 0 56 in october castel 2000 irrigation scheduling was programmed twice a week monday and thursday the soil moisture was measured with the validation fdr probes in the root profile 0 0 5 m before each scheduling event then the irrigation required dose v mm was defined as 7 v f m z θ c r i t f d r v a l θ f d r v a l where f m is the wetted soil fraction z mm is the bulb depth θ f d r v a l and θ c r i t f d r v a l vol are the current and critical soil water content for scheduling irrigation with validation fdr probes respectively the total dose vt mm to be applied for i days and the time for each irrigation event it s were calculated as 8 v t i 1 i n c w r i v 9 i t s v t s q i n t a k e n where s m2 is the total irrigated area qintake l s 1 is the total flow delivered to the subunit irrigation area controlled by pressure regulator and n is the number of days irrigation was performed for the scheduled interval 2 7 irrigation strategy validation the sensor based strategy was implemented during 2016 in the same experimental plot where irrigation thresholds were obtained the treatments applied were control irrigated during the whole season at 100 etc allen et al 1998 castel 2000 and the sensor based strategy sb strategy irrigated following θ c r i t for the strategy implementation the θ c r i t obtained from the stress cycles were extended to specific developmental crop phenological stages of the trees with similar vpd levels post harvest and bloom and fruit set periods c1 and c2 phase i periods a1 and a2 phase ii periods b1 and b2 and phase iii periods c1 and c2 of fruit growth the statistical design for comparing the two irrigation strategies was a randomized complete block with three replicates per treatment each sub plot had four rows with 6 7 sample trees per row where perimeter trees were used as guard leaving 8 10 central trees for experimental determinations ψ s t e m was determinate approximately weekly at solar midday in two mature leaves of two trees per experimental unit for assessing plant water status in the sb strategy fdr probes validation 1 and 2 were used for measuring θ and for scheduling irrigation yield was determined at the time of commercial harvest in all the sampled trees this was defined by the grower collaborator following the standard fruit quality protocols used in the area juice total soluble solids content juice titratable acidity and maturity index about 12 brix 7 g l and 17 respectively according to perry et al 2017 crop water productivity cwp was calculated as the crop yield divided by the irrigation volumes applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 critical soil water content determination during the three drought cycles carried out in 2015 and 2016 ψ s t e m and θ f d r measured with definition 1 4 fdr probes were compared by using linear regressions fig 1 the equations depicted in fig 1 are indicating the soil water status threshold below which ψ s t e m do not decrease greatly in response to small changes in θ differences among the slope of the curve can be observed for the different studied periods this might be because of the variations in the vpd registered for each period the most pronounced slopes were found in the summer stress cycles periods b1 and b2 when vpd reached its maximum values 1 3 kpa from doy 201 207 in 2015 the most moderate slope was found from doy 316 in 2015 to doy 11 in 2016 period c1 in agreement with low vpd 0 4 kpa since the atmospheric demand is not a limiting factor and changes in the soil moisture do not result in drastic decreases in the plant water status however measurements from doy 336 in 2016 to 13 in 2017 period c2 showed a different trend with small variations in the θ f d r resulting in important changes in ψ s t e m given the registered vpd values 0 2kpa this was an unexpected behavior it could be a consequence of the low soil temperature probably occurring this winter period which might have increased water viscosity and root hydraulic resistance hindering water absorption kramer 1942 running and reid 1980 the linear equations that relates ψ s t e m and θ f d r fig 1 were solved using the ψ s t e m thresholds proposed in the methodology results showed that the θ c r i t f d r d e f for scheduling irrigation varied on the considered period of the year and the evaporative demand table 3a this is the main advantage of the proposed strategy because irrigation water needs are adapted to the soil water status and the crop phenological stage it should be noted that the probes definition 1 and 3 showed higher humidity values than the probes definition 2 and 4 this fact may be attributed to the lack of calibration of the probes to the soil characteristics or even to the differences between plants 3 2 critical soil water content standardization and extrapolation the simulation with leachm was performed for a cold period from doy 338 in 2015 to 12 in 2016 without irrigation and with low evaporative demand aiming to minimize the effect of the evapotranspiration rates on the soil water dynamics soil physical and chemical properties and crop data inputs are summarized in tables 1 and 2 linear regression equations table 4 were calculated to consider differences between θ f d r and θ s i m and to standardize soil moisture values obtained with the fdr probes the slope of the regression lines a give an idea of how well the simulation fits the real measurements the slope of the regression varied between 0 67 1 03 indicating that data trends were reasonably similar and both methods were reproducing comparable soil water dynamics the fitting constant b that ranged between 2 68 and 15 63 showed the different levels of soil moisture provided by simulated and measured temporal series for each probe θ f d r was higher than θ s i m data not shown other studies corroborate that electromagnetic soil water content sensors could overestimate volumetric water content due to presence of salt in soils sevostianova et al 2015 standardization equations were characterised by coefficients of determination ranging between 0 93 to 0 72 the standardization methodology was assessed by means of evaluation indicators errors were estimated with θ s i m and θ f d r rmse was 1 0 0 4 vol and rrmse was 0 16 0 06 both statistics are widely affected by the presence of outliers viteri 2013 and simulations performed with leachm model sometimes presented these punctual differences at the beginning of the simulated data set data not shown in other studies the estimation of soil water content in the root zone was considered suitable when the rmse was equal to 2 0 vol rallo et al 2011 and the rrmse was considered as valid when was it lower than 0 40 confalonieri and bechini 2004 wallis et al 2011 the soil water balance simulation with leachm despite the difference with respect to the soil water content of the fdr accurately reproduce moisture readings this fact could lay the foundations for future research where the θ c r i t may be used directly on the simulations and thus reduce the dependency of the equipment of continuous measurement of soil moisture there is no consensus in the scientific community regarding to capacitance probes calibration some authors ensure that fdr measurements are valid in any soil within wide ranges of soil moisture levels thomas 1966 hoekstra and delaney 1974 however some studies have demonstrated that capacitance probes were influenced by the soil type bell et al 1987 the proposed standardization or any other analogous methodology is indeed considering essential for ensuring the correct use of the sb strategy following this procedure any volumetric water content value from fdr probe sensors could be adjusted at the same reference and data from different sensors could be comparable the θ c r i t d e f obtained by means of leachm standardization were 26 8 28 9 and 24 4 vol for periods a1 a2 b1 b2 and c1 c2 respectively table 3 b a progressive increase of the values is recorded according to the vpd along the season during the period b1 b2 summer the θ c r i t d e f required to avoid plant stress was the highest with 29 2 vol because of the high evaporative demand during this part of the season vpd 1 2 kpa the soil water storage capacity in this period should be enough for avoiding significant water stress girona et al 2002 in contrast the lowest θ c r i t d e f was determined during the period c1 c2 winter 24 3 vol when the evaporative demand vpd 0 3 kpa is lower than in the summer indeed the results showed that the critical soil water content to maintain an adequate plant water status was lower during periods of low evaporative demand as winter and the beginning of spring the seasonal weighted average θ c r i t d e f for the root profile 0 0 5 m was 26 vol similar to previous results obtained in grapefruit pérez pérez et al 2008 and orange pérez pérez et al 2014 irrigated al 100 etc with a volumetric soil water content in the entire soil profile 0 1 m ranging between 21 and 25 vol and 24 and 24 vol respectively in these studies volumetric soil water content was measured using a neutron probe previously calibrated at the experimental site differences could be attributed among others to the soil properties measurement depth and citrus variety after applying the standardization process extrapolation was made to adapt the θ c r i t d e f to specific soil conditions where validation 1 and 2 probes were installed extrapolated θ c r i t v a l showed in the table 5 have been classified in specific phenological stages post harvest bloom and fruit set and phase i ii and iii of fruit growth in accordance with the registered average vpd during the drought cycles table 3 and during the season when the sensor based strategy was implemented table 4 indeed the thresholds obtained for validation probes were similar to the average values obtained for definition probes probably because the soil homogeneity within the plot 3 3 irrigation strategy validation irrigation was scheduled by means of the sensor based strategy during 2016 in the experimental plot using the validation 1 and 2 fdr probes the mean annual et0 and rainfall for the experimental season was of 1122 and 716 mm respectively the temporal distribution of rainfall and vpd followed the typical patterns of the mediterranean basin fig 2 a the seasonal variation of rainfall was characterised by a period of great scarcity during phase ii of fruit growth 21 mm and higher precipitation values were registered in the spring and the autumn during bloom and fruit set 113 mm and phase iii of fruit growth 548 mm mean daily vpd reached the highest values during phase ii of fruit growth 1 1 kpa during the implementation period from january to november 2016 control trees received 581 mm of irrigation while in the treatment irrigated following the sb strategy the applied irrigation water was 429 mm fig 2b a 27 water saving was achieved with the sb strategy reaching the highest reductions 29 during phase ii of fruit growth these differences in water application resulted in slightly different plant water status between treatments fig 2c during post harvest doy 11 and 21 the ψ s t e m registered in both treatments was lower than the thresholds established 0 8 to 1 0 mpa most likely because of the effect of low temperatures 12 4 c which could reduce plant water uptake capacity however it should be noted that there were no statistically significant differences between the evaluated irrigation strategies later on during the mid winter period plant water status was recovered in the control treatment because of the higher irrigation volume applied during the beginning of the crop season in comparisons with the sb strategy during this period doy 33 42 and 49 in the sb strategy ψ s t e m was lower than 1 0 mpa with no statistically significant differences between irrigation strategies from doy 55 plant water status was recovered in both treatments and specially since doy 73 when pruning was made in the entire plot during phase ii of fruit growth doy 218 232 239 and 244 ψ s t e m significantly decreased in the sb strategy compared with control treatment the plant water status values reached are probably consequence of the high evaporative demand during these periods however the threshold of 1 3 to 1 5 mpa stablished by ballester et al 2011and 2014 and gonzález altozano and castel 1999 to avoid negative consequences in quality and yield was not exceeded during phase iii of fruit growth doy 266 and 279 both treatments had an inadequate plant water status with the lowest values of ψ s t e m recorded in the sb strategy the θ c r i t v a l used for this period was 24 vol according to the low vpd registered in phase iii o fruit growth table 5 however final fruit growth and ripening took place and even if the evaporative demand was low the fruit sink demand for photoassimilates was elevated being the irrigation volumes applied probably insufficient it would be desirable to increase the θ c r i t v a l for this stage maintaining the levels of the phase ii of fruit growth 29 vol until harvest this fact underlines the importance of an appropriate determination and timing of the moisture thresholds notwithstanding the water savings obtained in the sb strategy no significant differences were found between treatments in terms of yield reaching 73 3 23 2 kg tree 1 and 72 1 19 8 kg tree 1 in control and sb strategy respectively these yield levels are well in line with the expected tree performance for mandarin trees in the area as reported in previous research ballester et al 2014 nicolas et al 2016 the highest cwp was obtained in the sb strategy 7 2 kg m 3 compared to the control treatment 5 4 kg m 3 demonstrating that the irrigation scheduling developed can optimize irrigation efficiency by better adjusting the watering regime to the actual orchard water consumption although there are other models for scheduling irrigation in citrus trees alba et al 2003 bonet et al 2010 they do not consider the limits of moisture and its adaptation to other soils two elements that are the basis of the model proposed this work demonstrates that an irrigation schedule adjusted to the soil water content dynamics can improve the water use efficiency however irrigation time calculated by the proposed strategy should be monitored to avoid errors associated with fdr probe management the small volume of soil sampled by fdr probes the influence of air gaps or the lack of contact between sensors and soil may cause problems evett and parkin 2005 evett et al 2006 the crop coefficient method for estimating water needs is too general and empiric but it could be considered as a reference to compare results and reveal errors indeed occasional determinations of plant water status could be also included in order to check if the irrigation scheduling regime is detrimentally affecting crop production similar water savings with no yield reductions as observed in the present work were obtained in previous studies also in citrus trees using other irrigation strategies such regulated deficit irrigation rdi ballester et al 2014 and subsurface drip irrigation martínez gimeno et al 2018 the sb strategy coupled with rdi strategies could be used to improve water productivity reduce tree growth and improve fruit composition enhancing thus economical profit pérez pérez et al 2010 however the sb strategy provide a θ c r i t considering an adequate ψ s t e m then future studies will be necessary to expand the scheduling range for conditions of greater stress in controlled deficit irrigation strategies moreover the use of more paired θ f d r and ψ s t e m measurements not only restricted to the stress cycles tested would substantially improve the determination of the critical soil water content thresholds 4 conclusions the determination and use of the θ c r i t is a useful tool for optimizing irrigation scheduling the sb strategy computes the water doses considering the θ f d r and avoiding excessive depletions which may result in a too severe tree water stress the strategy includes two steps for scheduling irrigation with fdr probes across mandarin orchards under similar climatic conditions on the one hand a standardization methodology minimizes sensor to sensor variations allowing to use absolute values of θ c r i t for estimating irrigation needs on the other hand an extrapolation methodology adapts θ c r i t to any soil physical condition the irrigation strategy was implemented in a commercial orchard and water savings reached 26 without limiting yield thus increasing crop water productivity future work will be necessary for assessing the suitability of the proposed strategy in a multi season study for different citrus varieties or species and under different crop conditions declaration of interests the authors declare that they have

10621,the accurate estimation of plant water needs is the first step for achieving high crop water productivity the main objective of the work was to develop an irrigation scheduling procedure for mandarin orchards under mediterranean conditions based on replacing the amount of consumed water using reference values of soil moisture according to different phenological periods the proposed methodology includes a definition part where the threshold values were established relating the trees stem water potential and the volumetric soil water content measured with frequency domain reflectometry probes a second part includes the steps for standardizing measurements from capacitance probes by using the leachm hydrological simulation model to take into account the sensor to sensor variations finally an extrapolation procedure based on soil water retention curves was used for adapting critical soil water content thresholds to different soil conditions field evaluations were made in a citrus orchard located in eastern spain during two seasons standardize critical soil water contents were i 24 vol for post harvest bloom fruit set and phase iii of fruit growth ii 27 vol for phase i of fruit growth and iii 29 vol for phase ii of fruit growth with average daily air vapour pressure deficit values ranging between 0 2 0 4 0 9 1 1 and 1 1 1 3 kpa respectively when implemented in the orchard the sensor based strategy resulted in water saving of 26 respect to a control treatment irrigated using the standard fao 56 approach without significant differences in yield and increasing the crop water productivity by 33 in conclusion we suggest that the determination and use of the critical soil water content is a useful tool for scheduling irrigation the proposed standardization and extrapolation methodology allows the irrigation strategy to be applied to other mandarin orchards under similar climatic conditions keywords critical soil water content plant water

total water abstractions fereres and soriano 2006 citrus trees are widely cultivated in south eastern spain where the predominant climate conditions are those typical of a semi arid zones climate change forecasts an increase in crop water requirements cwr and probably more severe drought periods menenti et al 2013 some scenarios for 2050 predict 30 50 decrease of fresh water availability while its demand on eastern and southern areas could be doubled milano et al 2013 in citrus trees irrigation is essential to guarantee high quality and yield and an effective water management strategy is crucial to cope with this situation of water scarcity garcía tejero et al 2011 and avoid environmental hazards such as groundwater pollution by nitrogen fertilizers quiñones et al 2007 precision irrigation aims to minimize water losses due to deep percolation during the watering events through increasing the efficiency of systems and using a schedule methodology based on the water exchange in the soil plant atmosphere system pérez 2016 nowadays the most widely used system for calculating irrigation needs is based on the water balance proposed in fao paper number 56 allen et al 1998 this method determines the cwr considering the reference evapotranspiration et0 and the crop coefficients kc although some studies have adapted the fao 56 algorithm for irrigation scheduling rallo et al 2011 this strategy has some uncertainty calculating water needs for instance when tree light interception consoli et al 2006 or crop load syvertsen et al 2003 yonemoto et al 2004 change over the seasons therefore a substantial improvement in irrigation management can be achieved if soil and plant water status are used for scheduling irrigation in woody perennial crops indirect methods for monitoring soil water status are based on measuring soil matric potential ψ s o i l or volumetric water content θ campbell and campbell 1982 amongst the wide range of available devices probes based on frequency domain reflectometry fdr are nowadays the most widely used tools to determine the θ because of their relatively affordable price and ease of use fares and polyakov 2006 accuracy of obtained information depends on the probe installation evett et al 2002 which should minimize air gaps between the plastic shell and the soil under these circumstances the accuracy of the fdr sensors can reach values of 1 vol with soil specific calibration muñoz carpena et al 2004 however provenzano et al 2015 found higher differences in a capacitance probe calibration for a range of soils with different particle size distributions the field practices used and particularly those related with the orchard soil management that affects bulk density and organic matter content can play a significant effect on soil properties invalidating the calibration hignett and evett 2008 paraskevas et al 2012 when absolute θ values are used for scheduling irrigation using manufacturer default calibration equations might result in inappropriate θ estimations and a site specific analysis should be then performed evett et al 2006 hydrological simulation could be an alternative tool for calibrating fdr probes and obtaining accurate θ values the leaching estimation and chemistry model leachm is a one dimensional deterministic model that describes the water and solutes regimes in unsaturated or partially saturated soils hutson 2003 leachm model has been widely used for simulating water nitrogen salts and pesticide behavior in soils ramos and carbonell 1991 asada et al 2013 nasri et al 2015 deng et al 2017 the model has been used to evaluate water and nitrogen management in citrus orchards lidón et al 1999 alva et al 2006 lidón et al 2013 it is a mechanistic model that uses the richards equation richards 1931 to simulate soil moisture variation being as valid as other agro hydrological models like spaw fao smcr simodis and hydrus 2d among others minacapilli et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 rallo et al 2011 autovino et al 2018 the usefulness of capacitance probes for scheduling irrigation can be increased if plants water status is included this information integrates the effects of surrounding environmental conditions and the fraction of the water available in the soil for the plant moriana et al 2012 in this sense midday stem water potential ψ s t e m is considered as a benchmark indicator of the degree of plant water stress ruiz sánchez et al 2010 ballester et al 2011 this indicator is obtained through a destructive measurement which is time consuming and needs dedication and currently it is impossible to automate however these measurements can play an essential role for irrigation scheduling when comparing it with a reference value corresponding to an ideal plant water status with full water availability spinelli et al 2017 the aim of the research was to develop an irrigation scheduling strategy for mandarin orchards under mediterranean conditions based on replacing the amount of consumed water using reference values of soil moisture at different phenological periods threshold values to start irrigation were determined using relationships between ψ s t e m and the volumetric soil water content measured with fdr probes θ f d r the methodology includes a procedure for standardizing soil moisture capacitance probes readings and extrapolating scheduling thresholds for plots with different soil characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 general approach the methodology followed for scheduling mandarin irrigation by means of the proposed sensor based strategy comprises three steps definition standardization and extrapolation the goal of the definition phase is to obtain a reference θ for scheduling irrigation with fdr probes ensuring an adequate plant water status the critical soil water content threshold θ c r i t f d r is defined from simultaneous measurements of θ f d r and ψ s t e m in different periods of the crop cycle in which irrigation was withheld secondly the aim of the standardization phase was to gauge fdr probes minimizing sensor to sensor variations for scheduling irrigation with absolute critical soil water content θ c r i t values this step is needed considering that fdr probes might provide for different readings at the same moisture levels due to lack of calibration the chosen methodology consists in comparing the soil water content obtain by means of a hydrological simulation software θ s i m with the θ f d r and computing the differences with a standardization equation and thirdly in the extrapolation phase a methodology based on soil water retention curves swrc and the ψ s o i l was used for adapting θ c r i t to different soil physical conditions the aim of these two last steps standardization and extrapolation are fundamental for applying the sensor based strategy to other mandarin orchards located under similar climatic conditions 2 2 experimental plot the study was carried out during 2015 and 2016 in a commercial citrus orchard located in alberic in the south of the province of valencia spain 39 7 31 33 n 0 33 17 06 w 37 m a m s l the experiment was performed on mature arrufatina

the usda classification is loam to sandy clay loam with percentages of clay ranging from 22 to 34 within the orchard soil organic matter was on average 1 3 the climate is semi arid with warm winters and dry summers with average annual precipitation of 400 mm lower than the et0 1000 1300 mm ign 2018 the plot was equipped with a drip irrigation system automatic control valves and flow meters to monitor the amount of water applied water was supplied by two drip laterals with a total 7 emitters per tree 2 2 l h 1 azud premier pc as azud alcantarilla murcia spain emitters were spaced at 1 2 m apart fdr water content profile probes enviroscan sentek stepney australia were used for monitoring θ f d r at 0 2 0 3 and 0 5 m depths where roots are mainly concentrated abouatallah et al 2012 at 30 min time step a total of 6 fdr probes were installed in the experimental plot four probes noted as definition def 1 4 were installed on four contiguous trees used for establishing the θ c r i t f d r thresholds two additional probes noted as validation val 1 and 2 were installed under different trees for implementing the sensor based strategy all probes were located adjacent to the drip irrigation line and at about 0 10 m from the emitter following the installations recommendations by bonet et al 2010 in order to characterize the soils where the 6 fdr probes were installed two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m height and 0 05 m diameter were collected around the access tubes at 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m depths soil organic matter content walkley and black 1934 dry bulk density and soil textural class according usda classification soil survey staff 1975 were determined 2 3 critical soil water content definition the θ c r i t f d r below which plant water stress occurs and it is necessary to start irrigation was obtained by solving linear equations fed with simultaneous measurements of ψ s t e m and θ f d r values of ψ s t e m obtained in previous research carried out in the area for solving these equations ballester et al 2014 martínez gimeno et al 2018 were adapted the onset of plant water stress was established in 0 8 to 1 0 mpa from mid september to may and in 1 0 to 1 2 mpa from june to mid september measurements were made during three drought cycles in two consecutive years irrigation was withheld from may 4th to may 17th days of the year doy 124 137 period a1 july 20th to july

december 1st to january 13th doy 336 13 period c2 in 2016 2017 according to common phenological stages of clementina arrufatina under climatic conditions of mediterranean area along the season period a corresponds with phase i of fruit growth period b with phase ii of fruit growth and period c with phase iii of fruit growth bloom and fruit set and post harvest definition probes 1 4 were used for measuring the θ f d r during these periods the ψ s t e m was measured in the same four trees equipped with the fdr probes by using a schölander pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co usa measurements were carried out with high frequency from daily to weekly during the drought cycles for each tree measurements were made on two leaves that were covered with aluminum foil bags at least one hour before the measurements turner 1981 average air vapour pressure deficit vpd was estimated for each drought cycle 2 4 critical soil water content standardization the adjustment to take into account sensor to sensor variation for using the θ c r i t with any fdr probe was made by contrasting θ s i m and θ f d r differences were quantified by solving the linear regression equation expressed as 1 θ f d r a θ s i m b where a and b are fitting parameters the leachm model was used for obtaining θ s i m input data includes soil physical and chemical properties of the different soil layers texture organic matter bulk density water retention parameters plant data crop cycle data crop cover fraction and weather rain temperature thermal amplitude potential evapotranspiration the leachm model follows the method proposed by childs and hanks 1975 to calculate the et0 from the weekly reference evapotranspiration the partition between evaporation and transpiration is made according to the crop cover fraction and following the equation proposed by nimah and hanks 1973 the soil profile where fdr probes were installed was divided into several horizontal segments the total simulation period was divided into short time intervals and equations were solved for each soil layer and each water flow interval which should be 0 1 day or less it was necessary to know the relations between hydraulic conductivity θ and ψ s o i l those are based on the moisture retention function eq 2 and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function eq 3 proposed by campbell 1974 integrating the modification suggested by hutson and cass 1987 2 ψ s o i l a θ θ s b 3 k k s θ θ s 2 b 2 p where ψ s o i l is the soil matric potential kpa a is the air entry water potential kpa b is an empirically determined constant θs is the volumetric water content at saturation vol θ is the volumetric water content vol k is the hydraulic conductivity mm day 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm day 1 and p is an interaction parameter about pore size the value of which is assumed to be 1 for the leachm model a free draining lower boundary was assumed although the objective of the work was not to assess the leachm model performance indicators were applied to validate simulations and detect anomalous data in the standardization differences between observed values θ f d r and predicted values θ s i m were evaluated by calculating two model evaluation indicators i the root mean square error rmse was selected for quantifying the error in terms of the units of the variable calculated by the model and ii the relative root mean squared error rrmse was used as indicator which is independent of the units of measurement the minimum value is 0 being also the optimal value loague and green 1991 their definitions are given by 4 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n 5 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o where n is the number of measured data oi and pi are the predicted and the measured values and o is the mean of the observed values indeed the approach proposed in the present work offers an alternative methodology to traditional calibration that allows to simulate an unlimited number of water balances from soil samples certainly this standardization methodology proposed could be replaced by any field or laboratory protocols to calibrate fdr sensors provenzano et al 2015 2 5 critical soil water content extrapolation the θ c r i t should be adapted for scheduling mandarin irrigation under different soil physical conditions for instance by relating ψ s o i l and θ using swrcs the swrc allows transferring the θ c r i t from the conditions where they were obtained definition to other locations validation with different soil physical properties using the corresponding ψ s o i l following these steps i to construct and to parameterize swrcs for the surrounding soil where fdr probes where installed ii determination of the ψ s o i l corresponding to the critical soil water content of definition fdr probes θ c r i t d e f and iii determination of the critical soil water content of validation fdr probes θ c r i t v a l corresponding to the ψ s o i l obtained in the previous step data for swrc were generated using the pressure plate method richards 1948 where θ corresponding to ψ s o i l of 0 10 30 60 100 300 and 1000 kpa was determined experimental data were fitted by means of the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 6 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ s o i l n m where θ is the soil water content vol θr is the soil residual water content vol θs is the soil saturated

θ c r i t crop water requirements were estimated according the crop evapotranspiration etc estimated with the single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 et0 was determined with the penman monteith equation in the version modified by fao allen et al 1998 by using the meteorological observations acquired by two automatic agro meteorological stations located nearby the orchard the kc varied among months depending on the crop phenological stage according to the canopy ground cover kc was assumed variable from a minimum of 0 36 in may to a maximum of 0 56 in october castel 2000 irrigation scheduling was programmed twice a week monday and thursday the soil moisture was measured with the validation fdr probes in the root profile 0 0 5 m before each scheduling event then the irrigation required dose v mm was defined as 7 v f m z θ c r i t f d r v a l θ f d r v a l where f m is the wetted soil fraction z mm is the bulb depth θ f d r v a l and θ c r i t f d r v a l vol are the current and critical soil water content for scheduling irrigation with validation fdr probes respectively the total dose vt mm to be applied for i days and the time for each irrigation event it s were calculated as 8 v t i 1 i n c w r i v 9 i t s v t s q i n t a k e n where s m2 is the total irrigated area qintake l s 1 is the total flow delivered to the subunit irrigation area controlled by pressure regulator and n is the number of days irrigation was performed for the scheduled interval 2 7 irrigation strategy validation the sensor based strategy was implemented during 2016 in the same experimental plot where irrigation thresholds were obtained the treatments applied were control irrigated during the whole season at 100 etc allen et al 1998 castel 2000 and the sensor based strategy sb strategy irrigated following θ c r i t for the strategy implementation the θ c r i t obtained from the stress cycles were extended to specific developmental crop phenological stages of the trees with similar vpd levels post harvest and bloom and fruit set periods c1 and c2 phase i periods a1 and a2 phase ii periods b1 and b2 and phase iii periods c1 and c2 of fruit growth the statistical design for comparing the two irrigation strategies was a randomized complete block with three replicates per treatment each sub plot had four rows with 6 7 sample trees per row where perimeter trees were used as guard leaving 8 10 central trees for experimental determinations ψ s t e m was determinate approximately weekly at solar midday in two mature leaves of two trees per experimental unit for assessing plant water status in the sb strategy fdr probes validation 1 and 2 were used for measuring θ and for scheduling irrigation yield was determined at the time of commercial harvest in all the sampled trees this was defined by the grower collaborator following the standard fruit quality protocols used in the area juice total soluble solids content juice titratable acidity and maturity index about 12 brix 7 g l and 17 respectively according to perry et al 2017 crop water productivity cwp was calculated as the crop yield divided by the irrigation volumes applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 critical soil water content determination during the three drought cycles carried out in 2015 and 2016 ψ s t e m and θ f d r measured with definition 1 4 fdr probes were compared by using linear regressions fig 1 the equations depicted in fig 1 are indicating the soil water status threshold below which ψ s t e m do not decrease greatly in response to small changes in θ differences among the slope of the curve can be observed for the different studied periods this might be because of the variations in the vpd registered for each period the most pronounced slopes were found in the summer stress cycles periods b1 and b2 when vpd reached its maximum values 1 3 kpa from doy 201 207 in 2015 the most moderate slope was found from doy 316 in 2015 to doy 11 in 2016 period c1 in agreement with low vpd 0 4 kpa since the atmospheric demand is not a limiting factor and changes in the soil moisture do not result in drastic decreases in the plant water status however measurements from doy 336 in 2016 to 13 in 2017 period c2 showed a different trend with small variations in the θ f d r resulting in important changes in ψ s t e m given the registered vpd values 0 2kpa this was an unexpected behavior it could be a consequence of the low soil temperature probably occurring this winter period which might have increased water viscosity and root hydraulic resistance hindering water absorption kramer 1942 running and reid 1980 the linear equations that relates ψ s t e m and θ f d r fig 1 were solved using the ψ s t e m thresholds proposed in the methodology results showed that the θ c r i t f d r d e f for scheduling irrigation varied on the considered period of the year and the evaporative demand table 3a this is the main advantage of the proposed strategy because irrigation water needs are adapted to the soil water status and the crop phenological stage it should be noted that the probes definition 1 and 3 showed higher humidity values than the probes definition 2 and 4 this fact may be attributed to the lack of calibration of the probes to the soil characteristics or even to the differences between plants 3 2 critical soil water content standardization and extrapolation the simulation with leachm was performed for a cold period from doy 338 in 2015 to 12 in 2016 without irrigation and with low evaporative demand aiming to minimize the effect of the evapotranspiration rates on the soil water dynamics soil physical and chemical properties and crop data inputs are summarized in tables 1 and 2 linear regression equations table 4 were calculated to consider differences between θ f d r and θ s i m and to standardize soil moisture values obtained with the fdr probes the slope of the regression lines a give an idea of how well the simulation fits the real measurements the slope of the regression varied between 0 67 1 03 indicating that data trends were reasonably similar and both methods were reproducing comparable soil water dynamics the fitting constant b that ranged between 2 68 and 15 63 showed the different levels of soil moisture provided by simulated and measured temporal series for each probe θ f d r was higher than θ s i m data not shown other studies corroborate that electromagnetic soil water content sensors could overestimate volumetric water content due to presence of salt in soils sevostianova et al 2015 standardization equations were characterised by coefficients of determination ranging between 0 93 to 0 72 the standardization methodology was assessed by means of evaluation indicators errors were estimated with θ s i m and θ f d r rmse was 1 0 0 4 vol and rrmse was 0 16 0 06 both statistics are widely affected by the presence of outliers viteri 2013 and simulations performed with leachm model sometimes presented these punctual differences at the beginning of the simulated data set data not shown in other studies the estimation of soil water content in the root zone was considered suitable when the rmse was equal to 2 0 vol rallo et al 2011 and the rrmse was considered as valid when was it lower than 0 40 confalonieri and bechini 2004 wallis et al 2011 the soil water balance simulation with leachm despite the difference with respect to the soil water content of the fdr accurately reproduce moisture readings this fact could lay the foundations for future research where the θ c r i t may be used directly on the simulations and thus reduce the dependency of the equipment of continuous measurement of soil moisture there is no consensus in the scientific community regarding to capacitance probes calibration some authors ensure that fdr measurements are valid in any soil within wide ranges of soil moisture levels thomas 1966 hoekstra and delaney 1974 however some studies have demonstrated that capacitance probes were influenced by the soil type bell et al 1987 the proposed standardization or any other analogous methodology is indeed considering essential for ensuring the correct use of the sb strategy following this procedure any volumetric water content value from fdr probe sensors could be adjusted at the same reference and data from different sensors could be comparable the θ c r i t d e f obtained by means of leachm standardization were 26 8 28 9 and 24 4 vol for periods a1 a2 b1 b2 and c1 c2 respectively table 3 b a progressive increase of the values is recorded according to the vpd along the season during the period b1 b2 summer the θ c r i t d e f required to avoid plant stress was the highest with 29 2 vol because of the high evaporative demand during this part of the season vpd 1 2 kpa the soil water storage capacity in this period should be enough for avoiding significant water stress girona et al 2002 in contrast the lowest θ c r i t d e f was determined during the period c1 c2 winter 24 3 vol when the evaporative demand vpd 0 3 kpa is lower than in the summer indeed the results showed that the critical soil water content to maintain an adequate plant water status was lower during periods of low evaporative demand as winter and the beginning of spring the seasonal weighted average θ c r i t d e f for the root profile 0 0 5 m was 26 vol similar to previous results obtained in grapefruit pérez pérez et al 2008 and orange pérez pérez et al 2014 irrigated al 100 etc with a volumetric soil water content in the entire soil profile 0 1 m ranging between 21 and 25 vol and 24 and 24 vol respectively in these studies volumetric soil water content was measured using a neutron probe previously calibrated at the experimental site differences could be attributed among others to the soil properties measurement depth and citrus variety after applying the standardization process extrapolation was made to adapt the θ c r i t d e f to specific soil conditions where validation 1 and 2 probes were installed extrapolated θ c r i t v a l showed in the table 5 have been classified in specific phenological stages post harvest bloom and fruit set and phase i ii and iii of fruit growth in accordance with the registered average vpd during the drought cycles table 3 and during the season when the sensor based strategy was implemented table 4 indeed the thresholds obtained for validation probes were similar to the average values obtained for definition probes probably because the soil homogeneity within the plot 3 3 irrigation strategy validation irrigation was scheduled by means of the sensor based strategy during 2016 in the experimental plot using the validation 1 and 2 fdr probes the mean annual et0 and rainfall for the experimental season was of 1122 and 716 mm respectively the temporal distribution of rainfall and vpd followed the typical patterns of the mediterranean basin fig 2 a the seasonal variation of rainfall was characterised by a period of great scarcity during phase ii of fruit growth 21 mm and higher precipitation values were registered in the spring and the autumn during bloom and fruit set 113 mm and phase iii of fruit growth 548 mm mean daily vpd reached the highest values during phase ii of fruit growth 1 1 kpa during the implementation period from january to november 2016 control trees received 581 mm of irrigation while in the treatment irrigated following the sb strategy the applied irrigation water was 429 mm fig 2b a 27 water saving was achieved with the sb strategy reaching the highest reductions 29 during phase ii of fruit growth these differences in water application resulted in slightly different plant water status between treatments fig 2c during post harvest doy 11 and 21 the ψ s t e m registered in both treatments was lower than the thresholds established 0 8 to 1 0 mpa most likely because of the effect of low temperatures 12 4 c which could reduce plant water uptake capacity however it should be noted that there were no statistically significant differences between the evaluated irrigation strategies later on during the mid winter period plant water status was recovered in the control treatment because of the higher irrigation volume applied during the beginning of the crop season in comparisons with the sb strategy during this period doy 33 42 and 49 in the sb strategy ψ s t e m was lower than 1 0 mpa with no statistically significant differences between irrigation strategies from doy 55 plant water status was recovered in both treatments and specially since doy 73 when pruning was made in the entire plot during phase ii of fruit growth doy 218 232 239 and 244 ψ s t e m significantly decreased in the sb strategy compared with control treatment the plant water status values reached are probably consequence of the high evaporative demand during these periods however the threshold of 1 3 to 1 5 mpa stablished by ballester et al 2011and 2014 and gonzález altozano and castel 1999 to avoid negative consequences in quality and yield was not exceeded during phase iii of fruit growth doy 266 and 279 both treatments had an inadequate plant water status with the lowest values of ψ s t e m recorded in the sb strategy the θ c r i t v a l used for this period was 24 vol according to the low vpd registered in phase iii o fruit growth table 5 however final fruit growth and ripening took place and even if the evaporative demand was low the fruit sink demand for photoassimilates was elevated being the irrigation volumes applied probably insufficient it would be desirable to increase the θ c r i t v a l for this stage maintaining the levels of the phase ii of fruit growth 29 vol until harvest this fact underlines the importance of an appropriate determination and timing of the moisture thresholds notwithstanding the water savings obtained in the sb strategy no significant differences were found between treatments in terms of yield reaching 73 3 23 2 kg tree 1 and 72 1 19 8 kg tree 1 in control and sb strategy respectively these yield levels are well in line with the expected tree performance for mandarin trees in the area as reported in previous research ballester et al 2014 nicolas et al 2016 the highest cwp was obtained in the sb strategy 7 2 kg m 3 compared to the control treatment 5 4 kg m 3 demonstrating that the irrigation scheduling developed can optimize irrigation efficiency by better adjusting the watering regime to the actual orchard water consumption although there are other models for scheduling irrigation in citrus trees alba et al 2003 bonet et al 2010 they do not consider the limits of moisture and its adaptation to other soils two elements that are the basis of the model proposed this work demonstrates that an irrigation schedule adjusted to the soil water content dynamics can improve the water use efficiency however irrigation time calculated by the proposed strategy should be monitored to avoid errors associated with fdr probe management the small volume of soil sampled by fdr probes the influence of air gaps or the lack of contact between sensors and soil may cause problems evett and parkin 2005 evett et al 2006 the crop coefficient method for estimating water needs is too general and empiric but it could be considered as a reference to compare results and reveal errors indeed occasional determinations of plant water status could be also included in order to check if the irrigation scheduling regime is detrimentally affecting crop production similar water savings with no yield reductions as observed in the present work were obtained in previous studies also in citrus trees using other irrigation strategies such regulated deficit irrigation rdi ballester et al 2014 and subsurface drip irrigation martínez gimeno et al 2018 the sb strategy coupled with rdi strategies could be used to improve water productivity reduce tree growth and improve fruit composition enhancing thus economical profit pérez pérez et al 2010 however the sb strategy provide a θ c r i t considering an adequate ψ s t e m then future studies will be necessary to expand the scheduling range for conditions of greater stress in controlled deficit irrigation strategies moreover the use of more paired θ f d r and ψ s t e m measurements not only restricted to the stress cycles tested would substantially improve the determination of the critical soil water content thresholds 4 conclusions the determination and use of the θ c r i t is a useful tool for optimizing irrigation scheduling the sb strategy computes the water doses considering the θ f d r and avoiding excessive depletions which may result in a too severe tree water stress the strategy includes two steps for scheduling irrigation with fdr probes across mandarin orchards under similar climatic conditions on the one hand a standardization methodology minimizes sensor to sensor variations allowing to use absolute values of θ c r i t for estimating irrigation needs on the other hand an extrapolation methodology adapts θ c r i t to any soil physical condition the irrigation strategy was implemented in a commercial orchard and water savings reached 26 without limiting yield thus increasing crop water productivity future work will be necessary for assessing the suitability of the proposed strategy in a multi season study for different citrus varieties or species and under different crop conditions declaration of interests the authors declare that they have

10622,as a main crop cultivated in greenhouses tomato solanum lycopersicum l has become one of the most popular vegetables in the world tomato is water and nutrient demanding although effects of irrigation and nitrogen nutrition management on tomato growth have been widely investigated few studies have been conducted on the interactive effects of irrigation and potassium k fertilizers especially those of irrigation and polymer coated potassium chloride pcpc in this study a pot experiment was conducted with three pcpc application rates f100 f80 and f60 and three irrigation levels i100 i80 and i60 in 2018 and repeated again in 2019 the results showed higher soil available k endogenous hormone contents antioxidant enzyme activities photosynthetic rate and tomato yield lower lipid peroxidation and better root morphology and tomato quality in the f80i80 treatment compared with the other treatments the f80i80 treatment increased tomato yield by 5 3 18 1 vitamin c content by 7 3 26 6 leaf rubisco activity from the fruit enlargement stage to the fruit ripening stage by 4 7 18 1 and photosynthetic rate by 4 5 17 8 adjusting pcpc application rate and irrigation level to meet tomato growth requirements could not only save water and fertilizers but also increase tomato yield and protect the environment keywords polymer coated potassium chloride irrigation level greenhouse tomato endogenous hormones antioxidant enzyme 1 introduction drought is an abiotic stress that affects plant growth and development and causes yield loss waraich et al 2011 in the past decades moderate to severe water scarcity has become a worldwide concern especially in semi arid and arid regions li and guo 2015 increasing domestic water demand due to rapid population growth which competes with industrial water usage has exacerbated the water shortage issue in china su et al 2018 flood irrigation using groundwater is a conventional irrigation method used in greenhouse production in china however this irrigation method is not water saving and favorable for crop quality chen et al 2013 in addition to groundwater over exploitation this irrigation method may also lead to soil nutrients loss to the deeper soil layers li et al 2017 consequently groundwater would be polluted and human health would be threatened haj amor et al 2017 therefore it is important to develop better irrigation strategies to improve water use efficiency wue but without compromising crop yield and quality yang et al 2020 in order to achieve this goal different irrigation strategies have been developed and assessed drip irrigation is one of the most popular irrigation methods in the world it is well known that drip irrigation has the advantages of high wue high fertilizer use efficiency and environmentally friendly however its high cost hinders its wide adoption in china deficit irrigation is another good method that improves soil water exploitation by plant roots ćosića et al 2015 qin et al 2013 coyago cruz et al 2019 although deficit irrigation decreases tomato yield to some extent it improves tomato quality and wue patanè et al 2011a b chen et al 2013 nangare et al 2016 reported that tomato fruit quality was improved in such as color hardness acidity soluble solids and ascorbic acid considerably with deficit irrigation at 80 of conventional irrigation level besides stable tomato yield and high water productivity 19 2 kg m 3 were achieved inmaculada et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation 75 etc reduced water use efficiency by an average of 28 2 but increased tomato soluble solids by 8 4 and hunter a b ratio by 2 4 long term water deficit stress restricts tomato growth and reduces its yield therefore it is necessary to develop fertilization strategies to offset the negative effect of drought stress on tomato yield an essential element for tomato growth and reproduction potassium k plays an important role in plant water metabolism and stress tolerance behboudian and anderson 1990 besford and maw 1975 appropriate k application not only meets crops k need but also enhances crops draught resistance as k increased leaf turgor potential under water stress premachandra et al 2008 therefore proper k application can avoid tomato yield decrease caused by deficit irrigation however to maximize crop yield and economic benefits farmers apply excessive fertilizers particularly k fertilizers in greenhouse tomato production fan et al 2014 massive application of k fertilizers not only decreases tomato yield and quality but also increases the risk of water pollution zhang et al 2013 tieman et al 2017 kuscu et al 2014 therefore methods to reduce available k loss and improve k use efficiency kue should be developed bertol et al 2007 polymer coated potassium chloride pcpc as a novel k fertilizer was developed by the national engineering laboratory for efficient use of soil and fertilizer resources in china it is a controlled released k fertilizer its k release rate closely matches crops k demand thereby reducing unnecessary k loss at the initial stage of fertilization and increasing k supply at the peak of crop k demand yang et al 2017 and reducing labor input associated with top dressing application compared with conventional k fertilization 20 of potassium chloride kcl was applied as base fertilizers while the rest 80 was applied water soluble fertilizer as topdressing therefore optimizing the input of k fertilizer is of great significance not only to meet the k demand of crops but also to reduce environmental pollution at the same time suitable k application rates improve crop yield quality and kue chapagain et al 2003 found that glucose and total soluble solids in the tomato fruits were slightly higher with increasing kcl application in the treatment solution and the percentage of rotten and blotchy fruits was significantly decreased the research of yang et al 2016 on cotton revealed that pcpc application not only increased cotton lint yield by 11 2 32 1 and improved cotton quality but also increased k recovery efficiency by 24 3 33 8 in comparison with conventional k fertilizer application tian et al 2017 demonstrated that the application significantly increased cotton lint yield by 8 1 32 7 and kue by 15 5 54 8 compared with kcl application therefore pcpc has great potential for increasing tomato yield and improving kue water and k managements play significant roles in tomato growth and yield formation in greenhouse currently few studies have been conducted on the interactive effects of pcpc application rate and irrigation level on tomato therefore pot experiments were conducted in this study to learn the best combination of pcpc application rate and irrigation level so as to maximize the synergy between pcpc and water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials a pot experiment was conducted in 2018 and repeated again in 2019 in a greenhouse 36 9 39 n

indicators of pcpc field application performance nutrient release rate of pcpc is mainly affected by temperature and soil moisture within a certain range k release rate of pcpc increases with the increases in temperature and soil moisture in the laboratory no marked k release from pcpc was observed during the first 21 days with only 12 1 of total k being released fig 3 however from day 21 91 69 4 of total k was released then from day 92 on k release decelerated after 119 days 74 4 of total k was released from pcpc in the field during the first 21days 19 0 13 4 and 8 8 of total k were released from pcpc in the i100 i80 and i60 conditions respectively the k release rate accelerated from day 35 77 in i100 from day 35 91 in i80 and from day 35 105 for i60 at the end of the experiment 96 5 87 3 and 76 6 of total k had been released from pcpc under the i100 i80 and i60 conditions respectively 3 2 interactive effects of irrigation and pcpc application on tomato yield kue and wue the results indicated that tomato yield kue and wue were significantly affected by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 in both 2018 and 2019 table 1 the pcpc application rate and irrigation level had significant interactive effects on tomato yield p 0 01 wue p 0 05 and kue p 0 05 in 2019 table 1 the f80 and i80 treatments presented higher tomato yield kue and wue in comparison with other treatments in 2018 the f80 treatments increased tomato yield by 3 9 6 3 2 9 7 3 and 8 0 8 7 compared with the cf f100 and f60 treatments respectively and increased wue by 25 4 27 6 6 4 7 6 and 9 9 11 5 respectively kue increased with decrease in pcpc application rate the f80 treatments increased kue by 10 8 10 9 and 11 0 11 7 compared with the cf and f100 treatments respectively in both

and on soluble sugar p 0 01 in 2018 in both years fruit lycopene vc soluble sugar and soluble solid contents were higher in the f80 treatments than in the cf f100 and f60 treatments the i80 treatments also had the higher lycopene vc soluble sugar and soluble solid contents than cf i100 and i60 treatments the f80i80 treatment significantly improved tomato fruit quality compared with other k fertilization treatments increasing fruit lycopene vc soluble sugar and soluble solid contents by 2 3 22 3 7 2 30 4 1 0 25 4 and 2 5 18 7 respectively 3 4 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on leaf spad value rubisco activity and photosynthesis indicators leaf spad values were considerably affected by pcpc application rate and irrigation level as well as their interaction fig 4 a treatments with pcpc application significantly improved leaf spad value compared with the ck treatment in particular the f80 treatments showed better effects than the f100 and f60 treatments in increasing leaf spad value rubisco is one of the most important enzymes in plants that affect photosynthesis in leaves rubisco enzyme was significantly affected by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 as well as their interaction in both the fruit enlargement stage and the fruit ripening stage fig 4 b photosynthetic rate stomatic conductance and transpiration rate were significantly affected by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 table 3 photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate were also significantly p 0 05 affected by the interaction between pcpc application rate and irrigation level rubisco activity and photosynthetic rate were higher in the f80 treatments than in the cf f100 and f60 treatments and higher in the i80 treatments than in the cf i100 and i60 treatments moreover compared with the other k fertilization treatments the f80i80 treatment increased rubisco activity by 4 7 18 1 during the fruit enlargement stage and the fruit ripening stage and increased photosynthetic rate by 4 5 17 8 in the two year stomatal conductance and transpiration rate increased with the increase in irrigation level in both years compared with the other k fertilization treatments the f80i100 treatment markedly increased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate by 3 3 41 3 and 3 3 40 9 respectively 3 5 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on tomato root morphology pcpc application rate and irrigation level significantly p 0 01 affected root surface area volume and average diameter table 4 the interaction between pcpc application rate and irrigation level significantly p 0 01 affected root surface area but did not significantly affect root volume and average diameter under a same irrigation level root surface area volume and average diameter first increased and then decreased with increase in pcpc application rate compared with the cf f100 and f60 treatments in the two years the f80 treatments increased root surface area by 38 9 48 5 3 8 11 5 and 14 9 21 5 respectively increased root volume by 39 5 48 7 4 4 10 9 and 17 6 17 6 respectively and increased root average diameter by 13 9 17 4 3 2 4 4 and 8 9 11 6 respectively under a same pcpc application rate root surface area volume and average diameter decreased with increase in irrigation level in the two years compared with the cf i100 and i80 treatments the i60 treatments had 27 0 44 3 21 3 26 2 and 11 4 17 5 respectively higher root surface area 38 5 49 5 13 8 18 3 and 8 0 8 8 respectively higher root volume and 12 8 18 0 7 7 10 3 and 3 9 5 8 respectively higher root average diameter the f80i60 treatment resulted in the most favorable root morphology compared with the other k fertilization treatments in both years 3 6 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on available k content in topsoil soil available k in topsoil was significantly affected by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 in both years fig 5 a 5b pcpc application rate and irrigation level had a significant interaction on soil available k p 0 05 in both years the content of available k in topsoil was significantly increased by the k fertilization treatment and increased with increase in pcpc application rate available k was significantly lower in the ck treatment than in the other treatments and was higher in the f100 treatment than in the cf f80 and f60 treatments the k release rate of pcpc was higher in the treatments with higher irrigation levels fig 3 during the tomato flowering and fruit enlargement stages soil available k was higher in the i100 treatments than in the cf i80 and i60 treatments however during the fruit enlargement and ripening stages in both years soil available k in the i80 treatments was significantly higher than those in the cf i100 and i60 treatments 3 7 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on tomato antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation cat pod and sod activities in tomato leaves first increased and then decreased with the increase in pcpc application rate during the fruit enlargement and the fruit ripening stages fig 6 while the mda and h2o2 contents first decreased and then increased with the increase in pcpc application rate the cat pod and sod activities in tomato leaves first decreased and then increased with the reduction in irrigation level and the mda and h2o2 contents first increased and then decreased in tomato leaves during the fruit enlargement stage to the fruit ripening stage fig 7 similar changes were observed in tomato roots in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the maximum cat pod and sod activities in the tomato leaves occurred in the f80 treatments they were 6 0 11 2 2 5 3 6 and 4 0 8 6 respectively higher than those in the f100 treatments and 10 2 15 1 3 2 6 7 and 6 1 11 3 respectively higher than those in the f60 treatments similarly in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the maximum cat pod and sod activities in the tomato roots occurred in the f80 treatments they were 7 5 9 5 3 6 15 0 and 5 2 15 0 respectively higher than those in the f100 treatments and 12 9 13 5 9 6 18 6 and 10 0 18 1 respectively higher than those in the f60 treatments in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the maximum cat pod and sod activities in tomato leaves occurred in the i80 treatments they were 6 0 10 1 5 3 6 1 and 5 2 5 9 respectively higher than those in the i100 treatments and 8 5 11 7 9 4 9 7 and 8 8 15 7 respectively higher than those in the i60 treatments similarly the maximum cat pod and sod activities in tomato roots occurred in the i80 treatments they were 4 0 6 4 4 9 6 9 and 7 0 10 3 respectively higher than those in the i100 treatments and 7 6 8 0 8 4 9 4 and 12 3 14 0 respectively higher than those in the i60 treatments in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the minimum mda and h2o2 contents in both tomato leaves and roots occurred in the f80i80 treatment they were 8 1 64 3 and 1 5 67 8 respectively lower than in those in the other k fertilization treatments the cat pod and sod activities mda and h2o2 contents were significantly influenced by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 except pod activity in leaves during the fruit enlargement stage the interaction between pcpc application rate and irrigation level had significant p 0 05 effects on the antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation in tomato but had no significant effect on leaf pod activity in the fruit enlargement stage and on leaf mda content leaf cat and pod and root sod activities in the fruit ripening stage 3 8 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on tomato endogenous hormones in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages endogenous hormones in tomato leaves and roots were significantly affected by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 as well as their interaction except iaa in leaves fig 8 in terms of iaa and ga contents the f80 treatments were higher than the f100 and f60 treatments and the i80 treatments were higher than the i100 and i60 treatments moreover the f80i80 treatment significantly increased iaa and ga contents in the leaves by 17 1 18 6 and 20 9 25 8 respectively as compared with the other k fertilization treatments meanwhile the f80i80 treatment markedly increased iaa and ga contents in the roots by 38 0 47 2 and 34 1 40 7 respectively as compared with the other k fertilization treatments 4 discussion k is a quality element for tomato production and adequate k supply is essential for high tomato quality tavallali et al 2018 pcpc application has been reported to significantly increase soil available k content and improve crop growth and yield li et al 2020 this study showed that pcpc application promoted tomato k absorption and increased tomato yield and wue compared with conventional k fertilizer i e kcl application the high soil available k content in the pcpc application treatments well satisfied the k need of tomato plants during the whole growth period meanwhile adequate k supply increased root surface area volume average diameter and activity and promoted iaa and ga syntheses in roots application of pcpc improved leaf photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as well as other physiological characteristics this was mainly due to the improvement of k status in tomato plants which promoted rubisco activity in tomato leaves and enhanced the photosynthetic activity of tomato plants wang et al 2014 also found similar results that appropriate k content in soil enhanced soybean leaf rubisco activity and resulted in photosynthesis increase in this study when pcpc was applied at 80 of conventional k fertilizer application level optimal tomato yield and quality was achieved but when pcpc was applied at the same level as conventional k fertilizer tomato yield and quality decreased this might be because excessive pcpc application inhibited tomato root growth iaa and ga syntheses and in turn the growth of tomato plant insufficient growth suppressed the syntheses of cat pod and sod enzymes weakened the stress resistance ability of plants under high temperature environment and had an adverse effect on fruit quality yurtseven et al 2005 found similar results that tomato yield fruit size and total soluble solid content first increased and then decreased with increase in k fertilizer application insufficient application of pcpc also had adverse effects on crop growth although the root system was enlarged with increased nutrient absorption area when soil k supply was insufficient plant k absorption was reduced tomato growth and fruit development were inhibited and tomato quality was adversely affected this result was consistent with that of kanai et al 2007 who showed that compared with control k deficiency treatment severely decreased the biomasses of all organs besford and maw 1975 found that low k level in nutrient medium limited plant nutrient assimilation and retarded plant growth flower development and fruit set pcpc applied at appropriate amount not only met the k need of plants but also promoted the syntheses of antioxidant enzymes in roots and leaves reduced lipid peroxidation and improved fruit quality in high temperature tomato growing environments therefore pcpc applied at appropriate amount can achieve the goal of reducing k fertilizer usage while maintaining tomato yield this study provides a basic reference for appropriate application of pcpc during tomato growing season previous studies demonstrated that tomato yield and fertilizer utilization efficiency decreased with reduction in irrigation amount zhang et al 2016 in this study tomato yield and kue first increased and then decreased with reduction in irrigation which is consistent with the finding of bhattacharyya et al 2018 in maize cultivation taking the results of this study and previous studies together we believe that kue may be affected by soil k supply intensity nutrient release rates of controlled release fertilizers are known to be significantly affected by environmental moisture and temperature lamont et al 1987 in this study the mean air temperature when the tomato seedlings were transplanted was 26 7 which was favorable for k release from pcpc the combined effect of soil moisture and temperature in the i100 treatments led to rapid k release from the pcpc which resulted in a rapid increase in soil available k and excessive k absorption by the plants during the early stage fig 3 in the period of maximum efficiency of nutrients k release from pcpc slowed down which caused a decrease in soil available k content and reduction in k uptake by tomato plants yang et al 2012 the i60 treatments were in a water shortage state for a long time and was slower k release from pcpc as compared with the i100 and i80 treatments which resulted in long term deficiency of soil available k and reduction of k absorption by roots the k release from pcpc in the i80 treatments was slow in the early stage and accelerated during the maximum k requirement period of tomato well matching the k absorption need of tomato meanwhile iaa and ga syntheses in the roots increased fruit yield and kue with the reduction in irrigation tomato fruit quality indexes first increased and then decreased table 2 liu et al 2019 also reported that too much water jeopardized fruit quality while appropriate irrigation amounts improved fruit quality with excessive irrigation in the i100 treatment tomato root growth was retarded and k uptake was decreased although root morphology was significantly improved in the i60 treatments the slow k release from pcpc led to low soil available k content therefore tomato quality in the i100 and i60 treatments was lower than that in the i80 treatments the above explanation also applies to leaf spad value net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance similar results were also reported by wang et al 2015a b with reduction in irrigation stomatal conductance and transpiration rate decreased which might be caused by water absorption decrease by the roots under water deficit conditions stomata closed to reduce transpiration and avoid excessive water loss similar results have been reported by zhang et al 2015 2018 compared with the single effect of pcpc application rate or irrigation level their interactive effect was more significant on tomato growth the f80i80 treatment presented the largest yield and the best fruit quality which was similar to the results of patanè et al 2011a b on tomato cabello et al 2009 on melon and du et al 2010 on maize the yield in the f80i80 treatment was 3482 7 g pot 1 in 2018 and 3483 5 g pot 1 in 2019 5 3 28 6 higher than those in the other treatments the lycopene vc soluble sugar and soluble solids in the f80i80 treatment were 2 3 35 4 7 2 53 2 1 0 37 5 and 2 5 19 7 respectively higher than those in the other treatments meanwhile the f80i80 treatment had higher kue and wue this demonstrated that suitable soil water conditions allowed pcpc to release k according to tomato need which increased kue and wue while avoiding excessive accumulation of k in the soil and the resulting salt stress yang et al 2012 the appropriate growth environment and sufficient nutrient supply improved iaa and ga contents in tomato roots and leaves and promoted the growth of tomato plants and development of fruits at the same time favorable conditions promoted the increase of leaf rubisco activity improved the net photosynthetic rate and increased nutrient accumulation wang et al 2015a b in addition the suitable growth environment increased antioxidant enzyme activities in the tomato plants enhanced stress resistance capacity of the tomato plants in high temperature environments and reduced lipid peroxidation 5 conclusions the interaction between irrigation level and pcpc application rate was investigated with pot experiments to help to improve greenhouse production of tomato the f80i80 treatment where the soil was so irrigated that after irrigation soil water content was 72 80 and where the amount of pcpc applied was 80 of the amount of conventional fertilizers applied presented the optimal leaf physiology indexes endogenous hormone contents and antioxidant enzyme activities and the minimal lipid peroxidation during tomato growth and achieved the highest tomato yield and quality the results from this study can be help to develop a sustainable water and fertilizer management strategy for greenhouse tomato cultivation in china the method of identifying the optimal ratio of irrigation level to pcpc application rate for tomato production used in this study is applicable for other vegetable and crop productions declaration of

10622,as a main crop cultivated in greenhouses tomato solanum lycopersicum l has become one of the most popular vegetables in the world tomato is water and nutrient demanding although effects of irrigation and nitrogen nutrition management on tomato growth have been widely investigated few studies have been conducted on the interactive effects of irrigation and potassium k fertilizers especially those of irrigation and polymer coated potassium chloride pcpc in this study a pot experiment was conducted with three pcpc application rates f100 f80 and f60 and three irrigation levels i100 i80 and i60 in 2018 and repeated again in 2019 the results showed higher soil available k endogenous hormone contents antioxidant enzyme activities photosynthetic rate and tomato yield lower lipid peroxidation and better root morphology and tomato quality in the f80i80 treatment compared with the other treatments the f80i80 treatment increased tomato yield by 5 3 18 1 vitamin c content by 7 3 26 6 leaf rubisco activity from the fruit enlargement stage to the fruit ripening stage by 4 7 18 1 and photosynthetic rate by 4 5 17 8 adjusting pcpc application rate and irrigation level to meet tomato growth requirements could not only save water and fertilizers but also increase tomato yield and protect the environment keywords polymer coated potassium chloride irrigation level greenhouse tomato endogenous hormones antioxidant enzyme 1 introduction drought is an abiotic stress that affects plant growth and development and causes yield loss waraich et al 2011 in the past decades moderate to severe water scarcity has become a worldwide concern especially in semi arid and arid regions li and guo 2015 increasing domestic water demand due to rapid population growth which competes with industrial water usage has exacerbated the water shortage issue in china su et al 2018 flood irrigation using groundwater is a conventional irrigation method used in greenhouse production in china however this irrigation method is not water saving and favorable for crop quality chen et al 2013 in addition to groundwater over exploitation this irrigation method may also lead to soil nutrients loss to the deeper soil layers li et al 2017 consequently groundwater would be polluted and human health would be threatened haj amor et al 2017 therefore it is important to develop better irrigation strategies to improve water use efficiency wue but without compromising crop yield and quality yang et al 2020 in order to achieve this goal different irrigation strategies have been developed and assessed drip irrigation is one of the most popular irrigation methods in the world it is well known that drip irrigation has the advantages of high wue high fertilizer use efficiency and environmentally friendly however its high cost hinders its wide adoption in china deficit irrigation is another good method that improves soil water exploitation by plant roots ćosića et al 2015 qin et al 2013 coyago cruz et al 2019 although deficit irrigation decreases tomato yield to some extent it improves tomato quality and wue patanè et al 2011a b chen et al 2013 nangare et al 2016 reported that tomato fruit quality was improved in such as color hardness acidity soluble solids and ascorbic acid considerably with deficit irrigation at 80 of conventional irrigation level besides stable tomato yield and high water productivity 19 2 kg m 3 were achieved inmaculada et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation 75 etc reduced water use efficiency by an average of 28 2 but increased tomato soluble solids by 8 4 and hunter a b ratio by 2 4 long term water deficit stress restricts tomato growth and reduces its yield therefore it is necessary to develop fertilization strategies to offset the negative effect of drought stress on tomato yield an essential element for tomato growth and reproduction potassium k plays an important role in plant water metabolism and stress tolerance behboudian and anderson 1990 besford and maw 1975 appropriate k application not only meets crops k need but also enhances crops draught resistance as k increased leaf turgor potential under water stress premachandra et al 2008 therefore proper k application can avoid tomato yield decrease caused by deficit irrigation however to maximize crop yield and economic benefits farmers apply excessive fertilizers particularly k fertilizers in greenhouse tomato production fan et al 2014 massive application of k fertilizers not only decreases tomato yield and quality but also increases the risk of water pollution zhang et al 2013 tieman et al 2017 kuscu et al 2014 therefore methods to reduce available k loss and improve k use efficiency kue should be developed bertol et al 2007 polymer coated potassium chloride pcpc as a novel k fertilizer was developed by the national engineering laboratory for efficient use of soil and fertilizer resources in china it is a controlled released k fertilizer its k release rate closely matches crops k demand thereby reducing unnecessary k loss at the initial stage of fertilization and increasing k supply at the peak of crop k demand yang et al 2017 and reducing labor input associated with top dressing application compared with conventional k fertilization 20 of potassium chloride kcl was applied as base fertilizers while the rest 80 was applied water soluble fertilizer as topdressing therefore optimizing the input of k fertilizer is of great significance not only to meet the k demand of crops but also to reduce environmental pollution at the same time suitable k application rates improve crop yield quality and kue chapagain et al 2003 found that glucose and total soluble solids in the tomato fruits were slightly higher with increasing kcl application in the treatment solution and the percentage of rotten and blotchy fruits was significantly decreased the research of yang et al 2016 on cotton revealed that pcpc application not only increased cotton lint yield by 11 2 32 1 and improved cotton quality but also increased k recovery efficiency by 24 3 33 8 in comparison with conventional k fertilizer application tian et al 2017 demonstrated that the application significantly increased cotton lint yield by 8 1 32 7 and kue by 15 5 54 8 compared with kcl application therefore pcpc has great potential for increasing tomato yield and improving kue water and k managements play significant roles in tomato growth and yield formation in greenhouse currently few studies have been conducted on the interactive effects of pcpc application rate and irrigation level on tomato therefore pot experiments were conducted in this study to learn the best combination of pcpc application rate and irrigation level so as to maximize the synergy between pcpc and water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials a pot experiment was conducted in 2018 and repeated again in 2019 in a greenhouse 36 9 39 n

indicators of pcpc field application performance nutrient release rate of pcpc is mainly affected by temperature and soil moisture within a certain range k release rate of pcpc increases with the increases in temperature and soil moisture in the laboratory no marked k release from pcpc was observed during the first 21 days with only 12 1 of total k being released fig 3 however from day 21 91 69 4 of total k was released then from day 92 on k release decelerated after 119 days 74 4 of total k was released from pcpc in the field during the first 21days 19 0 13 4 and 8 8 of total k were released from pcpc in the i100 i80 and i60 conditions respectively the k release rate accelerated from day 35 77 in i100 from day 35 91 in i80 and from day 35 105 for i60 at the end of the experiment

fertilization treatments the f80i100 treatment markedly increased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate by 3 3 41 3 and 3 3 40 9 respectively 3 5 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on tomato root morphology pcpc application rate and irrigation level significantly p 0 01 affected root surface area volume and average diameter table 4 the interaction between pcpc application rate and irrigation level significantly p 0 01 affected root surface area but did not significantly affect root volume and average diameter under a same irrigation level root surface area volume and average diameter first increased and then decreased with increase in pcpc application rate compared with the cf f100 and f60 treatments in the two years the f80 treatments increased root surface area by 38 9

irrigation level had a significant interaction on soil available k p 0 05 in both years the content of available k in topsoil was significantly increased by the k fertilization treatment and increased

the k release rate of pcpc was higher in the treatments with higher irrigation levels fig 3 during the tomato flowering and fruit enlargement stages soil available k was higher in the i100 treatments than in the cf i80 and i60 treatments however during the fruit enlargement and ripening stages in both years soil available k in the i80 treatments was significantly higher than those in the cf i100 and i60 treatments 3 7 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on tomato antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation cat pod and sod activities in tomato leaves first increased and then decreased with the increase in pcpc application rate during the fruit enlargement and the fruit ripening stages fig 6 while the mda and h2o2 contents first decreased and then increased with the increase in pcpc application rate the cat pod and sod activities in tomato leaves first decreased and then increased with the reduction in irrigation level and the mda and h2o2 contents first increased and then decreased in tomato leaves during the fruit enlargement stage to the fruit ripening stage fig 7 similar changes were observed in tomato roots in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the maximum cat pod and sod activities in the tomato leaves occurred in the f80 treatments they were 6 0 11 2 2 5 3 6 and 4 0 8 6 respectively higher than those in the f100 treatments and 10 2 15 1 3 2 6 7 and 6 1 11 3 respectively higher than those in the f60 treatments similarly in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the maximum cat pod and sod activities in the tomato roots occurred in the f80 treatments they were 7 5 9 5 3 6 15 0 and 5 2 15 0 respectively higher than those in the f100 treatments and 12 9 13 5 9 6 18 6 and 10 0 18 1 respectively higher than those in the f60 treatments in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the maximum cat pod and sod activities in tomato leaves occurred in the i80 treatments they were 6 0 10 1 5 3 6 1 and 5 2 5 9 respectively higher than those in the i100 treatments and 8 5 11 7 9 4 9 7 and 8 8 15 7 respectively higher than those in the i60 treatments similarly the maximum cat pod and sod activities in tomato roots occurred in the i80 treatments they were 4 0 6 4 4 9 6 9 and 7 0 10 3 respectively higher than those in the i100 treatments and 7 6 8 0 8 4 9 4 and 12 3 14 0 respectively higher than those in the i60 treatments in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages the minimum mda and h2o2 contents in both tomato leaves and roots occurred in the f80i80 treatment they were 8 1 64 3 and 1 5 67 8 respectively lower than in those in the other k fertilization treatments the cat pod and sod activities mda and h2o2 contents were significantly influenced by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 except pod activity in leaves during the fruit enlargement stage the interaction between pcpc application rate and irrigation level had significant p 0 05 effects on the antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation in tomato but had no significant effect on leaf pod activity in the fruit enlargement stage and on leaf mda content leaf cat and pod and root sod activities in the fruit ripening stage 3 8 effects of irrigation and pcpc coupling on tomato endogenous hormones in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages endogenous hormones in tomato leaves and roots were significantly affected by pcpc application rate p 0 01 and irrigation level p 0 01 as well as their interaction except iaa in leaves fig 8 in terms of iaa and ga contents the f80 treatments were higher than the f100 and f60 treatments and the i80 treatments were higher than the i100 and i60 treatments moreover the f80i80 treatment significantly increased iaa and ga contents in the leaves by 17 1 18 6 and 20 9 25 8 respectively as compared with the other k fertilization treatments meanwhile the f80i80 treatment markedly increased iaa and ga contents in the roots by 38 0 47 2 and 34 1 40 7 respectively as compared with the other k fertilization treatments 4 discussion k is a quality element for tomato production and adequate k supply is essential for high tomato quality tavallali et al 2018 pcpc application has been reported to significantly increase soil available k content and improve crop growth and yield li et al 2020 this study showed that pcpc application promoted tomato k absorption and increased tomato yield and wue compared with conventional k fertilizer i e kcl application the high soil available k content in the pcpc application treatments well satisfied the k need of tomato plants during the whole growth period meanwhile adequate k supply increased root surface area volume average diameter and activity and promoted iaa and ga syntheses in roots application of pcpc improved leaf photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as well as other physiological characteristics this was mainly due to the improvement of k status in tomato plants which promoted rubisco activity in tomato leaves and enhanced the photosynthetic activity of tomato plants wang et al 2014 also found similar results that appropriate k content in soil enhanced soybean leaf rubisco activity and resulted in photosynthesis increase in this study when pcpc was applied at 80 of conventional k fertilizer application level optimal tomato yield and quality was achieved but when pcpc was applied at the same level as conventional k fertilizer tomato yield and quality decreased this might be because excessive pcpc application inhibited tomato root growth iaa and ga syntheses and in turn the growth of tomato plant insufficient growth suppressed the syntheses of cat pod and sod enzymes weakened the stress resistance ability of plants under high temperature environment and had an adverse effect on fruit quality yurtseven et al 2005 found similar results that tomato yield fruit size and total soluble solid content first increased and then decreased with increase in k fertilizer application insufficient application of pcpc also had adverse effects on crop growth although the root system was enlarged with increased nutrient absorption area when soil k supply was insufficient plant k absorption was reduced tomato growth and fruit development were inhibited and tomato quality was adversely affected this result was consistent with that of kanai et al 2007 who showed that compared with control k deficiency treatment severely decreased the biomasses of all organs besford and maw 1975 found that low k level in nutrient medium limited plant nutrient assimilation and retarded plant growth flower development and fruit set pcpc applied at appropriate amount not only met the k need of plants but also promoted the syntheses of antioxidant enzymes in roots and leaves reduced lipid peroxidation and improved fruit quality in high temperature tomato growing environments therefore pcpc applied at appropriate amount can achieve the goal of reducing k fertilizer usage while maintaining tomato yield this study provides a basic reference for appropriate application of pcpc during tomato growing season previous studies demonstrated that tomato yield and fertilizer utilization efficiency decreased with reduction in irrigation amount zhang et al 2016 in this study tomato yield and kue first increased and then decreased with reduction in irrigation which is consistent with the finding of bhattacharyya et al 2018 in maize cultivation taking the results of this study and previous studies together we believe that kue may be affected by soil k supply intensity nutrient release rates of controlled release fertilizers are known to be significantly affected by environmental moisture and temperature lamont et al 1987 in this study the mean air temperature when the tomato seedlings were transplanted was 26 7 which was favorable for k release from pcpc the combined effect of soil moisture and temperature in the i100 treatments led to rapid k release from the pcpc which resulted in a rapid increase in soil available k and excessive k absorption by the plants during the early stage fig 3 in the period of maximum efficiency of nutrients k release from pcpc slowed down which caused a decrease in soil available k content and reduction in k uptake by tomato plants yang et al 2012 the i60 treatments were in a water shortage state for a long time and was slower k release from pcpc as compared with the i100 and i80 treatments which resulted in long term deficiency of soil available k and reduction of k absorption by roots the k release from pcpc in the i80 treatments was slow in the early stage and accelerated during the maximum k requirement period of tomato well matching the k absorption need of tomato meanwhile iaa and ga syntheses in the roots increased fruit yield and kue with the reduction in irrigation tomato fruit quality indexes first increased and then decreased table 2 liu et al 2019 also reported that too much water jeopardized fruit quality while appropriate irrigation amounts improved fruit quality with excessive irrigation in the i100 treatment tomato root growth was retarded and k uptake was decreased although root morphology was significantly improved in the i60 treatments the slow k release from pcpc led to low soil available k content therefore tomato quality in the i100 and i60 treatments was lower than that in the i80 treatments the above explanation also applies to leaf spad value net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance similar results were also reported by wang et al 2015a b with reduction in irrigation stomatal conductance and transpiration rate decreased which might be caused by water absorption decrease by the roots under water deficit conditions stomata closed to reduce transpiration and avoid excessive water loss similar results have been reported by zhang et al 2015 2018 compared with the single effect of pcpc application rate or irrigation level their interactive effect was more significant on tomato growth the f80i80 treatment presented the largest yield and the best fruit quality which was similar to the results of patanè et al 2011a b on tomato cabello et al 2009 on melon and du et al 2010 on maize the yield in the f80i80 treatment was 3482 7 g pot 1 in 2018 and 3483 5 g pot 1 in 2019 5 3 28 6 higher than those in the other treatments the lycopene vc soluble sugar and soluble solids in the f80i80 treatment were 2 3 35 4 7 2 53 2 1 0 37 5 and 2 5 19 7 respectively higher than those in the other treatments meanwhile the f80i80 treatment had higher kue and wue this demonstrated that suitable soil water conditions allowed pcpc to release k according to tomato need which increased kue and wue while avoiding excessive accumulation of k in the soil and the resulting salt stress yang et al 2012 the appropriate growth environment and sufficient nutrient supply improved iaa and ga contents in tomato roots and leaves and promoted the growth of tomato plants and development of fruits at the same time favorable conditions promoted the increase of leaf rubisco activity improved the net photosynthetic rate and increased nutrient accumulation wang et al 2015a b in addition the suitable growth environment increased antioxidant enzyme activities in the tomato plants enhanced stress resistance capacity of the tomato plants in high temperature environments and reduced lipid peroxidation 5 conclusions the interaction between irrigation level and pcpc application rate was investigated with pot experiments to help to improve greenhouse production of tomato the f80i80 treatment where the soil was so irrigated that after irrigation soil water content was 72 80 and where the amount of pcpc applied was 80 of the amount of conventional fertilizers applied presented the optimal leaf physiology indexes endogenous hormone contents and antioxidant enzyme activities and the minimal lipid peroxidation during tomato growth and achieved the highest tomato yield and quality the results from this study can be help to develop a sustainable water and fertilizer management strategy for greenhouse tomato cultivation in china the

10623,optimizing nitrogen n fertilization is an integral component of maximizing crop yields while minimizing environmental harm aerated irrigation ai significantly improves the soil permeability and water productivity and is increasing in popularity however little information is available on the effects of ai on soil characteristics crop yield and n use efficiency nue the objectives of this study were to determine the effect of ai under different n fertilization rates on tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill soil environment and n dynamics and to determine the optimal n application rate for maximizing yield under ai a two year greenhouse experiment consisting of two irrigation methods ai and conventional irrigation ck and five application n rates 0 50 150 200 and 250 kg ha 1 was conducted in yangling shaanxi province china our results indicated that soil water filled pore space was lower than 60 at 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 which increased the oxygen content of the soil soil urease and catalase activities under ai at 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 also increased providing sufficient inorganic n for tomato growth use of ai increased tomato plant n uptake and translocated more n to fruit due to prolonging the periods when n accumulates quickly and of reproductive growth the n dilution curves for tomato established under ai and ck showed that ai could accumulate 5 more dry matter than ck for the same amount of n uptake the maximum tomato yield occurred with 200 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment but similar yield was observed with the 150 kg n ha 1 application rate under ai the nue with 150 kg n ha 1 was substantially higher than with 200 kg n ha 1 ai increased tomato yield and nue of this treatment by 3 9 5 4 and 3 13 2 respectively thus the n application rate could be reduced to 150 kg n ha 1 under ai without reducing tomato yield additionally the ai system is simple and easy to operate and could be widely used to improve crop yield and nue while reducing n

du et al 2018a yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 it has been reported that the nue of main crops in china reached approximately 30 which was far lower than nue of 65 reported in the united states and other developed countries thus an urgent goal for china is to maintain a high productivity level while increasing nue in order that agricultural sustainability may be preserved the amount of n

shoot growth soil respiration stomatal conductance and nutrient uptake fukao and bailey serres 2004 hans and zude 2009 guo et al 2008 thus ai has been proposed to improve soil aeration by injecting air through subsurface drip irrigation lines du et al 2018 bhattarai et al 2008 ben noah and friedman 2016 abuarab et al 2013 the main advantages of this technique are low cost and simple operation especially when irrigation and air injection are applied via the same drip lines chen et al 2011 reported that ai increased o2 concentration and soil respiration in the crop root zone by 2 4 32 6 and 42 100 respectively ityle et al 2014 indicated that ai improved bell pepper biomass and fruit yield by 16 and 18 respectively many studies also reported that ai increased both water use efficiency and yield dhungel et al 2012 shahien et al 2014 du et al 2018 however to our knowledge fewer observations have been reported on the comprehensive impacts of ai on soil physical and biological characteristics crop n uptake and nue further study is required to better understand how crop n use under ai can improve nue decrease farmers n input thereby limiting the impacts of excessive n fertilizer the objectives of the current study were to 1 determine the effect of ai under different rates of n fertilization on the physical and biological characteristics of the soil and 2 determine the effect of ai under different n fertilization rates on tomato n dynamics and 3 determine the optimal n application rate under ai to maximize crop yield and nue we hypothesized that a lower n application rate would be required under ai to obtain the same crop yield compared with the conventional irrigation method 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments using ai under

for n0 and n50 fig 2a and b for autumn tomatoes wfps under ai was 60 except the last three samplings for n150 n200 and n250 and generally 60 except the first sampling for n0 and n50 fig 2c wfps under

application rate in contrast to wfps oxygen content tended to increase with the n application rate fig 3 the average oxygen contents at 50 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 relative to 0 kg n ha 1 increased by 2 26 4 24 5 44 and 6 22 for spring tomatoes and by 2 45 5 65 7 44 and 8 45 for autumn tomatoes respectively ai increased oxygen contents by 1 88 and 3 21 for spring and autumn tomatoes respectively relative to ck 3 1 2 soil biological characteristics soil urease and catalase activities were both significantly affected by irrigation management and n application fig 4 average urease and catalase activities at 50 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 significantly increased by 23 62 and 27 91 57 62 and 91 39 69 25 and 102 56 and 66 41 and 95 23 respectively relative to the activities at 0 kg n ha 1 ai at the same n application rate significantly increased average urease and catalase activities by 7 67 and 11 87 respectively relative to ck urease activity under ck was the highest at 200 kg n ha 1 which did not differ significantly from the activity at 150 kg ha 1 under ai catalase activity under ai in spring and autumn was the highest at n application rates of 150 and 200 kg ha respectively both of

tomato fast n accumulation along with increased n fertilization rates generally exhibited an increase decrease pattern the duration was similar between the 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 treatments and was 2 4 days and 5 11 days longer than the 0 50 and 250 kg n ha 1 treatments for the spring and autumn cultivation respectively in addition the duration of fast n accumulation under ai was 1 2 and 1 6 days longer than under ck at the same n application rates for the spring and autumn seasons respectively the duration of tomato fast accumulation in the spring was lower than in the autumn due to the different cycle length 99 vs 137 days regardless of irrigation method the maximum n accumulation rate always increased with increasing n application rate in the two tomato growing seasons the average maximum n accumulation rate with 250 kg n ha 1 was 91 158 60 72 19 54 and 4 10 higher than with the 0 50 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 treatments in both growing seasons respectively at the same n application rate the maximum n application rate with ai was generally higher than with ck the time to reach maximum n accumulation rate in both tomato growing seasons was earlier with ai than with ck at the same n application rate however it was earlier with 150 kg n ha 1 than with 200 kg n ha 1 for the spring cultivation the reverse was true for autumn cultivation 3 2 2 n partition in tomato the n accumulation and partitioning for tomato are shown in table 3 for tomato vegetative and reproductive structures total n accumulation and nhi were significantly p 0 01 affected by irrigation method and n application rates tomato n accumulation showed distinct increases p 0 01 with increasing n application rates and the maximum n accumulation was generally obtained at 250 kg n ha 1 however the nhi of tomato generally showed an increase decrease trend as n application rate increased for the spring cultivation the nhi in the 150 kg n ha 1 treatment was significantly p 0 01 higher than with other n rates for the same irrigation method for the autumn cultivation the nhi at both the 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 rates were significantly p 0 01 higher than at other rates but no significant difference p 0 05 was found between the two treatments at the same n application rate the total n accumulation was about 3 and 3 and nhi was about 4 and 2 higher p 0 01 with ai than with ck in spring and autumn seasons respectively in addition the n accumulation and nhi in spring were both about 9 and 14 p 0 01 higher than in the autumn season 3 3 n dilution curves and nutrition diagnoses 3 3 1 determination of tomato critical n dilution curve the nc values which were fitted using eq 10 decreased with increasing critical shoot biomass in both growing seasons under both ai and ck table 4 the results indicated that plant n concentration had great variability at the same shoot biomass we obtained two boundary models nmax and nmin according to the maximum and minimum n concentration values on each sampling day in both growing seasons ai and ck showed similar b coefficients for the critical n dilution curves but the a values were lower with ai 3 42 and 3 51 than with ck 3 61 and 3 64 in spring and autumn seasons respectively in addition the a values for the critical n dilution curves under both ai and ck during spring cultivation were lower than during autumn cultivation 3 3 2 n nutrition index nni there were substantial differences in nni due to n rates and tomato growing seasons fig 5 the nni increased with increasing n application rates for the spring cultivation season the nni ranged from 0 73 to 1 29 fig 5a and from 0 66 to 1 21 for the autumn cultivation season fig 5b the nni values for the 150 kg n ha 1 application rate for spring tomato were close to 1 indicating that n level was appropriate the nni values at 0 and 50 kg n ha 1 were 1 indicating that these n levels were deficient the nni values were 1 for the 250 kg n ha 1 treatment indicating that n was excessive similar to the spring cultivation season the values of nni for 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 treatments were close to 1 for the autumn cultivation our results confirmed the reliability of using nni to assess the status of plant nutrition in tomato for different growing seasons 3 4 yield and n use efficiency of tomato tomato yield and all n use efficiency indices except npe were significantly affected by n rates p 0 05 and irrigation management table 5 compared with yield at the 0 kg n ha 1 application rate the average yields at 50 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 were significantly increased by 21 6 46 6 52 7 and 49 6 respectively the highest yield in both seasons occurred with 200 kg n ha 1 with ck but the 150 kg n ha 1 rate with ai obtained the same yield however the nae npfp and npe were all significantly p 0 01 decreased with increasing n application rates the mean nae npfp and npe with 150 kg n ha 1 were significantly p 0 01 increased by 18 1 28 0 and 36 7 in the spring cultivation season and increased by 16 4 27 2 and 23 6 in the autumn cultivation season compared with the 200 kg n ha 1 treatment respectively the mean nre for the 150 kg n ha 1 treatment 35 2 and 32 4 tended to be lower than for 200 kg n ha 1 42 9 and 34 4 in both seasons notably 150 kg n ha 1 resulted in relatively higher n use efficiency than 200 kg n ha 1 in both seasons furthermore the yield nae nre npfp and npe with 150 kg n ha 1 under ai was 5 4 13 2 8 8 5 4 and 4 0 in the spring cultivation season and 3 9 6 3 3 0 3 9 and 3 2 in the autumn cultivation season higher p 0 05 than those values under ck respectively 4 discussion the ability to improve n uptake is the first step to increase n use efficiency gu et al 2018 elia and conversa 2012 in the present study n accumulation was significantly p 0 01 table 3 increased with increasing n application rates in both tomato growing seasons however crop n accumulation was co regulated with shoot growth lemaire et al 2007 our present findings showed that n application rates of 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 in tomato had longer n accumulation duration and delayed starting time of the fast n accumulation phase compared with other n application rates table 2 ai also prolonged the fast n accumulation phase under application rates of 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 but entered the fast n accumulation phase earlier than ck therefore ai resulted in a quick build up of optimal canopy for capturing light and water resources and maintained the n supply for plant growth during the reproductive stage this resulted in an increase in n accumulation and translocation to the fruit dong et al 2017 du et al 2016 thus nhi at 150 kg n ha 1 was significantly higher than with other n rates during the spring cultivation season especially under ai during the autumn cultivation season nhi with 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 were both significantly higher than with other n application rates but no significant differences were found between the two rates table 3 this phenomenon may account for why wfps at 150 and 200 kg ha 1 was 60 fig 2 which maintained better soil aeration and thus greatly reduced the toxicity of hypoxia in the crop root zone ityle et al 2014 ai further intensified this benefit urease activity under ck was the highest at 200 kg n ha 1 similar to the activity at 150 kg n ha 1 under ai fig 4 the increase in urease activity under this better treatment favored urease hydrolysis and increased the conversion capacity of soil n nutrients providing sufficient inorganic n for tomato growth du et al 2018a the increase in catalase activity under ai protected the tomato plants from poison and thus provided a good environment for tomato growth and n accumulation fig 4 we propose that the improvement in soil physical and biological environment under ai promote tomato absorbing adequate n to maintain stable reproductive growth thereby achieving optimum yield the nc dilution curves for both tomato growing seasons showed that the a values with ai 3 42 and 3 51 were generally lower than with ck 3 61 and 3 64 in the spring and autumn cultivation seasons respectively table 4 these relationships showed that with ai about 5 more dry matter was accumulated than with ck for the same amount of n uptake this increase might be due to improved air permeability and biological environment in the soil with ai which promoted the absorption and utilization of water and fertilizer figs 2 4 in addition with ai the a value in spring was lower than that in autumn the higher temperature in spring promoted n uptake and dry matter accumulation and likely accounts for this phenomenon however the a values in our present study were lower than the а values of 4 53 found by tei et al 2002 and 4 35 reported by wang et al 2013 for tomato this indicates that ai in the present study accumulated 20 more dry matter than the conventional drip irrigation system used by tei et al 2002 and wang et al 2013 under the same amount of n uptake therefore ai appears to be an effective management measure to improve n fertilizer uptake and utilization as previously suggested by du et al 2018a and zhang et al 2018 the ai irrigation method and increasing n fertilizer application rate had a positive effect on tomato yield table 5 tomato yield under ck increased by 21 6 52 7 as n application rates increased and the maximum yields of 109 01 and 99 83 t ha 1 were obtained in the spring and autumn cultivation seasons at 200 kg n ha 1 ai increased tomato yield at this n application rate by 3 7 and 3 3 in the two cultivation seasons respectively however the n application rate of 150 kg n ha 1 with ai could maintain the same yield as obtained with 200 kg n ha 1 under ck this showed that the n application used by local farmers for tomato 250 kg n ha 1 could be reduced by 40 under ai without any loss in tomato yield the excessive n application not only resulted in adverse effects on crop growth e g increasing vegetative development thus delaying crop maturity table 3 but also resulted in excessive n accumulation in the soil much of which could be lost from the plant soil system via leaching and denitrification gu et al 2013 nayak et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 thus the n use efficiency always decreased as the n application rates increased yang et al 2017 this was consistent with the results of our present study table 5 under the optimum n application rates of 150 kg n ha 1 for tomato the nue under ai further significantly p 0 05 increased by 3 13 2 this indicated that optimizing n application rate along with ai further promoted crop yield and nue managing nitrogen use and improving nue of crops for sustainable development is a global challenge when singandhupe et al 2003 used drip irrigation and n application in ten equal splits instead of furrow irrigation with n applied in two equal splits the values of nae nre npfp and npe increased to 150 kg kg 1 48 290 kg kg 1 and 300 kg kg 1 respectively li et al 2001 conducted an experiment involving different fertilizer rates in shouguang and reported that the values of nre and nprp increased from 2 6 and 48 3 kg kg 1 under conventional measures to 10 6 and 221 kg kg 1 under recommend practices li et al 2017 undertook an experiment where tomato was grown with negative pressure irrigation and was able to achieve nre and npfp values of 2 7 and 260 kg kg 1 in all of these experiments increases in nue have been achieved through improvements in fertilizer and irrigation management usually involving optimization of n application rate and selecting appropriate irrigation methods in addition based on the co limitation principles irrigation is critical to capturing the benefits of n supply sadras 2005 therefore the results of our current experiment in yangling reflect best practices for tomato production with values of nae nre npfp and npe reaching 237 4 201 5 kg kg 1 36 7 32 8 702 9 660 3 kg kg 1 and 647 2 613 8 kg kg 1 in spring autumn seasons respectively furthermore the optimum n application rate in our study was smaller than reported in other studies except compared with singandhupe et al 2003 but the nue was generally higher than reported in most other studies table 6 this is the great effect of ai which improves the soil environment and promotes fertilizer absorption however the nue for tomato production found in our study even with recommended practices of ai and optimum n application rate is still lower than that achieved in other countries of the world table 6 for example the values of nre for tomato production were 48 55 and 60 reported for india singandhupe et al 2003 italy farnesell et al 2015 and egypt badr and el yazied 2007 respectively our results therefore demonstrated that potential exists to further improve nue in china although our experiments were carried out in the greenhouse the results and benefits should be applicable to field production as well as long as subsurface drip irrigation is used along with an air injector installed in line immediately following the water source furthermore ai has been widely used in field crops such as potato pineapple ananas comosus l merr cotton and corn zea mays l pendergast et al 2013 abuarab et al 2013 chen et al 2011 shahien et al 2014 thus ai could make a great contribution to agricultural production by improving crop nue while reducing environmental pollution due to excessive n applications and simultaneously resulting in economic benefits 5 conclusions 1 ai decreased wfps but increased soil oxygen content and urease and catalase activities 2 ai significantly increased crop n accumulation and its translocation to fruit through increasing the fast n accumulation phase and promoting reproductive growth 3 ai along with reduced n application rate significantly p 0 05 increased crop yield and nue while reducing the probability of the environmental pollution by excessive n application compared with ck declaration of

10623,optimizing nitrogen n fertilization is an integral component of maximizing crop yields while minimizing environmental harm aerated irrigation ai significantly improves the soil permeability and water productivity and is increasing in popularity however little information is available on the effects of ai on soil characteristics crop yield and n use efficiency nue the objectives of this study were to determine the effect of ai under different n fertilization rates on tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill soil environment and n dynamics and to determine the optimal n application rate for maximizing yield under ai a two year greenhouse experiment consisting of two irrigation methods ai and conventional irrigation ck and five application n rates 0 50 150 200 and 250 kg ha 1 was conducted in yangling shaanxi province china our results indicated that soil water filled pore space was lower than 60 at 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 which increased the oxygen content of the soil soil urease and catalase activities under ai at 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 also increased providing sufficient inorganic n for tomato growth use of ai increased tomato plant n uptake and translocated more n to fruit due to prolonging the periods when n accumulates quickly and of reproductive growth the n dilution curves for tomato established under ai and ck showed that ai could accumulate 5 more dry matter than ck for the same amount of n uptake the maximum tomato yield occurred with 200 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment but similar yield was observed with the 150 kg n ha 1 application rate under ai the nue with 150 kg n ha 1 was substantially higher than with 200 kg n ha 1 ai increased tomato yield and nue of this treatment by 3 9 5 4 and 3 13 2 respectively thus the n application rate could be reduced to 150 kg n ha 1 under ai without reducing tomato yield additionally the ai system is simple and easy to operate and could be widely used to improve crop yield and nue while reducing n application rate these results have important implications for the development of management strategies to maintain yield while reducing environment risks keywords aerated irrigation tomato enzyme activity soil oxygen n dilution curve 1 introduction nitrogen n is a vital nutrient and affects plant growth as well as quality and quantity of produce gu et al 2017 the total consumption of synthetic n fertilizer in china has increased from 9 3 million t in 1980 to 24 0 million t in 2012 but this 158 increase in n use increased total crop production by only about 70 from 320 6 million to 546 5 million t li et al 2016 applications of n fertilizer exceeding plant n demands decreased nue gu et al 2017 du et al 2018a yang et al 2017 hamzei 2011 and crop yields were not significantly increased du et al 2018a yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 it has been reported that the nue of main crops in china reached approximately 30 which was far lower than nue of 65 reported in the united states and other developed countries thus an urgent goal for china is to maintain a high productivity level while increasing nue in order that agricultural sustainability may be preserved the amount of n available in the soil however was sensitive to the variations in soil environment changes in soil oxygen content would inevitably affect soil n transformation rao 2017 higher soil water content around the root zone increased the tortuosity of the air pathways thereby significantly reducing oxygen diffusion rate niu et al 2012 oxygen deficiency in the root zone can negatively affect plant root and shoot growth soil respiration stomatal conductance and nutrient uptake fukao and bailey serres 2004 hans and zude 2009 guo et al 2008 thus ai has been proposed to improve soil aeration by injecting air through subsurface drip irrigation lines du et al 2018 bhattarai et al 2008 ben noah and friedman 2016 abuarab et al 2013 the main advantages of this technique are low cost and simple operation especially when irrigation and air injection are applied via the same drip lines chen et al 2011 reported that ai increased o2 concentration and soil respiration in the crop root zone by 2 4 32 6 and 42 100 respectively ityle et al 2014 indicated that ai improved bell pepper biomass and fruit yield by 16 and 18 respectively many studies also reported that ai increased both water use efficiency and yield dhungel et al 2012 shahien et al 2014 du et al 2018 however to our knowledge fewer observations have been reported on the comprehensive impacts of ai on soil physical and biological characteristics crop n uptake and nue further study is required to better understand how crop n use under ai can improve nue decrease farmers n input thereby limiting the impacts of excessive n fertilizer the objectives of the current study were to 1 determine the effect of ai under different rates of n fertilization on the physical and biological characteristics of the soil and 2 determine the effect of ai under different n fertilization rates on tomato n dynamics and 3 determine the optimal n application rate under ai to maximize crop yield and nue we hypothesized that a lower n application rate would be required under ai to obtain the same crop yield compared with the conventional irrigation method 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments using ai under different n application rates were conducted on tomato in a solar greenhouse at yangling shaanxi province northwestern part of china 34 17 n 108 02 e 521 m above mean sea level the study area

study an automatic weather station hobo micro station and sensors onset computer company massachusetts ma usa located in the greenhouse was used to measure air temperature and solar radiation 2 2 experimental design the first crop of tomato spring seedlings furuimingxing were transplanted to the greenhouse on 29 march 2017 and harvested on 7 july 2017 the second crop autumn was transplanted on 8 august 2017 and harvested 8 january 2018 n was applied at five different levels 0 50 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 for both the ai and ck irrigation methods the n application rate of 250 kg n ha 1 is the rate currently used by the local farmers experimental plots measured 5 5 m 3 5 m treatments were replicated three times row spacing was 50 cm with 45 cm between plants within rows fertilizers

with a flow meter and control valve in each plot every seven days water was added corresponding to the seven day evaporation from an evaporation pan with diameter 20 mm air was injected into the drip lines at a rate of 12 of the volume of the irrigation water using an in line mazzei air injector model 684 mazzei injector company bakersfield california usa the air was sucked through the venturi tube of the mazzei injector following bernoulli s principles pressure differences for the inlet and outlet across the air injector were maintained at 0 35 and 0 14 mpa respectively to maintain air injection at 12 by volume of the irrigation water the injector valve was opened for the ai and closed for the ck treatments during the spring air temperature ranged from 13 3 31 3 gradually increasing over spring during the autumn cultivation period the air temperature decreased from 24 8 to 6 9 temperatures were 7 5 higher on average during the spring season fig s1 the solar radiation during both

aboveground dry matter plant samples were taken four times during the tomato growing seasons 18 april 11 may 5 june and 7 july during the spring cultivation season and 26 september 21 october 21 november and 8 january during the autumn cultivation season three plants were randomly selected from each plot on each sampling date the plants were cut at ground level to determine the aboveground biomass and then separated into stems leaves and fruits samples were dried at 105 for 30 min and then at 75 until a constant weight and dry weights of stems leaves and fruits were determined 2 3 2 nutrient uptake the plant samples were digested with an h2so4 h2o2 mixture after the samples were ground and crushed to pass a 1 mm sieve the n contents of plant samples were determined using an automated continuous flow analyzer aa3 seal norderstedt germany total plant n uptake was calculated by multiplying the dry weight of each organ 2 3 3 yield of tomato fourteen tomato plants from the center of each plot were harvested at maturity for each plant number of fruits and individual fruit weights were measured 2 3 4 soil physical and biological characteristics soil water and oxygen

space wfps was calculated by 1 w f p s w 1 r 2 65 r 100 where w is soil gravimetric water content and r is soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 in our study in addition soil urease and catalase activity were measured at maturation stage using phenol sodium hypochlorite method huang 2012 and titration method guan 1986 respectively 2 4 calculations and data analysis 2 4 1 n dynamics n accumulation in tomato

concentration required for maximum crop growth nitrogen concentration decreases with increasing plant biomass this declining trend is described by a negative power function called the dilution curve according to lemaire et al 1984 who proposed the concept of a critical nc dilution curve based on whole plant n concentration the power equation is represented by 11 n c a c w m a x b where nc is the plant critical n concentration w max is the maximum shoot biomass t ha 1 a c and b are the estimated parameters the critical nc dilution curve could be used to diagnose the plant n nutrition status and therefore to calculate the n nutrition index nni 12 n n i n t n c where nt is the measured n concentration in the aboveground biomass and nc is the critical n concentration in the aboveground biomass for the nni of tomato at each sampling date if nni 1 plant n status is considered as optimal while nni 1 indicates excess n and nni 1 indicates deficiency in plant n 2 5 statistical analysis experiment data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova using the spss 18 0 software spss inc chicago il usa the differences between treatments were determined using the least

under the same irrigation method generally decreased as n application rates increased during both growing seasons fig 2 for spring tomatoes wfps was generally 60 for n150 n200 and n250 and mostly 60 for n0 and n50 fig 2a and b for autumn tomatoes wfps under ai was 60 except the last three samplings for n150 n200 and n250 and generally 60 except the first sampling for n0 and n50 fig 2c wfps under ck was also mostly 60 for n150 n200 and n250 and generally 60 except the first and fifth samplings for n0 and n50 fig 2d wfps was 1 85 2 55 and 2 01 4 37 lower under ai than ck for the same n application rate in contrast to wfps oxygen content tended to increase with the n application rate fig 3 the average oxygen contents at 50 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 relative to 0 kg n ha 1 increased by 2 26 4 24 5 44 and 6 22 for spring tomatoes and by 2 45 5 65 7 44 and 8 45 for autumn tomatoes respectively ai increased oxygen contents by 1 88 and 3 21 for spring and autumn tomatoes respectively relative to ck 3 1 2 soil biological characteristics soil urease and catalase activities were both significantly affected by irrigation management and n application fig 4 average urease and catalase activities at 50 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 significantly increased by 23 62 and 27 91 57 62 and 91 39 69 25 and 102 56 and 66 41 and 95 23 respectively relative to the activities at 0 kg n ha 1 ai at the same n application rate significantly increased average urease and catalase activities by 7 67 and 11 87 respectively relative to ck urease activity under ck was the highest at 200 kg n ha 1 which did not differ significantly from the activity at 150 kg ha 1 under ai catalase activity under ai in spring and autumn was the highest at n application rates of 150 and 200 kg ha respectively both of which were significantly higher than the activity under ck 3 2 n accumulation and n partition 3 2 1 dynamics simulation of n accumulation in tomato the n accumulation in tomato based on logistic growth curves for days after transplanting and the determined coefficients were all significant at p 0 05 or 0 01 table 1 the eigenvalues of the n accumulation are shown in table 2 the duration of tomato fast n accumulation along with increased n fertilization rates generally exhibited an increase decrease pattern the duration was similar between the 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 treatments and was 2 4 days and 5 11 days longer than the 0 50 and 250 kg n ha 1 treatments for the spring and autumn cultivation respectively in addition the duration of fast n accumulation under ai was 1 2 and 1 6 days longer than under ck at the same n application rates for the spring and autumn seasons respectively the duration of tomato fast accumulation in the spring was lower than in the autumn due to the different cycle length 99 vs 137 days regardless of irrigation method the maximum n accumulation rate always increased with increasing n application rate in the two tomato growing seasons the average maximum n accumulation rate with 250 kg n ha 1 was 91 158 60 72 19 54 and 4 10 higher than with the 0 50 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 treatments in both growing seasons respectively at the same n application rate the maximum n application rate with ai was generally higher than with ck the time to reach maximum n accumulation rate in both tomato growing seasons was earlier with ai than with ck at the same n application rate however it was earlier with 150 kg n ha 1 than with 200 kg n ha 1 for the spring cultivation the reverse was true for autumn cultivation 3 2 2 n partition in tomato the n accumulation and partitioning for tomato are shown in table 3 for tomato vegetative and reproductive structures total n accumulation and nhi were significantly p 0 01 affected by irrigation method and n application rates tomato n accumulation showed distinct increases p 0 01 with increasing n application rates and the maximum n accumulation was generally obtained at 250 kg n ha 1 however the nhi of tomato generally showed an increase decrease trend as n application rate increased for the spring cultivation the nhi in the 150 kg n ha 1 treatment was significantly p 0 01 higher than with other n rates for the same irrigation method for the autumn cultivation the nhi at both the 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 rates were significantly p 0 01 higher than at other rates but no significant difference p 0 05 was found between the two treatments at the same n application rate the total n accumulation was about 3 and 3 and nhi was about 4 and 2 higher p 0 01 with ai than with ck in spring and autumn seasons respectively in addition the n accumulation and nhi in spring were both about 9 and 14 p 0 01 higher than in the autumn season 3 3 n dilution curves and nutrition diagnoses 3 3 1 determination of tomato critical n dilution curve the nc values which were fitted using eq 10 decreased with increasing critical shoot biomass in both growing seasons under both ai and ck table 4 the results indicated that plant n concentration had great variability at the same shoot biomass we obtained two boundary models nmax and nmin according to the maximum and minimum n concentration values on each sampling day in both growing seasons ai and ck showed similar b coefficients for the critical n dilution curves but the a values were lower with ai 3 42 and 3 51 than with ck 3 61 and 3 64 in spring and autumn seasons respectively in addition the a values for the critical n dilution curves under both ai and ck during spring cultivation were lower than during autumn cultivation 3 3 2 n nutrition index nni there were substantial differences in nni due to n rates and tomato growing seasons fig 5 the nni increased with increasing n application rates for the spring cultivation season the nni ranged from 0 73 to 1 29 fig 5a and from 0 66 to 1 21 for the autumn cultivation season fig 5b the nni values for the 150 kg n ha 1 application rate for spring tomato were close to 1 indicating that n level was appropriate the nni values at 0 and 50 kg n ha 1 were 1 indicating that these n levels were deficient the nni values were 1 for the 250 kg n ha 1 treatment indicating that n was excessive similar to the spring cultivation season the values of nni for 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 treatments were close to 1 for the autumn cultivation our results confirmed the reliability of using nni to assess the status of plant nutrition in tomato for different growing seasons 3 4 yield and n use efficiency of tomato tomato yield and all n use efficiency indices except npe were significantly affected by n rates p 0 05 and irrigation management table 5 compared with yield at the 0 kg n ha 1 application rate the average yields at 50 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 were significantly increased by 21 6 46 6 52 7 and 49 6 respectively the highest yield in both seasons occurred with 200 kg n ha 1 with ck but the 150 kg n ha 1 rate with ai obtained the same yield however the nae npfp and npe were all significantly p 0 01 decreased with increasing n application rates the mean nae npfp and npe with 150 kg n ha 1 were significantly p 0 01 increased by 18 1 28 0 and 36 7 in the spring cultivation season and increased by 16 4 27 2 and 23 6 in the autumn cultivation season compared with the 200 kg n ha 1 treatment respectively the mean nre for the 150 kg n ha 1 treatment 35 2 and 32 4 tended to be lower than for 200 kg n ha 1 42 9 and 34 4 in both seasons notably 150 kg n ha 1 resulted in relatively higher n use efficiency than 200 kg n ha 1 in both seasons furthermore the yield nae nre npfp and npe with 150 kg n ha 1 under ai was 5 4 13 2 8 8 5 4 and 4 0 in the spring cultivation season and 3 9 6 3 3 0 3 9 and 3 2 in the autumn cultivation season higher p 0 05 than those values under ck respectively 4 discussion the ability to improve n uptake is the first step to increase n use efficiency gu et al 2018 elia and conversa 2012 in the present study n accumulation was significantly p 0 01 table 3 increased with increasing n application rates in both tomato growing seasons however crop n accumulation was co regulated with shoot growth lemaire et al 2007 our present findings showed that n application rates of 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 in tomato had longer n accumulation duration and delayed starting time of the fast n accumulation phase compared with other n application rates table 2 ai also prolonged the fast n accumulation phase under application rates of 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 but entered the fast n accumulation phase earlier than ck therefore ai resulted in a quick build up of optimal canopy for capturing light and water resources and maintained the n supply for plant growth during the reproductive stage this resulted in an increase in n accumulation and translocation to the fruit dong et al 2017 du et al 2016 thus nhi at 150 kg n ha 1 was significantly higher than with other n rates during the spring cultivation season especially under ai during the autumn cultivation season nhi with 150 and 200 kg n ha 1 were both significantly higher than with other n application rates but no significant differences were found between the two rates table 3 this phenomenon may account for why wfps at 150 and 200 kg ha 1 was 60 fig 2 which maintained better soil aeration and thus greatly reduced the toxicity of hypoxia in the crop root zone ityle et al 2014 ai further intensified this benefit urease activity under ck was the highest at 200 kg n ha 1 similar to the activity at 150 kg n ha 1 under ai fig 4 the increase in urease activity under this better treatment favored urease hydrolysis and increased the conversion capacity of soil n nutrients providing sufficient inorganic n for tomato growth du et al 2018a the increase in catalase activity under ai protected the tomato plants from poison and thus provided a good environment for tomato growth and n accumulation fig 4 we propose that the improvement in soil physical and biological environment under ai promote tomato absorbing adequate n to maintain stable reproductive growth thereby achieving optimum yield the nc dilution curves for both tomato growing seasons showed that the a values with ai 3 42 and 3 51 were generally lower than with ck 3 61 and 3 64 in the spring and autumn cultivation seasons respectively table 4 these relationships showed that with ai about 5 more dry matter was accumulated than with ck for the same amount of n uptake this increase might be due to improved air permeability and biological environment in the soil with ai which promoted the absorption and utilization of water and fertilizer figs 2 4 in addition with ai the a value in spring was lower than that in autumn the higher temperature in spring promoted n uptake and dry matter accumulation and likely accounts for this phenomenon however the a values in our present study were lower than the а values of 4 53 found by tei et al 2002 and 4 35 reported by wang et al 2013 for tomato this indicates that ai in the present study accumulated 20 more dry matter than the conventional drip irrigation system used by tei et al 2002 and wang et al 2013 under the same amount of n uptake therefore ai appears to be an effective management measure to improve n fertilizer uptake and utilization as previously suggested by du et al 2018a and zhang et al 2018 the ai irrigation method and increasing n fertilizer application rate had a positive effect on tomato yield table 5 tomato yield under ck increased by 21 6 52 7 as n application rates increased and the maximum yields of 109 01 and 99 83 t ha 1 were obtained in the spring and autumn cultivation seasons at 200 kg n ha 1 ai increased tomato yield at this n application rate by 3 7 and 3 3 in the two cultivation seasons respectively however the n application rate of 150 kg n ha 1 with ai could maintain the same yield as obtained with 200 kg n ha 1 under ck this showed that the n application used by local farmers for tomato 250 kg n ha 1 could be reduced by 40 under ai without any loss in tomato yield the excessive n application not only resulted in adverse effects on crop growth e g increasing vegetative development thus delaying crop maturity table 3 but also resulted in excessive n accumulation in the soil much of which could be lost from the plant soil system via leaching and denitrification gu et al 2013 nayak et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 thus the n use efficiency always decreased as the n application rates increased yang et al 2017 this was consistent with the results of our present study table 5 under the optimum n application rates of 150 kg n ha 1 for tomato the nue under ai further significantly p 0 05 increased by 3 13 2 this indicated that optimizing n application rate along with ai further promoted crop yield and nue managing nitrogen use and improving nue of crops for sustainable development is a global challenge when singandhupe et al 2003 used drip irrigation and n application in ten equal splits instead of furrow irrigation with n applied in two equal splits the values of nae nre npfp and npe increased to 150 kg kg 1 48 290 kg kg 1 and 300 kg kg 1 respectively li et al 2001 conducted an experiment involving different fertilizer rates in shouguang and reported that the values of nre and nprp increased from 2 6 and 48 3 kg kg 1 under conventional measures to 10 6 and 221 kg kg 1 under recommend practices li et al 2017 undertook an experiment where tomato was grown with negative pressure irrigation and was able to achieve nre and npfp values of 2 7 and 260 kg kg 1 in all of these experiments increases in nue have been achieved through improvements in fertilizer and irrigation management usually involving optimization of n application rate and selecting appropriate irrigation methods in addition based on the co limitation principles irrigation is critical to capturing the benefits of n supply sadras 2005 therefore the results of our current experiment in yangling reflect best practices for tomato production with values of nae nre npfp and npe reaching 237 4 201 5 kg kg 1 36 7 32 8 702 9 660 3 kg kg 1 and 647 2 613 8 kg kg 1 in spring autumn seasons respectively furthermore the optimum n application rate in our study was smaller than reported in other studies except compared with singandhupe et al 2003 but the nue was generally higher than reported in most other studies table 6 this is the great effect of ai which improves the soil environment and promotes fertilizer absorption however the nue for tomato production found in our study even with recommended practices of ai and optimum n application rate is still lower than that achieved in other countries of the world table 6 for example the values of nre for tomato production were 48 55 and 60 reported for india singandhupe et al 2003 italy farnesell et al 2015 and egypt badr and el yazied 2007 respectively our results therefore demonstrated that potential exists to further improve nue in china although our experiments were carried out in the greenhouse the results and benefits should be applicable to field production as well as long as subsurface drip irrigation is used along with an air injector installed in line immediately following the water source furthermore ai has been widely used in field crops such as potato pineapple ananas comosus l merr cotton and corn zea mays l pendergast et al 2013 abuarab et al 2013 chen et al 2011 shahien et al 2014 thus ai could make a great contribution to agricultural production by improving crop nue while reducing environmental pollution due to excessive n applications and simultaneously resulting in economic benefits 5 conclusions 1 ai decreased wfps but increased soil oxygen content and urease and catalase activities 2 ai significantly increased crop n accumulation and its translocation to fruit through increasing the fast n accumulation phase and promoting reproductive growth 3 ai along with reduced n application rate significantly p 0 05 increased crop yield and nue while reducing the probability of the environmental pollution by excessive n application compared with ck declaration of

10624,zeolite z has been widely used for improving rice production but there is a lack of information on how nitrogen n accumulation and translocation affect yield performance of paddy field in the alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd amended with zeolite in this study a 2 year field experiment with installed lysimeters was carried out to determine the influence of z application 0 5 and 10 t z ha 1 on rice yield tiller number leaf area index lai dry matter accumulation and translocation dma and dmt n accumulation and translocation na and nt inorganic n content in soil under two irrigation regimes cf continuously flooded irrigation awd the results showed that awd didn t affect rice grain yield in 2016 but reduced it in 2017 without z application and rice yield was not affected by awd with the application of 10 t z ha 1 in two years relative to cf awd reduced highest and ineffective tiller number in 2016 and highest and final tiller number in 2017 as well as lai after joint booting stage relative to cf z amendment significantly increased highest and final tiller number but didn t affect ineffective tiller number and increased lai after joint booting stage the principal components analysis showed that grain yield was more significantly correlated with the panicles per m2 nt and aboveground dma and na after panicle initiation stage as compared to cf awd significantly reduced aboveground dma after panicle initiation stage aboveground na after joint booting stage in both years and nt in 2016 but not in 2017 z amendment significantly improved aboveground dma and na after tillering stage as well as nt and panicles per m2 in addition awd with z amendment significantly improved inorganic n content in soil keywords alternate wetting and drying irrigation dry matter accumulation nitrogen accumulation and translocation soil inorganic n zeolite 1 introduction rice is known as one of the most important food crops in the world and the annual demand for rice has exceeded 50 kg per capita fao 2016 china is the largest country in rice production and consumption more than 60 of the population live on rice and rice cultivation area accounts for about 1 3 of the total food crop growing area in recent years the demand for rice grains has grown rapidly with increasing population in china wang 2015 however due to ever shrinking cropping area it is critical to improve rice grain yield per unit area in order to meet the increasing demand for rice grains shen et al 2013 fao 2016 rice production consumes the largest amount of water in the world bouman et al 2007 water usage for irrigating paddy field accounts for nearly 50 of total freshwater resources in china cai and chen 2000 moreover the problem of water shortage in china is becoming more and more serious and the water resource per capita is currently less than 1 4 of the world average level li 2006 the shortage of freshwater resources is seriously threatening rice production in china international water management institute iwma 2000 du et al 2010 therefore to solve the problem of fresh water shortage and reduce water usage by paddy fields several water saving irrigation technologies have been implemented such as alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd tuong et al 2005 ye et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015 carrijo et al 2017 non flooded mulching cultivation zhang et al 2009a 2009b and controlled irrigation peng et al 2015 among these technologies the most widely used was awd as compared to conventional continuous flooding irrigation cf awd could reduce water consumption by 15 30 and improved the aeration of paddy field while meeting the physiological requirements of plant growth for water cabangon et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 however the awd practice has been reported to give inconsistent results lower bouman and tuong 2001 similar chapagain and yamaji 2010 or higher rice grain yield zhang et al 2009a 2009b lampayan et al 2015 as compared to cf it is believed that rice grain yield is determined by agronomic traits on the other hand evidences are now mounting that grain yield could be derived from dry matter dm and n accumulation post anthesis and translocation of dm and n accumulated pre anthesis wu et al 2013 mahajan and chauhan 2016 pal et al 2017 specially soil n supply plays an important role during the reproductive stage from anthesis to grain ripening zhang et al 2013 however some studies showed that water deficit was more likely to affect n migration in the soil which inhibited plant growth and development and then plant n accumulation was reduced zou et al 2007 therefore it is essential to clarify and mitigate these key processes when awd was applied clinoptilolite zeolite z has been increasingly regarded as a valuable soil conditioner that could promote n uptake and yield of crop to a certain extent z is a porous hydrated aluminosilicate mineral its molecular formula is mn 2 al2o3 xsio2 yh2o where m is an alkali metal or an alkali metal cation and n x and y represent the bonding coefficients z has intensive affinity and high cation exchange capacity for nutrients especially n and water and can retain n in plant root zone and release it upon crop demand he et al 2002 noori et al 2006 the control release characteristics of n by z amendment enhance soil n availability and plant n accumulation thereby improving grain yield malekian et al 2011 campisi et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that mixing urea with z improved n accumulation and grain yield of upland crops including soybean khan et al 2013 corn malekian et al 2011 wheat khodaei joghan et al 2012 z amendment improved tiller number lai n content in plant and soil at the maturity stage as well as grain yield of flooded paddy rice sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 wu et al 2016 chen et al 2017a in addition z could mitigate the adverse impact of water stress on plant growth because of its high water holding capacity which in turn enhanced water availability to plants under water deficit ozbahce et al 2018 najafinezhad et al 2015 hazrati et al 2017 our previous research showed that z amendment could improve rice grain yield and total n accumulation under cf but it was more efficient under water saving irrigation conditions chen et al 2017b zheng et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that z application could compensate for the negative effects of water stress on n availability from the perspective of soil n translocation and plant n accumulation during the whole rice growing season the objectives of this study were to i compare agronomic traits under different irrigation regimes and z application rates including tiller numbers leaf area index lai and grain yield components ii understand the effects of z amendment on key processes that determine rice production under two irrigation regimes by measuring dry matter yield n accumulation and translocation and the content of available inorganic n in soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site description and materials the experiment was conducted at the donggang irrigation new technology experiment station liaoning province china 39 52 48 n 123 34 48 e 8 1 m above sea level during the rice growing period of 2016 and 2017 and non weighting lysimeters were in the field to monitor leachate and nutrient loss this area is dominated by humid continental climate

at www xyfs cn was produced by a quarry in faku county of liaoning china particle sizes were 0 18 0 38 mm physicochemical properties and chemical composition of z are given in table 1 2 2 experimental design and management practices a split plot experimental design was used in both 2016 and 2017 years and there were two irrigation regimes three zeolite application rates with three replications for each treatment the main plots were two irrigation regimes cf and awd three zeolite application rates z0 0 z5 5 and z10 10 t ha 1 were used in the sub plots each plot was equipped with a non weighing lysimeter 2 55 m long 2 62 m wide 2 5 m deep under an automatic rain shelter and the area of each plot was 6 68 m2 for the cf regime the depth of standing water was kept between 10 mm and 50 mm after rice seedlings being transplanted which was continued until 15 days before harvest based on the irrigation method commonly used by local farmers while in the awd regime the shallow water of 10 30 mm was kept at the first 15 20 days after transplanting to promote seedlings to recover from that time on the standing water was allowed to subside the soil was dried until the soil water potential was dropped to 10 kpa at the 15 cm soil depth and then the plots were re flooded to the water depth of 30 40 mm this awd cycles were repeated until about 15 days before harvest the soil water potential of 10 kpa in this study was recommended by wu et al 2019 who found appropriate awd soil water potential was 10 15 kpa could ensure the rice grain yield in the same research area as our study the water level meter mywt minyi china was used to monitor the water depth at 8 00 am every day the soil moisture tensiometer institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china was used to measure soil water potential swp at 8 00 am every day as the lysimeters had closed bottoms 1 5 mm h2o day 1 was drained from each plot using a water gathering pvc poly vinyl chloride pipe placed at 2

divided in two portions 50 as basal and 50 applied at tillering period all superphosphate was applied as a basal dressing before transplanting z was applied to the standing water and incorporated into soil to about 5 cm depth with basal fertilizer with a rake z was only applied in 2016 in order to test its residual effect in the next growing season as recommended by zheng et al 2018 rice seedlings japonica rice cv gangyu 2 were cultured in the seedbed with seeds being sown on 25 april seedlings transplanted on 28 may with the hill spacing of 14 cm 30 cm and three seedlings per hill and harvested on 18 september for both years weeds were controlled manually every 10 days until grain filling period and pesticide applications followed the local farmers practices 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 water usage yield and yield components the water usage by rice was calculated with the method of chen et al 2017b at the maturity stage grain yield was measured per plot plants were manually harvested with a sickle and the rice grains were threshed with a thresher and the yield was recorded after sun drying for about one week and then being adjusted to a 14 moisture content three rice plants with normal growth were randomly selected in each plot for measuring yield components including effective panicles per m2 spikelet numbers per panicle percentage of grain filling and 1000

interaction table 2 fig 2 without z no significant differences between cf and awd occurred in 2016 and grain yield was reduced by 5 9 under awd relative to cf in 2017 at 5 t z ha 1 awd significantly reduced grain yield by 4 9 in 2016 and 11 6 in 2017 but the difference was not significant between cf and awd when 10 t z ha 1 was applied as compared to zero z application addition of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 increased panicles per m2 by 7 2 and 10 0 in 2016 and 10 9 and 15 1 in 2017 respectively but no significant differences between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 addition occurred 3 2 tiller number and leaf area index across two years the tillering dynamics showed a trend of single peak curve which significantly increased at the initial stage of tillering peaked at the end of tillering then decreased and flattened off eventually fig 3 the highest tiller number showed a significant difference between irrigation regimes and z amendment in both years final tiller number was significantly affected by z only in 2016 but by both i and z in 2017 ineffective tiller number was significantly affected by i only in 2016 table 3 compared to cf awd decreased highest tiller number by 7 2 in 2016 and 6 6 in 2017 the final tiller number by 8 5 only in 2017 and the ineffective tiller number by 14 1 only in 2016 in contrast the highest and final tiller number increased with increasing rates of z application but ineffective tiller number was not affected by z amendment the lai increased from the tillering stage peaked at the panicle initiation and then declined lai was not significantly affected by i or z at the tillering stage in both years irrigation regime significantly affected lai at the joint booting and panicle initiation stages in 2016 and at the panicle initiation and grain filling stages in 2017 z amendment significantly affected lai at all the growth stages except for tillering in both years table 3 awd decreased lai by 5 8 and 8 2 respectively at the joint booting and panicle initiation stages in 2016 and decreased lai by 8 5 and 8 0 respectively at the panicle initiation and grain filling stages in 2017 relative to cf the addition of 5 and 10 t ha 1 z increased lai at the jointing booting panicle initiation grain filling stages by 21 5 and 35 5 20 0 and 30 0 19 7 and 31 4 respectively in 2016 and 19 2 and 29 8 17 1 and 31 1 19 4 and 31 0 in 2017 respectively relative to non z control 3 3 dry matter accumulation at different rice growing stages there was no significant interaction between i and z on the aboveground dma at all the observation stages table 4 at the tillering stage both i and z didn t have a significant effect on dma at the joint booting stage awd significantly reduced dma by 9 3 in 2016 relative to cf compared to z0 z5 and z10 significantly improved the aboveground dma by 10 6 and 16 9 respectively in 2016 and 9 8 and 13 5 respectively in 2017 but there was no significant difference between z5 and z10 in 2017 at the panicle initiation stage awd slightly not significantly reduced the stem leaf and panicle dma and significantly reduced the aboveground dma by 6 8 in 2016 and 6 3 in 2017 relative to cf z amendment significantly improved the stem leaf and panicle dma but no significant difference occurred between z5 and z10 in both years as compared to z0 z5 and z10 improved the aboveground dma by 16 9 and 25 6 respectively

under awd was lower 7 9 than cf in 2017 but no significant difference in 2016 z amendment significantly improved stem leaf panicle and aboveground dma as compared to no z application the addition of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 improved the aboveground dma by 14 7 and 20 2 respectively in 2016 and 14 5 and 19 4 respectively in 2017 but no significant difference between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment occurred at the maturity stage dma of panicle and aboveground were not affected by the irrigation regime but stem leaf dma in awd was lower than cf in contrast z amendment significantly improved stem leaf panicle and aboveground dma z5 and z10 improved the aboveground dma by 13 8 and 19 5 in 2016 and 13 1 and 18 7 respectively in 2017 relative to z0 for the dmt awd improved dmt by 6 4 in 2016 but no significant difference was found between cf and awd in 2017 z amendment significantly improved dmt as compared to zero z application 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved dmt by 27 2 and no significant improvement was recorded under 5 t z ha 1 in 2016 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved the dmt by 16 5 and 29 2 respectively in 2017 3 4 n accumulation at different rice growing stages consistent with dma no significant interaction between i and z on n accumulation na occurred at all the observation stages table 5 fig 4 at the tillering stage na was not affected by both i and z at the joint booting stage as compared to cf awd significantly reduced aboveground na by 13 1 in 2016 and 12 3 in 2017 the addition of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 significantly improved aboveground na by 12 1 and 17 5 respectively in 2016 and 10 7 and 15 1 respectively in 2017 but there was no significant difference in aboveground na between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 at the panicle initiation stage awd reduced aboveground na by 9 6 in 2016 and 10 7 in 2017 relative to cf 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved na by 17 2 and 25 9 respectively in 2016 and 16 7 and 22 7 respectively in 2017 relative to 0 t z ha 1 application at the grain filling stage as compared to cf awd reduced aboveground na by 8 6 in 2016 and 5 5 in 2017 the addition of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 improved the aboveground na by 14 5 and 17 8 respectively in 2016 and 13 0 and 16 6 respectively in 2017 but not significant difference in aboveground na occurred between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 application at the maturity stage awd reduced aboveground na by 7 2 in 2016 and 5 4 in 2017 relative to cf 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved the na by 10 0 and 13 2 respectively in 2016 and 10 9 and 15 1 respectively in 2017 relative to no z application for the n translocation nt irrigation regime didn t affect the nt in 2016 but awd significantly reduced nt by 12 0 in 2017 as compared to no z treatment application of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 improved nt by 26 5 and 46 0 respectively in 2016 and 23 0 and 33 5 respectively in 2017 but no significant difference between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 addition was found in 2017 3 5 soil inorganic n content during the whole rice growing season the dynamics of nh4 n and no3 n content in soils from different treatments during the rice growing season in 2017 are shown in fig 5 nh4 n content in soil rose rapidly after basal and tillering fertilizer application and then there was a rapid decline but increased again after panicle fertilization then slightly declined until maturity no3 n content in soil was highest at the beginning and rapidly declined in 15 days then tended to stabilize and slightly increased after the end of july the nh4 n content in soil ranged from 1 50 to 9 00 mg kg 1 and no3 n content ranged from 0 30 to 2 74 mg kg 1 nh4 n and no3 n content in soil were significantly affected by z at all sampling dates and by i at most of the sampling dates averaged value of both nh4 n and no3 n content in soil were significantly affected by i and z but not their interaction table 6 the averaged value of nh4 n were 3 13 mg kg 1 and 3 46 mg kg 1 and no3 n were 0 67 mg kg 1 and 0 84 mg kg 1 respectively for cf and awd awd increased nh4 n content by 10 7 and no3 n by 25 0 relative to cf as compared to zero z application 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved nh4 n content by 27 4 and 41 5 respectively and no3 n content by 15 1 and 24 7 respectively 3 6 principal components analysis when variables of different irrigation regimes and rates of z application were analyzed in pca 90 2 of the total variability was explained by the two principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 fig 6 the first principal component pc1 represented 68 4 of the variability and accounted mainly for yield pa ht ft iet

treatments 4 discussion 4 1 influence of awd on tiller number leaf area index and rice production in agreement with the observation that awd could significantly reduce water usage rejesus et al 2011 linquist et al 2014 wang et al 2016 carrijo et al 2017 our study showed that awd reduced water usage by 11 1 12 8 however previous reports are inconsistent regarding the effects of awd on grain yield some studies showed that comparable rice grain yield could be achieved with awd systems de vries et al 2010 yao et al 2012 but other studies showed reduced grain yield under awd bouman and tuong 2001 islam et al 2018 how awd regime could consistently improve grain yield remains to be an important topic for study the analysis of principal component in the present study showed that rice grain yield was highly related with tiller number fig 6 from the perspective of rice tiller dynamics wang et al 2016 reported that in order for the water saving irrigation to achieve comparable rice production it was crucial to reduce ineffective tiller numbers and improve canopy structure the present study showed that awd significantly reduced ineffective tiller numbers and accomplished similar grain yield as compared to cf though the highest tiller number and the highest lai were also reduced in 2016 fig 2 table 3 however awd didn t affect ineffective tiller number but reduced the highest tiller number and lai after the panicle initiation stage in 2017 which may explain the reduced rice grain yield under awd fig 2 table 3 from the perspective of dry matter accumulation improved crop grain yield was mainly related to a higher crop dm post anthesis that allows remobilization of more photosynthates to the developing grains pal et al 2017 dong et al 2012 reported that the aboveground dma was not significantly affected by irrigation regimes the study of ye et al 2013 indicated that both shoot and whole plant biomass were slightly lower before grain filling but higher at maturity in awd than cf additionally gong et al 2005 found dma before the panicle initiation stage was lower under awd than cf and the opposite was true during the late stage these differences in dma at different growth stages may be attributed to different awd timing and threshold used nevertheless previous studies showed that dma at the late rice growing stage is important for similar rice grain yield under the water saving irrigation pal et al 2017 the present study also demonstrated that yield was more positively correlated with dma after the panicle initiation stage as well as dmt fig 6 in this study aboveground dma for awd was lower than cf at the panicle initiation stage but similar dma was obtained at harvest which could explain why the rice grain yield was not affected by the main effect of irrigation regime in both years in addition our study showed awd increased dmt in 2016 but slightly reduced it in 2017 not significant which was mainly related to the lower temperature at the panicle initiation stage in 2017 and thus resulted in negative effects on reproductive growth of rice this may be another reason for the lower rice grain yield under awd with no z application in 2017 4 2 influence of z amendment on tiller number leaf area index and rice production zeolite has been regarded as a valuable soil amendment to improve plant growth including tiller number lai dry matter accumulation and subsequent grain yield sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 gholamhoseini et al 2013 chen et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 in line with these studies our study showed that z amendment significantly improved tiller number and lai especially after the mid tillering stage however lim et al 2016 found z application inhibited rice tillering due to decreased availability of nh4 n due to strong retention in the soil during the early rice growing stage eventually leading to a reduction in dma at the harvest this discrepancy is likely related to soil properties fertilizer management and z application rates a superior tiller number and lai often lead to a higher remobilization of resources and enhance dma and subsequent grain yield fageria 2007 li et al 2012 therefore in the present study the yield increasing induced by z amendment could be attributed to the higher dma after the joint booting stage as effective tiller number and lai were improved on the other hand our study also revealed that z amendment significantly improved dmt which may partially contribute to the improved grain yield what is more z s cost was 28 t 1 including transportation and labor in 2016 therefore the cost of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 application was 140 ha 1 and 280 ha 1 28 t 1 5 t and 28 t 1 10 t the price of the rice is 500 t 1 5 and 10 t z ha 1 application improved total rice yield by 1 175 t ha 1 and 1 535 t ha 1 in two years so the economic income of improved rice yield was 587 5 ha 1 and 767 5 ha 1 in summary 5 and 10 t z ha 1 application could achieve 447 5 487 5 ha 1 economic benefit 4 3 influence of awd on plant n accumulation and inorganic n content in soil n accumulation during joint booting panicle initiation grain filling and maturity stages were positively correlated with grain yield fig 6 which agrees with previous studies qiao et al 2012 pal et al 2017 wang et al 2018 since n is taken up with water n accumulation would be affected by water deficit which is confirmed by other studies that showed a reduction in n accumulation under water stress conditions koutroubas et al 2004 zou et al 2007 dordas 2009 in the present study at the tillering stage n accumulation was not affected by irrigation regime as water deficit was initialed at the mid tillering stage and plants were not subjected to water stress yet after the tillering stage aboveground and stem leaf n accumulation was lower under awd than cf fortunately similar panicle n accumulation was achieved indicating that awd didn t affect n translocation from stem leaf to panicle apart from n accumulation nt was also positively correlated with rice grain yield fig 5 the reduced rice grain yield under awd without z amendment in 2017 might be also related to the decreased nt under awd which is in agreement with previous studies zhang et al 2007 qiao et al 2012 inorganic n in soil is directly absorbed and utilized by rice plants irrigation regime can influence microflora and vitality which drive the nitrification denitrification process and thus affect n availability in soil chen et al 2012 awd significantly increased the content of nh4 n and no3 n in soil during most of the rice growing stage fig 5 the increased nh4 n might be attributed to the higher n concentration in soil solution as a result of lower water storage in an awd paddy field in contrast ye et al 2013 found that awd had a lower nh4 n content due to inhibited nitrification and stronger reduction process under cf this difference occurred mostly because of the different water deficit timing and degree and re flooded water depth used the higher n concentration in soil solution and the enhanced nitrification due to aerobic condition contributed to the increase of no3 n content in soil with awd treatment our study showed that awd improved the average inorganic n content during the whole rice growing season but not in dry matter and n accumulation and translocation panicle per m2 and rice grain yield this was mainly because n in the soil could not be effectively taken up by plant under awd caused by the lower transpiration rate due to a prolonged duration of water deficit which inhibited the rice growth and hence affects negatively grain yield rejesus et al 2011 4 4 influence of z amendment on plant n accumulation and inorganic n content in soil plant n accumulation at the tillering stage was not affected by z amendment in our study fig 4 which is likely due to the fact that z retained more nh4 n in the cation exchange site when the basal fertilizer was applied lim et al 2016 after the tillering stage adsorbed n by zeolite released slowly which ensured the long term supply of n to plants and so z amendment significantly improved plant n accumulation in different tissues fig 4 in the present study n accumulation was similar between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment after the grain filling stage but n loss was reduced and inorganic n content in soil was improved with increasing rate of z addition sun et al 2019 this could be explained by the fact that more n was adsorbed by z before the panicle initiation stage 80 n fertilizer was applied but could not be fully released later due to fixation of nh4 in the crystal structure of clay minerals lim et al 2016 therefore it is important that adequate amount of z should be applied z amendment maintained a higher content of nh4 n and no3 n in soil during the entire rice growing stage and 5 and 10 t z ha 1 improved the averaged nh4 n content by 10 and no3 n content by 13 fig 5 n accumulation at the early stage of rice growing was mainly affected by n absorption ability of the plant itself nitrogen accumulation at the middle and late growth stages were mainly influenced by n supplying capability of soil and the fertilizer topdressing amount ando et al 1996 in general n application at the early stage is enough due to the lower demand for n by rice plants and even excessive for most of the paddy fields qi et al 2012 cao et al 2013 it was worth noting that n application with z was comparable to slow release fertilizers the high affinity of z for nh4 facilitated nh4 retention in the soil higher n concentration in the soil solution which buffered the excessive supply of n at the early growth stage malekian et al 2011 gholamhoseini et al 2013 our study showed that z modified soil still maintained higher n content although there was no n fertilizer added at the late stage the key is that most of the increased inorganic n in soil was available through slow release from z which met the demand of plants for n at the later growth stages these results indicate that the increase in rice grain yield by z amendment results from the prolonged release of n from soil that facilitates n accumulation and translocation and subsequent dry matter production 5 conclusion high rice grain yield depends on panicles per m2 aboveground dry matter and n accumulation after the panicle initiation stage and n translocation though alternate wetting and drying irrigation resulted in a higher inorganic n content in soil with less water usage but not in dry matter and n accumulation and translocation panicle per m2 and rice grain yield under awd as compared to cf significantly higher rice grain yield was achieved with the application of z due to prolonged supply of n in the soil which improved n accumulation and translocation especially after the panicle initiation stage and led to increased tiller number lai dry matter accumulation panicles per m2 the results from the present and previous studies confirm that the yield increasing mechanism of z is the improved n supply in the amended soil that meets the demand of rice plants for n during the entire growth period declaration of competing interest the

10624,zeolite z has been widely used for improving rice production but there is a lack of information on how nitrogen n accumulation and translocation affect yield performance of paddy field in the alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd amended with zeolite in this study a 2 year field experiment with installed lysimeters was carried out to determine the influence of z application 0 5 and 10 t z ha 1 on rice yield tiller number leaf area index lai dry matter accumulation and translocation dma and dmt n accumulation and translocation na and nt inorganic n content in soil under two irrigation regimes cf continuously flooded irrigation awd the results showed that awd didn t affect rice grain yield in 2016 but reduced it in 2017 without z application and rice yield was not affected by awd with the application of 10 t z ha 1 in two years relative to cf awd reduced highest and ineffective tiller number in 2016 and highest and final tiller number in 2017 as well as lai after joint booting stage relative to cf z amendment significantly increased highest and final tiller number but didn t affect ineffective tiller number and increased lai after joint booting stage the principal components analysis showed that grain yield was more significantly correlated with the panicles per m2 nt and aboveground dma and na after panicle initiation stage as compared to cf awd significantly reduced aboveground dma after panicle initiation stage aboveground na after joint booting stage in both years and nt in 2016 but not in 2017 z amendment significantly improved aboveground dma and na after tillering stage as well as nt and panicles per m2 in addition awd with z amendment significantly improved inorganic n content in soil keywords alternate wetting and drying irrigation dry matter accumulation nitrogen accumulation and translocation soil inorganic n zeolite 1 introduction rice is known as one of the most important food crops in the world and the annual demand for rice has exceeded 50 kg per capita fao 2016 china is the largest country in rice production and consumption more than 60 of the population live on rice and rice cultivation area accounts for about 1 3 of the total food crop growing area in recent years the demand for rice grains has grown rapidly with increasing population in china wang 2015 however due to ever shrinking cropping area it is critical to improve rice grain yield per unit area in order to meet the increasing demand for rice grains shen et al 2013 fao 2016 rice production consumes the largest amount of water in the world bouman et al 2007 water usage for irrigating paddy field accounts for nearly 50 of total freshwater resources in china cai and chen 2000 moreover the problem of water shortage in china is becoming more and more serious and the water resource per capita is currently less than 1 4 of the world average level li 2006 the shortage of freshwater resources is seriously threatening rice production in china international water management institute iwma 2000 du et al 2010 therefore to solve the problem of fresh water shortage and reduce water usage by paddy fields several water saving irrigation technologies have been implemented such as alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd tuong et al 2005 ye et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015 carrijo et al 2017 non flooded mulching cultivation zhang et al 2009a 2009b and controlled irrigation peng et al 2015 among these technologies the most widely used was awd as compared to conventional continuous flooding irrigation cf awd could reduce water consumption by 15 30 and improved the aeration of paddy field while meeting the physiological requirements of plant growth for water cabangon et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 however the awd practice has been reported to give inconsistent results lower bouman and tuong 2001 similar chapagain and yamaji 2010 or higher rice grain yield zhang et al 2009a 2009b lampayan et al 2015 as compared to cf it is believed that rice grain yield is determined by agronomic traits on the other hand evidences are now mounting that grain yield could be derived from dry matter dm and n accumulation post anthesis and translocation of dm and n accumulated pre anthesis wu et al 2013 mahajan and chauhan 2016 pal et al 2017 specially soil n supply plays an important role during the reproductive stage from anthesis to grain ripening zhang et al 2013 however some studies showed that water deficit was more likely to affect n migration in the soil which inhibited plant growth and development and then plant n accumulation was reduced zou et al 2007 therefore it is essential to clarify and mitigate these key processes when awd was applied clinoptilolite zeolite z has been increasingly regarded as a valuable soil conditioner that could promote n uptake and yield of crop to a certain extent z is a porous hydrated aluminosilicate mineral its molecular formula is mn 2 al2o3 xsio2 yh2o where m is an alkali metal or an alkali metal cation and n x and y represent the bonding coefficients z has intensive affinity and high cation exchange capacity for nutrients especially n and water and can retain n in plant root zone and release it upon crop demand he et al 2002 noori et al 2006 the control release characteristics of n by z amendment enhance soil n availability and plant n accumulation thereby improving grain yield malekian et al 2011 campisi et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that mixing urea with z improved n accumulation and grain yield of upland crops including soybean khan et al 2013 corn malekian et al 2011 wheat khodaei joghan et al 2012 z amendment improved tiller number lai n content in plant and soil at the maturity stage as well as grain yield of flooded paddy rice sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 wu et al 2016 chen et al 2017a in addition z could mitigate the adverse impact of water stress on plant growth because of its high water holding capacity which in turn enhanced water availability to plants under water deficit ozbahce et al 2018 najafinezhad et al 2015 hazrati et al 2017 our previous research showed that z amendment could improve rice grain yield and total n accumulation under cf but it was more efficient under water saving irrigation conditions chen et al 2017b zheng et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that z application could compensate for the negative effects of water stress on n availability from the perspective of soil n translocation and plant n accumulation during the whole rice growing season the objectives of this study were to i compare agronomic traits under different irrigation regimes and z application rates including tiller numbers leaf area index lai and grain yield components ii understand the effects of z amendment on key processes that determine rice production under two irrigation regimes by measuring dry matter yield n accumulation and translocation and the content of available inorganic n in soil 2 materials

design and management practices a split plot experimental design was used in both 2016 and 2017 years and there were two irrigation regimes three zeolite application rates with three replications for each treatment the main plots were two irrigation regimes cf and awd three zeolite application rates z0 0 z5 5 and z10 10 t ha 1 were used in the sub plots each plot was equipped with a non weighing lysimeter 2 55 m long 2 62 m wide 2 5 m deep under an automatic rain shelter and the area of each plot was 6 68 m2 for the cf regime the depth of standing water was kept between 10 mm and 50 mm after rice seedlings being transplanted which was continued until 15 days before harvest based on the irrigation method commonly used by local farmers while in the awd regime the shallow water of 10 30 mm was kept at the first 15 20 days after transplanting to promote seedlings to recover from that time on the standing water was allowed to subside the soil was dried until the soil water potential was dropped to 10 kpa at the 15 cm soil depth and then the plots were re flooded to the water depth of 30 40 mm this awd cycles were repeated until about 15 days before harvest the soil water potential of 10 kpa in this study was recommended by wu et al 2019 who found appropriate awd soil water potential was 10 15 kpa could ensure the rice grain yield in the same research area as our study the water level meter mywt minyi china was used to monitor the water depth at 8 00 am every day the soil moisture tensiometer institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china was used to

divided in two portions 50 as basal and 50 applied at tillering period all superphosphate was applied as a basal dressing before transplanting z was applied to the standing water and incorporated into soil to about 5 cm depth with basal fertilizer with a rake z was only applied in 2016 in order to test its residual effect in the next growing season as recommended by zheng et al 2018 rice seedlings japonica rice cv gangyu 2 were cultured in the seedbed with seeds being sown on 25 april seedlings transplanted on 28 may with the hill spacing of 14 cm 30 cm and three seedlings per hill and harvested on 18 september for both years weeds were controlled manually every 10 days until grain filling period and pesticide applications followed the local farmers practices 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 water usage yield and yield components the water usage by rice was calculated with the method of chen et al 2017b at the maturity stage grain yield was measured per plot plants were manually harvested with a sickle and the rice grains were threshed with a thresher and the yield was recorded after sun drying for about one week and then being adjusted to a 14 moisture content three

interaction table 2 fig 2 without z no significant differences between cf and awd occurred in 2016 and grain yield was reduced by 5 9 under awd relative to cf in 2017 at 5 t z ha 1 awd significantly reduced grain yield by 4 9 in 2016 and 11 6 in 2017 but the difference was not significant between cf and awd when 10 t z ha 1 was applied as compared to zero z application addition of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 increased panicles per m2 by 7 2 and 10 0 in 2016 and 10 9 and 15 1 in 2017 respectively but no significant differences between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 addition occurred 3 2 tiller number and leaf area index across two years the tillering dynamics showed a trend of single peak curve which significantly increased at the initial stage of tillering peaked at the end of tillering then decreased and flattened off eventually fig 3 the highest tiller number showed a significant difference between irrigation regimes and z amendment in both years final tiller number was significantly affected by z only in 2016 but by both i and z in 2017 ineffective tiller number was significantly affected by i only in 2016 table 3 compared to cf awd decreased highest tiller number by 7 2 in 2016 and 6 6 in 2017 the final tiller number by 8 5 only in 2017 and the ineffective tiller number by 14 1 only in 2016 in contrast the highest and final tiller number increased with increasing rates of z application but ineffective tiller number was not affected by z amendment the lai increased from the tillering stage peaked at the panicle initiation and then declined lai was not significantly affected by i or z at the tillering stage in both years irrigation regime significantly affected lai at the joint booting and panicle initiation stages in 2016 and at the panicle initiation and grain filling stages in

improved the aboveground dma by 10 6 and 16 9 respectively in 2016 and 9 8 and 13 5 respectively in 2017 but there was no significant difference between z5 and z10 in 2017 at the panicle initiation stage awd slightly not significantly reduced the stem leaf and panicle dma and significantly reduced the aboveground dma by 6 8 in 2016 and 6 3 in 2017 relative to cf z amendment significantly improved the stem leaf and panicle dma but no significant difference occurred between z5 and z10 in both years as compared to z0 z5 and z10 improved the aboveground dma by 16 9 and 25 6 respectively in 2016 and 15 7 and 24 3 respectively in 2017 at the grain filling stage panicle dma was not affected by i but awd significantly reduced stem leaf dma in both years additionally the aboveground dma

and 10 t z ha 1 improved the aboveground dma by 14 7 and 20 2 respectively in 2016 and 14 5 and 19 4 respectively in 2017 but no significant difference between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment occurred at the maturity stage dma of panicle and aboveground were not affected by the irrigation regime but stem leaf dma in awd was lower than cf in contrast z amendment significantly improved stem leaf panicle and aboveground dma z5 and z10 improved the aboveground dma by 13 8 and 19 5 in 2016 and 13 1 and 18 7 respectively in 2017 relative to z0 for the dmt awd improved dmt by 6 4 in 2016 but no significant difference was found between cf and awd in 2017 z amendment significantly improved dmt as compared to zero z application 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved dmt by 27 2 and no significant improvement was recorded under 5 t z ha 1 in 2016 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved the dmt by 16 5 and 29 2 respectively in 2017 3 4 n accumulation at different rice growing stages consistent with dma no significant interaction between i and z on n accumulation na occurred at all the observation stages table 5 fig 4 at the tillering stage na was not affected by both i and z at the joint booting stage as compared to cf awd significantly reduced aboveground na by 13 1 in 2016 and 12 3 in 2017 the addition of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 significantly improved aboveground na by 12 1 and 17 5 respectively in 2016 and 10 7 and 15 1 respectively in 2017 but there was no significant difference in aboveground na between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 at the panicle initiation stage awd reduced aboveground na by 9 6 in 2016 and 10 7 in 2017 relative to cf 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved na by 17 2 and 25 9 respectively in 2016 and 16 7 and 22 7 respectively in 2017 relative to 0 t z ha 1 application at the

nt irrigation regime didn t affect the nt in 2016 but awd significantly reduced nt by 12 0 in 2017 as compared to no z treatment application of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 improved nt by 26 5 and 46 0 respectively in 2016 and 23 0 and 33 5 respectively in 2017 but no significant difference between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 addition was found in 2017 3 5 soil inorganic n content during the whole rice growing season the dynamics of nh4 n and no3 n content in soils from different treatments during the rice growing season in 2017 are shown in fig 5 nh4 n content in soil rose rapidly after basal and tillering fertilizer application and then there was a rapid decline but increased again after panicle fertilization then slightly declined until maturity no3 n content in soil was highest at the beginning and rapidly declined in 15 days then tended to stabilize and slightly increased after the end of july the nh4 n content in soil ranged from 1 50 to 9 00 mg kg 1 and no3 n content ranged from 0 30 to 2 74 mg kg 1 nh4 n and no3 n content in soil were significantly affected by z at all sampling dates and by i at most of the sampling dates averaged value of both nh4 n and no3 n content in soil were significantly affected by i and z but not their interaction table 6 the averaged value of nh4 n were 3 13 mg kg 1 and 3 46 mg kg 1 and no3 n were 0 67 mg kg 1 and 0 84 mg kg 1 respectively for cf and awd awd increased nh4 n content by 10 7 and no3 n by 25 0 relative to cf as compared to zero z application 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment improved nh4 n content by 27 4 and 41 5 respectively and no3 n content by 15 1 and 24 7 respectively 3 6 principal components analysis when variables of different irrigation regimes and rates of z application were analyzed in pca 90 2 of the total variability was explained by the two principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 fig 6 the first principal component pc1 represented 68 4 of the variability and accounted mainly for yield pa ht ft iet td jd pd gd md dmt jn pn gn mn mt and ave nh4 indicating that these variables had a greater response to changes in irrigation regimes and z application rates pc2 represented 21 8 of the variability derived from pf tw tn and ave no3 indicating that these variables had a lesser response to changes in irrigation regimes and z rates yield was associated with dmt jd jn ave nh4 and tiller number especially pa nt dma and na after panicle initiation stage t amendment of z z5 and z10 were more biased towards the positive x axis and y axis direction than control z0 indicating that z has a positive effect on yield panicles per m2 dma dmt na nt tiller number and nh4 n in soil iawdz10 icfz10 iawdz5 were more influential to yield and the variables that are related to yield in all the treatments 4 discussion 4 1 influence of awd on tiller number leaf area index and rice production in agreement with the observation that awd could significantly reduce water usage rejesus et al 2011 linquist et al 2014 wang et al 2016 carrijo et al 2017 our study showed that awd reduced water usage by 11 1 12 8 however previous reports are inconsistent regarding the effects of awd on grain yield some studies showed that comparable rice grain yield could be achieved with awd systems de vries et al 2010 yao et al 2012 but other studies showed reduced grain yield under awd bouman and tuong 2001 islam et al 2018 how awd regime could consistently improve grain yield remains to be an important topic for study the analysis of principal component in the present study showed that rice grain yield was highly related with tiller number fig 6 from the perspective of rice tiller dynamics wang et al 2016 reported that in order for the water saving irrigation to achieve comparable rice production it was crucial to reduce ineffective tiller numbers and improve canopy structure the present study showed that awd significantly reduced ineffective tiller numbers and accomplished similar grain yield as compared to cf though the highest tiller number and the highest lai were also reduced in 2016 fig 2 table 3 however awd didn t affect ineffective tiller number but reduced the highest tiller number and lai after the panicle initiation stage in 2017 which may explain the reduced rice grain yield under awd fig 2 table 3 from the perspective of dry matter accumulation improved crop grain yield was mainly related to a higher crop dm post anthesis that allows remobilization of more photosynthates to the developing grains pal et al 2017 dong et al 2012 reported that the aboveground dma was not significantly affected by irrigation regimes the study of ye et al 2013 indicated that both shoot and whole plant biomass were slightly lower before grain filling but higher at maturity in awd than cf additionally gong et al 2005 found dma before the panicle initiation stage was lower under awd than cf and the opposite was true during the late stage these differences in dma at different growth stages may be attributed to different awd timing and threshold used nevertheless previous studies showed that dma at the late rice growing stage is important for similar rice grain yield under the water saving irrigation pal et al 2017 the present study also demonstrated that yield was more positively correlated with dma after the panicle initiation stage as well as dmt fig 6 in this study aboveground dma for awd was lower than cf at the panicle initiation stage but similar dma was obtained at harvest which could explain why the rice grain yield was not affected by the main effect of irrigation regime in both years in addition our study showed awd increased dmt in 2016 but slightly reduced it in 2017 not significant which was mainly related to the lower temperature at the panicle initiation stage in 2017 and thus resulted in negative effects on reproductive growth of rice this may be another reason for the lower rice grain yield under awd with no z application in 2017 4 2 influence of z amendment on tiller number leaf area index and rice production zeolite has been regarded as a valuable soil amendment to improve plant growth including tiller number lai dry matter accumulation and subsequent grain yield sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 gholamhoseini et al 2013 chen et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 in line with these studies our study showed that z amendment significantly improved tiller number and lai especially after the mid tillering stage however lim et al 2016 found z application inhibited rice tillering due to decreased availability of nh4 n due to strong retention in the soil during the early rice growing stage eventually leading to a reduction in dma at the harvest this discrepancy is likely related to soil properties fertilizer management and z application rates a superior tiller number and lai often lead to a higher remobilization of resources and enhance dma and subsequent grain yield fageria 2007 li et al 2012 therefore in the present study the yield increasing induced by z amendment could be attributed to the higher dma after the joint booting stage as effective tiller number and lai were improved on the other hand our study also revealed that z amendment significantly improved dmt which may partially contribute to the improved grain yield what is more z s cost was 28 t 1 including transportation and labor in 2016 therefore the cost of 5 and 10 t z ha 1 application was 140 ha 1 and 280 ha 1 28 t 1 5 t and 28 t 1 10 t the price of the rice is 500 t 1 5 and 10 t z ha 1 application improved total rice yield by 1 175 t ha 1 and 1 535 t ha 1 in two years so the economic income of improved rice yield was 587 5 ha 1 and 767 5 ha 1 in summary 5 and 10 t z ha 1 application could achieve 447 5 487 5 ha 1 economic benefit 4 3 influence of awd on plant n accumulation and inorganic n content in soil n accumulation during joint booting panicle initiation grain filling and maturity stages were positively correlated with grain yield fig 6 which agrees with previous studies qiao et al 2012 pal et al 2017 wang et al 2018 since n is taken up with water n accumulation would be affected by water deficit which is confirmed by other studies that showed a reduction in n accumulation under water stress conditions koutroubas et al 2004 zou et al 2007 dordas 2009 in the present study at the tillering stage n accumulation was not affected by irrigation regime as water deficit was initialed at the mid tillering stage and plants were not subjected to water stress yet after the tillering stage aboveground and stem leaf n accumulation was lower under awd than cf fortunately similar panicle n accumulation was achieved indicating that awd didn t affect n translocation from stem leaf to panicle apart from n accumulation nt was also positively correlated with rice grain yield fig 5 the reduced rice grain yield under awd without z amendment in 2017 might be also related to the decreased nt under awd which is in agreement with previous studies zhang et al 2007 qiao et al 2012 inorganic n in soil is directly absorbed and utilized by rice plants irrigation regime can influence microflora and vitality which drive the nitrification denitrification process and thus affect n availability in soil chen et al 2012 awd significantly increased the content of nh4 n and no3 n in soil during most of the rice growing stage fig 5 the increased nh4 n might be attributed to the higher n concentration in soil solution as a result of lower water storage in an awd paddy field in contrast ye et al 2013 found that awd had a lower nh4 n content due to inhibited nitrification and stronger reduction process under cf this difference occurred mostly because of the different water deficit timing and degree and re flooded water depth used the higher n concentration in soil solution and the enhanced nitrification due to aerobic condition contributed to the increase of no3 n content in soil with awd treatment our study showed that awd improved the average inorganic n content during the whole rice growing season but not in dry matter and n accumulation and translocation panicle per m2 and rice grain yield this was mainly because n in the soil could not be effectively taken up by plant under awd caused by the lower transpiration rate due to a prolonged duration of water deficit which inhibited the rice growth and hence affects negatively grain yield rejesus et al 2011 4 4 influence of z amendment on plant n accumulation and inorganic n content in soil plant n accumulation at the tillering stage was not affected by z amendment in our study fig 4 which is likely due to the fact that z retained more nh4 n in the cation exchange site when the basal fertilizer was applied lim et al 2016 after the tillering stage adsorbed n by zeolite released slowly which ensured the long term supply of n to plants and so z amendment significantly improved plant n accumulation in different tissues fig 4 in the present study n accumulation was similar between 5 and 10 t z ha 1 amendment after the grain filling stage but n loss was reduced and inorganic n content in soil was improved with increasing rate of z addition sun et al 2019 this could be explained by the fact that more n was adsorbed by z before the panicle initiation stage 80 n fertilizer was applied but could not be fully released later due to fixation of nh4 in the crystal structure of clay minerals lim et al 2016 therefore it is important that adequate amount of z should be applied z amendment maintained a higher content of nh4 n and no3 n in soil during the entire rice growing stage and 5 and 10 t z ha 1 improved the averaged nh4 n content by 10 and no3 n content by 13 fig 5 n accumulation at the early stage of rice growing was mainly affected by n absorption ability of the plant itself nitrogen accumulation at the middle and late growth stages were mainly influenced by n supplying capability of soil and the fertilizer topdressing amount ando et al 1996 in general n application at the early stage is enough due to the lower demand for n by rice plants and even excessive for most of the paddy fields qi et al 2012 cao et al 2013 it was worth noting that n application with z was comparable to slow release fertilizers the high affinity of z for nh4 facilitated nh4 retention in the soil higher n concentration in the soil solution which buffered the excessive supply of n at the early growth stage malekian et al 2011 gholamhoseini et al 2013 our study showed that z modified soil still maintained higher n content although there was no n fertilizer added at the late stage the key is that most of the increased inorganic n in soil was available through slow release from z which met the demand of plants for n at the later growth stages these results indicate that the increase in rice grain yield by z amendment results from the prolonged release of n from soil that facilitates n accumulation and translocation and subsequent dry matter production 5 conclusion high rice grain yield depends on panicles per m2 aboveground dry matter and n accumulation after the panicle initiation stage and n translocation though alternate wetting and drying irrigation resulted in a higher inorganic n content in soil with less water usage but not in dry matter and n accumulation and translocation panicle per m2 and rice grain yield under awd as compared to cf significantly higher rice grain yield was achieved with the application of z due to prolonged supply of n in the soil which improved n accumulation and translocation especially after the panicle initiation stage and led to increased tiller number lai dry matter accumulation panicles per m2 the results from the present and previous studies confirm that the yield increasing mechanism of z is the improved n supply in the amended soil that meets the demand of rice plants for n during the entire growth period declaration of competing interest the
