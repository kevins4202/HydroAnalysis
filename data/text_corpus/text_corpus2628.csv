13140,the implementation of membrane distillation in the recovery of textile wastewater can minimize waste production to an industry segment that is a significant consumer of fresh water and one of the biggest polluters this study investigated the influence of the dye s concentration in the performance of the direct contact membrane distillation process with a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane and synthetic solutions of reactive and disperse black dyes results demonstrated a decrease in the permeate flux as the dye concentration increased with the influence of the dye class at the highest concentration tested 3000 mg l 1 and compared to water there was a reduction more accentuated for the disperse dye 41 4 j 15 13 kg h 1 m 2 in 0 mg l 1 and jf 5 09 kg h 1 m 2 than for reactive dye 35 3 j 15 13 kg h 1 m 2 in 0 mg l 1 and jf 9 50 kg h 1 m 2 on the other hand color rejection results were above 98 with both dyes even in high concentrations the fouling factor was calculated and the disperse dye presented higher values when compared to the same concentrations in reactive dye solutions indicating that the physicochemical characteristics of the dyes influence the process dye deposition on the membrane surface was tested using sem edx contact angle thickness and ftir analysis the results indicated that the reactive dye confirmed less fouling than disperse black the membrane presented good resistance to solutions with high concentrations based on these results the process is viable and highly efficient for the production of recovered water indicating the feasibility for continuously updated cleaner production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ptfe disperse dye reactive dye textile wastewater rejection 1 introduction the use of treated wastewater to reduce the consumption of clean water and minimize the effluent generated emerges as a solution due to the limited water resources various industries especially in the dye cosmetics foods textile cellulose and chemical consume large amounts of water and consequently generate effluents highly contaminated 1 the textile industry generates significant amounts of wastewater consisting of a complex mixture of dyes salts surfactants and other additives becoming treatment difficult and impairing the direct release into the water system 2 statistics show that textile companies need approximately 300 tons of water to produce 1 ton of textile materials 3 due to the intense textile activity in brazil and other countries there must be a constant update of the national policy and development of studies aiming to reduce the environmental impact generated by this sector in this manner the recovery of textile wastewaters helps to reduce the negative environmental impacts becoming a cleaner and more economical operation thus there is regulatory interest in increasing cleaner technologies to reuse this wastewater 4 physical chemical and biological treatment techniques as well as integrated systems have been introduced to treat wastewater to meet discharge requirements or enable water reuse 5 6 typically synthetic dyes from textile wastewater can be removed by physical and chemical methods in industries however these methods have limitations due to their higher cost less versatility limited efficiency interference with other wastewater components and waste management 7 8 therefore the researchers investigated new and more efficient wastewater treatment methods to maintain the quality of textile wastewater before it is released into the environment 9 among these various wastewater treatment techniques the membrane distillation md process has become attractive due to the potential benefits associated with this technology the three main advantages of md over other desalination processes are the high rejection of dissolved ions low applied pressure and low operating temperatures 10 11 as a result several studies have been carried out analyzing the cost of md versus traditional technologies including other thermal processes 2 12 however evaluating the md suitability for textile wastewater treatment is relatively new despite its widely used process in desalination and its promising technology 13 14 membrane distillation is a thermal separation process driven by the vapor pressure gradient across a highly porous hydrophobic membrane the vapor pressure gradient is the driving force of mass transfer resulting from the temperature difference between the hot side and membrane cold 8 among the four basic configurations direct contact membranes distillation dcmd has received more attention because it does not require an external condenser and is more suitable for water based applications 15 17 in addition it is the simplest configuration and can produce high flux with the proper operating conditions 18 md is considered a promising technology for the textile industry as no additional heating is not required due to the high effluent temperature of the textile effluent making the process energy efficient 3 19 22 in this sense the textile industry which generates a large of hot wastewater has a great potential for studies that help consolidate this technology aiming at environmental and sustainability assessment furthermore it is also worth mentioning that the efficiency of this treatment with the recovery of textile effluents can allow the generation of reused water and dye recovery for industrial reuse 23 25 because of this it is necessary to evaluate the influence of dye concentration in textile wastewater and its interaction with the membrane it is essential to understand the behavior of the process concerning dyes and auxiliary products of a dyeing bath different dye concentrations are present in dyeing bath or treatment stages and this factor is also little explored concerning the performance of the membrane distillation process 26 the literature cites dye concentrations in effluents ranging from 50 to 7000 mg l 1 being more common values less than 1000 mg l 1 27 however it is important to notice that the effluent concentration discharge varies from one textile industry to another the higher values are found in the dyeing machine discharge and the minor values are common in the equalization tank the components of the feed solution can directly influence the performance of the md as they modify essential membrane characteristics to the process literature studies treating highly saline water have shown that the permeate flux decreases with increasing feed concentration 28 29 the driving force reduction can explain this phenomenon due to the decrease in vapor pressure of the feed solution and the exponential increase in the viscosity of the feed with increased concentration it can also be attributed to fouling since the solutes are more likely to deposit on the membrane surface when the concentration is higher promoting penetration of the molecules of these elements in the membrane s pores research concerning the influence of solute concentration have been described in the literature for fruit juices 30 32 or salts 33 36 concerning textile dyes chong et al 37 studied this variation using reactive blue dye at low concentrations 20 25 30 and 35 mg l 1 in dcmd they reported the drop in permeate flux and color rejection versus increased concentration according to the authors this fact can be attributed to fouling since solutes are more likely to deposit on the surface of the membrane when the concentration is higher promoting penetration of molecules of these elements in the membrane s pores towards the permeate side criscuoli et al 38 also studied the dyes concentration in the feed solution in the vmd process they observed a decline in the permeate flux which was greater at higher concentrations such as 500 mg l 1 when compared to 25 mg l 1 these studies show that there is still a significant gap in this parameter study applied to the recovery of textile wastewater by the dcmd process once only lower concentrations were studied besides most academic publications have focused on evaluating the effects of operating conditions 14 20 39 40 therefore identifying the effect of the influence of the variation of dyes on the flux performance is extremely important consequently the study of this parameter would present the feasibility or not of using this technology it is worth mentioning that the disperse black dye has not been the subject of studies applied to md for waste treatment except for publications from the research group 8 14 20 25 41 45 disperse dyes are typically used for polyester dyeing and are also substantive to acrylics triacetates and other synthetic fibers for sublimation transfer printing this study provides knowledge to evaluate if membrane distillation could be implemented at the dyeing bath discharge in the equalization tank or even after the conventional wastewater treatment once these steps have different dye concentrations in this sense identifying the effect and influence of dye variation on flux performance is extremely important as various processes and products generate different residual dye concentrations therefore in this work the main objective was to determine the influence and evaluate the effect of the variation of the dye concentration in the textile wastewater recovery by direct contact membrane distillation differences in results of variation of dye concentration of different classes were established synthetic solutions with textile dyes reactive black and disperse black were used in the dcmd process using a commercial plane ptfe membrane 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes and dyes concentration variation the dcmd experiments were conducted using the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane produced by merck millipore ltda according to the literature this type of membrane is the most commonly used with the best characteristics desired for the md process such as satisfactory water flux high resistance to wetting due to the excellent hydrophobicity of the membrane and high chemical and thermal stability 46 the membrane has a pore size of 0 22 μm a porosity of 85 a thickness of 220 μm polypropylene support and an area of 0 0041 m2 25 fig 1 shows the chemical structure intact ptfe membrane and scanning electron microscope sem image two textile dyes that are widely used in the dyeing stage of the textile industry were selected to carry out the experiments the disperse black dye widely used in the dyeing of polyester fibers has low water solubility but interacts with polymer chains through van der waals forces it is composed of a mixture of dyes whose composition was not informed by the supplier turning unfeasible the representation of it by its chemical structure 41 the reactive black dye widely used in the dyeing of cellulosic fibers is highly soluble in water has a molar mass of 991 82 g mol 1 and has a molecular structure defined by at least one chromophore group consisting of the azo bond n n which is mainly responsible for the color 8 the chemical structure of the rb dye is illustrated in fig 2 the concentrations of the dyes were selected according to the literature and based on the values found in real samples of textile wastewater in the dyeing baths of the textile industries of santa catarina state brazil the minimum concentration value of 50 mg l 1 used was defined as similar to the concentration of the synthetic bath produced and studied by 47 the maximum concentration was 3 000 mg l 1 superior to real concentration of textile dyeing wastewater collected in the industry and analyzed in the laboratory in the laboratory s dyeings a concentration of 800 mg l 1 with reactive dye and 350 mg l 1 with disperse dye was observed in the residual bath these concentrations were also reproduced in synthetic solutions which consisted of only water and reactive or disperse dye table 1 to assess the influence of these residual dyeing concentrations on dcmd 2 2 dcmd experimental unit and characterization of membranes fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the dcmd experimental setup used in this work the unit was equipped with a membrane module positioned horizontally so that the feed solution would flow through the upper compartment of the module at the same time the permeate would pass through the lower compartment an external cooling bath was used on the permeate side while a thermal resistance was used for heating the feed stream the feed and permeate rate flows have a countercurrent configuration which allows a constant temperature difference across the membrane surface water vapor from the hot stream feed is transferred through the porous hydrophobic membrane to condense on the cold permeate side the operating conditions were defined based on studies in the literature that evaluated the md applied to the recovery of textile wastewater 2 43 45 47 48 the feed flow rate was recirculated through the membrane cell at 1 5 l min 1 and 60 c while the permeate distilled water was recirculated at a permeate flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 and 20 c the initial volumes used were 2 l and 0 6 l for feed and permeate reservoirs samples were collected every 0 5 h to analyze the permeate flux and color rejection the total time for each experiment was 4 h the estimated time where the initial decline in permeate flux becomes irrelevant i e the initial fouling 45 the permeate flux j kg h 1 m 2 was measured by recording the mass of water received on the permeate side according to eq 1 m t and m t0 kg are the permeate masses at time t h and at the initial time t0 h and a m2 is the effective area of the membrane the color rejection rate provides the percentage of dye rejection achieved in the dcmd process the value can vary from 0 where the dye passes freely through the membrane to 100 where there is the complete rejection of the solute eq 2 fc and cp correspond to the concentration of the dye on the feed side and the dye on the permeate side respectively calculating cp eq 3 considers the dilution

the dye concentration in the permeate reservoir was measured using a curve based on absorbancy the absorbancy readings were done with an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer micronal ajx 900 this equipment functioned through the detection of absorbed light in the maximum wavelength wavelengths with maximum absorbance λm a x for dyes applied at the rejection rate are 599 nm for the reactive dye and 301 nm for the disperse dye membrane characterizations were performed to observe the physical structure before and after the dcmd process the methodologies used were scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir thickness and contact angle the sem was performed to evaluate the morphology of the upper surface of the membranes the samples were previously covered with gold with the jeol jsm 6390lv equipment it was impossible to observe images of the cross section of the membranes as they did not break into liquid nitrogen from the images generated by the sem the edx technique was applied to detect elements present in the surface layer of the membrane for this an energy dispersion spectrometry system with the noran system six software was used the mean pore size of the ptfe membranes was determined by analysis of sem images using imagej software in which 20 measurements were made for each image the reduction of mean pore size is related to membrane fouling and was considered here concerning the initial mean pore size informed by the supplier ftir analyses of the membranes were performed to detect the functional groups present in their structure 32 scans of each sample were conducted with the cary 600 series device agilent technologies with transmittance in the range of 650 to 4000 cm 1 and resolution of 4 cm 1 the thickness of the membranes was determined using a micrometer mitutoyo brand model mdc 25p where 20 random readings were done on the membranes used in the experiments the contact angle analyses were performed to assess the hydrophobicity of each membrane used in the dcmd process a goniometer ramé hart model 250 f1 was used accompanied by image processing software dropimage advanced and 10 random measurements of each drop were performed to obtain an average value of the surface contact angle 3 results and discussion fig 4 shows the effect of dye concentrations on the final permeate flux after 4 h as can be seen the permeate flux decays with the increase in dye concentrations due to increased dye loading retention of residues on the membrane surface partially blocks pores and induces concentration polarization generally permeate flux is strongly dependent on the chemical properties of the dye solution and its interaction with the membrane material in fact the results demonstrated a difference in the behavior of reactive and disperse dyes being the last one resulting in more decrease in permeate flux in their studies an et al 50 and khumalo et al 51 have also reported this phenomenon with synthetic dye solutions higher flux values at lower concentrations can also probably be attributed to the fact that fluid dynamics within the system can keep dye species more in suspension further away from the membrane surface leading to a reduction in fouling chong et al 37 obtained a reduction of approximately 21 in the final permeate flux when the concentration of reactive dye increased from 20 to 35 mg l 1 showing a tendency to increase the percentage of flux drop when there is an increase in solute concentration results obtained in this work corroborated this behavior even with higher concentrations than published in the literature some textile dyeing machine discharges present these higher concentrations and this work allows understand the effect of the dye concentration in industrial conditions also it was observed that the decrease of permeate flux concerning the water occurred for all concentrations and dyes this behavior agrees with desalination studies where it was observed a reduction in vapor pressure by salt addition and consequently there is a reduction of the driving force 52 resistances at feed membrane and permeate boundary layers were modified due to the presence of dye which also modifies the overall mass transfer coefficient there is a drop in water activity with the increase of feed solution concentration decreasing the vapor pressure and leading to a low transmembrane vapor flux due to the lower vapor pressure gradient across the membrane causing a decrease in permeate fluxes all over time the permeate flux decreases due to the reduction in the convective heat transfer coefficient caused by the increases in the solute concentration this behavior is already known but results demonstrated a minor effect with reactive dye compared to the disperse dye solutions for reactive dye above 100 mg l 1 the observed decrease consists of a slight change another factor that explains the flux decline is the blocking of membrane pores due to clogging caused by interactions between the membrane surface and the dye molecules reactive dyes have larger structures and a high water affinity thus forming a solution on the other hand the disperse dyes have low solubility in water generally forming dispersions thus favoring the adsorption of dye particles on the membrane surface in this case it could be observed that the decrease is higher with the disperse dye solution compared to the reactive 14 the results were compared with the agmd and vmd configurations results and showed a substantial decrease in permeate flux with increasing feed concentration in the work of baghel et al 40 which studies the determination of optimal conditions using the vacuum membrane distillation process a reduction in the permeate flux was also found with the increase of the initial dye concentration from 10 ppm to 130 ppm xu et al 28 observed the same behavior using the agmd configuration where the water flux decreased modestly with an increasing salt concentration in the feed in both cases this reduction may be due to the deposition of molecules on the membrane surface which slows down the flux of vapors through the membrane pores 4 concerning the influence of dye class it was evidenced that disperse dye presented lower fluxes than the reactive the decay ratio between dye classes table 2 was calculated by the ratio of the difference between the final fluxes with disperse and reactive dye to the final permeate flux of reactive dye results showed a progressive increase the higher the dye concentration the greater the drop in the disperse dye permeate flux concerning the reactive dye in fact it was obtained the highest decay rate with 3000 mg l 1 among all tested concentrations this result is important since this comparison is not known in the literature furthermore this result enables to understand the effect of different dyes in the water reclamation when a mixture of dyes is present like in the equalization tank of textile wastewater this behavior can be caused by the smaller particles of disperse dye deposited in the membranes pores reducing the vapor permeation the disperse dye is a dispersion when used below the ideal temperature the dcmd process is carried out at 60 c causing precipitation of the particles of the db dye on the membrane surface during the process reducing the permeate flux the disperse dyes are insoluble in water which may explain the greater precipitation of their particles in the surface layer of the membrane this corroborates that the variation in concentration of the disperse dye directly influences the performance of the md process similar behavior was observed by li et al 48 although the authors did not evaluate the behavior of disperse dye alone a decrease in the permeate flux was observed when disperse dye was present with other classes in the dcmd feed solution it was concluded that this result could be attributed to the accumulation of suspended solids disperse dyes on the membrane surface blocking the pores and causing fouling fig 5 shows the profile of permeate flux under different dye concentrations as a function of time compared with the experiment carried out only with water as expected the maximum flux value was obtained in the first 30 min the literature assumes that the flux variation with time decreases until it reaches the steady state 45 it was observed that the permeate flux decreased until stabilization at the beginning of the operational period regardless of the dye concentration the downward trend is likely caused by severe deposition of solutes on the membrane s outer surface early in the separation process leading to blockage of the surface pores 4 to further understand the effect of dye concentration on the membrane initial fouling mechanism during md operation table 3 shows the decay rate of final permeate flux concerning the initial permeate flux for water and each dye concentration of the reactive and disperse black solutions the maximum decay rate of 35 3 for the reactive dye and 49 3 for the disperse dye showing a greater drop in flux for the disperse dye this can mainly be attributed to pore blocking and concentration polarization by dye adsorption of the black disperse dye in the experiment carried out only with deionized water as the feed solution there was also a total decay of 38 of the permeate flux over time this decay may be explained by the steam filling the initially dry membrane pores until the steady state is reached this phase could be called initial fouling generating a higher permeate flux of vapor in the initial phase of the experiment until reaching stability in the md process the boundary layers established at the membrane interfaces also interfere in the formation of the vapor pressure of the solutions marrying a greater variation in heat transfer at the beginning of the experiments so the temperature variations are higher resulting in higher permeate flux variation fig 6 shows the fouling factor for the concentrations studied for the two textile dyes for the reactive dye this parameter increased from 6 8 to 37 2 with the increase of dye concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 for the disperse dye the increase was higher from 22 7 to 66 3 with the same dye concentrations this behavior can be attributed mainly to pore blockage and concentration polarization by dye adsorption as cited by an et al 49 which reported that ffs remained constant up to 40 ppm increased rapidly from 40 ppm to 100 ppm and then stabilized above 100 ppm an important fact to be observed is the scale factor when comparing the dye classes the fouling factor obtained with the db solution in all dye concentrations is higher when compared to the same concentrations in rb solutions showing that the scale factor is higher with the disperse dye this is because the disperse dyes are relatively insoluble in water which leads to greater precipitation on the membrane surface causing more fouling and thus reducing the permeate flux as already described the rejection attraction and repulsion of the dye depend on its structures and chemical interactions with the membranes explaining the difference in the behavior of each solution indicating that the dye class plays an important role in dye fouling in the dcmd process furthermore this explains the lower permeate flux and the higher decay rate for the disperse dye sem results allowed observing the high porosity of the ptfe membrane it is also noted the presence of pores in all images used in the experiments with reactive dye fig 7 a d with a more visually noticeable decrease in the concentration of 3 000 mg l 1 compared to the pristine membrane fig 1 possibly due to solute deposits on the surface of the membranes however despite such deposition on the membrane with the highest concentration high porosity is still observed indicating that this dye class has not altered the membrane structure for the disperse dye fig 7e h the decrease in membrane pores is also noticeable with the increase in the dye concentration it can be observed that there is a greater decrease in the concentration of 500 and 3 000 mg l 1 indicating that high concentrations of this class of dye influence the process visually it was observed that there are differences when compared with the results obtained with the reactive dye the mean pore size table 4 decreased with increasing dye concentration confirming scale deposition on the membrane surface the edx analysis identified the presence of the elements carbon fluorine nitrogen and oxygen for the membranes used with the rb and db dyes indicating the presence of residual components of the dyes on the surfaces of the membranes this fact can be explained by the physicochemical interactions between the structures of the compounds during md however these interactions did not affect the color rejection for these dyes in any of the studied concentrations through the ftir technique it was possible to observe that the dye particles did not alter the functional groups of the membranes the results of ftir analyses of the membranes used for the two classes of dyes are shown in fig 8 the ftir plots clearly showed the representative bands of chemical groups found on ptfe membranes the same behavioral characteristics can be observed in both spectra of membranes with a variation of dye concentration the ptfe membrane showed characteristic peaks at 1205 cm 1 1153 cm 1 and 624 cm 1 corresponding to symmetrical elongation cf asymmetrical elongation and deforming vibrations the ftir spectra of the ptfe membranes after running with the dmcd process did not show significant variations this demonstrates that the initial structure and property of the ptfe membrane were correctly preserved the scale layer made on the surface of the membranes could not modify their structures even for the disperse dye that obtained a high scale factor indicating once again the potentiality of the dcmd process for textile wastewater treatment the thickness values of the membranes as a function of the different concentrations of dye rb and db in the feed solution are shown in table 5 there was no significant variation in the results for the dye rb indicating that the membrane structures were not altered thus even with the reduction in the permeate flux observed with the dye concentration increase it is possible to consider that the deposition of dyes in the surface layer on the membrane could not modify the thickness of the membranes an increase of approximately 10 μm was observed in the membrane tested with the db compared to that used in the experiment without dye indicating that this dye has a greater deposition on the membranes than the rb dye table 5 also shows the values of the contact angle measurements between membranes and the synthetic solutions of the textile dyes there was no major change in the angle measurement compared to the different concentrations of rb dye since the angle obtained with the highest concentration corresponds to 97 of that obtained with intact membrane however the measurements showed a declining trend when the solute concentration increased this indicates that under the studied concentrations the interactions between the membrane and this class of dye did not influence the hydrophobicity of the membrane for the disperse dye a drop of up to 13 is perceived in the measure of the angle in relation to the different concentrations of dye the most considerable decrease occurs in the concentration of 3 000 mg l 1 when the angle drops to 112 this value corresponds to 88 of that obtained with the membrane intact however this result still maintains the hydrophobic character of the membrane since angles above 90 characterize this parameter this decline shows that there may be a drop in the contact angle at high concentrations of db possibly caused by fouling and at even higher concentrations this effect could cause the membrane to wet a 100 color rejection rate was obtained for the rb dye at all concentrations in the present work mokhtar et al 47 and silva et al 45 also reported high color rejection rates with dyes all above 98 for this dye class an important characteristic of the ptfe membrane is its contact angle greater than 90 due to its high hydrophobic capacity thus the high hydrophobicity of the ptfe membranes influences directly in the repulsion of the drops of the solutions on the surface of the membranes making it difficult for solutes to permeate through the pores of the membranes despite the low flux the color rejection remained high for the db dye with a rejection of 100 for the experiments with a concentration of up to 500 mg l 1 and 98 for 1 000 and 3 000 mg l 1 this shows that even with the high fouling factor and solute precipitation on the membrane surface the high hydrophobicity of the ptfe membrane maintains the repelling effect of the drops of the feed solution thus the highly efficient color rejection performance of the selected characteristic pollutant revealed that the dcmd process could serve as a promising technology for treating dye wastewater 4 conclusions in this study the influence of the dye concentration from textile fibers dyeing on the performance of the membrane distillation process was evaluated the results showed that different rb and db dye concentrations influence the permeate flux indicating that the increase in the dye concentration decreases the permeate flux the disperse dye solutions presented lower permeate flux than the reactive reaching a drop of up to 41 4 in the permeate flux such as in the concentration of 3000 mg l 1 due to greater deposition of solutes in the membrane pores which caused the phenomenon fouling thus it was demonstrated that the higher the dye concentration the lower the permeate flux but the characteristics of the dyes are directly linked to the values of flux obtained i e the physical chemical characteristics of the dyes influence the dcmd due to the interactions between the membrane and the solutions the fouling factor also showed higher values for the disperse dye solutions indicating that this dye is more prone to fouling than the reactive dye regardless of the concentration however the rejection of the membrane for solutes was greater than 98 and no wetting of the membrane was observed dye deposition on the membrane surface was tested using sem edx contact angle thickness and ftir analysis the results indicated that the ptfe membrane exhibited good resistance under continuous exposure to both dye solutions with high concentrations and the scale observed did not change the quality of the permeate only a decrease in recovered water despite the perspective of the md process applied to the textile area more studies are still needed to convince the industry to implement membrane technologies in a textile wastewater treatment plant mainly investigating the technical economic performance of the applied md process to the treatment of textile wastewater therefore technology could really be a solution for reusing textile wastewater and ensuring a cleaner less water consuming textile in the future declaration of competing interest

and waste management 7 8 therefore the researchers investigated new and more efficient wastewater treatment methods to maintain the quality of textile wastewater before it is released into the

main advantages of md over other desalination processes are the high rejection of dissolved ions low applied pressure and low operating temperatures 10 11 as a result several studies have been carried out analyzing the cost of md versus traditional technologies including other thermal processes 2 12 however evaluating the md suitability for textile wastewater treatment is relatively new despite its widely used process in desalination and its promising technology 13 14 membrane distillation is a thermal separation process driven by the vapor pressure gradient across a highly porous hydrophobic membrane the vapor pressure gradient is the driving force of mass transfer resulting from the temperature difference between the hot side and membrane cold 8 among the four basic configurations direct contact membranes distillation dcmd has received more attention because it does not require an external condenser and is more suitable for water based applications 15 17 in addition it is the simplest configuration and can produce high flux with the proper operating conditions 18 md is considered a promising technology for the textile industry as no additional heating is not required due to the high effluent temperature of the textile effluent making the process energy efficient 3 19 22 in this sense the textile industry which generates a large of hot wastewater has a great potential for studies that help consolidate this technology aiming at environmental and sustainability assessment furthermore it is also worth mentioning that the efficiency of this treatment with the recovery of textile effluents can allow the generation of reused water and dye recovery for industrial reuse 23 25 because of this it is necessary to evaluate the influence of dye concentration in textile wastewater and its interaction with the membrane it is essential to understand the behavior of the process concerning dyes and auxiliary products of a dyeing bath different dye concentrations are present in dyeing bath or treatment stages and this factor is also little explored concerning the performance of the membrane distillation process 26 the literature cites dye concentrations in effluents ranging from 50 to 7000 mg l 1 being more common values less than 1000 mg l 1 27 however it is important to notice that the effluent concentration discharge varies from one textile industry to another the higher values are found in the dyeing machine discharge and the minor values are common in the equalization tank the components of the feed solution can directly influence the performance of the md as they modify essential membrane characteristics to the process literature studies treating highly saline water have shown that the permeate flux decreases with increasing feed concentration 28 29 the driving force reduction can explain this phenomenon due to the decrease in vapor pressure of the feed solution and the exponential increase in the viscosity of the feed with increased concentration it can also be attributed to fouling since the solutes are more likely to deposit on the membrane surface when the concentration is higher promoting penetration of the molecules of these elements in the membrane s pores research concerning the influence of solute concentration have been described in the literature for fruit juices 30 32 or salts 33 36 concerning textile dyes chong et al 37 studied this variation using reactive blue dye at low concentrations 20 25 30 and 35 mg l 1 in dcmd they reported the drop in permeate flux and color rejection versus increased concentration according to the authors this fact can be attributed to fouling since solutes are more likely to deposit on the surface of the membrane when the concentration is higher promoting penetration of molecules of these elements in the membrane s pores towards the permeate side criscuoli et al 38 also studied the dyes concentration in the feed solution in the vmd process they observed a decline in the permeate flux which was greater at higher concentrations such as 500 mg l 1 when compared to 25 mg l 1 these studies show that there is still a significant gap in this parameter study applied to the recovery of textile wastewater by the dcmd process once only lower concentrations were studied besides most academic publications have focused on evaluating the effects of operating conditions 14 20 39 40 therefore identifying the effect of the influence of the variation of dyes on the flux performance is extremely important consequently the study of this parameter would present the feasibility or not of using this technology it is worth mentioning that the disperse black dye has not been the subject of studies applied to md for waste treatment except for publications from the research group 8 14 20 25 41 45 disperse dyes are typically used for polyester dyeing and are also substantive to acrylics triacetates and other synthetic fibers for sublimation transfer printing this study provides knowledge to evaluate if membrane distillation could be implemented at the dyeing bath discharge in the equalization tank or even after the conventional wastewater treatment once these steps have different dye concentrations in this sense identifying the effect and influence of dye variation on flux performance is extremely important as various processes and products generate different residual dye concentrations therefore in this work the main objective was to determine the influence and evaluate the effect of the variation of the dye concentration in the textile wastewater recovery by direct contact membrane distillation differences in results of variation of dye concentration of different classes were established synthetic solutions with textile dyes reactive black and disperse black were used in the dcmd process using a commercial plane ptfe membrane 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes and dyes concentration variation the dcmd experiments were conducted using the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane produced by merck millipore ltda according to the literature this type of membrane is the most commonly used with the best characteristics desired for the md process such as satisfactory water flux high resistance to wetting due to the excellent hydrophobicity of the membrane and high chemical and thermal stability 46 the membrane has a pore size of 0 22 μm a porosity of 85 a thickness of 220 μm polypropylene support and an area of 0 0041 m2 25 fig 1 shows the chemical structure intact ptfe membrane and scanning electron microscope sem image two textile dyes that are widely used in the dyeing stage of the textile industry were selected to carry out the experiments the disperse black dye widely used in the dyeing of polyester fibers has low water solubility but interacts with polymer chains through van der waals forces it is composed of a mixture of dyes whose composition was not informed by the supplier turning unfeasible the representation of it by its chemical structure 41 the reactive black dye widely used in the dyeing of cellulosic fibers is highly soluble in water has a molar mass of 991 82 g mol 1 and has a molecular structure defined by at least one chromophore group consisting of the azo bond n n which is mainly responsible for the color 8 the chemical structure of the rb dye is illustrated in fig 2 the concentrations of the dyes were selected according to the literature and based on the values found in real samples of textile wastewater in the dyeing baths of the textile industries of santa catarina state brazil the minimum concentration value of 50 mg l 1 used was defined as similar to the concentration of the synthetic bath produced and studied by 47 the maximum concentration was 3 000 mg l 1 superior to real concentration of textile dyeing wastewater collected in the industry and analyzed in the laboratory in the laboratory s dyeings a concentration of 800 mg l 1 with reactive dye and 350 mg l 1 with disperse dye was observed in the residual bath these concentrations were also reproduced in synthetic solutions which consisted of only water and reactive or disperse dye table 1 to assess the influence of these residual dyeing concentrations on dcmd 2 2 dcmd experimental unit and characterization of membranes fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the dcmd experimental setup used in this work the unit was equipped with a membrane module positioned horizontally so that the feed solution would flow through the upper compartment of the module at the same time the permeate would pass through the lower compartment an external cooling bath was used on the permeate side while a thermal resistance was used for heating the feed stream the feed and permeate rate flows have a countercurrent configuration which allows a constant temperature difference across the membrane surface water vapor from the hot stream feed is transferred through the porous hydrophobic membrane to condense on the cold permeate side the operating conditions were defined based on studies in the literature that evaluated the md applied to the recovery of textile wastewater 2 43 45 47 48 the feed flow rate was recirculated through the membrane cell at 1 5 l min 1 and 60 c while the permeate distilled water was recirculated at a permeate flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 and 20 c the initial volumes used were 2 l and 0 6 l for feed and permeate reservoirs samples were collected every 0 5 h to analyze the permeate flux and color rejection the total time for each experiment was 4 h the estimated time where the initial decline in permeate flux becomes irrelevant i e the initial fouling 45 the permeate flux j kg h 1 m 2 was measured by recording the mass of water received on the permeate side according to eq 1 m t and m t0 kg are the permeate masses at time t h and at the initial time t0 h and a m2 is the effective area of the membrane the color rejection rate provides the percentage of dye rejection achieved in the dcmd process the value can vary from 0 where the dye passes freely through the membrane to 100 where there is the complete rejection of the solute eq 2 fc and cp correspond to the concentration of the dye on the feed side and the dye on the permeate side respectively calculating cp eq 3 considers the dilution

the dye concentration in the permeate reservoir was measured using a curve based on absorbancy the absorbancy readings were done with an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer micronal ajx 900 this equipment functioned through the detection of absorbed light in the maximum wavelength wavelengths with maximum absorbance λm a x for dyes applied at the rejection rate are 599 nm for the reactive dye and 301 nm for the disperse dye membrane characterizations were performed to observe the physical structure before and after the dcmd process the methodologies used were scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir thickness and contact angle the sem was performed to evaluate the morphology of the upper surface of the membranes the samples were previously covered with gold with the jeol jsm 6390lv equipment it was impossible to observe images of the cross section of the membranes as they did not break into liquid nitrogen from the images generated by the sem the edx technique was applied to detect elements present in the surface layer of the membrane for this an energy dispersion spectrometry system with the noran system six software was used the mean pore size of the ptfe membranes was determined by analysis of sem images using imagej software in which 20 measurements were made for each image the reduction of mean pore size is related to membrane fouling and was considered here concerning the initial mean pore size informed by the supplier ftir analyses of the membranes were performed to detect the functional groups present in their structure 32 scans of each sample were conducted with the cary 600 series device agilent technologies with transmittance in the range of 650 to 4000 cm 1 and resolution of 4 cm 1 the thickness of the membranes was determined using a micrometer mitutoyo brand model mdc 25p where 20 random readings were done on the membranes used in the experiments the contact angle analyses were performed to assess the hydrophobicity of each membrane used in the dcmd process a goniometer ramé hart model 250 f1 was used accompanied by image processing software dropimage advanced and 10 random measurements of each drop were performed to obtain an average value of the surface contact angle 3 results and discussion fig 4 shows the effect of dye concentrations on the final permeate flux after 4 h as can be seen the permeate flux decays with the increase in dye concentrations due to increased dye loading retention of residues on the membrane surface partially blocks pores and induces concentration polarization generally permeate flux is strongly dependent on the chemical properties of the dye solution and its interaction with the membrane material in fact the results demonstrated a difference in the behavior of reactive and disperse dyes being the last one resulting in more decrease in permeate flux in their studies an et al 50 and khumalo et al 51 have also reported this phenomenon with synthetic dye solutions higher flux values at lower concentrations can also probably be attributed to the fact that fluid dynamics within the system can keep dye species more in suspension further away from the membrane surface leading to a reduction in fouling chong et al 37 obtained a reduction of approximately 21 in the final permeate flux when the concentration of reactive dye increased from 20 to 35 mg l 1 showing a tendency to increase the percentage of flux drop when there is an increase in solute concentration results obtained in this work corroborated this behavior even with higher concentrations than published in the literature some textile dyeing machine discharges present these higher concentrations and this work allows understand the effect of the dye concentration in industrial conditions also it was observed that the decrease of permeate flux concerning the water occurred for all concentrations and dyes this behavior agrees with desalination studies where it was observed a reduction in vapor pressure by salt addition and consequently there is a reduction of the driving force 52 resistances at feed membrane and permeate boundary layers were modified due to the presence of dye which also modifies the overall mass transfer coefficient there is a drop in water activity with the increase of feed solution concentration decreasing the vapor pressure and leading to a low transmembrane vapor flux due to the lower vapor pressure gradient across the membrane causing a decrease in permeate fluxes all over time the permeate flux decreases due to the reduction in the convective heat transfer coefficient caused by the increases in the solute concentration this behavior is already known but results demonstrated a minor effect with reactive dye compared to the disperse dye solutions for reactive dye above 100 mg l 1 the observed decrease consists of a slight change another factor that explains the flux decline is the blocking of membrane pores due to clogging caused by interactions between the membrane surface and the dye molecules reactive dyes have larger structures and a high water affinity thus forming a solution on the other hand the disperse dyes have low solubility in water generally forming dispersions thus favoring the adsorption of dye particles on the membrane surface in this case it could be observed that the decrease is higher with the disperse dye solution compared to the reactive 14 the results were compared with the agmd and vmd configurations results and showed a substantial decrease in permeate flux with increasing feed concentration in the work of baghel et al 40 which studies the determination of optimal conditions using the vacuum membrane distillation process a reduction in the permeate flux was also found with the increase of the initial dye concentration from 10 ppm to 130 ppm xu et al 28 observed the same behavior using the agmd configuration where the water flux decreased modestly with an increasing salt concentration in the feed in both cases this reduction may be due to the deposition of molecules on the membrane surface which slows down the flux of vapors through the membrane pores 4 concerning the influence of dye class it was evidenced that disperse dye presented lower fluxes than the reactive the decay ratio between dye classes table 2 was calculated by the ratio of the difference between the final fluxes with disperse and reactive dye to the final permeate flux of reactive dye results showed a progressive increase the higher the dye concentration the greater the drop in the disperse dye permeate flux concerning the reactive dye in fact it was obtained the highest decay rate with 3000 mg l 1 among all tested concentrations this result is important since this comparison is not known in the literature furthermore this result enables to understand the effect of different dyes in the water reclamation when a mixture of dyes is present like in the equalization tank of textile wastewater this behavior can be caused by the smaller particles of disperse dye deposited in the membranes pores reducing the vapor permeation the disperse dye is a dispersion when used below the ideal temperature the dcmd process is carried out at 60 c causing precipitation of the particles of the db dye on the membrane surface during the process reducing the permeate flux the disperse dyes are insoluble in water which may explain the greater precipitation of their particles in the surface layer of the membrane this corroborates that the variation in concentration of the disperse dye directly influences the performance of the md process similar behavior was observed by li et al 48 although the authors did not evaluate the behavior of disperse dye alone a decrease in the permeate flux was observed when disperse dye was present with other classes in the dcmd feed solution it was concluded that this result could be attributed to the accumulation of suspended solids disperse dyes on the membrane surface blocking the pores and causing fouling fig 5 shows the profile of permeate flux under different dye concentrations as a function of time compared with the experiment carried out only with water as expected the maximum flux value was obtained in the first 30 min the literature assumes that the flux variation with time decreases until it reaches the steady state 45 it was observed that the permeate flux decreased until stabilization at the beginning of the operational period regardless of the dye concentration the downward trend is likely caused by severe deposition of solutes on the membrane s outer surface early in the separation process leading to blockage of the surface pores 4 to further understand the effect of dye concentration on the membrane initial fouling mechanism during md operation table 3 shows the decay rate of final permeate flux concerning the initial permeate flux for water and each dye concentration of the reactive and disperse black solutions the maximum decay rate of 35 3 for the reactive dye and 49 3 for the disperse dye showing a greater drop in flux for the disperse dye this can mainly be attributed to pore blocking and concentration polarization by dye adsorption of the black disperse dye in the experiment carried out only with deionized water as the feed solution there was also a total decay of 38 of the permeate flux over time this decay may be explained by the steam filling the initially dry membrane pores until the steady state is reached this phase could be called initial fouling generating a higher permeate flux of vapor in the initial phase of the experiment until reaching stability in the md process the boundary layers established at the membrane interfaces also interfere in the formation of the vapor pressure of the solutions marrying a greater variation in heat transfer at the beginning of the experiments so the temperature variations are higher resulting in higher permeate flux variation fig 6 shows the fouling factor for the concentrations studied for the two textile dyes for the reactive dye this parameter increased from 6 8 to 37 2 with the increase of dye concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 for the disperse dye the increase was higher from 22 7 to 66 3 with the same dye concentrations this behavior can be attributed mainly to pore blockage and concentration polarization by dye adsorption as cited by an et al 49 which reported that ffs remained constant up to 40 ppm increased rapidly from 40 ppm to 100 ppm and then stabilized above 100 ppm an important fact to be observed is the scale factor when comparing the dye classes the fouling factor obtained with the db solution in all dye concentrations is higher when compared to the same concentrations in rb solutions showing that the scale factor is higher with the disperse dye this is because the disperse dyes are relatively insoluble in water which leads to greater precipitation on the membrane surface causing more fouling and thus reducing the permeate flux as already described the rejection attraction and repulsion of the dye depend on its structures and chemical interactions with the membranes explaining the difference in the behavior of each solution indicating that the dye class plays an important role in dye fouling in the dcmd process furthermore this explains the lower permeate flux and the higher decay rate for the disperse dye sem results allowed observing the high porosity of the ptfe membrane it is also noted the presence of pores in all images used in the experiments with reactive dye fig 7 a d with a more visually noticeable decrease in the concentration of 3 000 mg l 1 compared to the pristine membrane fig 1 possibly due to solute deposits on the surface of the membranes however despite such deposition on the membrane with the highest concentration high porosity is still observed indicating that this dye class has not altered the membrane structure for the disperse dye fig 7e h the decrease in membrane pores is also noticeable with the increase in the dye concentration it can be observed that there is a greater decrease in the concentration of 500 and 3 000 mg l 1 indicating that high concentrations of this class of dye influence the process visually it was observed that there are differences when compared with the results obtained with the reactive dye the mean pore size table 4 decreased with increasing dye concentration confirming scale deposition on the membrane surface the edx analysis identified the presence of the elements carbon fluorine nitrogen and oxygen for the membranes used with the rb and db dyes indicating the presence of residual components of the dyes on the surfaces of the membranes this fact can be explained by the physicochemical interactions between the structures of the compounds during md however these interactions did not affect the color rejection for these dyes in any of the studied concentrations through the ftir technique it was possible to observe that the dye particles did not alter the functional groups of the membranes the results of ftir analyses of the membranes used for the two classes of dyes are shown in fig 8 the ftir plots clearly showed the representative bands of chemical groups found on ptfe membranes the same behavioral characteristics can be observed in both spectra of membranes with a variation of dye concentration the ptfe membrane showed characteristic peaks at 1205 cm 1 1153 cm 1 and 624 cm 1 corresponding to symmetrical elongation cf asymmetrical elongation and deforming vibrations the ftir spectra of the ptfe membranes after running with the dmcd process did not show significant variations this demonstrates that the initial structure and property of the ptfe membrane were correctly preserved the scale layer made on the surface of the membranes could not modify their structures even for the disperse dye that obtained a high scale factor indicating once again the potentiality of the dcmd process for textile wastewater treatment the thickness values of the membranes as a function of the different concentrations of dye rb and db in the feed solution are shown in table 5 there was no significant variation in the results for the dye rb indicating that the membrane structures were not altered thus even with the reduction in the permeate flux observed with the dye concentration increase it is possible to consider that the deposition of dyes in the surface layer on the membrane could not modify the thickness of the membranes an increase of approximately 10 μm was observed in the membrane tested with the db compared to that used in the experiment without dye indicating that this dye has a greater deposition on the membranes than the rb dye table 5 also shows the values of the contact angle measurements between membranes and the synthetic solutions of the textile dyes there was no major change in the angle measurement compared to the different concentrations of rb dye since the angle obtained with the highest concentration corresponds to 97 of that obtained with intact membrane however the measurements showed a declining trend when the solute concentration increased this indicates that under the studied concentrations the interactions between the membrane and this class of dye did not influence the hydrophobicity of the membrane for the disperse dye a drop of up to 13 is perceived in the measure of the angle in relation to the different concentrations of dye the most considerable decrease occurs in the concentration of 3 000 mg l 1 when the angle drops to 112 this value corresponds to 88 of that obtained with the membrane intact however this result still maintains the hydrophobic character of the membrane since angles above 90 characterize this parameter this decline shows that there may be a drop in the contact angle at high concentrations of db possibly caused by fouling and at even higher concentrations this effect could cause the membrane to wet a 100 color rejection rate was obtained for the rb dye at all concentrations in the present work mokhtar et al 47 and silva et al 45 also reported high color rejection rates with dyes all above 98 for this dye class an important characteristic of the ptfe membrane is its contact angle greater than 90 due to its high hydrophobic capacity thus the high hydrophobicity of the ptfe membranes influences directly in the repulsion of the drops of the solutions on the surface of the membranes making it difficult for solutes to permeate through the pores of the membranes despite the low flux the color rejection remained high for the db dye with a rejection of 100 for the experiments with a concentration of up to 500 mg l 1 and 98 for 1 000 and 3 000 mg l 1 this shows that even with the high fouling factor and solute precipitation on the membrane surface the high hydrophobicity of the ptfe membrane maintains the repelling effect of the drops of the feed solution thus the highly efficient color rejection performance of the selected characteristic pollutant revealed that the dcmd process could serve as a promising technology for treating dye wastewater 4 conclusions in this study the influence of the dye concentration from textile fibers dyeing on the performance of the membrane distillation process was evaluated the results showed that different rb and db dye concentrations influence the permeate flux indicating that the increase in the dye concentration decreases the permeate flux the disperse dye solutions presented lower permeate flux than the reactive reaching a drop of up to 41 4 in the permeate flux such as in the concentration of 3000 mg l 1 due to greater deposition of solutes in the membrane pores which caused the phenomenon fouling thus it was demonstrated that the higher the dye concentration the lower the permeate flux but the characteristics of the dyes are directly linked to the values of flux obtained i e the physical chemical characteristics of the dyes influence the dcmd due to the interactions between the membrane and the solutions the fouling factor also showed higher values for the disperse dye solutions indicating that this dye is more prone to fouling than the reactive dye regardless of the concentration however the rejection of the membrane for solutes was greater than 98 and no wetting of the membrane was observed dye deposition on the membrane surface was tested using sem edx contact angle thickness and ftir analysis the results indicated that the ptfe membrane exhibited good resistance under continuous exposure to both dye solutions with high concentrations and the scale observed did not change the quality of the permeate only a decrease in recovered water despite the perspective of the md process applied to the textile area more studies are still needed to convince the industry to implement membrane technologies in a textile wastewater treatment plant mainly investigating the technical economic performance of the applied md process to the treatment of textile wastewater therefore technology could really be a solution for reusing textile wastewater and ensuring a cleaner less water consuming textile in the future declaration of competing interest

13141,the main objective of the proposed work was to optimize an adsorbent gel from biological material with the substitution of pva by biopolymer extracted from cactus while maintaining the mechanical and sorption properties the porous composite was based on cactus extract ce and sodium alginate sa and the mechanical properties and adsorption capacities of these beads were then compared with those modified using polyvinyl alcohol pva and calcium carbonate cc respectively twenty formulations based on ce sa pva and cc have made it possible to prepare in accordance with an experimental design conducted in mode 6 four major classes of beads the three responses used to assess the evolution in bead performance were the breaking point of the beads bead rigidity based on a rheological study and the adsorption capacity of pentachlorophenol pcp the analysis of these responses showed that ce exerted a positive effect on both the mechanical strength 400 2200 pa and rigidity 5 11 of the beads similar to that of pva with the conservation of bead adsorption capacity 80 120 mg g 1of dry matter the beads based on ce and sa revealed their regular shape with a porous structure and good chemical and physical stability the ftir spectral analysis suggested that the interactions between sa and ce take place via hydrogen interactions and or covalent bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biosorbents cactus extract gelled beads rheological study adsorption 1 introduction many authors 1 3 are currently interested in the extraction of mucilage from plants mucilage results from the polymerization of several polysaccharides composed mainly of sugars l arabinose 24 6 42 d galactose 21 40 1 l rhamnose 7 13 1 d xylose 22 22 2 and d galacturonic acid 8 12 7 all of which are mainly associated with uronic acids this hydrocolloid complex is of a carbohydrate nature with highly branched structures 1 and a high molecular weight ranging between 2 3 104 and 3 106 da which serves to prevent structural contraction by facilitating the formation of a continuous matrix 2 this feature is characterized by viscous masses at a concentration of 10 by weight the viscosity exhibited is similar to that of xanthan at 3 and 25 c 1 3 such a complex also comes in the form of two distinct water soluble fractions one being apectin with gelling properties and ca2 and the other without gelling properties 10 4 this elastic property of mucilage enables its use in several industrial applications e g coating or texture adjustment 1 the characteristics of mucilage and its extraction yield depend on both the plant and the extraction method employed 5 the mucilage of opuntia ficus indica ofi is one of the natural promoter materials found in industry due to its numerous emulsifying gelling thickening and antioxidant properties in many medicinal and food formulations 6 its functional properties are essentially related to the structural composition including the content of galacturonic acids and phenolic compounds level of esterification molecular weight distribution degree of polymerization degree of branching and length of the galacturonic blocks indeed a high degree of branching prevents gelation by limiting the zones capable of interacting with ca2 cations while the fully de esterified extract offers excellent gelling properties in the presence of calcium 7 the extraction by an alkaline procedure yields a low degree of esterification and low methylation under such conditions the saponification of the methyl ester groups is favorable to the step of polycondensation 8 physical and chemical changes therefore lead to local crystallization and increase both the viscosity and gelling 7 in addition the ionization of uronic acids under alkaline conditions causes repulsion between the negative charges which promotes their solubility in water and thus allows for good extraction 9 the incorporation of natural or synthetic additives e g cross linking agents nanoparticles or polymers which offer thermodynamic compatibility serves to improve mechanical properties such additives include pectin 10 starch 11 polyvinyl alcohol pva 12 and gelatin 13 this association promotes cross linking between the polymer chains which in turn reinforces the mechanical properties of the resulting films in particular the elongation at breaking tensile strength and elasticity 10 11 14 15 in addition the ensuing structuring capacity has been mentioned in several research works according to de campo et al 2018 16 the nano encapsulation of zeaxanthin by the mucilage protects it from degradation and thus increases its stability over time in similar studies otalora et al 2015 2018 2 17 showed that microencapsulation by means of the spray drying method for betalains and betaxanthins in a mucilage and maltodextrin mixture provides better stability than that obtained with sodium alginate using an ionic gelation method the mixture of two polyanions pectin and alginate coated by chitosan polycation resulted in a mechanically stable polyelectrolyte membrane and moreover improved performance by increasing the osmotic flow of solvents 8 in recent years various types of natural and synthetic materials have been encapsulated 18 20 various studies have been carried out on the development of gelled beads based on polysaccharides such as alginates 21 chitosan 22 23 and carrageenan 24 alginate is the most widely used anionic polymer in this process due to its gelling capacity in the presence of divalent cations however these beads remain limited in their environmental applications given their low resistance to stresses and or their restricted porosity in this regard polyvinyl alcohol pva and calcium carbonate cc have been suggested in order to improve mechanical strength and produce macroporosity in the gel structure 25 27 respectively the main objective of the proposed work is to develop an optimized gelled biosorbent bead economically relevant and environmentally friendly for its use in water depollution processes the synthetized material utilizes a combination of biopolymers namely sodium alginate and polysaccharide extracts from opuntia ficus indica these extracts were required to possess significant gelation properties with a use designed to improve matrix mechanical properties in addition their surface needed to be multifunctional and their charge negative the repulsion effects between the two negatively charged biopolymers then modify the cross linking and mesh for a better diffusion of solutes throughout the material the material properties will be compared with gelled beads modified using pva to validate the possible substitution of these copolymers three evaluation criteria were selected two mechanical i e breaking point and bead rigidity plus the amount of pentachlorophenol adsorption capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 cactus

four classes of gelled beads sa ce sa cc sa pva and sa cc pva were prepared according to an experimental protocol whereby the matrix was composed of 20 formulation tests table 4 for standard beads a solution of sodium alginate sa with or without the addition of ce was mixed and homogenized using a magnetic stirrer for 3 h speed set at 300 rpm the mixture obtained was introduced drop wise according to the extrusion method using a peristaltic pump longer pump bt100 2 j china into a 0 2 m calcium chloride sigma aldrich and 6 boric acid sigma aldrich cross linking bath for 10 h 27 at ph 5 for formulations containing cc and or pva the components were added to the mixture prior to extrusion the pva or additional cc allowed studying the structural reinforcement and the porosity of the elaborate composite beads respectively in the experiments run to prepare porous reinforced beads based on pva the polymer was dissolved in distilled water and the solution was then stirred for 30 min at a temperature of 80 c the refrigerated pva solution was mixed with the initial dispersion the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h aspirated by the peristaltic pump and poured into the cross linking bath the beads containing cc were immersed in a solution of hcl 200 ml at 1 m for 2 h the dissolution of cc in an acid medium did indeed create a porous structure within the bead 2 4 characterization of the beads the mean diameter and sphericity of the wet gelled beads were estimated using image j software all wet beads obtained were dried beforehand on absorbent paper to remove excess water the value selected was an average of 10 measurements for each formulation the actual density of the beads was measured according to the volumetric displacement method the humidity rate of

buffer solution ph 7 3 and magnetic stirring the oxitop reactors were then placed in a chamber within an enclosure thermostatically controlled at 20 c on a shaking table after every 5 day measurement interval the oxitops were reset once again to zero the study of bead chemical stability as a function of evolution in ph was carried out on alginate beads modified by the incorporation of ce and or pva and or cc a sequence of several 0 5 g masses of each formulation was poured into bottles containing volumes of 10 ml of distilled water a ph range from 2 to 12 was prepared by adding a few drops of either hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m the entire solution was left to stand for 30 days at room temperature the beads were then dried in a desiccator and weighed the mass loss was calculated according to eq 2 2 m m 0 m f m 0 0 100 where m0 and mf g denote the initial and final masses of the gelled beads respectively 2 6 adsorption of pentachlorophenol pentachlorophenol pcp possesses physicochemical characteristics that make it a model molecule for studying the behavior of ionizable anionic species weak acids in soils and waste chemical formula c6cl5oh molecular weight 266 3 g mol 1 λmax 320 nm pka 4 75 pcp was chosen as the model organic micropollutant to determine the adsorption capacities of the various classes of formulated beads several batch adsorption tests were run this adsorption study was performed in 250 ml dark glass vials containing masses of 0 5 g of wet beads and receiving additional volumes 100 ml of the pollutant solution at ph 6 the composition was stirred at 225 rpm using a shaker sm 30 edmund bühler gmbh bodelshausen germany at room temperature for 10 h in this study the initial concentration of pcp c0 was equal to 13 mg l 1 the pcp concentration was determined by spectrophotometric assay at 320 nm abs 27 39 pcp g l 1 using the uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 tokyo japan 2 7 experimental matrix the partial least squares pls regression method was adopted to determine the coefficients of the quadratic models the experimental design employed was a fractional orthogonal plane with central points of the box behnken type it was generated by the modde 6 0 software and contained 20 tests including four repetitions in the center of the variation domain to verify reproducibility the four centered and reduced control factors adopted were sodium

of dry matter the statistical quality of the pls models was influenced by the evaluation of four parameters namely coefficient of determination r2 prediction coefficient q2 model validity and reproducibility pure error in addition the statistical study of the model was established by an analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cactus extract ce 3 1 1 chemical characterization ash content represented 16 of the cactus extract ce which was close to the rate observed by malainnine et al 2003 19 6 34 the quantitative and qualitative characterizations of ce were carried out via colorimetric methods see fig 1 for proteins phenolic compounds sugars and uronic acids these results showed that around 100 of the ash content was accounted for by the major compounds while the phenolic compounds constituted more than 50 of the ce with a content equal to 522 7 mg g 1 according to bouaouine et al 2019 35 cactus extracts were very rich phenolic compounds at ph 10 300 to 600 mg g 1 the soluble fibers content constituted around 56 of the ce 560 mg g 1 of ce according to lefsih et al 2016 7 cladodes of opuntia ficus indica are mostly constituted of carbohydrates and its polysaccharides are mainly composed of pectins likewise glucose and galacturonic acids were the main sugars of opuntia cladodes between 6 9 to 45 3 and 44 3 to 81 1 respectively 7 the mass yield w w of uronic acids in the ce equaled 14 140 2 mg g 1 thus suggesting the presence of a considerable amount of pectin polymers pectin was the main water soluble fraction representing approximately 4 of the dry cladode weight these results were consistent with those previously obtained on extracted polysaccharides representing 5 14 of the dry cladode weight 36 and moreover confirmed that opuntia is rich in pectin polysaccharides of around 140 mg g 1 of ce the extract also contained about 12 of neutral sugars per dry weight 119 1 mg g 1 stemming from highly branched chains 36 37 representing 3 4 of the cladodes dry weight the protein content was on the order of 70 7 mg g 1 of ce and was correlated with the extraction conditions also the extraction ph constituted an important influential factor 38 at ph 10 some proteins were hydrolyzed or precipitated thus possibly explaining the low rate 10 3 1 2 physicochemical characterization fig 2 shows the evolution in the zeta potential of colloidal forms of ce vs ph the variation in the zeta potential of the ce solution showed an increase in negative charge with an increase in ph reaching a value of less than 20 mv over a large range of ph values ph 4 this finding can be attributed to the presence of uronic acids whose pka values laid around 3 5 another small increase in negative charge was also apparent at ph 9 10 perhaps due to the amino group from protein with a pka of near 9 5 the ftir analyses confirmed the presence of amino groups on the ce fig 4 measuring the dynamic light scattering dls size distribution of the extract in solution yielded an average micromolecular cluster size on the order of 1 7 μm 3 2 characterization of the gelled beads to examine the morphology of the porous reinforced beads based on sa and ce we had introduced scanning electron microscopy at different levels of magnifications the corresponding images are presented in fig 3 overall the surface of the gelled beads revealed good encapsulation of the particles with a regular morphology a the folds observed on the surface of the dried gelled material b suggest that the structure featuring pores in its hydrous configuration this morphology facilitated the diffusion of molecules within the gel and therefore promoted the sorption of solutes the porous appearance could be explained by electrostatic repulsions between the polymer chains of negatively charged ce and sa the impact of introducing ce into the alginate gel has been investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy fig 4 a wide band located between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 was observed in the spectra of both sa and ce which corresponded to the valence vibration of the groups oh r of alcohol and the carboxylic acids implicated usually in oh intermolecular bonding 12 39 similarly an intense band were observed on the sa and ce spectra located at 1601 and 1610 cm 1 respectively corresponding to the vibrations of the bond coo of the ionized carboxylic acids and or to the deformations of the primary amines nh2 40 at around 1400 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 the two spectra showed bands corresponding to either the elongations of the c hbonds or the oh elongations the valence vibration of the co bond in the c oh groups of the carboxylic groups was noticed in the sa and ce spectra as well in addition a very intense band at around 1050 cm 1 corresponding to the c o c and c oh bonds present in the polysaccharides appeared in these same two spectra the bands corresponding to ch valence elongations cc vibrations were also present in the two spectra at approximately 950 and 850 cm 1 respectively this result confirms the polysaccharide presence oh c o c ch groups in the two polymers including uronic acid which contain cooh group the presence of neutral sugar and uronic acid compound was shown in colorimetric analysis performed on ce fig 1 ce contains also protein fig 1 which is an amino acid polymer that can explain the nh2 group presence in ce spectra in the ir spectrum of sa ce beads these same bands were observed yet with shift and intensification or retreat of some peaks these results suggested the interactions between sa and ce through hydrogen bonds let s also noted the appearance of new band at 1729 cm 1 which corresponded to carbonyl c o bonds of esterified carboxylic groups 15 41 when the intra or intermolecular oh and coo bonds were established the absorption band mentioned at around 3303 cm 1 was more intense and shifted towards lower wave numbers 3285 cm 1 as was observed in the sa and ce spectrum based beads with the appearance of the ester function 12 the fitr analysis confirm the colorimetric analysis of ce may be presence of amino acid from protein presence of neutral sugar and uronic acid and suggested the interactions between sa and ce which contain oh and cooh groups through hydrogen and or an ester covalent bond 3 3 study of the rheological properties of the beads the mechanical behavior of the beads is an important property when implementing the material in reactor like filters these properties are generally described from an evaluation of the elasticity and viscoelasticity based on the temporal response of a bead subjected to stress in this study bead rigidity has been estimated by both rheological parameters i e the storage modulus g which represented the solid behavior and the loss modulus g which represented the liquid behavior of the gel structure fig 5 illustrates the evolution of these two modules g and g with respect to deformation of reinforced and porous reinforced beads by sa ce and then by sa pva and cc respectively at small deformations a plateau was recorded corresponding to the domain of linear viscoelasticity where g and g were constant and g lve g lve in each class the two classes exhibited the behavior of a viscoelastic solid 42 and therefore did not depend on stress and moreover varied from one class to another g lve 600 pa g lve 80 pa g lve 2600 pa g lve 300 pa for sa pva cc and sa ce beads respectively in this zone the deformation was reversible in the elastic sense with the beads maintaining their shape and remaining intact at deformations from 0 01 to 1 for beads based on sa pva and cc and at deformations from 0 01 to 8 for beads based on sa and ce at this stage it was assumed that beyond the given stress value maximum force the beads were broken when deformation exceeded a specific value g decreased and intercepted g at the gel point whose values were equal to 2 5 and 10 for sa pva cc and sa ce beads respectively 43 beyond the gel point the beads behaved like a viscoelastic liquid the effectiveness of pva as reinforcing agent was already proved in literature 12 27 41 according to the results obtained by the rheological study the reinforcement of beads with cactus extract yielded good mechanical properties where the sa ce based beads were more rigid than the sa pva cc based beads with g lve 2600 pa significantly higher than module obtained with beads modified by pva and cc g lve 600 pa furthermore the sa ce based beads presented a mechanical strength higher than the sa pva cc based beads for deformation lower than 10 and 2 5 respectively the difference observed between g and the gel point of the structure resulting from combination of sa with ce or modified by pva and cc suggested that ce may be the target of a reinforcing agent just like pva the intermolecular interactions by hydrogen bonds between ce and sa served to reinforce the gel structure as exhibited in the ftir analyses 3 4 adsorption capacities in this study the adsorbed quantity of pcp by the beads has been estimated for reinforced and porous reinforced beads by sa ce and then by sa pva and cc respectively the results are presented in table 2 according to table 2 the structure resulting from a combination of sa ce and sa gel modified by pva and cc provided for a close adsorption capacity with adsorbed quantities of 129 0 1 mg g 1 and 126 0 5 mg g 1 of dry weight respectively they suggested that the ce can be considered as reinforcing agent without modifying the adsorption properties 3 5 analysis of correlations table 3 combines the results related to the characteristics of the various gelled beads of the experimental matrix in terms of diameter circularity density and moisture content the 20 formulations were presented in table 3a table 3b present the physical characteristics of the 20 beads bead density very often laid close to the water value varying from 1 0 to 1 2 the moisture content of the gelled beads was high with values between 96 and 99 depending on bead composition it decreased with the introduction of pva and or ce and increased with the formation of macroporosity by cc in formulations 5 and 6 since the solution was more viscous in the presence of ce the drop introduced into the cross linking solution was therefore larger in addition the electrostatic repulsion between sa and ce created modifications in cross linking within the bead which in turn increased its diameter formulations 10 12 14 16 the carbonate reaction in an acidic environment formed co2 gas in the beads and might also contribute to the increase in diameter in the presence of caco3 furthermore it should be noted that the shape of the beads remained relatively homogeneous with bead sphericity greater than 0 9 for all formulations the three responses were entered into the model to explore the isoresponse contours with regard to the percentages of the four indicators and the values of the various coefficients presented in table 4 the percentages of the four quality indicators of rsm models in the static sense are presented in fig 6 namely r2 q2 model validity and reproducibility these results showed the quality of the three rsm models r2 80 q2 40 model validity 40 and reproducibility 77 and can be considered as predictable the isoresponse contours with regard to the four indicators and the calculation of the coefficients of the various terms of the polynomial showed that the three responses were independent of one another fig 7 presents the corresponding isoresponse contours which translated the evolution in the gel point deformation of the gelled beads as a function of the simultaneous variation in the concentrations of sa pva a and sa ce b for fixed minimum concentrations of ce and cc for a and cc and pva for b respectively this deformation described the maximum resistance tolerated by beads subjected to stress below this limit the beads exhibited elastic properties and above their behavior changed to acquire plastic properties from this analysis of the contours it appeared that for sa and pva based beads pva exerted a favorable effect on bead stability which was proportional to the corresponding concentration sa however displayed a weakly negative effect when its concentration exceeded 1 8 g 100 ml of the mixture for sa and ce based beads the two components sa and ce had an effect on bead deformation and moreover the gradient varied proportionally with the ce concentration and inversely with the sa concentration indeed a concentration of 0 5 g 100 ml of ce increased material strength from 5 to 11 to the same extent as pva at a concentration of 1 5 g 100 ml in the case of pva some authors 12 15 27 have shown that the increases in cross linking between the chains of the two polymers served to improve the resistance to stress the isoresponse contours presented in fig 8 reflected the evolution in the storage modulus g of the beads as a function of the variation in the simultaneous concentrations of sa and pva a and sa and ce b for fixed minimum concentrations of ce cc for a and cc pva for b respectively this response described the rigidity of the gelled beads from this analysis of the contours it appeared that the two components sa and pva had a positive effect on bead rigidity with a greater effect from the sa component this stability was proportional to the concentration of both sa and pva for beads based on sa and ce these two components exerted a positive effect on rigidity at sa concentration less than 1 2 g 100 ml ce had a potential effect on rigidity while at ce concentrations below 0 1 g 100 ml sa was responsible for the strong effect on rigidity a ce concentration of 0 5 g 100 ml increased the storage modulus from 400 to 2200 pa for a formulation of beads of 1 g 100 ml of sa to the same extent as pva at a concentration of 1 5 g 100 ml in the case of pva the hydrogen bonds governed this rigidity 12 15 27 similarly for ce as demonstrated by the ftir results the bonds formed between the two polymers served to strengthen the gel structure the isoresponse contours reflected the evolution in the adsorbed amount of pcp within the gelled beads as a function of the variation in the simultaneous concentrations of sa cc a and sa ce b while as previously noted maintaining the other parameters at a constant minimum value see fig 9 from this analysis of the contours it appeared that for sa and cc based beads both components affected the adsorption capacity of the beads and moreover the gradient varied proportionally with the cc concentration and inversely with the sa concentration at high sa concentrations the compaction of the gelled structure reduced diffusion and the adsorption capacity decreased in the case of bead formulations containing cc the external surface had a rough appearance due to the production and releases of co2 in an acid environment as well as to the generation of high macroporosity hence the improved diffusion of the pollutant throughout the gel structure the adsorption capacity increased from 80 to 120 mg g 1 of dry matter for sa and ce based beads both components sa and ce had an effect on the quantity of pollutant adsorbed by the beads moreover the gradient varied proportionally with the ce concentration and inversely with the sa concentration ce and sa were indeed negatively charged which induced repulsion between these macromolecules hence the improved diffusion of the pollutant throughout the gel structure the adsorption capacity increased from 80 to 120 mg g 1 of dry matter a high concentration of alginate increased cross linking in the hydrogel and reduced adsorption capacity the use of a statistical model in the elimination of pcp at ph 6 yielded a positive response on the porosity of the ce based gelled beads which proved to be as effective as cc based beads the adsorption capacity increased from 80 to 120 mg g 1 of dry matter for both classes of beads based on the three responses it can thus be concluded that polysaccharides from cactus extracts ce had a positive effect on bead mechanical strength and rigidity to the same extent as pva conserving the bead adsorption capacity and this for an optimized beads at sa ce ratio equal to 77 23 3 6 stability of the prepared material in order to study the biological stability of the various classes of beads over time we had evaluated the degradation of organic matter by monitoring the consumption of o2 results from this study showed that the two beads sa ce and sa pva cc revealed good stability over time with a very low consumption of o2 recorded during a single month 177 mg o2 g 1 the chemical stability of the beads sa ce and sa pva cc was achieved by monitoring mass loss as a function of ph fig 10 in this study the sa pva cc and sa ce based beads ensured good stability with mass losses 10 within a ph range from 3 to 10 in a strong basic medium ph 11 the gel structure was damaged and the beads were therefore unusable for analyses and adsorption tests this finding was explained by the exchange of ca2 with monovalent na ions and bridges between various polymer chains being limited with partial degradation of the gel structure in a very acidic environment ph 2 the porous beads sa pva cc and sa ce based beads loose13 and 16 of their initial masses respectively these results were in agreement with those previously recorded by chabane et al 2016 27 4 conclusion results from this study showed that cactus extract ce was characterized by a negative charge an average size of 1 7 μm and a composition of 52 phenolic compounds 14 galacturonic acids 13 neutral sugars and 7 proteins the soluble fibers content was equal to 56 the ftir spectral analysis suggested that interactions between the sa and ce constituents of the various formulations took place via hydrogen bonds and or covalent bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the two polymers the rheological analysis carried out on the ce based gelled sa beads indicated more stable behavior than that for beads reinforced by pva the use of a statistical model in the elimination of pcp at ph 6 yielded a positive response on the porosity of the ce based gelled beads which proved to be as effective as cc based beads these biocomposite beads have been characterized as spherical relatively homogeneous in size and chemically stable sem observation showed a porous morphology with well encapsulated sorbent particles and a rough structure with heterogeneously sized pores these results clearly confirm the good sorption efficiency of this new generation of material with an adsorption capacity of 129 0 1 mg g 1 in our experimental conditions

13141,the main objective of the proposed work was to optimize an adsorbent gel from biological material with the substitution of pva by biopolymer extracted from cactus while maintaining the mechanical and sorption properties the porous composite was based on cactus extract ce and sodium alginate sa and the mechanical properties and adsorption capacities of these beads were then compared with those modified using polyvinyl alcohol pva and calcium carbonate cc respectively twenty formulations based on ce sa pva and cc have made it possible to prepare in accordance with an experimental design conducted in mode 6 four major classes of beads the three responses used to assess the evolution in bead performance were the breaking point of the beads bead rigidity based on a rheological study and the adsorption capacity of pentachlorophenol pcp the analysis of these responses showed that ce exerted a positive effect on both the mechanical strength 400 2200 pa and rigidity 5 11 of the beads similar to that of pva with the conservation of bead adsorption capacity 80 120 mg g 1of dry matter the beads based on ce and sa revealed their regular shape with a porous structure and good chemical and physical stability the ftir spectral analysis suggested that the interactions between sa and ce take place via hydrogen interactions and or covalent bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biosorbents cactus extract gelled beads rheological study adsorption 1 introduction many authors 1 3 are currently interested in the extraction of mucilage from plants mucilage results from the polymerization of several polysaccharides composed mainly of sugars l arabinose 24 6 42 d galactose 21 40 1 l rhamnose 7 13 1 d xylose 22 22 2 and d galacturonic acid 8 12 7 all of which are mainly associated with uronic acids this hydrocolloid complex is of a carbohydrate nature with highly branched structures 1 and a high molecular weight ranging between 2 3 104 and 3 106 da which serves to prevent structural contraction by facilitating the formation of a continuous matrix 2 this feature is characterized by viscous masses at a concentration of 10 by weight the viscosity exhibited is similar to that of xanthan at 3 and 25 c 1 3 such a complex also comes in the form of two distinct water soluble fractions one being apectin with gelling properties and ca2 and the other without gelling properties 10 4 this elastic property of mucilage enables its use in several industrial applications e g coating or texture adjustment 1 the characteristics of mucilage and its extraction yield depend on both the plant and the extraction method employed 5 the mucilage of opuntia ficus indica ofi is one of the natural promoter materials found in industry due to its numerous emulsifying gelling thickening and antioxidant properties in many medicinal and food formulations 6 its functional properties are essentially related to the structural composition including the content of galacturonic acids and phenolic compounds level of esterification molecular weight distribution degree of polymerization degree of branching and length of the galacturonic blocks indeed a high degree of branching prevents gelation by limiting the zones capable of interacting with ca2 cations while the fully de esterified extract offers excellent gelling properties in the presence of calcium 7 the extraction by an alkaline procedure yields a low degree of esterification and low methylation under such conditions the saponification of the methyl ester groups is favorable to the step of polycondensation 8 physical and chemical changes therefore lead to local crystallization and increase both the viscosity and gelling 7 in addition the ionization of uronic acids under alkaline conditions causes repulsion between the negative charges which promotes their solubility in water and thus allows for good extraction 9 the incorporation of natural or synthetic additives e g cross linking agents nanoparticles or polymers which offer thermodynamic compatibility serves to improve mechanical properties such additives include pectin 10 starch 11 polyvinyl alcohol pva 12 and gelatin 13 this association promotes cross linking between the polymer chains which in turn reinforces the mechanical properties of the resulting films in particular the elongation at breaking tensile strength and elasticity 10 11 14 15 in addition the ensuing structuring capacity has been mentioned in several research works according to de campo et al 2018 16 the nano encapsulation of zeaxanthin by the mucilage protects it from degradation and thus increases its stability over time in similar studies otalora et al 2015 2018 2 17 showed that microencapsulation by means of the spray drying method for betalains and betaxanthins in a mucilage and maltodextrin mixture provides better stability than that obtained with sodium alginate using an ionic gelation method the mixture of two polyanions pectin and alginate coated by chitosan polycation resulted in a mechanically stable polyelectrolyte membrane and moreover improved performance by increasing the osmotic flow of solvents 8 in recent years various types of natural and synthetic materials have been encapsulated 18 20 various studies have been carried out on the development of gelled beads based on polysaccharides such as alginates 21 chitosan 22 23 and carrageenan 24 alginate is the most widely used anionic polymer in this process due to its gelling capacity in the presence of divalent cations however these beads remain limited in their environmental applications given their low resistance to stresses and or their restricted porosity in this regard polyvinyl alcohol pva and calcium carbonate cc have been suggested in order to improve mechanical strength and produce macroporosity in the gel structure 25 27 respectively the main objective of the proposed work is to develop an optimized gelled biosorbent bead economically relevant and environmentally friendly for its use in water depollution processes the synthetized material utilizes a combination of biopolymers namely sodium alginate and polysaccharide extracts from opuntia ficus indica these extracts were required to possess significant gelation properties with a use designed to improve matrix mechanical properties in addition their surface needed to be multifunctional and their charge negative the repulsion effects between the two negatively charged biopolymers then modify the cross linking and mesh for a better diffusion of solutes throughout the material the material properties will be compared with gelled beads modified using pva to validate the possible substitution of these copolymers three evaluation criteria were selected two mechanical i e breaking point and bead rigidity plus the amount of pentachlorophenol adsorption capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 cactus extract ce preparation the cladodes of opuntia ficus indica originate from the region of blida northern algeria these cladodes were first cleaned by removing the thorns and black spots with a knife after rinsing several times with tap water to remove dust they were cut into small 1 cm cubes ce was prepared according to the method described by fox et al 2012 and vicino et al 2016 28 29 with some modifications a mixture 1000 g of cladodes 1000 ml of 1 nacl purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa was heated at 85 c in a crystallizer for 20 min to deactivate the enzymes after cooling to room temperature t 20 1 c ph was adjusted from 4 to 10 by adding a few drops of a 0 1 m naoh solution sigma aldrich after vigorous stirring of the mixture in order to induce de esterification of the carboxyl groups the suspension was filtered through a fabric filter and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000g the solid liquid separation of the supernatant was carried out with isopropanol afterwards the solid was washed several times with ethanol sigma aldrich dried at room temperature ground and sieved in order to obtain a diameter fraction 200 μm 2 2 characterization of the cactus extract ce ash content was determined by calcination at 550 c soluble fibers content were measured by the method described by xiong et al 2022 30 the biochemical composition of the ce was determined by colorimetric methods using a spectrophotometer cadas50 s dr lange germany the main compounds and methods employed are summarized in table 1 below along with their corresponding references these products were purchased from sigma aldrich the charge and size measurements of the extracted polysaccharide cluster particles were carried out with a malvern master zetasizer 3000 device malvern instruments uk the size distribution and charge were determined by use of a laser light diffractometer 10 mw 470 nm and 4 mw hene 632 8 nm for the blue and red light sources respectively with a size order ranging from 10 nm to 3 5 mm the analyses were conducted at ambient temperature and at an extract concentration equal to 10 4 g l 1 the ce charge was determined by measuring the zeta potential at different ph values lying between 2 and 12 ph was adjusted by adding a few drops of naoh and or hcl sigma aldrich all measurements were performed in duplicate 2 3 preparation of various classes of

degree of hydrolyzation 97 5 99 5 cc for calcium carbonate caco3 purity percentage 99 obtained from merck merck germany and ce for cactus extract were used during this study s bead preparation steps four classes of gelled beads sa ce sa cc sa pva and sa cc pva were prepared according to an experimental protocol whereby the matrix was composed of 20 formulation tests table 4 for standard beads a solution of sodium alginate sa with or without the addition of ce was mixed and homogenized using a magnetic stirrer for 3 h speed set at 300 rpm the mixture obtained was introduced drop wise according to the extrusion method using a peristaltic pump longer pump bt100 2 j china into a 0 2 m calcium chloride sigma aldrich and 6 boric acid sigma aldrich cross linking bath for 10 h 27 at ph 5 for formulations containing cc and or pva the components were added to the mixture prior to extrusion the pva or additional cc allowed studying the structural reinforcement and the porosity of the elaborate composite beads respectively in the experiments run to prepare porous reinforced beads based on pva the polymer was dissolved in distilled water and the solution was then stirred for 30 min at a temperature of 80 c the refrigerated pva solution was mixed with the initial dispersion the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h aspirated by the peristaltic pump and poured into the cross linking bath the beads containing cc were immersed in a solution of hcl 200 ml at 1 m for 2 h the dissolution of cc in an acid medium did indeed create a porous structure within the bead 2 4 characterization of the beads the mean diameter and sphericity of the wet gelled beads were estimated using image j software all wet beads obtained were dried beforehand on absorbent paper to remove excess water the value selected was an average of 10 measurements for each formulation the actual density of the beads was measured according to the volumetric displacement method the humidity rate of the beads was taken as the average of 10 beads weighed before and after drying in an oven at 105 c for 1 h this value was determined by means of eq 1 1 moisture content in m w m d m w 100 where mw and md g represent the masses of the beads before and after drying at 105 c respectively the materials were then analyzed by ftir in order to identify the functional surface groups these analyses were carried out on the dried beads using a jasco ft ir 4200 brand ftir spectrometer tokyo japan using kbr pellets over a frequency range between 400 and 4000 cm 1 the morphology of the beads composed of cactus extract ce was studied by analyzing them with scanning electron microscopy sem feg quanta 650 microscopy fei usa the gelled beads were first dried and then observed at a voltage of 5 kv a study of the viscoelastic properties of the various wet bead formulations was conducted using a rotary rheometer anton paar physica rheolab mcr 302 gmbh germany fitted with a plane plane type measurement system 8 mm in diameter the experimental results were processed via the rheoplus us200 software anton paar gmbh germany these analyses were performed in oscillation shear mode at a frequency of 1 hz a normal applied force between 0 03 and 0 04 n and a temperature of 20 c the two viscoelasticity parameters were evaluated and deduced from the linear viscoelastic range i e lve range namely the storage modulus g and loss modulus g the gel point was another parameter investigated in this study it described the breaking of the bead at the intersection point between g and g 2 5 biological and chemical ph stabilities of the beads for the aerobic biodegradability a series of 10 gelled beads of each class were placed in oxitop type reactors according to the standardized method with 432 ml of phosphate buffer solution ph 7 3 and magnetic stirring the oxitop reactors were then placed in a chamber within an enclosure thermostatically controlled at 20 c on a shaking table after every 5 day measurement interval the oxitops were reset once again to zero the study of bead chemical stability as a function of evolution in ph was carried out on alginate beads modified by the incorporation of ce and or pva and or cc a sequence of several 0 5 g masses of each formulation was poured into bottles containing volumes of 10 ml of distilled water a ph range from 2 to 12 was prepared by adding a few drops of either hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m the entire solution was left to stand for 30 days at room temperature the beads were then dried in a desiccator and weighed the mass loss was calculated according to eq 2 2 m m 0 m f m 0 0 100 where m0 and mf g denote the initial and final masses of the gelled beads respectively 2 6 adsorption of pentachlorophenol pentachlorophenol pcp possesses physicochemical characteristics that make it a model molecule for studying the behavior of ionizable anionic species weak acids in soils and waste chemical formula c6cl5oh molecular weight 266 3 g mol 1 λmax 320 nm pka 4 75 pcp was chosen as the model organic micropollutant to determine the adsorption capacities of the various classes of formulated beads several batch adsorption tests were run this adsorption study was performed in 250 ml dark glass vials containing masses of 0 5 g of wet beads and receiving additional volumes 100 ml of the pollutant solution at ph 6 the composition was stirred at 225 rpm using a shaker sm 30 edmund bühler gmbh bodelshausen germany at room temperature for 10 h in this study the initial concentration of pcp c0 was equal to 13 mg l 1 the pcp concentration was determined by spectrophotometric assay at 320 nm abs 27 39 pcp g l 1 using the uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 tokyo japan 2 7 experimental matrix the partial least squares pls regression method was adopted to determine the coefficients of the quadratic models the experimental design employed was a fractional orthogonal plane with central points of the box behnken type it was generated by the modde 6 0 software and contained 20 tests including four repetitions in the center of the variation domain to verify reproducibility the four centered and reduced control factors adopted were sodium alginate sa 1 2 5 g 100 ml cactus extract ce 0 01 0 5 g 100 ml polyvinyl alcohol pva 0 01 1 5 g 100 ml and calcium carbonate cc 0 01 1 5 g 100 ml the three responses used for bead performance evolution were the breaking point of the beads expressed as the deformation at gel point in bead rigidity expressed as the storage modulus g in pa and the pcp amount adsorbed by these beads in mg g 1 of dry matter the statistical quality of the pls models was influenced by the evaluation of four parameters namely coefficient of determination r2 prediction coefficient q2 model validity and reproducibility pure error in addition the statistical study of the model was established by an analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cactus extract ce 3 1 1 chemical characterization ash content represented 16 of the cactus extract ce which was close to the rate observed by malainnine et al 2003 19 6 34 the quantitative and qualitative characterizations of ce were carried out via colorimetric methods see fig 1 for proteins phenolic compounds sugars and uronic acids these results showed that around 100 of the ash content was accounted for by the major compounds while the phenolic compounds constituted more than 50 of the ce with a content equal to 522 7 mg g 1 according to bouaouine et al 2019 35 cactus extracts were very rich phenolic compounds at ph 10 300 to 600 mg g 1 the soluble fibers content constituted around 56 of the ce 560 mg g 1 of ce according to lefsih et al 2016 7 cladodes of opuntia ficus indica are mostly constituted of carbohydrates and its polysaccharides are mainly composed of pectins likewise glucose and galacturonic acids were the main sugars of opuntia cladodes between 6 9 to 45 3 and 44 3 to 81 1 respectively 7 the mass yield w w of uronic acids in the ce equaled 14 140 2 mg g 1 thus suggesting the presence of a considerable amount of pectin polymers pectin was the main water soluble fraction representing approximately 4 of the dry cladode weight these results were consistent with those previously obtained on extracted polysaccharides representing 5 14 of the dry cladode weight 36 and moreover confirmed that opuntia is rich in pectin polysaccharides of around 140 mg g 1 of ce the extract also contained about 12 of neutral sugars per dry weight 119 1 mg g 1 stemming from highly branched chains 36 37 representing 3 4 of the cladodes dry weight the protein content was on the order of 70 7 mg g 1 of ce and was correlated with the extraction conditions also the extraction ph constituted an important influential factor 38 at ph 10 some proteins were hydrolyzed or precipitated thus possibly explaining the low rate 10 3 1 2 physicochemical characterization fig 2 shows the evolution in the zeta potential of colloidal forms of ce vs ph the variation in the zeta potential of the ce solution showed an increase in negative charge with an increase in ph reaching a value of less than 20 mv over a large range of ph values ph 4 this finding can be attributed to the presence of uronic acids whose pka values laid around 3 5 another small increase in negative charge was also apparent at ph 9 10 perhaps due to the amino group from protein with a pka of near 9 5 the ftir analyses confirmed the presence of amino groups on the ce fig 4 measuring the dynamic light scattering dls size distribution of the extract in solution yielded an average micromolecular cluster size on the order of 1 7 μm 3 2 characterization of the gelled beads to examine the morphology of the porous reinforced beads based on sa and ce we had introduced scanning electron microscopy at different levels of magnifications the corresponding images are presented in fig 3 overall the surface of the gelled beads revealed good encapsulation of the particles with a regular morphology a the folds observed on the surface of the dried gelled material b suggest that the structure featuring pores in its hydrous configuration this morphology facilitated the diffusion of molecules within the gel and therefore promoted the sorption of solutes the porous appearance could be explained by electrostatic repulsions between the polymer chains of negatively charged ce and sa the impact of introducing ce into the alginate gel has been investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy fig 4 a wide band located between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 was observed in the spectra of both sa and ce which corresponded to the valence vibration of the groups oh r of alcohol and the carboxylic acids implicated usually in oh intermolecular bonding 12 39 similarly an intense band were observed on the sa and ce spectra located at 1601 and 1610 cm 1 respectively corresponding to the vibrations of the bond coo of the ionized carboxylic acids and or to the deformations of the primary amines nh2 40 at around 1400 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 the two spectra showed bands corresponding to either the elongations of the c hbonds or the oh elongations the valence vibration of the co bond in the c oh groups of the carboxylic groups was noticed in the sa and ce spectra as well in addition a very intense band at around 1050 cm 1 corresponding to the c o c and c oh bonds present in the polysaccharides appeared in these same two spectra the bands corresponding to ch valence elongations cc vibrations were also present in the two spectra at approximately 950 and 850 cm 1 respectively this result confirms the polysaccharide presence oh c o c ch groups in the two polymers including uronic acid which contain cooh group the presence of neutral sugar and uronic acid compound was shown in colorimetric analysis performed on ce fig 1 ce contains also protein fig 1 which is an amino acid polymer that can explain the nh2 group presence in ce spectra in the ir spectrum of sa ce beads these same bands were observed yet with shift and intensification or retreat of some peaks these results suggested the interactions between sa and ce through hydrogen bonds let s also noted the appearance of new band at 1729 cm 1 which corresponded to carbonyl c o bonds of esterified carboxylic groups 15 41 when the intra or intermolecular oh and coo bonds were established the absorption band mentioned at around 3303 cm 1 was more intense and shifted towards lower wave numbers 3285 cm 1 as was observed in the sa and ce spectrum based beads with the appearance of the ester function 12 the fitr analysis confirm the colorimetric analysis of ce may be presence of amino acid from protein presence of neutral sugar and uronic acid and suggested the interactions between sa and ce which contain oh and cooh groups through hydrogen and or an ester covalent bond 3 3 study of the rheological properties of the beads the mechanical behavior of the beads is an important property when implementing the material in reactor like filters these properties are generally described from an evaluation of the elasticity and viscoelasticity based on the temporal response of a bead subjected to stress in this study bead rigidity has been estimated by both rheological parameters i e the storage modulus g which represented the solid behavior and the loss modulus g which represented the liquid behavior of the gel structure fig 5 illustrates the evolution of these two modules g and g with respect to deformation of reinforced and porous reinforced beads by sa ce and then by sa pva and cc respectively at small deformations a plateau was recorded corresponding to the domain of linear viscoelasticity where g and g were constant and g lve g lve in each class the two classes exhibited the behavior of a viscoelastic solid 42 and therefore did not depend on stress and moreover varied from one class to another g lve 600 pa g lve 80 pa g lve 2600 pa g lve 300 pa for sa pva cc and sa ce beads respectively in this zone the deformation was reversible in the elastic sense with the beads maintaining their shape and remaining intact at deformations from 0 01 to 1 for beads based on sa pva and cc and at deformations from 0 01 to 8 for beads based on sa and ce at this stage it was assumed that beyond the given stress value maximum force the beads were broken when deformation exceeded a specific value g decreased and intercepted g at the gel point whose values were equal to 2 5 and 10 for sa pva cc and sa ce beads respectively 43 beyond the gel point the beads behaved like a viscoelastic liquid the effectiveness of pva as reinforcing agent was already proved in literature 12 27 41 according to the results obtained by the rheological study the reinforcement of beads with cactus extract yielded good mechanical properties where the sa ce based beads were more rigid than the sa pva cc based beads with g lve 2600 pa significantly higher than module obtained with beads modified by pva and cc g lve 600 pa furthermore the sa ce based beads presented a mechanical strength higher than the sa pva cc based beads for deformation lower than 10 and 2 5 respectively the difference observed between g and the gel point of the structure resulting from combination of sa with ce or modified by pva and cc suggested that ce may be the target of a reinforcing agent just like pva the intermolecular interactions by hydrogen bonds between ce and sa served to reinforce the gel structure as exhibited in the ftir analyses 3 4 adsorption capacities in this study the adsorbed quantity of pcp by the beads has been estimated for reinforced and porous reinforced beads by sa ce and then by sa pva and cc respectively the results are presented in table 2 according to table 2 the structure resulting from a combination of sa ce and sa gel modified by pva and cc provided for a close adsorption capacity with adsorbed quantities of 129 0 1 mg g 1 and 126 0 5 mg g 1 of dry weight respectively they suggested that the ce can be considered as reinforcing agent without modifying the adsorption properties 3 5 analysis of correlations table 3 combines the results related to the characteristics of the various gelled beads of the experimental matrix in terms of diameter circularity density and moisture content the 20 formulations were presented in table 3a table 3b present the physical characteristics of the 20 beads bead density very often laid close to the water value varying from 1 0 to 1 2 the moisture content of the gelled beads was high with values between 96 and 99 depending on bead composition it decreased with the introduction of pva and or ce and increased with the formation of macroporosity by cc in formulations 5 and 6 since the solution was more viscous in the presence of ce the drop introduced into the cross linking solution was therefore larger in addition the electrostatic repulsion between sa and ce created modifications in cross linking within the bead which in turn increased its diameter formulations 10 12 14 16 the carbonate reaction in an acidic environment formed co2 gas in the beads and might also contribute to the increase in diameter in the presence of caco3 furthermore it should be noted that the shape of the beads remained relatively homogeneous with bead sphericity greater than 0 9 for all formulations the three responses were entered into the model to explore the isoresponse contours with regard to the percentages of the four indicators and the values of the various coefficients presented in table 4 the percentages of the four quality indicators of rsm models in the static sense are presented in fig 6 namely r2 q2 model validity and reproducibility these results showed the quality of the three rsm models r2 80 q2 40 model validity 40 and reproducibility 77 and can be considered as predictable the isoresponse contours with regard to the four indicators and the calculation of the coefficients of the various terms of the polynomial showed that the three responses were independent of one another fig 7 presents the corresponding isoresponse contours which translated the evolution in the gel point deformation of the gelled beads as a function of the simultaneous variation in the concentrations of sa pva a and sa ce b for fixed minimum concentrations of ce and cc for a and cc and pva for b respectively this deformation described the maximum resistance tolerated by beads subjected to stress below this limit the beads exhibited elastic properties and above their behavior changed to acquire plastic properties from this analysis of the contours it appeared that for sa and pva based beads pva exerted a favorable effect on bead stability which was proportional to the corresponding concentration sa however displayed a weakly negative effect when its concentration exceeded 1 8 g 100 ml of the mixture for sa and ce based beads the two components sa and ce had an effect on bead deformation and moreover the gradient varied proportionally with the ce concentration and inversely with the sa concentration indeed a concentration of 0 5 g 100 ml of ce increased material strength from 5 to 11 to the same extent as pva at a concentration of 1 5 g 100 ml in the case of pva some authors 12 15 27 have shown that the increases in cross linking between the chains of the two polymers served to improve the resistance to stress the isoresponse contours presented in fig 8 reflected the evolution in the storage modulus g of the beads as a function of the variation in the simultaneous concentrations of sa and pva a and sa and ce b for fixed minimum concentrations of ce cc for a and cc pva for b respectively this response described the rigidity of the gelled beads from this analysis of the contours it appeared that the two components sa and pva had a positive effect on bead rigidity with a greater effect from the sa component this stability was proportional to the concentration of both sa and pva for beads based on sa and ce these two components exerted a positive effect on rigidity at sa concentration less than 1 2 g 100 ml ce had a potential effect on rigidity while at ce concentrations below 0 1 g 100 ml sa was responsible for the strong effect on rigidity a ce concentration of 0 5 g 100 ml increased the storage modulus from 400 to 2200 pa for a formulation of beads of 1 g 100 ml of sa to the same extent as pva at a concentration of 1 5 g 100 ml in the case of pva the hydrogen bonds governed this rigidity 12 15 27 similarly for ce as demonstrated by the ftir results the bonds formed between the two polymers served to strengthen the gel structure the isoresponse contours reflected the evolution in the adsorbed amount of pcp within the gelled beads as a function of the variation in the simultaneous concentrations of sa cc a and sa ce b while as previously noted maintaining the other parameters at a constant minimum value see fig 9 from this analysis of the contours it appeared that for sa and cc based beads both components affected the adsorption capacity of the beads and moreover the gradient varied proportionally with the cc concentration and inversely with the sa concentration at high sa concentrations the compaction of the gelled structure reduced diffusion and the adsorption capacity decreased in the case of bead formulations containing cc the external surface had a rough appearance due to the production and releases of co2 in an acid environment as well as to the generation of high macroporosity hence the improved diffusion of the pollutant throughout the gel structure the adsorption capacity increased from 80 to 120 mg g 1 of dry matter for sa and ce based beads both components sa and ce had an effect on the quantity of pollutant adsorbed by the beads moreover the gradient varied proportionally with the ce concentration and inversely with the sa concentration ce and sa were indeed negatively charged which induced repulsion between these macromolecules hence the improved diffusion of the pollutant throughout the gel structure the adsorption capacity increased from 80 to 120 mg g 1 of dry matter a high concentration of alginate increased cross linking in the hydrogel and reduced adsorption capacity the use of a statistical model in the elimination of pcp at ph 6 yielded a positive response on the porosity of the ce based gelled beads which proved to be as effective as cc based beads the adsorption capacity increased from 80 to 120 mg g 1 of dry matter for both classes of beads based on the three responses it can thus be concluded that polysaccharides from cactus extracts ce had a positive effect on bead mechanical strength and rigidity to the same extent as pva conserving the bead adsorption capacity and this for an optimized beads at sa ce ratio equal to 77 23 3 6 stability of the prepared material in order to study the biological stability of the various classes of beads over time we had evaluated the degradation of organic matter by monitoring the consumption of o2 results from this study showed that the two beads sa ce and sa pva cc revealed good stability over time with a very low consumption of o2 recorded during a single month 177 mg o2 g 1 the chemical stability of the beads sa ce and sa pva cc was achieved by monitoring mass loss as a function of ph fig 10 in this study the sa pva cc and sa ce based beads ensured good stability with mass losses 10 within a ph range from 3 to 10 in a strong basic medium ph 11 the gel structure was damaged and the beads were therefore unusable for analyses and adsorption tests this finding was explained by the exchange of ca2 with monovalent na ions and bridges between various polymer chains being limited with partial degradation of the gel structure in a very acidic environment ph 2 the porous beads sa pva cc and sa ce based beads loose13 and 16 of their initial masses respectively these results were in agreement with those previously recorded by chabane et al 2016 27 4 conclusion results from this study showed that cactus extract ce was characterized by a negative charge an average size of 1 7 μm and a composition of 52 phenolic compounds 14 galacturonic acids 13 neutral sugars and 7 proteins the soluble fibers content was equal to 56 the ftir spectral analysis suggested that interactions between the sa and ce constituents of the various formulations took place via hydrogen bonds and or covalent bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the two polymers the rheological analysis carried out on the ce based gelled sa beads indicated more stable behavior than that for beads reinforced by pva the use of a statistical model in the elimination of pcp at ph 6 yielded a positive response on the porosity of the ce based gelled beads which proved to be as effective as cc based beads these biocomposite beads have been characterized as spherical relatively homogeneous in size and chemically stable sem observation showed a porous morphology with well encapsulated sorbent particles and a rough structure with heterogeneously sized pores these results clearly confirm the good sorption efficiency of this new generation of material with an adsorption capacity of 129 0 1 mg g 1 in our experimental conditions

13142,removal of cryptosporidium protozoa by granular media filtration is a critical step in conventional multi barrier drinking water treatment and turbidity is commonly used to monitor system performance we assessed the efficiencies of 3 different filter media at removing a cryptosporidium parvum surrogate comprising glycoprotein coated 4 5 μm polystyrene microspheres and evaluated the responses of turbidity levels to surrogate concentrations field trials were performed using pilot scale rapid sand filters comprising anthracite pumice or engineered ceramic sand while simulating a typical water treatment plant s operational conditions data from 44 trials indicated that the surrogate s log10 reduction values lrvs based on the peak concentrations were 3 in 100 70 and 41 of the trials with the ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively the lrvs achieved in the ceramic sand filter trials 4 44 0 38 were significantly greater than those in the pumice sand 3 21 0 30 and anthracite 3 01 0 70 filter trials p 0 00001 correlations p 0 05 between turbidity levels and surrogate concentrations were observed in 17 44 and 29 of 51 trials involving the ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively at peak surrogate breakthrough the filtered water contained hundreds to thousands of surrogate particles l but the turbidity levels were 0 1 ntu in 63 and 71 of the trials with pumice and anthracite filters respectively in contrast despite the ceramic sand filter achieving lrvs 3 consistently the peak turbidity levels exceeded 0 30 ntu in 17 of the trials our findings highlight the need to introduce supplementary tools alongside turbidity to monitor filter performance more sensitively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cryptosporidium surrogate filtration log10 reduction value turbidity 1 introduction drinking water contamination by cryptosporidium spp including cryptosporidium parvum and cryptosporidium hominis poses a serious health risk as cryptosporidium oocysts are extremely resistant to chlorination filtration through granular media plays a major role in the removal of cryptosporidium oocysts during conventional drinking water treatment that involves coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection by chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation 1 insufficient oocyst removal during drinking water treatment has caused numerous cryptosporidiosis outbreaks 2 4 during the cryptosporidiosis outbreak in milwaukee in 1993 more than 400 000 people were infected by a contaminated drinking water supply 5 to ensure safe drinking water supplies the filtration efficiencies of treatment systems need to be determined to optimise filter operations and better plan disinfection steps much attention has been given to the study of cryptosporidium removal in real scale water treatment operations 1 6 8 and in pilot scale experiments 9 15 as pathogen monitoring and testing are expensive the current practices used to assess cryptosporidium removal during water treatment rely largely on the use of turbidity as a performance measure however the endpoint turbidity level does not measure the filtration efficiency directly nor does it indicate the oocyst removal level that may be achieved 16 to assess cryptosporidium removal through granular media filtration researchers have used bacterial spores 17 21 and unmodified oocyst sized carboxylated polystyrene microspheres 22 25 as surrogates as bacterial spores are indigenous they can be used in real scale filtration operations but the use of microspheres is limited to pilot plants and laboratory studies bacterial spores are easy to culture and they share some characteristics with oocysts in terms of their biology and survivability 17 but compared with oocysts bacterial spores are smaller generally more negatively charged and they have greater density 17 moreover unlike oocysts which are spherical or oval bacterial spores are rod shaped as a result of their different physiochemical properties studies have found that bacterial spores underestimate oocyst removal in rapid granular filtration as indicated in a review by hijnen and medema 26 unmodified microspheres are commercially available and easy to detect and could have precise size shape and buoyant density similar to oocysts however compared to oocysts unmodified carboxylated polystyrene microspheres are significantly more negatively charged 22 24 27 28 and they are markedly more hydrophobic 27 and they do not have a macromolecular structure like the oocysts as such the ability of oocyst sized microspheres to mimic oocyst removal by filtration in porous media varies greatly depending on the experimental conditions brown and emelko 23 observed that oocyst sized microspheres appeared to be reasonable indicators of c parvum oocyst removal by in line filtration preceded by alum and ferric chloride coagulation but not by chitosan coagulation while emelko et al 29 found that oocyst sized microspheres were good surrogates for oocyst filtration removal in pilot scale sand anthracite dual media filters emelko et al 30 reported that they were poor surrogates in pilot scale engineered ceramic sand filters recently biomolecule modified carboxylated polystyrene microspheres have been used as alternative cryptosporidium surrogates in filtration studies 27 28 31 32 the new surrogates not only mimic the size density and shape of c parvum oocysts but also their surface charge and surface macromolecules 28 as well as their hydrophobicity 27 pang et al 28 used glycoprotein or biotin to modify the surfaces of microspheres because these biomolecules and c parvum share very similar isoelectric points and glycoprotein is the predominant macromolecule on the oocysts surfaces the findings from laboratory studies conducted under different experimental conditions demonstrated that biomolecule modified microspheres significantly outperformed unmodified microspheres in relation to mimicking the filtration removal of oocysts 27 28 31 glycoprotein modified microspheres were also validated in a pilot scale study involving conventional coagulation and filtration through sand anthracite dual media by monis et al 16 these investigators found that the modified microspheres matched the oocysts coagulation and filtration log10 reduction values lrvs more closely than those of clostridium spores chlorella algae bacteria and turbidity these promising findings suggest that biomolecule modified oocyst sized microspheres can be used as more representative but not conservative surrogates than unmodified microspheres to evaluate oocyst removal in filter media and to optimise water treatment systems the selection of effective filter media is important to optimise protozoan removal during filtration traditional silica sand anthracite activated carbon and in particular silica sand anthracite dual media have been most widely used in rapid sand filters most studies that have evaluated oocyst or surrogate removal in rapid sand filters have focused on these conventional filtration media as indicated in the review by emelko et al 7 over the last 2 decades efforts have been made to explore the use of alternative filter media to improve filter performance 33 34 engineered ceramic sand 30 35 36 and low cost pumice sand 37 38 are among the most promising alternative filter media due to their high surface areas great surface roughness and porous structures and they provide better turbidity removal than conventional filter media although a vast amount of information is available on these media for their removal of metals and organic contaminants 37 39 41 and to less degree turbidity or solid removal data that directly compare their protozoan removal efficiencies with conventional media are rare to address the knowledge gaps discussed above the primary objective of this study was to compare the relative removal efficiencies of a cryptosporidium surrogate which was in the form of glycoprotein coated carboxylated polystyrene microspheres in dual media filters comprising silica sand with anthracite engineered ceramic sand or pumice sand in a pilot filtration plant when the filters were vulnerable to particle breakthroughs the study s secondary objective was to examine the sensitivity of turbidity measured in line in response to the surrogate s particle concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate synthesis carboxylated blue excitation 360 nm emission 407 nm 4 50 μm polystyrene microspheres were purchased from polysciences inc warrington pa usa the size shape and buoyant density 1 05 g cm3 of these microspheres are similar to those of cryptosporidium oocysts which are spherical or oval 3 9 5 9 μm in diameter 42 and have an average buoyant density of 1 075 0 005 g cm3 43 the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate which was developed by pang et al 28 was synthesised by covalently coupling the microspheres with α1 acid glycoprotein milliporesigma burlington ma usa adapting the method described in technote 205 from bangs laboratories inc 44 a water soluble carbodiimide cross linker namely 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride edc was used to couple the glycoprotein to the microspheres glycoprotein and c parvum oocysts have similar isoelectric points at ph 2 28 and glycoprotein is the predominant macromolecule on oocysts cell walls briefly 4 ml microspheres were centrifuged and washed 3 times in 10 ml 2 n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes buffer ph 5 3 followed by vortexing and sonication with edc 100 mg the suspension was centrifuged and washed 3 times in 50 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 during the last wash 20 mg glycoprotein was dissolved in 5 ml pbs and the mixture allowed to react at room temperate for 4 h with constant mixing using an orbital shaker subsequently the suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml glycine 35 mm with a bovine serum albumin bsa blocker 0 5 w v and it was mixed gently using an orbital shaker the solution was centrifuged again and resuspended in the storage buffer that comprised 10 ml pbs containing 0 05 bsa as a blocker the final solution containing the modified microspheres was stored at 4 c until use the surrogate s zeta potentials were determined in triplicate in 1 mm sodium chloride nacl at ph 7 using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments malvern uk 2 2 filter media over half of new zealand s population receives drinking water from water treatment plants wtps that use rapid sand filtration most wtps use imported anthracite filter media but some plants also use imported engineered ceramic sand filter media or new zealand pumice sand the anthracite was sourced from james cumming sons pty ltd parramatta australia the silica filter sand and imported macrolite engineered ceramic sand kinetico macrolite ceramic spheres kinetico water systems newbury oh usa were supplied by filtec ltd wellington new zealand and the silicon sponge pumice sand was provided by silicon industries nz ltd hamilton new zealand anthracite is a high quality coal that consists of hard and durable coal particles the silica filter sand comprised hard grained quartz or pure silica sand the macrolite engineered ceramic sand comprised nepheline syenite primarily 85 95 and minor amounts of aluminium oxide 1 15 bentonite 3 5 and silicon carbide 1 3 45 macrolite spheres are durable and chemically inert the silicon sponge pumice sand is durable and was manufactured from new zealand pumice volcanic aluminium silicate using natural modification processes including high temperature sterilisation 46 the effective grain sizes d10 median grain sizes d50 and uniformity coefficients d60 d10 of the filter media were characterised using standard sieve analyses and their bulk densities were determined from the dry weights of sand media in given volumes supplementary table s1 the d10 d50 and d60 values represent the diameters on grain size distribution curves that correspond with 10 50 and 60 finer grains respectively the filter media were classified as coarse sand based on their d10 values or very coarse sand based on their d50 values 2 3 pilot filtration plant in this study a pilot filtration plant was established at the branxholme water treatment plant invercargill new zealand the pilot filtration plant was designed by lutra ltd wellington new zealand and constructed by aqua installation maintenance ltd wellington new zealand the wtp treats water sourced from the oreti river the pilot plant s feedwater came from the wtp s clarifiers post coagulation with polyaluminium chloride pacl or alum hence it was part of the coagulation sedimentation filtration treatment train the pilot plant supplementary fig s1 replicated the function of a rapid gravity filter the filter 15 cm diameter contained 1 m of granular media 70 cm filter media and 20 cm silica sand supported by 10 cm pea gravel and it had a 40 cm water column head after packing the filter was conditioned for at least 2 weeks before the first surrogate spiking experiment during normal operations a header tank placed at 5 73 m fed the filter surrogate spiking was achieved through a funnel inlet via a t joint controlled by ball valves at 5 43 m above the filter water flowed downwards through the filter bed and the filtered water collected in an underdrain where it exited through a tube that was used for sample collection the pilot plant was equipped with an in line turbidity sensor hach ultraturb plus hach company loveland co usa controller hach ultrapure digital controller sc200 and pressure indicators at the inlet and outlet the in line turbidity sensor was installed after 10 trials involving the anthracite filter the turbidity meters at the pilot plant and the municipal wtp were calibrated regularly at the same time backwashes with air scouring were conducted on average every 3 4 days to clean the filter media backwashing was performed when the filter reached a nominal head loss determined by the differential pressure 5 10 kpa or when a high turbidity reading of 0 1 nephelometric turbidity units ntu was recorded the pilot plant operated continuously for 16 months and was managed by invercargill city council s wtp staff 2 4 pilot trials for each filter medium 3 types of trial were performed at constant flow rates with spiking solutions 5 l of the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate namely 1 single spiking trials which were conducted mostly at 0 5 h after backwashing to evaluate surrogate removal efficiencies when the filters were vulnerable to protozoan breakthrough 2 multiple spiking time series trials at 0 5 1 2 and 3 h after backwashing to examine a filter s performance during ripening and 3 spiking after excessive backwashing trials which were conducted at 0 5 h after 2 consecutive backwashes at the end of multiple spiking time series trials to examine a filter s performance under excessive backwashing conditions in new zealand most wtps that include sand filtration use filtration rates of between 1 4 and 9 3 m h for the anthracite filter the trials were conducted at high 8 m h and low 2 m h filtration rates that corresponded with flow rates of 2 3 l min and 0 6 l min respectively and high 104 105 particles ml and low 102 103 particles ml surrogate concentrations to examine the effects of the flow rate and surrogate concentration on filtration removal seeding these surrogate concentrations ensured that the log10 reductions could be measured properly if the surrogate concentrations in the filter effluent were too low or could not be detected the log10 reductions could not be determined accurately all trials involving the pumice and ceramic sand filters were conducted at high filtration rates and low surrogate concentrations the field trials were performed under operational conditions that were similar to those used at the municipal branxholme water treatment plant before the trials involving the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate salt water tracer experiments during which 5 l of 500 mg l nacl were injected were conducted to establish the flow pattern and expedite better sampling schedule designs for the surrogate trials the nacl concentrations were measured in situ by using a hach hq14d conductivity meter hach company loveland co usa during each surrogate challenge experiment the surrogate injection solution was freshly prepared by thoroughly mixing the surrogate stock solution 1 ml with 5 l feedwater from the clarifiers and it was spiked into the filter through the funnel inlet the injections took 2 35 0 22 min during the high flow trials and 9 17 0 67 min during the low flow trials the injections were followed by filter flushing with tracer free feedwater supplied from the header tank for each surrogate trial the samples were collected continuously for the entire experimental duration from the filter outlet at a volume of 1 1 6 l sample at 1 min intervals for up to 30 min during the high flow rate trials and at 2 min intervals for 60 min during the low flow rate trials the water samples were couriered overnight from invercargill to christchurch new zealand stored in the dark at room temperature and processed no later than 2 weeks after their collection the surrogate particles were captured by filtering the water samples through whatman nuclepore polycarbonate filters with 2 μm pores wha110656 merck kgaa darmstadt germany under a vacuum the filters were then imaged by using epifluorescence microscopy leica microsystems wetzlar germany 20 images sample at 100 magnification and enumerated using imagej software 47 supplementary fig s2 shows an image of the surrogate particles the ph electrical conductivity and turbidity of the feedwater samples were measured at invercargill city council s water testing laboratory using an orion 250a ph meter thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa with a thermo scientific ross sure flow ph electrode hach hq14d conductivity meter with a hach cdc401 conductivity probe and a hach turbidimeter 2400 n that measured turbidity using the ratio on mode according to usepa method 180 1 the dissolved non purgeable organic carbon content of the feedwater samples was determined by eurofins els ltd wellington new zealand using a shimadzu toc v csh total organic carbon analyzer according to the apha 22nd edition 5310b c and astm d2579 d4839 the injection solutions zeta potentials were analysed by using a zetasizer nano zs table 1 shows the experimental conditions 2 5 data analysis using the concentration breakthrough curves from the individual trials supplementary fig s3 the efficiencies of surrogate removal were evaluated using the lrvs based on the relative peak concentrations and log10 mass reduction values lmrs based on the total mass recoveries 1 lrv log 10 c 0 c max 2 lmr log 10 m 0 m samples log 10 m 0 i 0 n c i v i where c0 is the input concentration cmax is the peak concentration of the filtered water m0 is the input mass msamples is the accumulative mass recovered in continuously collected samples ci is the sample concentration and vi is the sample volume although the lrv is the term most used by the water treatment industry and the lmrs and lrvs showed similar trends we considered that the lmr was a more reliable and representative performance measure as it was based on the cumulative mass recovered from all of the samples whereas the lrv was based on the peak concentration determined from a single sample thus we have presented both the lrvs and lmrs an lrv or lmr of 1 2 or 3 is equivalent to a 90 99 or 99 9 reduction in the concentration or mass respectively the lrvs and lmrs from the trials involving the individual filter media types and the surrogate under different experimental conditions were then analysed and their mean and standard deviation values and the percentages of the trials with lrvs 3 or lmrs 3 were determined as the frequencies of the lrvs and lmrs showed approximately normal distributions section 3 1 2 sample student s t tests with unequal variances were performed to compare differences in the mean lrvs and lmrs under different conditions a value of p 0 05 was considered significantly different the responses of the turbidity levels to the surrogate concentrations were evaluated using simple linear regression analyses of the datasets that had the same time intervals and durations for the high flow trials the turbidity recordings and water sampling were at 1 min intervals for the low flow trials the water sampling was at 2 min intervals thus the 2 min average turbidity levels were used in the regression analyses a value of p 0 05 indicated that the turbidity levels and surrogate concentrations were significantly correlated the r2 values represent the fractions of the variabilities in the turbidity data that can be explained by variations in the surrogate concentrations in addition the peak breakthrough times of the surrogate and turbidity were compared for each experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter media efficiencies derived from single spiking trials the surrogate concentration breakthrough curves from the individual trials supplementary fig s3 were analysed regarding their lrvs and lmrs fig 1 and they were then statistically summarised according to the different groups table 2 supplementary fig s4 the lrvs and lmrs derived from the individual trials were examined for their frequencies table 3 and distributions supplementary fig s5 and they were used in t tests to compare the results obtained under different experimental conditions supplementary table s2 these results are discussed below the ceramic sand filter displayed the highest cryptosporidium surrogate removal efficiency lrv 4 40 0 38 lmr 4 19 0 33 and the lrvs and lmrs were 3 in 100 of the trials table 2 the lrvs and lmrs achieved in the ceramic sand filter trials were significantly greater p 0 00001 than those achieved in the anthracite and pumice sand filter trials table 2 supplementary table s2 the lrv 3 21 0 30 and lmr 2 97 0 30 from the pumice sand filter trials did not differ significantly p 0 32 from those in the anthracite filter trials lrv 3 01 0 70 lmr 2 81 0 69 table 2 supplementary table s2 however the pumice sand filter trials yielded higher frequencies of lrvs 3 70 and lmrs 3 50 than the anthracite filter trials 41 and 36 respectively table 2 supplementary fig s5 variations in filter performance were greater in the anthracite trials than in the ceramic and pumice sand trials fig 1 table 2 supplementary figs s4 and s5 the frequencies of the lrvs and lmrs table 3 showed approximately normal distributions supplementary fig s5 thus t tests were appropriate for the statistical analyses the oocyst surrogate s lrvs mean 3 01 0 70 range 1 65 4 61 for the sand anthracite dual media filter are very similar to the cryptosporidium oocyst lrvs summarised in the review by emelko et al 7 from pilot scale studies involving conventional rapid filtration through sand anthracite dual media that are as follows 2 0 5 0 10 1 9 4 0 12 1 7 4 3 14 1 6 3 4 15 and an average lrv of 2 8 13 the results from our experiments showed that the average lrv for the macrolite engineered ceramic media filter 4 40 0 38 was 1 38 log10 greater than that for the sand anthracite dual media filter 3 02 0 28 under the similar experimental conditions namely pacl coagulation and a flow rate of 8 m h table 2 this finding concurs with emelko et al 30 and scott 35 who used macrolite engineered ceramic media filters and conventional sand anthracite dual media filters emelko et al 30 found that engineered ceramic media could improve oocyst sized microsphere removal by up to 1 5 log10 compared with conventional filtration scott 35 reported that oocyst removals in engineered ceramic media achieved lrvs that were up to 1 25 log10 greater than those achieved using conventional media when the raw water was pre treated with pacl the observed differences in surrogate removal in the different filters may be explained by the properties of the filter media the superior performance of the engineered ceramic sand could be attributed to its high surface roughness and high surface area 35 36 because these properties enhance particle removal compared with conventional filter media macrolite ceramic spheres have markedly higher surface areas the surface areas of pores 0 5 μm are 0 139 0 329 m2 cm3 for 0 55 1 2 mm macrolite ceramic spheres 0 0154 m2 cm3 for 0 9 mm anthracite and 0 0121 m2 cm3 for 0 5 mm silica filter sand 48 pumice sand also has a high porosity and high surface area and thermally modified silicon sponge pumice has a specific surface area of 10 m2 g and an irregular surface texture 46 information describing the specific surface areas of the other filter media used in this study was not available from the suppliers for reference purposes 0 83 0 88 mm anthracite with a carbon content of 73 85 has a specific surface area of 1 m2 g 49 and 0 60 mm silica sand comprising 99 sio2 has a specific surface area of 0 83 m2 g 50 the ceramic and pumice sand filter media also comprised smaller effective grain sizes d10 0 60 and d10 0 61 mm respectively than the anthracite filter media d10 0 81 mm supplementary table s1 thus they contained smaller pore sizes and achieved greater filtration removal of the particles the surface charges of the filter media are another important factor that influence particle removal however accurately determining the zeta potentials of granular porous media requires the use of a streaming potential analyser or a zetaprobe analyser which were unavailable for this study 3 2 effects of experimental conditions on surrogate removal as the study was conducted over 16 months 2 different batches of microspheres with different lot numbers were purchased and used for surrogate synthesis the zeta potentials of the surrogates synthesised from these microsphere batches differed batch 1 43 20 2 23 mv batch 2 17 2 0 90 mv two independent investigators validated the consistency and reproducibility of these results we suspected that the number of carboxyl groups on the 2 batches of microspheres differed which resulted in the zeta potentials varying between the surrogate batches synthesised the anthracite filter trials were conducted using both surrogate batches while the ceramic and pumice sand filter trials were conducted using surrogate batch 2 although the surrogate stocks from batches 1 and 2 differed regarding their zeta potentials the injection solutions zeta potentials were very similar in the trials conducted using different filters table 1 because the surrogate stocks 1 ml zeta potentials were moderated by the feedwater 5 l after mixing when surrogate batches 1 and 2 were used in the anthracite filter trials conducted at high flow rates using pacl coagulation the lrvs and lmrs fig 1 table 2 supplementary fig s4 did not differ significantly p 0 78 supplementary table s2 the lrvs and lmrs determined from the anthracite filter trials fig 1 table 2 supplementary fig s4 did not differ significantly when high or low filtration rates and high or low surrogate concentrations were used or when alum or pacl coagulants were used in the main wtp all p 0 14 supplementary table s2 likewise using different coagulants in the main wtp did not generate significantly different lrvs and lmrs in the pumice sand filter trials p 0 66 in addition the water chemistry ph dissolved organic carbon conductivity zeta potential turbidity of the feedwater and injection solutions remained on average relatively constant during the study period table 1 and showed no clear correlations with surrogate removal it is important to note that as our experiments were conducted during the initial operating periods soon after backwashing and the experimental data are limited the aforementioned observations do not reflect filtration mechanisms at stable operating conditions for example particle filtration removal in granular media is found to reduce as flow rates increase 7 32 51 because a flow rate increase could facilitate the detachment of those particles that are weakly attached to the surfaces of the granular media 33 however harrington et al 9 undertook a study involving pilot scale conventional treatment with anthracite sand dual media filtration and their results were similar to those from this study they found that in general filtration rates had no observable effects on the removal of c parvum oocysts spores and escherichia coli across flow rates that ranged from 1 4 to 5 4 mm s 5 19 m h scott 35 found that flow rates of 9 8 m h and 24 4 m h did not appear to significantly impact upon the removal of cryptosporidium oocysts by filtration in pilot scale engineered ceramic sand filters when pacl coagulation was used although higher flow rates appeared to contribute to lower cryptosporidium oocyst removal rates when alum coagulation was used likewise a review by emelko et al 7 reported that sudden hydraulic changes had different effects on cryptosporidium filtration removal that ranged from no effect to severely reduced removals relative to those observed during stable operating conditions our study s results suggest that the surrogate removal efficiency was clearly related to the type of filter media and that the ceramic sand filter showed the greatest removal efficiency as changes in other parameters did not significantly affect the surrogate removal efficiency in the context of the experimental conditions employed the results obtained from the trials conducted under different conditions can be analysed together according to the type of filter media used table 2 3 3 filter media efficiencies derived from multiple spiking trials during filter ripening and excessive backwash trials fig 2 shows the results from the multiple injection time series trials conducted at 0 5 1 2 and 3 h after backwashing during filter ripening the lrvs and lmrs determined from the anthracite and pumice sand filters increased progressively in power functions by at least 1 log10 within 2 5 h in contrast the lrvs and lmrs determined from the ceramic sand filter remained relatively constant over 0 5 2 h and only increased at 3 h after backwashing hence the ripening periods for surrogate removal were 3 h after backwashing for all of the filters used the findings from the surrogate spiking trials of all 3 filters conducted at 30 min after 2 consecutive backwashes showed that excessive backwashing reduced the filtration efficiency significantly fig 3 with lrv and lmr reductions of 0 7 2 3 log10 note that there were no pressure changes or head losses following backwashing during the 3 h multiple spiking time series trials the same was true for the single spiking experiments that were mostly conducted at 0 5 h after backwashing although the single spiking trials and excessive backwashing trials were conducted before the filters matured that is when they were vulnerable to protozoan breakthrough the lrvs and lmrs determined in this study may not represent worst case scenarios because most of these trials were conducted at 30 min after backwashing however in practice many wtp filters are returned to service directly or very soon after backwashing to save operational costs and as long as the turbidity levels after filtration do not exceed the drinking water guideline thresholds the water is acceptable to wtp operators 3 4 responses of turbidity levels to cryptosporidium surrogate concentrations in the filtered water linear regression analyses of the data from 51 trials supplementary figs s6 s8 showed significant correlations between the turbidity levels and the surrogate concentrations p 0 05 in the filtered water in only 17 r2 0 22 0 45 44 r2 0 24 0 81 and 29 r2 0 38 0 80 of the trials involving ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively table 4 agreements between the surrogate concentrations and turbidity levels in the context of the peak breakthrough times where the differences were 2 min were identified in 39 44 and 19 of the trials involving ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively table 4 in addition to the surrogate particles other factors may have contributed to the variations in the turbidity levels of the filtered water including background particles in the feedwater from the clarifiers and experimental and operational factors some operational factors can affect turbidity in filtered water and cause turbidity spikes including air bubbles flow rate fluctuations colour and dissolved organic carbon 52 53 as described previously the correlation between the surrogate concentrations and turbidity levels in the filtered water was closer for the pumice sand filter than the correlations determined for the anthracite and ceramic sand filters table 4 supplementary figs s6 s8 the pumice sand filter was associated with generally lower and more stable turbidity levels than those associated with the anthracite and ceramic sand filters fig 4 which suggests the pumice sand filter was better at buffering turbidity variations farizoglu et al 38 also reported that pumice was better at reducing turbidity than sand the peak turbidity levels in the filtered water from the pumice sand filter were 0 14 ntu in 100 of the trials and 0 1 ntu in 81 of the trials in comparison the peak turbidity levels in the water from the ceramic sand filter were higher 0 3 ntu in 17 of the trials and 0 1 ntu in 61 of the trials and more variable figs 4 5 despite its superior performance at surrogate removal notably the drinking water standards for new zealand 54 require that turbidity levels in the filtered water of continuously monitored systems do not exceed 0 3 ntu for 5 of the time on the other hand the water from the anthracite filter tended to display low peak turbidity levels 0 1 ntu in 76 of the trials mostly 0 18 ntu except for 1 trial especially in the trials conducted at the low filtration rates 0 02 0 07 ntu but its surrogate removal efficiencies were relatively low these findings imply that low turbidity levels do not necessarily indicate high levels of particle removal and vice versa note that the in line turbidity data for the anthracite filter table 4 figs 4 5 supplementary fig s8 were generated during the low surrogate concentration trials as the in line turbidity meter was not available for the first 10 trials which included all the high surrogate concentration trials section 2 3 all of the trials of the ceramic and pumice sand filters were conducted with low surrogate concentrations despite satisfactory levels of surrogate removal high surrogate particle concentrations were observed in the filtered water as a consequence of the high surrogate concentrations seeded in the trials 102 105 particles ml to ensure that the log10 reductions could be measured properly at the peak surrogate breakthroughs the peak turbidity levels were 0 1 ntu in 33 63 and 71 of the trials conducted using ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively even though the filtered water contained hundreds to thousands of surrogate particles l table 4 similarly in the study undertaken by eisnor et al 55 the turbidity levels in the filtered water in the wtps were 0 1 ntu despite concentrations of 20 000 particles l these findings also suggest that low turbidity levels do not necessarily indicate low particle concentrations other investigators have also reported variable degrees of correlation between protozoan concentrations and turbidity in different settings some researchers have reported good correlations in some systems while others have reported poor or no correlations in other systems for example heller et al 56 found no correlation between turbidity and protozoan concentrations in the effluent from slow sand filters nascimento et al 11 observed that removal of cryptosporidium oocysts was not correlated with turbidity but was correlated with particles of 2 7 μm during ripening in direct filtration he and nan 57 reported that while particles 5μm correlated with water turbidity particles 5μm showed weak correlations with turbidity based on the findings from this and other studies we can conclude that a correlation between the protozoan concentration and turbidity established in one system cannot be applied to other systems without validation protozoa can break through filters even when the turbidity is within guideline levels 58 60 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have occurred when the treated water turbidity levels were 0 24 ntu 61 0 17 ntu 62 and 0 1 ntu 56 the results from this and other studies indicate that other monitoring tools may be helpful supplements to turbidity monitoring therefore we recommend that indigenous microbial surrogates such as bacterial spores 56 63 are monitored to help with assessing the removal of persistent oo cysts in filter beds 4 conclusions and recommendations our study s findings demonstrated that the ceramic sand filter was significantly more effective at removing the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate than the anthracite and pumice sand filters and that the anthracite filter showed the greatest variation regarding surrogate removal efficiency the filters ripening times were 3 h and excessive backwashing reduced the filtration efficiency significantly the data describing the media filtration efficiencies could help wtp operators improve their practices for ensuring drinking water safety this could be achieved for example by using more effective filter media allowing sufficient time for the water to run to waste after backwashing before the filter is brought back on line and incorporating additional post filtration treatments our data showed that the turbidity levels in the filtered water did not reliably indicate cryptosporidium surrogate breakthroughs and surrogate particle concentrations hence low turbidity does not necessarily indicate high levels of particle removal and vice versa as turbidity is a non specific parameter it may not be applicable to the removal of specific particles such as oocysts we recommend that in addition to turbidity monitoring indigenous microbial surrogates such as bacterial spores are monitored to alert wtp to changes in drinking water quality earlier and to help with assessing the removal of persistent oo cysts in filter beds it should be noted that although glycoprotein coated polystyrene microspheres can be used as an alternative surrogate for oocyst filtration removal like unmodified polystyrene microsphere surrogates their uses are limited to experimental studies for research purposes or for selection design purposes to assess real scale filter operations surrogates comprising food grade materials must be used we have embarked on this research and have recently developed a legionella surrogate using food grade alginate which is extracted from seaweed for use in engineered water systems 64 this approach can be also used to develop oocyst surrogates

13142,removal of cryptosporidium protozoa by granular media filtration is a critical step in conventional multi barrier drinking water treatment and turbidity is commonly used to monitor system performance we assessed the efficiencies of 3 different filter media at removing a cryptosporidium parvum surrogate comprising glycoprotein coated 4 5 μm polystyrene microspheres and evaluated the responses of turbidity levels to surrogate concentrations field trials were performed using pilot scale rapid sand filters comprising anthracite pumice or engineered ceramic sand while simulating a typical water treatment plant s operational conditions data from 44 trials indicated that the surrogate s log10 reduction values lrvs based on the peak concentrations were 3 in 100 70 and 41 of the trials with the ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively the lrvs achieved in the ceramic sand filter trials 4 44 0 38 were significantly greater than those in the pumice sand 3 21 0 30 and anthracite 3 01 0 70 filter trials p 0 00001 correlations p 0 05 between turbidity levels and surrogate concentrations were observed in 17 44 and 29 of 51 trials involving the ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively at peak surrogate breakthrough the filtered water contained hundreds to thousands of surrogate particles l but the turbidity levels were 0 1 ntu in 63 and 71 of the trials with pumice and anthracite filters respectively in contrast despite the ceramic sand filter achieving lrvs 3 consistently the peak turbidity levels exceeded 0 30 ntu in 17 of the trials our findings highlight the need to introduce supplementary tools alongside turbidity to monitor filter performance more sensitively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cryptosporidium surrogate filtration log10 reduction value turbidity 1 introduction drinking water contamination by cryptosporidium spp including cryptosporidium parvum and cryptosporidium hominis poses a serious health risk as cryptosporidium oocysts are extremely resistant to chlorination filtration through granular media plays a major role in the removal of cryptosporidium oocysts during conventional drinking water treatment that involves coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection by chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation 1 insufficient oocyst removal during drinking water treatment has caused numerous cryptosporidiosis outbreaks 2 4 during the cryptosporidiosis outbreak in milwaukee in 1993 more than 400 000 people were infected by a contaminated drinking water supply 5 to ensure safe drinking water supplies the filtration efficiencies of treatment systems need to be determined to optimise filter operations and better plan disinfection steps much attention has been given to the study of cryptosporidium removal in real scale water treatment operations 1 6 8 and in pilot scale experiments 9 15 as pathogen monitoring and testing are expensive the current practices used to assess cryptosporidium removal during water treatment rely largely on the use of turbidity as a performance measure however the endpoint turbidity level does not measure the filtration efficiency directly nor does it indicate the oocyst removal level that may be achieved 16 to assess cryptosporidium removal through granular media filtration researchers have used bacterial spores 17 21 and unmodified oocyst sized carboxylated polystyrene microspheres 22 25 as surrogates as bacterial spores are indigenous they can be used in real scale filtration operations but the use of microspheres is limited to pilot plants and laboratory studies bacterial spores are easy to culture and they share some characteristics with oocysts in terms of their biology and survivability 17 but compared with oocysts bacterial spores are smaller generally more negatively charged and they have greater density 17 moreover unlike oocysts which are spherical or oval bacterial spores are rod shaped as a result of their different physiochemical properties studies have found that bacterial spores underestimate oocyst removal in rapid granular filtration as indicated in a review by hijnen and medema 26 unmodified microspheres are commercially available and easy to detect and could have precise size shape and buoyant density similar to oocysts however compared to oocysts unmodified carboxylated polystyrene microspheres are significantly more negatively charged 22 24 27 28 and they are markedly more hydrophobic 27 and they do not have a macromolecular structure like the oocysts as such the ability of oocyst sized microspheres to mimic oocyst removal by filtration in porous media varies greatly depending on the experimental conditions brown and emelko 23 observed that oocyst sized microspheres appeared to be reasonable indicators of c parvum oocyst removal by in line filtration preceded by alum and ferric chloride coagulation but not by chitosan coagulation while emelko et al 29 found that oocyst sized microspheres were good surrogates for oocyst filtration removal in pilot scale sand anthracite dual media filters emelko et al 30 reported that they were poor surrogates in pilot scale engineered ceramic sand filters recently biomolecule modified carboxylated polystyrene microspheres have been used as alternative cryptosporidium surrogates in filtration studies 27 28 31 32 the new surrogates not only mimic the size density and shape of c parvum oocysts but also their surface charge and surface macromolecules 28 as well as their hydrophobicity 27 pang et al 28 used glycoprotein or biotin to modify the surfaces of microspheres because these biomolecules and c parvum share very similar isoelectric points and glycoprotein is the predominant macromolecule on the oocysts surfaces the findings from laboratory studies conducted under different experimental conditions demonstrated that biomolecule modified microspheres significantly outperformed unmodified microspheres in relation to mimicking the filtration removal of oocysts 27 28 31 glycoprotein modified microspheres were also validated in a pilot scale study involving conventional coagulation and filtration through sand anthracite dual media by monis et al 16 these investigators found that the modified microspheres matched the oocysts coagulation and filtration log10 reduction values lrvs more closely than those of clostridium spores chlorella algae bacteria and turbidity these promising findings suggest that biomolecule modified oocyst sized microspheres can be used as more representative but not conservative surrogates than unmodified microspheres to evaluate oocyst removal in filter media and to optimise water treatment systems the selection of effective filter media is important to optimise protozoan removal during filtration traditional silica sand anthracite activated carbon and in particular silica sand anthracite dual media have been most widely used in rapid sand filters most studies that have evaluated oocyst or surrogate removal in rapid sand filters have focused on these conventional filtration media as indicated in the review by emelko et al 7 over the last 2 decades efforts have been made to explore the use of alternative filter media to improve filter performance 33 34 engineered ceramic sand 30 35 36 and low cost pumice sand 37 38 are among the most promising alternative filter media due to their high surface areas great surface roughness and porous structures and they provide better turbidity removal than conventional filter media although a vast amount of information is available on these media for their removal of metals and organic contaminants 37 39 41 and to less degree turbidity or solid removal data that directly compare their protozoan removal efficiencies with conventional media are rare to address the knowledge gaps discussed above the primary objective of this study was to compare the relative removal efficiencies of a cryptosporidium surrogate which was in the form of glycoprotein coated carboxylated polystyrene microspheres in dual media filters comprising silica sand with anthracite engineered ceramic sand or pumice sand in a pilot filtration plant when the filters were vulnerable to particle breakthroughs the study s secondary objective was to examine the sensitivity of turbidity measured in line in response to the surrogate s particle concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate synthesis carboxylated blue excitation 360 nm emission 407 nm 4 50 μm polystyrene microspheres were purchased from polysciences inc warrington pa usa the size shape and buoyant density 1 05 g cm3 of these microspheres are similar to those of cryptosporidium oocysts which are spherical or oval 3 9 5 9 μm in diameter 42 and have an average buoyant density of 1 075 0 005 g cm3 43 the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate which was developed by pang et al 28 was synthesised by covalently coupling the microspheres with α1 acid glycoprotein milliporesigma burlington ma usa adapting the method described in technote 205 from bangs laboratories inc 44 a water soluble carbodiimide cross linker namely 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride edc was used to couple the glycoprotein to the microspheres glycoprotein and c parvum oocysts have similar isoelectric points at ph 2 28 and glycoprotein is the predominant macromolecule on oocysts cell walls briefly 4 ml microspheres were centrifuged and washed 3 times in 10 ml 2 n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes buffer ph 5 3 followed by vortexing and sonication with edc 100 mg the suspension was centrifuged and washed 3 times in 50 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 during the last wash 20 mg glycoprotein was dissolved in 5 ml pbs and the mixture allowed to react at room temperate for 4 h with constant mixing using an orbital shaker subsequently the suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml glycine 35 mm with a bovine serum albumin bsa blocker 0 5 w v and it was mixed gently using an orbital shaker the solution was centrifuged again and resuspended in the storage buffer that comprised 10 ml pbs containing 0 05 bsa as a blocker the final solution containing the modified microspheres was stored at 4 c until use the surrogate s zeta

sizes d10 median grain sizes d50 and uniformity coefficients d60 d10 of the filter media were characterised using standard sieve analyses and their bulk densities were determined from the dry weights of sand media in given volumes supplementary table s1 the d10 d50 and d60 values represent the diameters on grain size distribution curves that correspond with 10 50 and 60 finer grains respectively the filter media were classified as coarse sand based on their d10 values or very coarse sand based on their d50 values 2 3 pilot filtration plant in this study a pilot filtration plant was established at the branxholme water treatment plant invercargill new zealand the pilot filtration plant was designed by lutra ltd wellington new zealand and constructed by aqua installation maintenance ltd wellington new zealand the wtp treats water sourced from the oreti river the pilot plant s feedwater came from the wtp s clarifiers post coagulation with polyaluminium chloride pacl or alum hence it was part of the coagulation sedimentation filtration treatment train the pilot plant supplementary fig s1 replicated the function of a rapid gravity filter the filter 15 cm diameter contained 1 m of granular media 70 cm filter media and 20 cm silica sand supported by 10 cm pea gravel and it had a 40 cm water column head after packing the filter was conditioned for at least 2 weeks before the first surrogate spiking experiment during normal operations a header tank placed at 5 73 m fed the filter surrogate spiking was achieved through a funnel inlet via a t joint controlled by ball valves at 5 43 m above the filter water flowed downwards through the filter bed and the filtered water collected in an underdrain where it exited through a tube that was used for sample collection the pilot plant was equipped with an in line turbidity sensor hach ultraturb plus hach company loveland co usa controller hach ultrapure digital controller sc200 and pressure indicators at the inlet and outlet the in line turbidity sensor was installed after 10 trials involving the anthracite filter the turbidity meters at the pilot plant and the municipal wtp were calibrated regularly at the same time backwashes with air scouring were conducted on average every 3 4 days to clean the filter media backwashing was performed when the filter reached a nominal head loss determined by the differential pressure 5 10 kpa or when a high turbidity reading of 0 1 nephelometric turbidity units ntu was recorded the pilot plant operated continuously for 16 months and was managed by invercargill city council s wtp staff 2 4 pilot trials for each filter medium 3 types of trial were performed at constant flow rates with spiking solutions 5 l of the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate namely 1 single spiking trials which were conducted mostly at 0 5 h after backwashing to evaluate surrogate removal efficiencies when the filters were vulnerable to protozoan breakthrough 2 multiple spiking time series trials at 0 5 1 2 and 3 h after backwashing to examine a filter s performance during ripening and 3 spiking after excessive backwashing trials which were conducted at 0 5 h after 2 consecutive backwashes at the end of multiple spiking time series trials to examine a filter s performance under excessive backwashing conditions in new zealand most wtps that include sand filtration use filtration rates of between 1 4 and 9 3 m h for the anthracite filter the trials were conducted at high 8 m h and low 2 m h filtration rates that corresponded with flow rates of 2 3 l min and 0 6 l min respectively and high 104 105 particles ml and low 102 103 particles ml surrogate concentrations to examine the effects of the flow rate and surrogate concentration on filtration removal seeding these surrogate concentrations ensured that the log10 reductions could be measured properly if the surrogate concentrations in the filter effluent were too low or could not be detected the log10 reductions could not be determined accurately all trials involving the pumice and ceramic sand filters were conducted at high filtration rates and low surrogate concentrations the field trials were performed under operational conditions that were similar to those used at the municipal branxholme water treatment plant before the trials involving the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate salt water tracer experiments during which 5 l of 500 mg l nacl were injected were conducted to establish the flow pattern and expedite better sampling schedule designs for the surrogate trials the nacl concentrations were measured in situ by using a hach hq14d conductivity meter hach company loveland co usa during each surrogate challenge experiment the surrogate injection solution was freshly prepared by thoroughly mixing the surrogate stock solution 1 ml with 5 l feedwater from the clarifiers and it was spiked into the filter through the funnel inlet the injections took 2 35 0 22 min during the high flow trials and 9 17 0 67 min during the low flow trials the injections were followed by filter flushing with tracer free feedwater supplied from the header tank for each surrogate trial the samples were collected continuously for the entire experimental duration from the filter outlet at a volume of 1 1 6 l sample at 1 min intervals for up to 30 min during the high flow rate trials and at 2 min intervals for 60 min during the low flow rate trials the water samples were couriered overnight from invercargill to christchurch new zealand stored in the dark at room temperature and processed no later than 2 weeks after their collection the surrogate particles were captured by filtering the water samples through whatman nuclepore polycarbonate filters with 2 μm pores wha110656 merck kgaa darmstadt germany under a vacuum the filters were then imaged by using epifluorescence microscopy leica microsystems wetzlar germany 20 images sample at 100 magnification and enumerated using imagej software 47 supplementary fig s2 shows an image of the surrogate particles the ph electrical conductivity and turbidity of the feedwater samples were measured at invercargill city council s water testing laboratory using an orion 250a ph meter thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa with a thermo scientific ross sure flow ph electrode hach hq14d conductivity meter with a hach cdc401 conductivity probe and a hach turbidimeter 2400 n that measured turbidity using the ratio on mode according to usepa method 180 1 the dissolved non purgeable organic carbon content of the feedwater samples was determined by eurofins els ltd wellington new zealand using a shimadzu toc v csh total organic carbon analyzer according to the apha 22nd edition 5310b c and astm d2579 d4839 the injection solutions zeta potentials were analysed by using a zetasizer nano zs table 1 shows the experimental conditions 2 5 data analysis using the concentration breakthrough curves from the individual trials supplementary fig s3 the efficiencies of surrogate removal were evaluated using the lrvs based on the relative peak concentrations and log10 mass reduction values lmrs based on the total mass recoveries 1 lrv log 10 c 0 c max 2 lmr log 10 m 0 m samples log 10 m 0 i 0 n c i v i where c0 is the input concentration cmax is the peak concentration of the filtered water m0 is the input mass msamples is the accumulative mass recovered in continuously collected samples ci is the sample concentration and vi is the sample volume although the lrv is the term most used by the water treatment industry and the lmrs and lrvs showed similar trends we considered that the lmr was a more reliable and representative performance measure as it was based on the cumulative mass recovered from all of the samples whereas the lrv was based on the peak concentration determined from a single sample thus we have presented both the lrvs and lmrs an lrv or lmr of 1 2 or 3 is equivalent to a 90 99 or 99 9 reduction in the concentration or mass respectively the lrvs and lmrs from the trials involving the individual filter media types and the surrogate under different experimental conditions were then analysed and their mean and standard deviation values and the percentages of the trials with lrvs 3 or lmrs 3 were determined as the frequencies of the lrvs and lmrs showed approximately normal distributions section 3 1 2 sample student s t tests with unequal variances were performed to compare differences in the mean lrvs and lmrs under different conditions a value of p 0 05 was considered significantly different the responses of the turbidity levels to the surrogate concentrations were evaluated using simple linear regression analyses of the datasets that had the same time intervals and durations for the high flow trials the turbidity recordings and water sampling were at 1 min intervals for the low flow trials the water sampling was at 2 min intervals thus the 2 min average turbidity levels were used in the regression analyses a value of p 0 05 indicated that the turbidity levels and surrogate concentrations were significantly correlated the r2 values represent the fractions of the variabilities in the turbidity data that can be explained by variations in the surrogate concentrations in addition the peak breakthrough times of the surrogate and turbidity were compared for each experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter media efficiencies derived from single spiking trials the surrogate concentration breakthrough curves from the individual trials supplementary fig s3 were analysed regarding their lrvs and lmrs fig 1 and they were then statistically summarised according to the different groups table 2 supplementary fig s4 the lrvs and lmrs derived from the individual trials were examined for their frequencies table 3 and distributions supplementary fig s5 and they were used in t tests to compare the results obtained under different experimental conditions supplementary table s2 these results are discussed below the ceramic sand filter displayed the highest cryptosporidium surrogate removal efficiency lrv 4 40 0 38 lmr

anthracite and pumice sand filter trials table 2 supplementary table s2 the lrv 3 21 0 30 and lmr 2 97 0 30 from the pumice sand filter trials did not differ significantly p 0 32 from those in the anthracite filter trials lrv 3 01 0 70 lmr 2 81 0 69 table 2 supplementary table s2 however the pumice sand filter trials yielded higher frequencies of lrvs 3 70 and lmrs 3 50 than the anthracite filter trials 41 and 36 respectively table 2 supplementary fig s5 variations in filter performance were greater in the anthracite trials than in the ceramic and pumice sand trials fig 1 table 2 supplementary figs s4 and s5 the frequencies of the lrvs and lmrs table 3 showed approximately normal distributions supplementary fig s5 thus t tests were appropriate for the statistical analyses the oocyst surrogate s lrvs mean 3 01 0 70 range 1 65 4 61 for the sand anthracite dual media filter are very similar to the cryptosporidium oocyst lrvs summarised in the review by emelko et al 7 from pilot scale studies involving conventional rapid filtration through sand anthracite dual media that are as follows 2 0 5 0 10 1 9 4 0 12 1 7 4 3 14 1 6 3 4 15 and an average lrv of 2 8 13 the results from our experiments showed that the average lrv for the macrolite engineered ceramic media filter 4 40 0 38 was 1 38 log10 greater than that for the sand anthracite dual media filter 3 02 0 28 under the similar experimental conditions namely pacl coagulation and a flow rate of 8 m h table 2 this finding concurs with emelko et al 30 and scott 35 who used macrolite engineered ceramic media filters and conventional sand anthracite dual media filters emelko et al 30 found that engineered ceramic media could improve oocyst sized microsphere removal by up to 1 5 log10 compared with conventional filtration scott 35 reported that oocyst removals in engineered ceramic media achieved lrvs that were up to 1 25 log10 greater than those achieved using conventional media when the raw water was pre treated with pacl the observed differences in surrogate removal in the different filters may be explained by the properties of the filter media the superior performance of the engineered ceramic sand could be attributed to its high surface roughness and high surface area 35 36 because these properties enhance particle removal compared with conventional filter media macrolite ceramic spheres have markedly higher surface areas the surface areas of pores 0 5 μm are 0 139 0 329 m2 cm3 for 0 55 1 2 mm macrolite ceramic spheres 0 0154 m2 cm3 for 0 9 mm anthracite and 0 0121 m2 cm3 for 0 5 mm silica filter sand 48 pumice sand also has a high porosity and high surface area and thermally modified silicon sponge pumice has a specific surface area of 10 m2 g and an irregular surface texture 46 information describing the specific surface areas of the other filter media used in this study was not available from the suppliers for reference purposes 0 83 0 88 mm anthracite with a carbon content of 73 85 has a specific surface area of 1 m2 g 49 and 0 60 mm silica sand comprising 99 sio2 has a specific surface area of 0 83 m2 g 50 the ceramic and pumice sand filter media also comprised smaller effective grain sizes d10 0 60 and d10 0 61 mm respectively than the anthracite filter media d10 0 81 mm supplementary table s1 thus they contained smaller pore sizes and achieved greater filtration removal of the particles the surface charges of the filter media are another important factor that influence particle removal however accurately determining the zeta potentials of granular porous media requires the use of a streaming potential analyser or a zetaprobe analyser which were unavailable for this study 3 2 effects of experimental conditions on surrogate removal as the study was conducted over 16 months 2 different batches of microspheres with different lot numbers were purchased and used for surrogate synthesis the zeta potentials of the surrogates synthesised from these microsphere batches differed batch 1 43 20 2 23 mv batch 2 17 2 0 90 mv two independent investigators validated the consistency and reproducibility of these results we suspected that the number of carboxyl groups on the 2 batches of microspheres differed which resulted in the zeta potentials varying between the surrogate batches synthesised the anthracite filter trials were conducted using both surrogate batches while the ceramic and pumice sand filter trials were conducted using surrogate batch 2 although the surrogate stocks from batches 1 and 2 differed regarding their zeta potentials the injection solutions zeta potentials were very similar in the trials conducted using different filters table 1 because the surrogate stocks 1 ml zeta potentials were moderated by the feedwater 5 l after mixing when surrogate batches 1 and 2 were used in the anthracite filter trials conducted at high flow rates using pacl coagulation the lrvs and lmrs fig 1 table 2 supplementary fig s4 did not differ significantly p 0 78 supplementary table s2 the lrvs and lmrs determined from the anthracite filter trials fig 1 table 2 supplementary fig s4 did not differ significantly when high or low filtration rates and high or low surrogate concentrations were used or when alum or pacl coagulants were used in the main wtp all p 0 14 supplementary table s2 likewise using different coagulants in the main wtp did not generate significantly different lrvs and lmrs in the pumice sand filter trials p 0 66 in addition the water chemistry ph dissolved organic carbon conductivity zeta potential turbidity of the feedwater and injection solutions remained on average relatively constant during the study period table 1 and showed no clear correlations with surrogate removal it is important to note that as our experiments were conducted during the initial operating periods soon after backwashing and the experimental data are limited the aforementioned observations do not reflect filtration mechanisms at stable operating conditions for example particle filtration removal in granular media is found to reduce as flow rates increase 7 32 51 because a flow rate increase could facilitate the detachment of those particles that are weakly attached to the surfaces of the granular media 33 however harrington et al 9 undertook a study involving pilot scale conventional treatment with anthracite sand dual media filtration and their results were similar to those from this study they found that in general filtration rates had no observable effects on the removal of c parvum oocysts spores and escherichia coli across flow rates that ranged from 1 4 to 5 4 mm s 5 19 m h scott 35 found that flow rates of 9 8 m h and 24 4 m h did not appear to significantly impact upon the removal of cryptosporidium oocysts by filtration in pilot scale engineered ceramic sand filters when pacl coagulation was used although higher flow rates appeared to contribute to lower cryptosporidium oocyst removal rates when alum coagulation was used likewise a review by emelko et al 7 reported that sudden hydraulic changes had different effects on cryptosporidium filtration removal that ranged from no effect to severely reduced removals relative to those observed during stable operating conditions our study s results suggest that the surrogate removal efficiency was clearly related to the type of filter media and that the ceramic sand filter showed the greatest removal efficiency as changes in other parameters did not significantly affect the surrogate removal efficiency in the context of the experimental conditions employed the results obtained from the trials conducted under different conditions can be analysed together according to the type of filter media used table 2 3 3 filter media efficiencies derived from multiple spiking trials during filter ripening and excessive backwash trials fig 2 shows the results from the multiple injection time series trials conducted at 0 5 1 2 and 3 h after backwashing during filter ripening the lrvs and lmrs determined from the anthracite and pumice sand filters increased progressively in power functions by at least 1 log10 within 2 5 h in contrast the lrvs and lmrs determined from the ceramic sand filter remained relatively constant over 0 5 2 h and only increased at 3 h after backwashing hence the ripening periods for surrogate removal were 3 h after backwashing for all of the filters used the findings from the surrogate spiking trials of all 3 filters conducted at 30 min after 2 consecutive backwashes showed that excessive backwashing reduced the filtration efficiency significantly fig 3 with lrv and lmr reductions of 0 7 2 3 log10 note that there were no pressure changes or head losses following backwashing during the 3 h multiple spiking time series trials the same was true for the single spiking experiments that were mostly conducted at 0 5 h after backwashing although the single spiking trials and excessive backwashing trials were conducted before the filters matured that is when they were vulnerable to protozoan breakthrough the lrvs and lmrs determined in this study may not represent worst case scenarios because most of these trials were conducted at 30 min after backwashing however in practice many wtp filters are returned to service directly or very soon after backwashing to save operational costs and as long as the turbidity levels after filtration do not exceed the drinking water guideline thresholds the water is acceptable to wtp operators 3 4 responses of turbidity levels to cryptosporidium surrogate concentrations in the filtered water linear regression analyses of the data from 51 trials supplementary figs s6 s8 showed significant correlations between the turbidity levels and the surrogate concentrations p 0 05 in the filtered water in only 17 r2 0 22 0 45 44 r2 0 24 0 81 and 29 r2 0 38 0 80 of the trials involving ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively table 4 agreements between the surrogate concentrations and turbidity levels in the context of the peak breakthrough times where the differences were 2 min were identified in 39 44 and 19 of the trials involving ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively table 4 in addition to the surrogate particles other factors may have contributed to the variations in the turbidity levels of the filtered water including background particles in the feedwater from the clarifiers and experimental and operational factors some operational factors can affect turbidity in filtered water and cause turbidity spikes including air bubbles flow rate fluctuations colour and dissolved organic carbon 52 53 as described previously the correlation between the surrogate concentrations and turbidity levels in the filtered water was closer for the pumice sand filter than the correlations determined for the anthracite and ceramic sand filters table 4 supplementary figs s6 s8 the pumice sand filter was associated with generally lower and more stable turbidity levels than those associated with the anthracite and ceramic sand filters fig 4 which suggests the pumice sand filter was better at buffering turbidity variations farizoglu et al 38 also reported that pumice was better at reducing turbidity than sand the peak turbidity levels in the filtered water from the pumice sand filter were 0 14 ntu in 100 of the trials and 0 1 ntu in 81 of the trials in comparison the peak turbidity levels in the water from the ceramic sand filter were higher 0 3 ntu in 17 of the trials and 0 1 ntu in 61 of the trials and more variable figs 4 5 despite its superior performance at surrogate removal notably the drinking water standards for new zealand 54 require that turbidity levels in the filtered water of continuously monitored systems do not exceed 0 3 ntu for 5 of the time on the other hand the water from the anthracite filter tended to display low peak turbidity levels 0 1 ntu in 76 of the trials mostly 0 18 ntu except for 1 trial especially in the trials conducted at the low filtration rates 0 02 0 07 ntu but its surrogate removal efficiencies were relatively low these findings imply that low turbidity levels do not necessarily indicate high levels of particle removal and vice versa note that the in line turbidity data for the anthracite filter table 4 figs 4 5 supplementary fig s8 were generated during the low surrogate concentration trials as the in line turbidity meter was not available for the first 10 trials which included all the high surrogate concentration trials section 2 3 all of the trials of the ceramic and pumice sand filters were conducted with low surrogate concentrations despite satisfactory levels of surrogate removal high surrogate particle concentrations were observed in the filtered water as a consequence of the high surrogate concentrations seeded in the trials 102 105 particles ml to ensure that the log10 reductions could be measured properly at the peak surrogate breakthroughs the peak turbidity levels were 0 1 ntu in 33 63 and 71 of the trials conducted using ceramic sand pumice sand and anthracite filters respectively even though the filtered water contained hundreds to thousands of surrogate particles l table 4 similarly in the study undertaken by eisnor et al 55 the turbidity levels in the filtered water in the wtps were 0 1 ntu despite concentrations of 20 000 particles l these findings also suggest that low turbidity levels do not necessarily indicate low particle concentrations other investigators have also reported variable degrees of correlation between protozoan concentrations and turbidity in different settings some researchers have reported good correlations in some systems while others have reported poor or no correlations in other systems for example heller et al 56 found no correlation between turbidity and protozoan concentrations in the effluent from slow sand filters nascimento et al 11 observed that removal of cryptosporidium oocysts was not correlated with turbidity but was correlated with particles of 2 7 μm during ripening in direct filtration he and nan 57 reported that while particles 5μm correlated with water turbidity particles 5μm showed weak correlations with turbidity based on the findings from this and other studies we can conclude that a correlation between the protozoan concentration and turbidity established in one system cannot be applied to other systems without validation protozoa can break through filters even when the turbidity is within guideline levels 58 60 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have occurred when the treated water turbidity levels were 0 24 ntu 61 0 17 ntu 62 and 0 1 ntu 56 the results from this and other studies indicate that other monitoring tools may be helpful supplements to turbidity monitoring therefore we recommend that indigenous microbial surrogates such as bacterial spores 56 63 are monitored to help with assessing the removal of persistent oo cysts in filter beds 4 conclusions and recommendations our study s findings demonstrated that the ceramic sand filter was significantly more effective at removing the cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate than the anthracite and pumice sand filters and that the anthracite filter showed the greatest variation regarding surrogate removal efficiency the filters ripening times were 3 h and excessive backwashing reduced the filtration efficiency significantly the data describing the media filtration efficiencies could help wtp operators improve their practices for ensuring drinking water safety this could be achieved for example by using more effective filter media allowing sufficient time for the water to run to waste after backwashing before the filter is brought back on line and incorporating additional post filtration treatments our data showed that the turbidity levels in the filtered water did not reliably indicate cryptosporidium surrogate breakthroughs and surrogate particle concentrations hence low turbidity does not necessarily indicate high levels of particle removal and vice versa as turbidity is a non specific parameter it may not be applicable to the removal of specific particles such as oocysts we recommend that in addition to turbidity monitoring indigenous microbial surrogates such as bacterial spores are monitored to alert wtp to changes in drinking water quality earlier and to help with assessing the removal of persistent oo cysts in filter beds it should be noted that although glycoprotein coated polystyrene microspheres can be used as an alternative surrogate for oocyst filtration removal like unmodified polystyrene microsphere surrogates their uses are limited to experimental studies for research purposes or for selection design purposes to assess real scale filter operations surrogates comprising food grade materials must be used we have embarked on this research and have recently developed a legionella surrogate using food grade alginate which is extracted from seaweed for use in engineered water systems 64 this approach can be also used to develop oocyst surrogates

13143,this work aimed to evaluate the influence of different mixtures of emerging pollutants eps paracetamol acetylsalicylic acid caffeine fluoxetine and diazepam in the growth of scenedesmus obliquus chlorella homosphaera and spirulina platensis the cells growth test was carried out for 20 days and the mixture of eps was incorporated in the specific medium for each microalgae phytotoxicity tests were performed based on the germination index of lettuce and cucumber seeds using the wastewater from microalgae cultures s obliquus and s platensis without biomass s obliquus was able to grow in all mixtures of eps on the other hand s platensis presented cell death in eps mixtures containing paracetamol both seeds germinated in s obliquus supernatant with a germination index gi of 42 07 when acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine were added in the absence of eps gi was 61 49 the supernatant from s platensis presented toxicological effects on seeds germination with no germination for lettuce seeds on cucumber seeds the supernatant of s platensis cultivated without eps or acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine showed a gi of 7 13 and 4 27 respectively showing a negative effect of the culture medium of spirulina on this parameter therefore it is possible to use microalgae to eps bioremediation and use the supernatant to further applications if the correct microalgae strain is chosen s obliquus showed the ability to grow when eps were incorporated into the medium besides reducing the phytotoxicological effects of the supernatant on the germination of seeds graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pharmaceuticals supernatant bioremediation ecotoxicity seed germination 1 introduction emerging pollutants eps are pharmaceuticals pesticides personal hygiene products chemicals and others compounds 1 3 the most significant sources of eps are the irregular disposal of pharmaceuticals and self medication since the human body does not fully metabolize these compounds they are excreted by urine and feces and as a result may arrive in aquatic environments with their active metabolites 4 6 furthermore the ease of purchase increase eps presence in wastewater as most pharmaceutics do not require a medical prescription 7 pharmaceutics of analgesics and antipyretics groups such as paracetamol caffeine and acetylsalicylic acid are widely used causing an increasing presence in wastewater increased demand for antidepressants as fluoxetine and diazepam due to mental health disorders has also influenced the presence of those pharmaceuticals on wastewater the harmful effects to the ecosystem have been reported in the last years 8 9 in this sense it becomes a problem for the ecosystem along with the necessity of wastewater treatment to remove or degrade pharmaceuticals 10 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps are commonly designed to reduce organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and pathogens 11 12 thus the wwtps are not adequate for removing eps in wastewater and surface waters because of the eps chemical characteristics and varying concentrations ng l 1 to μg l 1 13 14 in order to minimize this problem bioremediation and remediation techniques can be applied the advanced oxidation processes adsorbent materials membrane separation processes in addition to the use of combined technologies are the most remediation techniques used to remove eps 4 15 16 however the impracticability of using some of those techniques is related to reduced efficiency and the possibility of producing secondary metabolites which can be more toxic than the original compound 17 although eps have been detected in low concentrations in surface water they are linked to a series of adverse effects such as inhibition of cell multiplication damage to the metabolism and reproductive systems of living beings in addition to bioaccumulating in tissues of aquatic organisms 18 21 eps are also known for their carcinogenic mutagenic and ecotoxicological effects in addition chronic exposure can cause bioaccumulation at various trophic levels 22 23 eps bioremediation using microalgae present some advantages since the risk of generation of secondary compounds after eps degradation is low besides it is an ecological and sustainable technology as the microalgae biomass can be used for bioenergy production biofertilizers and fertigation 21 24 25 bioremediation by microalgae can occur through bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation 15 in addition it is an alternative process for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon sources present in wastewater 26 microalgae can use pharmaceutics as carbon and energy sources converting them into simple and less toxic compounds 1 27 scenedesmus sp has been reported to remove caffeine with 99 efficiency 28 paracetamol with 39 efficiency 9 chlorella sp efficiently removed 67 of acetaminophen 9 99 of caffeine 28 and 98 of acetylsalicylic acid 8 spirulina was used to remove different types of pharmaceutics such as penicillin from hospital wastewater with an efficiency of 99 29 thus microalgae are a promising and economically viable solution for the eps treatment as well as for the implementation of an industry based on biomass production furthermore several compounds of interest can be extracted from biomass and used to manufacture products 15 21 30 32 however since several pharmaceuticals are detected in aquatic environments such as analgesics antibiotics anti inflammatories antidepressants these can interact with each other and the environment 5 the mixture of these substances can have synergistic antagonistic and even potentiating effects in the environment which affect cell development factors that have to be investigated 33 in addition to assessing the biodegradability and synergistic effects of eps in different mediums it is necessary to evaluate the ecotoxicological potential of different aqueous matrices on living organisms and the whole ecosystem 34 among the existing techniques phytotoxicity is a reliable easy and inexpensive way to evaluate the effects of wastewater on different bioindicators such as seeds 35 37 in order to simulate the toxicological effects of effluents from microalgae cultures grown in the presence of eps we investigated the resistance of microalgae scenedesmus obliquus spirulina platensis and chlorella homosphaera of growing in a mixture of different eps acetylsalicylic acid caffeine diazepam fluoxetine and paracetamol after that we evaluated the effects of supernatants from microalgae cultures on seed germination the hypothesis was that microalgae would grow in a medium containing emerging contaminants and that algal metabolism could mitigate toxic effects of these contaminants when the wastewater of microalgae cultures was applied to seeds envisioning an application of algal effluents in fertirrigation 2 material and methods the experimental design was performed in 2 steps

100 mg l 1 of caffeine c these concentration was defined based on the maximum concentrations in which the microalgae showed cell growth as reported by rempel et al 16 the group containing the eps mixture was designed according to the microalgae resistance to the isolated pharmaceuticals it is known that acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine did not have an inhibitory effect on microalgal growth as reported in our previous studies 16 thus the experiment was designed with these pharmaceuticals into medium plus the other pharmaceuticals ordered as follows control 1 composed of culture medium and

and discussion 3 1 microalgal growth in the 1st step fig 2 presents the growth kinetics of the microalgae table 1 presents the maximum specific growth rates and the final concentrations of biomass obtained in the cultures with eps for the three microalgae studied in 1st step fig 1 concerning the control tests the microalgae chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus obtained maximum specific growth rates μmax and final biomass concentration xf without a statistical difference p 0 05 between controls 1 and 2 the presence of ethanol in control 2 did not present toxicity for these strains in the spirulina platensis tests control 1 showed higher μmax 0 040 d 1 than control 2 0 029 d 1 on the other hand xf of control 2 was higher 0 648 g l 1 than control 1 0 566 g l 1 spirulina may have used carbon from the ethanol structure as a nutrient source influencing final biomass concentration compared to tests without ethanol the use of ethanol as a source of organic carbon was explored in the cultivation of chlorella protothecoides in addition to glycerol which obtained a biomass yield of 12 73 g l 1 45 as previously reported by kotzabasis et al 46 the addition of low doses of alcohol in chlorella minutissima microalgae culture stimulated rapid cell multiplication compared with the control assays in the presence of other carbon sources from guillard s f 2 medium however when used as a single carbon source in the culture medium methanol and ethanol alcohols showed worse performance in the cells development of microalgae 47 in the asac assay composed of acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine scenedesmus obliquus obtained values of μmax and xf without a statistical difference p 0 05 compared to controls 1 and 2 at the same time chlorella homosphaera and spirulina platensis had xf statistically equal p 0 05 to both controls table 1 which indicates the possibility of microalgae to use these pharmaceuticals as an alternative carbon source since microalgae can grow in mixotrophic cultures 48 these two pharmaceuticals did not show a high degree of toxicity and inhibition in microalgae growth compared with the other pharmaceuticals used in the tests fig 1 similar results were obtained by matamoros et al 28 who reported that caffeine is non toxicity to chlorella sp the rate of pharmaceutical removal in the medium grown with the microalgae increased by 40 compared to the medium grown with wastewater some studies address that caffeine has no risk to freshwater species since it is detected in the environment on the μg l 1 scale while toxicity tests demonstrate tolerance to higher concentrations mg l 1 scale 16 49 50 the persistence of eps in the environment is an essential factor to be considered because even in low concentrations prolonged exposure to these pollutants can cause toxic and chronic effects on different organisms 51 according to zarrelli et al 50 caffeine is a compound that has more significant toxic potential when exposed chronically in the environment rather than in an acute way escapa et al 8 found a μmax of 0 77 d 1 for the growth of chlorella sorokiniana in cultivation with salicylic acid at a concentration of 25 mg l 1 more significant than those found in this work the contrast between the results may be that the authors have studied the pharmaceutics behavior individually and used a lower concentration than our study 100 mg l 1 the difference between the two compounds needs to be considered as acetylsalicylic acid has the addition of acetyl radical being sold as the aspirin while salicylic acid is a phenolic naturally found in plants which helps in pathogenic attacks however depending on the concentration both salicylic acid and acetylsalicylic acid can stimulate microalgae development 52 54 the microalgae were able to develop in the presence of diazepam acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine asacd assay with chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus obtaining values of μmax and xf statistically equal p 0 05 to controls 1 and 2 table 1 despite diazepam being a toxic compound it is known that some microalgae can be more resistant when they are in contact with pollutants in low concentrations helping their growth 55 56 hormesis is a dose response phenomenon characterized by a low dose stimulation and a high dose inhibition 57 hormesis can occur in several organisms such as microorganisms plants and animals due to external agents physiological changes or regulatory mechanisms 58 59 for example the microalgae navicula sp showed higher growth at low doses of ibuprofen 1 mg l 1 while at 10 mg l 1 the microalgae decreased growth chlorophyll and carotenoids contents 60 in our study hormesis could be a way to explain the toxicity of the eps towards spirulina platensis due to the high concentrations mg l 1 rempel et al 16 studied the behavior of the same strains spirulina platensis chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus in different concentrations of diazepam individually the authors reported that the pharmaceuticals were toxic at concentrations higher than 30 mg l 1 in the present study the pharmaceutical mixtures with diazepam had no toxic effect compared to the groups containing paracetamol and the other eps asacp and asacdpf assays table 1 diazepam is a compound derived from benzodiazepine considered an anxiolytic and anticonvulsant 61 destrieux et al 62 studied the growth of algae fish and bacteria in a medium containing different classes of pharmaceuticals the authors analyzed that the algae were more sensitive in a medium composed of anxiolytics than the other two species furthermore diazepam has lipophilic characteristics which allow its penetration into cells causing the degradation 56 63 spirulina platensis showed cell death in the asacdpf and asacp assays table 1 and fig 2 a among the three strains the most metabolically affected was spirulina platensis this may have occurred due to the lipophilic properties of diazepam since spirulina platensis a prokaryotic cyanobacterium has different cells wall compared to the two other microalgae tested which are eukaryotic the cell wall of spirulina sp consists of four layers with a thickness of approximately 60 nm 64 the first and third layers are composed of fibrillar molecules while the second layer is formed of peptidoglycans and the outermost layer is a membrane covered with acid polysaccharides 64 65 the cell wall of the genus chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp is composed of the algaenan biopolymer also called sporopollenin an insoluble aliphatic macromolecule that makes the wall impermeable for small molecules 66 67 in some cases the outer membrane of the cell wall may be composed of a trilaminate structure which helps protect the cell against external agents 68 69 the difference in the cell wall composition of each microalgae can be the reason for the more excellent resistance of chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus fig 2 b c against the pharmaceuticals inserted in the asacd assay as seen in table 1 there was a statistical difference in the parameters xf and μmax in the asacp and asacdpf assays compared to controls 1 and 2 p 0 05 which shows that the eps mixture negatively affected the microalgal growth of chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus in addition spirulina platensis showed cell death in these trials this effect may be due to the toxicity of paracetamol since there was no reduction in the growth of these microalgae with acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine in tests with paracetamol asacp and asacdpf high toxicity was observed in the growth for all microalgae fig 2 according to wu et al 70 this can be explained by the action of paracetamol which occurs through the saturation of cofactors by the conjugation with sulfates and glucuronic acid producing less toxic metabolites than the counterpart compound part of paracetamol is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 enzyme and produces the toxic intermediate napqi n acetyl p benzoquinone imine which spontaneously binds with the enzyme glutathione and is eliminated suppose there is an exhaustion of the cofactors or the glutathione enzyme in high doses of paracetamol in that case the napqi can be accumulated and thus covalently modify the protein cells oxidize lipid membranes and cause damage to dna and rna 71 73 in the asacf assay which contained fluoxetine acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine scenedesmus obliquus presented values of μmax and xf without a statistical difference p 0 05 to controls 1 and 2 table 1 attesting to its resistance and its potential use in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with these pharmaceuticals the genus scenedesmus sp has the characteristic of accumulating biomass when in contact with compounds of a relatively low toxic profile adapting quickly to the environment 56 chlorella homosphaera and spirulina platensis were negatively affected by this mixture of eps table 1 fig a b the toxicity of fluoxetine may be related to its ability to break protein bonds in membranes in a non specific way 74 and to the induction of oxidative stress interference with the target organism s reproductive system 75 and inhibition of efflux pumps thus interfering in the excretion of eps to the cell s exterior 76 therefore this pharmaceutical persistent in surface waters 77 risks aquatic organisms due to the high toxicity chlorella vulgaris demonstrated cell disruption and deformation when cultivated in the presence of fluoxetine even at μg l 1 concentrations in addition to decreasing the enzymatic antioxidant activity sod and cat and increasing thiobarbituric acid levels thus the reduction of these enzymes indicates oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation of the microalgae due to exposure to fluoxetine 78 it is important to remember that the microalgae growing in wastewater will contact several pollutants in different concentrations for this reason it is relevant to assess the resistance of these microalgae to groups of pharmaceuticals as this may vary between species 79 the inadequate composition of the medium leads to different biological processes for microalgae causing an accumulation of secondary metabolites and oxidative stress that hinder and affect growth 15 80 82 one way to assess the toxicity of eps is to calculate the effective concentration ec50 that 50 of the microalgal growth rate is inhibited pollutants with ec50 100 mg l 1 are classified as harmless substances from 10 to 100 mg l 1 are included under the harmful category 1 10 mg l 1 are considered toxic substances and all pollutants with ec50 1 mg l 1 are very toxic substances 83 for the pharmaceuticals used in our study the ec50 for microalgae are as follows diazepam with 16 5 mg l 1 84 fluoxetine with 1 6 mg l 1 85 acetylsalicylic acid with 106 mg l 1 86 paracetamol with 13 4 mg l 1 87 and caffeine ranged 20 366 μg l 1 88 caffeine has an ec50 value that is considered a very toxic substance however zarrelli et al 50 reported that caffeine did not present toxicity to the microalgae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata in acute exposure up to 150 mg l 1 also lawrence et al 89 suggest that caffeine presented a nutrient behavior rather than a contaminant against bacterial biofilms however chronic exposure to low doses μg l 1 of caffeine can cause greater toxicity to organisms as it acts as a pseudo persistent contaminant when continuously discharged into the environment 90 the mixture of pharmaceuticals can decrease the cell density of microalgae due to the cell death of more sensitive cells and affect the biochemical characteristics nevertheless chronic exposure to eps might allow them to grow again after adaptation 91 the mixtures generally present greater toxicity when compared to the isolated contaminant as they could present synergistic antagonistic or addictive behavior 92 the eps mixture comprising paracetamol and fluoxetine had the most ecotoxicological effect for all tested cultures for both maximum specific growth rate and final biomass concentration spirulina platensis showed cells death in the presence of paracetamol and fluoxetine however scenedesmus obliquus showed high resistance to these pollutants which can be explained by the microalgae having used the pharmaceuticals as a source of organic carbon 8 and or the phenomenon of hormesis 57 3 2 microalgal growth in the 2nd step in the 2nd step the microalgal growth of spirulina platensis and scenedesmus obliquus was carried out fig 1 the assays chosen for this stage were the asac assay 100 mg l 1 of asa and caffeine for spirulina platensis and the asac and asacp assays 100 mg l 1 of asa and caffeine and 30 mg l 1 of paracetamol for scenedesmus obliquus table 2 presents the maximum specific growth rates and final biomass concentration results fig 3 shows the growth curves in 30 days of cultivation spirulina platensis had both growth rates μmax and biomass concentration xf statistically equal to control 1 p 0 05 table 2 and fig 3 a it demonstrates that these pharmaceuticals did not show toxicity for this microalgae at the tested concentrations as previously noted in the 1st step for scenedesmus obliquus control 1 obtained the highest μmax and xf while the asacp assay presented the lowest results the asac assay showed no statistical difference between the other two assays p 0 05 with μmax of 0 033 d 1 and 0 971 g l 1 of xf table 2 and fig 3 b the asacp assay maintained the behavior observed in the 1st step by presenting the lowest results for both parameters it reinforces the hypothesis of the ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals at reported concentrations the asac assay also maintained the behavior from the 1st step supporting that the pharmaceuticals asa and caffeine stimulate microalgal growth since the assays containing only these two pharmaceuticals showed statistically equal control 1 p 0 05 3 3 phytotoxicological effects on seeds of supernatant from microalgae culture the supernatant from spirulina platensis culture showed phytotoxicity to cucumber seeds fig 4 supplementary material table 1 in addition there was no germination of lettuce seeds at any time demonstrating that the supernatant from spirulina platensis completely inhibited the germination growth germination index 0 for cucumber seeds all tests showed statistical difference compared to the distilled water control p 0 05 in the three studied parameters root length rl seed germination sg and germination index gi except in sg time 0 the gi showed no statistical difference between control 1 and asac p 0 05 at each time analyzed for spirulina platensis fig 4 supplementary material table 1 gi values smaller than 100 indicate that germination and radicle elongation were impaired and a value greater than 100 indicates an improvement in both indexes 43 93 the results observed in phytotoxicity tests can be linked to two factors the toxicity of the spirulina platensis culture medium and the toxicity of eps it is known that spirulina platensis grown well in an alkaline medium supplementary material table 2 and in a high concentration of salts 94 which may have interfered with seed germination fig 4 belmehdi et al 95 demonstrated that phs of 8 and 9 decrease the germination of origanum elongatum seeds while the optimal growth ph was 6 and 7 besides excess salts impair the development of plants 96 therefore assuming that only one parameter influences the germination of all seed species is a mistake 97 to assess the eps phytotoxicity effect without the influence of the culture medium of spirulina operations could be used to retain the salts of the microalgae standard culture medium these operations should be investigated so the retained salts could be added again in microalgal cultures reducing nutrients and bringing bioeconomy to the process fig 5 shows the phytotoxicity of the supernatant from scenedesmus obliquus cultivation for cucumber and lettuce seeds it was observed germination of both seeds control 1 assay for scenedesmus obliquus fig 5 showed higher gi during the assay period than the control 1 assay of spirulina platensis fig 4 this fact may be related to the difference in alkalinity between the culture medium since the standard medium for scenedesmus obliquus has a neutral range of ph supplementary material table 4 96 which provides a favorable environment for the development of bioindicators fig 5 in fig 5 a it can be seen that from 10 to 25 days the gi of cucumber seeds with distilled water control 1 did not show the statistical difference p 0 05 when compared to tests with pes asac and asacp supplementary material table 3 it denotes the hypothesis that scenedesmus obliquus managed to metabolize pharmaceuticals through the three possible bioremediation mechanisms bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation 15 16 21 the metabolic processes in microalgae may have reduced the toxicity of the eps in the seeds as gi was equal to the controls p 0 05 in the asacp assay the gi in 10 days was 64 69 and in 20 days was 60 12 meanwhile the asac assay showed gi of 80 42 in 10 days and 84 75 in 20 days germination indexes higher than 80 indicate that the supernatant is not phytotoxic to the bioindicator 36 98 in 30 days a decrease in the gi for the asac 42 07 and asacp 36 39 was noticed it may have occurred due to the cell disruption process of scenedesmus obliquus causing the release of eps metabolites that were bioaccumulated and bioadsorbed in the cells the cell rupture may have occurred due to the time of cultivation as cell death was observed in 20 to 30 days figs 2 c 3 b which can cause the release of eps and other secondary compounds that possibly influenced the decrease in the bioindicators gi for lettuce seeds fig 5 b there was no statistical difference at 10 to 30 days between the assays with the presence of eps asac and asacp and control 1 p 0 05 supplementary material table 3 at 10 days the gi was 85 34 for asac considered non phytotoxic the gi was lower for lettuce seeds when compared to cucumber seeds which may be related to the higher resistance of cucumbers due to their energy reserve 99 the eps can affect embryonic tissues through physiological barriers depending on the seed structure which varies according to the species and contaminant characteristics the inhibition of enzymatic reactions can also explain germination toxicity 100 101 as microalgae plants can also present hormesis 102 phytotoxicity is observed in developmental and physiological changes such as low germination rates growth inhibition reduction in chlorophyll content tissue deformation among other related stressors 103 104 the mixture of pharmaceuticals may exert synergistic or additive effects resulting in enhanced phytotoxicity as observed in other organisms 105 the ways of absorption and bioaccumulation of eps in plants still need to be elucidated the capture of pollutants by the roots occurs by mass flow or by the diffusion of the compounds neutral compounds diffuse through the root cell membrane and ionizable compounds penetrate the roots through a combination of diffusion of the neutral fraction and electrostatic interactions of the ionic fraction 106 107 the plants exposure to pharmaceuticals can affect their development slowing the growth and elongating the roots as seen in studies using pharmaceuticals such as tetracycline chlortetracycline amoxicillin 108 and metformin 109 garcía medina et al 110 reported that carbamazepine could penetrate the cells responsible for the growth of onion allium cepa there was a generation imbalance in the reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant systems of the plant damaging lipids proteins and genetic material and consequently causing oxidative stress eps effects on seed germination can be related to respiration metabolism i e more active during the germinative process increasing the mitochondrial activity and the generation of oxygen reactive species these species act as a source of alert during germination for plant hormones such as abscisic acid and gibberellin responsible for dormancy control radicle elongation and seed germination an increase in oxygen reactive species is observed in the early germination stages as it facilitates the dormancy breaking and moves reserves thus reducing the energy required for embryo germination however the excess of reactive oxygen species can cause cell damage and affect germinal metabolism 111 the present study demonstrates the potential use of scenesdemsus obliquus to retain and possibly metabolize different combined groups of eps and the influence of culture supernatant on the germination of two plant bioindicators lettuce and cucumber seeds reusing microalgal supernatant for crops irrigation or incorporating new microalgae cultures is an option to reduce freshwater use in addition it can reduce the use of synthetic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus as these nutrients are present in the supernatant after cultivation 112 however it is still necessary 1 determine the possible individual effects of the cultivation medium and the eps on the seeds 2 measure the residual concentrations of eps in the supernatant and the seeds and 3 elucidate the microalgae bioremediation mechanism concerning the eps treatment 4 conclusions scenedesmus obliquus showed excellent ability to grow in the eps mixtures in concentrations higher mg l 1 scale than commonly detected in the ecosystem ng l 1 to μg l 1 less toxicity of supernatant was achieved making this technology a promising alternative for eps treatment on the other hand spirulina platensis was more sensitive to the eps addition showing cell death with the presence of paracetamol in the medium culture furthermore the spirulina platensis supernatant inhibited the seeds germination showing phytotoxicity germination index of scenedesmus obliquus supernatant was higher than 80 for both seeds considering non phytotoxic based on this the use of microalgae for eps bioremediation is a promising alternative for wastewater treatment however choosing the correct microalgae strain is essential to achieve an optimized growth kinetic with the lowest phytotoxicity of the culture medium moreover the reduced toxicological effect of culture medium supernatant without biomass on seeds germination suggests a possible application of the wastewater of microalgae cultivation for crop irrigation being necessary

13143,this work aimed to evaluate the influence of different mixtures of emerging pollutants eps paracetamol acetylsalicylic acid caffeine fluoxetine and diazepam in the growth of scenedesmus obliquus chlorella homosphaera and spirulina platensis the cells growth test was carried out for 20 days and the mixture of eps was incorporated in the specific medium for each microalgae phytotoxicity tests were performed based on the germination index of lettuce and cucumber seeds using the wastewater from microalgae cultures s obliquus and s platensis without biomass s obliquus was able to grow in all mixtures of eps on the other hand s platensis presented cell death in eps mixtures containing paracetamol both seeds germinated in s obliquus supernatant with a germination index gi of 42 07 when acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine were added in the absence of eps gi was 61 49 the supernatant from s platensis presented toxicological effects on seeds germination with no germination for lettuce seeds on cucumber seeds the supernatant of s platensis cultivated without eps or acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine showed a gi of 7 13 and 4 27 respectively showing a negative effect of the culture medium of spirulina on this parameter therefore it is possible to use microalgae to eps bioremediation and use the supernatant to further applications if the correct microalgae strain is chosen s obliquus showed the ability to grow when eps were incorporated into the medium besides reducing the phytotoxicological effects of the supernatant on the germination of seeds graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pharmaceuticals supernatant bioremediation ecotoxicity seed germination 1 introduction emerging pollutants eps are pharmaceuticals pesticides personal hygiene products chemicals and others compounds 1 3 the most significant sources of eps are the irregular disposal of pharmaceuticals and self medication since the human body does not fully metabolize these compounds they are excreted by urine and feces and as a result may arrive in aquatic environments with their active metabolites 4 6 furthermore the ease of purchase increase eps presence in wastewater as most pharmaceutics do not require a medical prescription 7 pharmaceutics of analgesics and antipyretics groups such as paracetamol caffeine and acetylsalicylic acid are widely used causing an increasing presence in wastewater increased demand for antidepressants as fluoxetine and diazepam due to mental health disorders has also influenced the presence of those pharmaceuticals on wastewater the harmful effects to the ecosystem have been reported in the last years 8 9 in this sense it becomes a problem for the ecosystem along with the necessity of wastewater treatment to remove or degrade pharmaceuticals 10 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps are commonly designed to reduce organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and pathogens 11 12 thus the wwtps are not adequate for removing eps in wastewater and surface waters because of the eps chemical characteristics and varying concentrations ng l 1 to μg l 1 13 14 in order to minimize this problem bioremediation and remediation techniques can be applied the advanced oxidation processes adsorbent materials membrane separation processes in addition to the use of combined technologies are the most remediation techniques used to remove eps 4 15 16 however the impracticability of using some of those techniques is related to reduced efficiency and the possibility of producing secondary metabolites which can be more toxic than the original compound 17 although eps have been detected in low concentrations in surface water they are linked to a series of adverse effects such as inhibition of cell multiplication damage to the metabolism and reproductive systems of living beings in addition to bioaccumulating in tissues of aquatic organisms 18 21 eps are also known for their carcinogenic mutagenic and ecotoxicological effects in addition chronic exposure can cause bioaccumulation at various trophic levels 22 23 eps bioremediation using microalgae present some advantages since the risk of generation of secondary compounds after eps degradation is low besides it is an ecological and sustainable technology as the microalgae biomass can be used for bioenergy production biofertilizers and fertigation 21 24 25 bioremediation by microalgae can occur through bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation 15 in addition it is an alternative process for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon sources present in wastewater 26 microalgae can use pharmaceutics as carbon and energy sources converting them into simple and less toxic compounds 1 27 scenedesmus sp has been reported to remove caffeine with 99 efficiency 28 paracetamol with 39 efficiency 9 chlorella sp efficiently removed 67 of acetaminophen 9 99 of caffeine 28 and 98 of acetylsalicylic acid 8 spirulina was used to remove different types of pharmaceutics such as penicillin from hospital wastewater with an efficiency of 99 29 thus microalgae are a promising and economically viable solution for the eps treatment as well as for the implementation of an industry based on biomass production furthermore several compounds of interest can be extracted from biomass and used to manufacture products 15 21 30 32 however since several pharmaceuticals are detected in aquatic environments such as analgesics antibiotics anti inflammatories antidepressants these can interact with each other and the environment 5 the mixture of these substances can have synergistic antagonistic and even potentiating effects in the environment which affect cell development factors that have to be investigated 33 in addition to assessing the biodegradability and synergistic effects of eps in different mediums it is necessary to evaluate the ecotoxicological potential of different aqueous matrices on living organisms and the whole ecosystem 34 among the existing techniques phytotoxicity is a reliable easy and inexpensive way to evaluate the effects of wastewater on different bioindicators such as seeds 35 37 in order to simulate the toxicological effects of effluents from microalgae cultures grown in the presence of eps we investigated the resistance of microalgae scenedesmus obliquus spirulina platensis and chlorella homosphaera of growing in a mixture of different eps acetylsalicylic acid caffeine diazepam fluoxetine and paracetamol after that we evaluated the effects of supernatants from microalgae cultures on seed germination the hypothesis was that microalgae would grow in a medium containing emerging contaminants and that algal metabolism could mitigate toxic effects of these contaminants when the wastewater of microalgae cultures was applied to seeds envisioning an application of algal effluents in fertirrigation 2 material and methods the experimental design was performed in 2 steps

and discussion 3 1 microalgal growth in the 1st step fig 2 presents the growth kinetics of the microalgae table 1 presents the maximum specific growth rates and the final concentrations of biomass obtained in the cultures with eps for the three microalgae studied in 1st step fig 1 concerning the control tests the microalgae chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus obtained maximum specific growth rates μmax and final biomass concentration xf without a statistical difference p 0 05 between controls 1 and 2 the presence of ethanol in control 2 did not present toxicity for these strains in the spirulina platensis tests control 1 showed higher μmax 0 040 d 1 than control 2 0 029 d 1 on the other hand xf of control 2 was higher 0 648 g l 1 than control 1 0 566 g l 1 spirulina may have used carbon from the ethanol structure as a nutrient source influencing final biomass concentration compared to tests without ethanol the use of ethanol as a source of organic carbon was explored in the cultivation of chlorella protothecoides in addition to glycerol which obtained a biomass yield of 12 73 g l 1 45 as previously reported by kotzabasis et al 46 the addition of low doses of alcohol in chlorella minutissima microalgae culture stimulated rapid cell multiplication compared with the control assays in the presence of other carbon sources from guillard s f 2 medium however when used as a single carbon source in the culture medium methanol and ethanol alcohols showed worse performance in the cells development of microalgae 47 in the asac assay composed of acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine scenedesmus obliquus obtained values of μmax and xf without a statistical difference p 0 05 compared to controls 1 and 2 at the same time chlorella homosphaera and spirulina platensis had xf statistically equal p 0 05 to both controls table 1 which indicates the possibility of microalgae to use these pharmaceuticals as an alternative carbon source since microalgae can grow in mixotrophic cultures 48 these two pharmaceuticals did not show a high degree of toxicity and inhibition in microalgae growth compared with the other pharmaceuticals used in the tests fig 1 similar results were obtained by matamoros et al 28 who reported that caffeine is non toxicity to chlorella sp the rate of pharmaceutical removal in the medium grown with the microalgae increased by 40 compared to the medium grown with wastewater some studies address that caffeine has no risk to freshwater species since it is detected in the environment on the μg l 1 scale while toxicity tests demonstrate tolerance to higher concentrations mg l 1 scale 16 49 50 the persistence of eps in the environment is an essential factor to be considered because even in low concentrations prolonged exposure to these pollutants can cause toxic and chronic effects on different organisms 51 according to zarrelli et al 50 caffeine is a compound that has more significant toxic potential when exposed chronically in the environment rather than in an acute way escapa et al 8 found a μmax of 0 77 d 1 for the growth of chlorella sorokiniana in cultivation with salicylic acid at a concentration of 25 mg l 1 more significant than those found in this work the contrast between the results may be that the authors have studied the pharmaceutics behavior individually and used a lower concentration than our study 100 mg l 1 the difference between the two compounds needs to be considered as acetylsalicylic acid has the addition of acetyl radical being sold as the aspirin while salicylic acid is a phenolic naturally found in plants which helps in pathogenic attacks however depending on the concentration both salicylic acid and acetylsalicylic acid can stimulate microalgae development 52 54 the microalgae were able to develop in the presence of diazepam acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine asacd assay with chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus obtaining values of μmax and xf statistically equal p 0 05 to controls 1 and 2 table 1 despite diazepam being a toxic compound it is known that some microalgae can be more resistant when they are in contact with pollutants in low concentrations helping their growth 55 56 hormesis is a dose response phenomenon characterized by a low dose stimulation and a high dose inhibition 57 hormesis can occur in several organisms such as microorganisms plants and animals due to external agents physiological changes or regulatory mechanisms 58 59 for example the microalgae navicula sp showed higher growth at low doses of ibuprofen 1 mg l 1 while at 10 mg l 1 the microalgae decreased growth chlorophyll and carotenoids contents 60 in our study hormesis could be a way to explain the toxicity of the eps towards spirulina platensis due to the high concentrations mg l 1 rempel et al 16 studied the behavior of the same strains spirulina platensis chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus in different concentrations of diazepam individually the authors reported that the pharmaceuticals were toxic at concentrations higher than 30 mg l 1 in the present study the pharmaceutical mixtures with diazepam had no toxic effect compared to the groups containing paracetamol and the other eps asacp and asacdpf assays table 1 diazepam is a compound derived from benzodiazepine considered an anxiolytic and anticonvulsant 61 destrieux et al 62 studied the growth of algae fish and bacteria in a medium containing different classes of pharmaceuticals the authors analyzed that the algae were more sensitive in a medium composed of anxiolytics than the other two species furthermore diazepam has lipophilic characteristics which allow its penetration into cells causing the degradation 56 63 spirulina platensis showed cell death in the asacdpf and asacp assays table 1 and fig 2 a among the three strains the most metabolically affected was spirulina platensis this may have occurred due to the lipophilic properties of diazepam since spirulina platensis a prokaryotic cyanobacterium has different cells wall compared to the two other microalgae tested which are eukaryotic the cell wall of spirulina sp consists of four layers with a thickness of approximately 60 nm 64 the first and third layers are composed of fibrillar molecules while the second layer is formed of peptidoglycans and the outermost layer is a membrane covered with acid polysaccharides 64 65 the cell wall of the genus chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp is composed of the algaenan biopolymer also called sporopollenin an insoluble aliphatic macromolecule that makes the wall impermeable for small molecules 66 67 in some cases the outer membrane of the cell wall may be composed of a trilaminate structure which helps protect the cell against external agents 68 69 the difference in the cell wall composition of each microalgae can be the reason for the more excellent resistance of chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus fig 2 b c against the pharmaceuticals inserted in the asacd assay as seen in table 1 there was a statistical difference in the parameters xf and μmax in the asacp and asacdpf assays compared to controls 1 and 2 p 0 05 which shows that the eps mixture negatively affected the microalgal growth of chlorella homosphaera and scenedesmus obliquus in addition spirulina platensis showed cell death in these trials this effect may be due to the toxicity of paracetamol since there was no reduction in the growth of these microalgae with acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine in tests with paracetamol asacp and asacdpf high toxicity was observed in the growth for all microalgae fig 2 according to wu et al 70 this can be explained by the action of paracetamol which occurs through the saturation of cofactors by the conjugation with sulfates and glucuronic acid producing less toxic metabolites than the counterpart compound part of paracetamol is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 enzyme and produces the toxic intermediate napqi n acetyl p benzoquinone imine which spontaneously binds with the enzyme glutathione and is eliminated suppose there is an exhaustion of the cofactors or the glutathione enzyme in high doses of paracetamol in that case the napqi can be accumulated and thus covalently modify the protein cells oxidize lipid membranes and cause damage to dna and rna 71 73 in the asacf assay which contained fluoxetine acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine scenedesmus obliquus presented values of μmax and xf without a statistical difference p 0 05 to controls 1 and 2 table 1 attesting to its resistance and its potential use in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with these pharmaceuticals the genus scenedesmus sp has the characteristic of accumulating biomass when in contact with compounds of a relatively low toxic profile adapting quickly to the environment 56 chlorella homosphaera and spirulina platensis were negatively affected by this mixture of eps table 1 fig a b the toxicity of fluoxetine may be related to its ability to break protein bonds in membranes in a non specific way 74 and to the induction of oxidative stress interference with the target organism s reproductive system 75 and inhibition of efflux pumps thus interfering in the excretion of eps to the cell s exterior 76 therefore this pharmaceutical persistent in surface waters 77 risks aquatic organisms due to the high toxicity chlorella vulgaris demonstrated cell disruption and deformation when cultivated in the presence of fluoxetine even at μg l 1 concentrations in addition to decreasing the enzymatic antioxidant activity sod and cat and increasing thiobarbituric acid levels thus the reduction of these enzymes indicates oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation of the microalgae due to exposure to fluoxetine 78 it is important to remember that the microalgae growing in wastewater will contact several pollutants in different concentrations for this reason it is relevant to assess the resistance of these microalgae to groups of pharmaceuticals as this may vary between species 79 the inadequate composition of the medium leads to different biological processes for microalgae causing an accumulation of secondary metabolites and oxidative stress that hinder and affect growth 15 80 82 one way to assess the toxicity of eps is to calculate the effective concentration ec50 that 50 of the microalgal growth rate is inhibited pollutants with ec50 100 mg l 1 are classified as harmless substances from 10 to 100 mg l 1 are included under the harmful category 1 10 mg l 1 are considered toxic substances and all pollutants with ec50 1 mg l 1 are very toxic substances 83 for the pharmaceuticals used in our study the ec50 for microalgae are as follows diazepam with 16 5 mg l 1 84 fluoxetine with 1 6 mg l 1 85 acetylsalicylic acid with 106 mg l 1 86 paracetamol with 13 4 mg l 1 87 and caffeine ranged 20 366 μg l 1 88 caffeine has an ec50 value that is considered a very toxic substance however zarrelli et al 50 reported that caffeine did not present toxicity to the microalgae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata in acute exposure up to 150 mg l 1 also lawrence et al 89 suggest that caffeine presented a nutrient behavior rather than a contaminant against bacterial biofilms however chronic exposure to low doses μg l 1 of caffeine can cause greater toxicity to organisms as it acts as a pseudo persistent contaminant when continuously discharged into the environment 90 the mixture of pharmaceuticals can decrease the cell density of microalgae due to the cell death of more sensitive cells and affect the biochemical characteristics nevertheless chronic exposure to eps might allow them to grow again after adaptation 91 the mixtures generally present greater toxicity when compared to the isolated contaminant as they could present synergistic antagonistic or addictive behavior 92 the eps mixture comprising paracetamol and fluoxetine had the most ecotoxicological effect for all tested cultures for both maximum specific growth rate and final biomass concentration spirulina platensis showed cells death in the presence of paracetamol and fluoxetine however scenedesmus obliquus showed high resistance to these pollutants which can be explained by the microalgae having used the pharmaceuticals as a source of organic carbon 8 and or the phenomenon of hormesis 57 3 2 microalgal growth in the 2nd step in the 2nd step the microalgal growth of spirulina platensis and scenedesmus obliquus was carried out fig 1 the assays chosen for this stage were the asac assay 100 mg l 1 of asa and caffeine for spirulina platensis and the asac and asacp assays 100 mg l 1 of asa and caffeine and 30 mg l 1 of paracetamol for scenedesmus obliquus table 2 presents the maximum specific growth rates and final biomass concentration results fig 3 shows the growth curves in 30 days of cultivation spirulina platensis had both growth rates μmax and biomass concentration xf statistically equal to control 1 p 0 05 table 2 and fig 3 a it demonstrates that these pharmaceuticals did not show toxicity for this microalgae at the tested concentrations as previously noted in the 1st step for scenedesmus obliquus control 1 obtained the highest μmax and xf while the asacp assay presented the lowest results the asac assay showed no statistical difference between the other two assays p 0 05 with μmax of 0 033 d 1 and 0 971 g l 1 of xf table 2 and fig 3 b the asacp assay maintained the behavior observed in the 1st step by presenting the lowest results for both parameters it reinforces the hypothesis of the ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals at reported concentrations the asac assay also maintained the behavior from the 1st step supporting that the pharmaceuticals asa and caffeine stimulate microalgal growth since the assays containing only these two pharmaceuticals showed statistically equal control 1 p 0 05 3 3 phytotoxicological effects on seeds of supernatant from microalgae culture the supernatant from spirulina platensis culture showed phytotoxicity to cucumber seeds fig 4 supplementary material table 1 in addition there was no germination of lettuce seeds at any time demonstrating that the supernatant from spirulina platensis completely inhibited the germination growth germination index 0 for cucumber seeds all tests showed statistical difference compared to the distilled water control p 0 05 in the three studied parameters root length rl seed germination sg and germination index gi except in sg time 0 the gi showed no statistical difference between control 1 and asac p 0 05 at each time analyzed for spirulina platensis fig 4 supplementary material table 1 gi values smaller than 100 indicate that germination and radicle elongation were impaired and a value greater than 100 indicates an improvement in both indexes 43 93 the results observed in phytotoxicity tests can be linked to two factors the toxicity of the spirulina platensis culture medium and the toxicity of eps it is known that spirulina platensis grown well in an alkaline medium supplementary material table 2 and in a high concentration of salts 94 which may have interfered with seed germination fig 4 belmehdi et al 95 demonstrated that phs of 8 and 9 decrease the germination of origanum elongatum seeds while the optimal growth ph was 6 and 7 besides excess salts impair the development of plants 96 therefore assuming that only one parameter influences the germination of all seed species is a mistake 97 to assess the eps phytotoxicity effect without the influence of the culture medium of spirulina operations could be used to retain the salts of the microalgae standard culture medium these operations should be investigated so the retained salts could be added again in microalgal cultures reducing nutrients and bringing bioeconomy to the process fig 5 shows the phytotoxicity of the supernatant from scenedesmus obliquus cultivation for cucumber and lettuce seeds it was observed germination of both seeds control 1 assay for scenedesmus obliquus fig 5 showed higher gi during the assay period than the control 1 assay of spirulina platensis fig 4 this fact may be related to the difference in alkalinity between the culture medium since the standard medium for scenedesmus obliquus has a neutral range of ph supplementary material table 4 96 which provides a favorable environment for the development of bioindicators fig 5 in fig 5 a it can be seen that from 10 to 25 days the gi of cucumber seeds with distilled water control 1 did not show the statistical difference p 0 05 when compared to tests with pes asac and asacp supplementary material table 3 it denotes the hypothesis that scenedesmus obliquus managed to metabolize pharmaceuticals through the three possible bioremediation mechanisms bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation 15 16 21 the metabolic processes in microalgae may have reduced the toxicity of the eps in the seeds as gi was equal to the controls p 0 05 in the asacp assay the gi in 10 days was 64 69 and in 20 days was 60 12 meanwhile the asac assay showed gi of 80 42 in 10 days and 84 75 in 20 days germination indexes higher than 80 indicate that the supernatant is not phytotoxic to the bioindicator 36 98 in 30 days a decrease in the gi for the asac 42 07 and asacp 36 39 was noticed it may have occurred due to the cell disruption process of scenedesmus obliquus causing the release of eps metabolites that were bioaccumulated and bioadsorbed in the cells the cell rupture may have occurred due to the time of cultivation as cell death was observed in 20 to 30 days figs 2 c 3 b which can cause the release of eps and other secondary compounds that possibly influenced the decrease in the bioindicators gi for lettuce seeds fig 5 b there was no statistical difference at 10 to 30 days between the assays with the presence of eps asac and asacp and control 1 p 0 05 supplementary material table 3 at 10 days the gi was 85 34 for asac considered non phytotoxic the gi was lower for lettuce seeds when compared to cucumber seeds which may be related to the higher resistance of cucumbers due to their energy reserve 99 the eps can affect embryonic tissues through physiological barriers depending on the seed structure which varies according to the species and contaminant characteristics the inhibition of enzymatic reactions can also explain germination toxicity 100 101 as microalgae plants can also present hormesis 102 phytotoxicity is observed in developmental and physiological changes such as low germination rates growth inhibition reduction in chlorophyll content tissue deformation among other related stressors 103 104 the mixture of pharmaceuticals may exert synergistic or additive effects resulting in enhanced phytotoxicity as observed in other organisms 105 the ways of absorption and bioaccumulation of eps in plants still need to be elucidated the capture of pollutants by the roots occurs by mass flow or by the diffusion of the compounds neutral compounds diffuse through the root cell membrane and ionizable compounds penetrate the roots through a combination of diffusion of the neutral fraction and electrostatic interactions of the ionic fraction 106 107 the plants exposure to pharmaceuticals can affect their development slowing the growth and elongating the roots as seen in studies using pharmaceuticals such as tetracycline chlortetracycline amoxicillin 108 and metformin 109 garcía medina et al 110 reported that carbamazepine could penetrate the cells responsible for the growth of onion allium cepa there was a generation imbalance in the reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant systems of the plant damaging lipids proteins and genetic material and consequently causing oxidative stress eps effects on seed germination can be related to respiration metabolism i e more active during the germinative process increasing the mitochondrial activity and the generation of oxygen reactive species these species act as a source of alert during germination for plant hormones such as abscisic acid and gibberellin responsible for dormancy control radicle elongation and seed germination an increase in oxygen reactive species is observed in the early germination stages as it facilitates the dormancy breaking and moves reserves thus reducing the energy required for embryo germination however the excess of reactive oxygen species can cause cell damage and affect germinal metabolism 111 the present study demonstrates the potential use of scenesdemsus obliquus to retain and possibly metabolize different combined groups of eps and the influence of culture supernatant on the germination of two plant bioindicators lettuce and cucumber seeds reusing microalgal supernatant for crops irrigation or incorporating new microalgae cultures is an option to reduce freshwater use in addition it can reduce the use of synthetic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus as these nutrients are present in the supernatant after cultivation 112 however it is still necessary 1 determine the possible individual effects of the cultivation medium and the eps on the seeds 2 measure the residual concentrations of eps in the supernatant and the seeds and 3 elucidate the microalgae bioremediation mechanism concerning the eps treatment 4 conclusions scenedesmus obliquus showed excellent ability to grow in the eps mixtures in concentrations higher mg l 1 scale than commonly detected in the ecosystem ng l 1 to μg l 1 less toxicity of supernatant was achieved making this technology a promising alternative for eps treatment on the other hand spirulina platensis was more sensitive to the eps addition showing cell death with the presence of paracetamol in the medium culture furthermore the spirulina platensis supernatant inhibited the seeds germination showing phytotoxicity germination index of scenedesmus obliquus supernatant was higher than 80 for both seeds considering non phytotoxic based on this the use of microalgae for eps bioremediation is a promising alternative for wastewater treatment however choosing the correct microalgae strain is essential to achieve an optimized growth kinetic with the lowest phytotoxicity of the culture medium moreover the reduced toxicological effect of culture medium supernatant without biomass on seeds germination suggests a possible application of the wastewater of microalgae cultivation for crop irrigation being necessary

13144,in this study calcined mg al layered double hydroxide mg al cldh was successfully synthesized for boron b removal from aqueous solutions batch experiments were conducted considering various reaction conditions including initial ph reaction temperature initial b concentration mg al cldh dosage ambient condition and co existing ions effect for optimizing b removal efficiency results showed that sorption kinetic rate became higher by approaching towards the neutral ph conditions while it declined at the strong acidic or alkaline conditions mg al cldh was capable of removing high b concentration 80 mg l from aqueous solutions at a reasonable dosage of 2 g l with a comparable sorption capacity 22 1 mg g to other reported studies moreover high b removal rates were observed at high reaction temperatures reflecting the endothermic nature of the reaction and reached equilibrium within less than 6 h at temperature of 70 c moreover results of 3d rsm modeling confirmed that the middle high range of mg al cldh dosage values was the suitable range to achieve high b removal efficiency in spite of ph temperature and initial concentration effects furthermore isotherm modeling confirmed that b removal by mg al cldh occurred via a mono layer sorption and thermodynamic modeling revealed the positive value of entropy change indicating that the randomness of the solid liquid interaction increased within the adsorption process of b spent mg al cldh showed great reusability performance by achieving 67 75 b removal efficiency over three consecutive regeneration cycles confirming the high potential and applicability of the presented adsorbent in real water treatment applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords boron removal mg al layer double hydroxide isotherm modeling kinetics 3d rsm 1 introduction boron b presence in water bodies especially seawater is naturally occurred and generally considered as an essential element for plants animals and even humans at significantly controlled amounts human activities are another crucial source for the occurrence of excessive b concentration in water bodies most of the boron found in water bodies surface water and groundwater are most likely the result of humanmade pollution 1 in surface water b presence is mostly caused by wastewater discharge with high amounts of detergents which contain borate bo3 3 moreover industrial discharge from glass film food preservatives and fertilizers hold a major part in water pollution by boron 1 2 whereas b can be found in groundwater in the forms of borate and borosilicate as a result of sedimentary rocks and soil leaching 3 b concentration in groundwater ranges from 0 3 to 100 mg l while in surface water where the majority of b is occurred at an average concentration of 4 5 mg l 4 the exposure to excessive b concentration in water may cause severe health effects on humans including nervous system disorder and gastrointestinal disorder moreover high b concentrations can harmfully affect plants causing growth retardation 5 hence the world health organization who has set guidelines for b concentration in drinking water to be 0 5 mg l 6 several technologies were considered for the removal of boron from aqueous solutions such as adsorption reverse osmosis ro ion exchange and coagulation electrocoagulation 7 9 ro membranes are advantaged by the long term feasibility and the environmentally friendly features yet they cannot completely remove b from water in such regard ro membranes can efficiently remove borate anions from seawater unlike the neutrally charged boric acid h3bo3 which could be rejected by the membranes in addition to the limitations related to the ph dependency 10 it has been reported that removal rates using ro membranes vary depending on the treatment ph range boric acid recorded rejection rates of 40 60 at ph range of 5 5 9 5 on the other hand in the same ph conditions borate ion registered removal rates at 95 11 the easy implementation as well as the high selectivity to boron species of some synthesized resins are the major driving aspects towards considering ion exchange technology for b removal from aqueous mediums 12 nevertheless this technology is not so efficient at high b concentrations and also can be greatly influenced be several reaction factors e g ph temperature and co existing anions 13 coagulation method is a well known removal technology for b from water still it suffers from the low removal efficiency high operational cost and high rate of the yielded sludge causing secondary pollution 14 such drawbacks can be overcome via the electrocoagulation designed reactors yet the high cost remains an issue meanwhile adsorption is the most commonly used technology for b removal from water due to the simples operation high removal efficiency low cost chemical stability easy regeneration and modification abilities of the adsorbents 15 in such regard various sorbents have been investigated for boron removal such as activated carbon 16 fly ash clays natural minerals biomass based materials 17 metal oxides 18 mesoporous silica nanoparticles complexing membranes 19 and selective resins 20 one of the promising and most efficient are ldhs and ldh like materials 21 having a flexible composition via altering the nature of the interlayer without changing the basic structure as well as the ability to remove a wide range of anions from aqueous mediums are ldhs most favorable advantages thus ldhs are applicable in various fields as catalysts or catalysts precursors anion exchangers flame retardants stabilizers for polymers and electroactive photoactive materials 22 24 many types of ldhs classified by the type of the merged cations in ldh layers have been considered in water treatment applications 25 mg al ldh has been tested and reported to have unique properties in b removal from water including high adsorption capacity exceptional anion exchange rate and mobility of interlayer anions in water molecules 26 it has been previously reported that b adsorption on mg al ldh is greatly enhanced via ldh calcination at high temperatures 500 700 c owing to the structural change in ldh interlayer within calcination process which increases b intake capacity 27 therefore calcined mg al ldh can be considered as one of the most promising ldhs for b removal from aqueous solutions several reported studies focused on investigating b removal by mg al ldh however there are always knowledge gaps found in the literature when it comes to aspects related to reaction parameters optimization for instance some researchers considered very high dosage of mg al ldh 5 20 g l as optimized value which could be hard to be feasible in real applications 28 31 moreover many reports neglected the regeneration desorption performance of the b reacted mg al ldh as well as the reaction temperature and initial ph effects 32 33 furthermore few studies have been concerned on the interaction effects of the reaction conditions towards b removal efficiency by mg al ldh which can be very critical to understand the combined influence of such parameters hence the main aim of this study is to investigate most of the possibly influencing aspects on b removal by calcined mg al ldh including initial ph temperature initial boron concentration mg al ldh dosage

removal mechanism of boron by mg al ldh were determined considering detailed kinetic isotherm and thermodynamics analyses furthermore one of the novelty aspects in this work is considering the response surface methodology rsm for the determination of the interaction effects between the different reaction parameters towards b removal from aqueous solutions by mg al ldh additionally the regeneration abilities of the b loaded adsorbent were evaluated through adsorption desorption cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials non calcined and calcined mg al ldh were synthesized using the following materials magnesium nitrate hexahydrate mg no3 2 6h2o aluminum nitrate nonahydrate al no3 3 9h2o and sodium hydroxide naoh 34 stock solution of 500 mg l initial b concentration was prepared using boric acid h3bo3 diluted hydrochloric acid hcl and concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 were considered for ph adjustment and b concentration analysis respectively all solutions were prepared using deoxygenated deionized water 2 2 mg al ldh synthesis the preparation of 10 g non calcined mg al ldh was carried out in the duration of three days 700 ml aqueous solution containing 0 1 mol of mg no3 2 6h2o and 0 05 mol of al no3 3 9h2o were mixed vigorously 30 the solution mixture was then added drop wise to 1500 ml of 2 m naoh solution while stirred using a mechanical mixer set at 400 rpm the temperature was kept at 45 3 c during the process the obtained slurry was then heated for 2 h t 85 3 c under slow mixing at 200 rpm the solution was kept in room temperature for 12 h next day the slurry product was separated by centrifugation technique and washed with deionized water several times until ph reached 8 5 9 5 and conductivity was constant the collected solid material was dried at 60 c for 48 h then small part of the dried product was collected for further use as non calcined ldh while the rest was calcined at 550 c for 4 h to be used as calcined ldh mg al cldh the solid material was dry and light enough to be crushed into powder like form which were later kept in a concealed container for the batch experimental use abbas et al 18 reported that sorption of b on magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide reached its maximum sorption capabilities at ph 9 5 and ph 8 0 respectively which was the reason that ph was determined to be ph 8 5 9 5 during synthesis 2 3 characterization the physical chemical characteristics of mg al ldh and mg al cldh composites were investigated by several techniques the shape and morphological features were investigated using transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100f jeol co japan scanning electron microscopic analysis was conducted using sem jcm 6000 jeol co japan coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds

determination of the changes in the structure of ldh after calcination and reaction with b tem jem 2800 jeol co japan chemical composition and crystallinity of mg al cldh were determined by x ray diffraction xrd analysis using cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 å on ttr rigaku diffractometer set at 40 kv and 40 ma with scanning angle 2θ ranged from 3 to 90 and scanning speed of 2 min 1 35 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was conducted at wavenumber range of 500 4000 cm 1 using ftir device ft ir 4200 jasco japan for the determination of surface functional groups in fresh and spent mg al cldh additionally n2 adsorption desorption measurements were conducted using brunauer emmett and teller bet specific surface area ssa analyzer 3flex micromeritics corp to determine the ssa of the freshly synthesized mg al cldh and the corresponding n2 adsorption desorption isotherm 2 4 batch experiments analysis batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption of b on mg al ldh using polypropylene pp flasks in order to avoid reaction of b with glass trial experiment was conducted first to determine the calcination effect on b removal by mg al ldh considering 5 mg l initial b concentration and 5 g l adsorbent dosage data are not shown mg al cldh showed around 56 enhancement in b removal efficiency comparing to that of mg al ldh after 1 day reaction time hence mg al cldh was considered as the main adsorbent material for reaction parameters investigation all the base line value of the parameters to be considered in the batch experiments were determined based on a previously performed experimental optimization with respect to the highest removal efficiency towards boron solution volume of 100 ml with the following basic initial conditions ph 9 0 temperature of 25 c initial b concentration of 20 mg l and mg al ldh dosage of 2 g l at unaerated conditions to further investigate variations of the reaction parameters a study of their effects on the removal of boron was considered initial ph effect on the removal of b by mg al cldh at different ph levels 3 6 9 and 12 were considered reaction temperature effect was also examined with a range of 25 40 55 and 70 c effect of initial b concentration 5 10 20 40 and 80 mg l and cldh dosage of 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 2 0 g l were studied as well furthermore to study ambient conditions two separate experiments were conducted the anaerobic test was done using nitrogen purging into the solution during the whole time of the experiment to provide deoxygenated environment and aerobic test was conducted by pumping air into the batch throughout the whole experiment as well in order to simulate the real conditions of b removal from real seawater synthesized seawater was considered as batch solution based on the astm standard practice for preparing ocean water d 1141 98 2003 36 the chemical components used for seawater synthesis are as in table s1 were added to 1 l of deoxygenated deionized water in a polypropylene flask and kept as a stock solution comparison was conducted on the removal of b between the synthesized b solution and the synthesized seawater solution with b concentration of 5 mg l samples of 5 ml were withdrawn at specific time intervals during 24 h then analyzed for b concentration using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer the following process was commenced for b concentration analysis 75 ml of sulfuric acid in a 400 ml conical flask one bag of borover 3 b reagent powder packs were added and mixed well for 5 min 35 ml of the above mixed reagent was added to another two flasks 2 ml of deionized water was added to one flask and another 2 ml of the b contaminated water was added to the other flask then mixed well after 25 min of reaction time the solutions were added to measuring vials and wiped of any excesses then measurement was conducted 2 5 regeneration and desorption procedures the reusability of the synthesized mg al cldh was evaluated through adsorption desorption cycles 0 2 g of mg al cldh was added to 100 ml of b solution with initial concentration of 20 mg l adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 9 0 and at room temperature after 4 h reaction time which was enough for b concentration to reach really close to the equilibrium value the spent solid was separated from the solution using vacuum filtration with 0 2 μm filter paper to be later used in the desorption cycle the regeneration of b loaded mg al cldh was conducted using 1 0 m naoh solution for 30 min the process was conducted for three consecutive cycles to expand the assessment range of the reusability performance 2 6 response surface methodology rsm optimization response surface methodology rsm integrated with statistical analysis was conducted considering the experimental data of the investigated parameters to describe their effects on b removal efficiency using mg al cldh hence anova analysis was performed based on the displayed parameters coding and value ranges in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization for characterization of mg al ldh and mg al cldh different characterization techniques were considered and the results are discussed in the following sections 3 1 1 tem analysis tem analysis demonstrated the shape and size of the freshly synthesized mg al cldh and mg al ldh as shown in fig 1 the hexagonal typical plates shape was observed in both cldh and ldh the imaging analysis of tem images revealed a range size of mg al ldh plates of around 20 100 nm furthermore the elemental mapping and eds spectrum confirmed the well distribution of mg al and o on the surface of both cldh and ldh revealing the successful synthesis of the targeted sorbent the presence of c and cu peaks was attributed to the carbon cupper tem grid used for samples preparation 3 1 2 xrd analysis xrd analysis was used to determine the crystalline structure and the characteristic reflections of the fresh and spent mg al cldh samples as shown in fig 2 xrd of the fresh mg al cldh confirmed the successful calcination of the ldh material by the presence of the periclase mgo phase associated with diffraction peaks at 2θ of 43 and 63 37 the calcination process at 550 c caused the formation of mg al based spinel attributed to the small peaks at the 2θ range of 10 to 40 such spinel attributed peaks have been previously observed at other high calcination temperature values of 600 c and 900 c which can be related to both the temperature of calcination as well as the calcination time 3 8 h in the reported studies 38 39 the absence of any hydrotalcite related peaks in the fresh mg al cldh confirmed that the interlayered ldh structure was changed into the mixed mg al oxide form after the reaction with b the rehydration of mg al cldh as well as the intercalation of b anions at the interlayer caused the reconstruction of ldh structure which was confirmed by the typical hydrotalcite characteristic peaks for 003 and 006 planes at 2θ range of 7 and 26 in addition to the other non basal peaks for 018 110 and 113 planes 37 39 furthermore the involvement of mg al complexes in the interlayer sorption of b anions b oh 4 and hbo3 2 was associated with the peaks at 2θ of 33 8 and 36 2 respectively 40 the interlayer space of ldh d was calculated for the spent material to be 0 784 nm based on the previously reported cell parameter c calculations c 3d003 6d006 2 d c 3 which was comparable to the reported values in the literature confirming the intercalation of b anions water and hydroxide ions 41 42 3 1 3 n2 bet measurements bet based measurements of n2 adsorption desorption for mg al cldh is provided in fig s1 the yielded isotherm curves were classified as isotherm iii shape according to iupac classification such h3 type hysteresis reflected the successful description of irregular solids with plate shaped particles furthermore the results of bet ssa analysis showed that mg al cldh has an average pore size range of 3 23 3 97 nm and ssa of around 288 3 m2 g 3 1 4 ftir analysis ftir spectra of fresh and spent mg al cldh is provided in fig s2 broad peaks were observed in both fresh and spent mg al cldh at 3700 3000 cm 1 which were assigned to the oh stretching vibration 43 44 the peak near 1640 cm 1 was attributed to the hoh vibration of the angular deformation of water molecules 45 moreover the peaks at 700 550 cm 1 were assigned to mgo and alo vibrations 44 b sorption was confirmed by the presence of two relatively small peaks at 1500 1300 cm 1 and near 1195 cm 1 which were assigned to bo and boh bonds respectively 46 3 2 initial ph effect the results of the effect of the initial ph on b removal by mg al cldh is shown in fig 3a results revealed that ph 12 0 showed the least removal rate of b throughout the entire reaction time 24 h whereas the other ph values showed much better performance such results reflected the unfavourability of the strong alkaline conditions for b removal from aqueous solutions by mg al cldh almost all other initial ph values showed similar trend and reached equilibrium after around 10 h from starting the experiment ph 9 0 showed a slight improvement in the kinetic rate at the early stage of the reaction with a rapid removal rate to reach b concentration of 7 2 mg l after only 1 h from the start of the experiment it is worth mentioning that ph 3 0 and 6 0 showed a comparable performance to ph 9 0 with an almost identical trend at the later stages nevertheless ph 9 0 was slightly favorable final b concentration of 0 2 mg l after 24 h reaction time in other experiments data are not shown considering lower initial boron concentrations 5 and 10 mg l ph 12 0 showed the same lowest removal rate followed by ph 3 0 in order to understand the effect of initial ph on b removal by mg al cldh salt addition approach was considered for the calculations of point of zero charge phpzc of mg al cldh 0 1 g fresh mg al cldh was added to 50 ml of 0 1 m kcl solution at different initial ph values 3 0 12 0 then kept at room temperature with periodical vigorous hand shaking over 24 h such shaking style was adopted because of the high solubility of ldh materials in water the difference between the final and initial ph was recorded and plotted vs the initial ph for the estimation of phpzc of mg al cldh fig s3 results showed that phpzc of mg al cldh was around 9 8 reflecting the mg al cldh surface is positively charged within a wide range of ph 3 0 9 0 47 this phenomenon could be explained with the change of b species in aqueous solutions under different ph conditions where at ph 3 0 9 0 boric acid h3bo3 is the dominant species and in ph 9 5 12 0 tetrahydroxyborate b oh 4 species are dominant hence this would explain the poor removal performance at the strong alkaline conditions which can be attributed to the possible electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged b species and the negatively charged mg al cldh such results implied that alkaline conditions are not so preferable for b removal by mg al cldh these implications will be confirmed later by detailed kinetic analysis and the proposed removal mechanisms corresponding to the ph conditions and available aqueous b species from the previously discussed results it is concluded that the removal of b species from aqueous solutions onto mg al cldh is ph dependent with the best performance at range of 3 0 9 6 qiu et al 48 reported similar results in accordance of ph effects on the sorption of b onto d ldh 700 with a dosage of 2 5 g l which was higher than that considered in this study though maximum sorption capacity in this study was higher by 22 01 mg g compared to theirs which was 2 37 mg g meanwhile spent mg al cldh samples at ph 3 0 and 9 0 were analyzed using xrd fig s4 results illustrated similar xrd patterns of both samples with a slight difference in intensity count 3 3 temperature effect reaction temperature effect was investigated on the removal of b by mg al cldh as shown in fig 3b with increased reaction temperatures higher removal rates of b in aqueous solutions were observed at temperature 70 c b concentration in the solution reached its equilibrium at less than 6 h with higher removal rate than that of the other temperatures which have not reached the same sorption value even after 24 h of reaction time such results reflected the endothermic nature of the removal process of b by mg al cldh where the higher temperature introduced to the reaction the better the removal efficiency is achieved isaacs et al 31 reported that with increased reaction temperature up to 35 c b sorption capacity onto mg al cldh has decreased compared to lower temperatures such as 15 and 25 c where both showed similar adsorption capacities while in the present study 25 c showed comparable removal performance to the high temperatures approaching to almost full final removal efficiency after 24 h of the reaction time such results confirmed the high applicability of mg al cldh in the real b removal applications which will not favor the high operating temperatures 3 4 initial b concentration effect the effect of initial concentration on b removal by mg al cldh is displayed in fig 3c results showed that even at high concentrations mg al cldh proved to be an efficient sorbent to b up to initial b concentration of 40 mg l 2 g l of mg al cldh was able to efficiently remove b from the solution with high equilibrium rate especially at the lower concentrations 5 10 and 20 mg l with the same mg al cldh dosage initial b concentration of 80 mg l showed promising results in the removal of the contaminant the first 18 h of the experiment but clear desorption was detected at the later stages which was confirmed by the sudden rise in case of 80 mg l to reach 36 1 mg l after 24 h from the start of the reaction so there could be three explanations from our point of view for such trend the first one of course is the possible error in the analysis or during the withdrawal of the sample from the reaction solution which can be relatively eliminated owing to the same observations after duplicating the experiment the second possible reason is that the affinity of the sorbed b species on ldh surface could be affected by the long reaction time 24 h as well as the availability of the remained b species in the solution at such very high initial concentration 49 50 this explanation can be supported by the fact that such final desorption did not occur at the other lower initial concentration values the third possible reason is that the affinity of the adsorbate to the adsorbent could have been affected by the change in the solution ph knowing that ph observations showed an increasing trend over the reaction time which can cause a partial elution of the sorbed b into the solution in conclusion b removal by mg al cldh seemed to be initial concentration independent at low concentration levels while it has a significant effect at high initial concentrations 3 5 mg al cldh dosage effect the results revealed that the higher the mg al cldh dosage the higher the b removal can be achieved fig 3d at the highest dosages 0 2 0 5 and 2 0 g l higher b removal rates were observed comparing to the lower dosage values however even with dosage value of 0 1 g l removal rate was still clear and reached its maximum adsorption at 8 mg l of b residual concentration the trend for dosage value of 2 0 g l showed faster removal rate at the early stage to reach 7 2 mg l b concentration within just the first 30 min while sorption capacity weakened at lower dosages due to the high b species availability compared to mg al cldh dosage the trend of both dosages 0 2 and 0 5 g l were almost identical with a slight superiority to the 0 5 g l dosage b removal capacity was enhanced in case of higher mg al cldh dosage because of the corresponding increase in the available sorption sites on mg al cldh surface while the initial b concentration was constant 3 6 ambient effect in order to consider the effect of the ambient environment unaerated aerobic and anaerobic tests were conducted in the duration of 24 hour reaction time which were compared with unaerated data with the same basic operating variables fig 4a it is worth mentioning that the difference between all the considered ambient conditions is as follows unaerated the flask is sealed with a rubber plug aerobic air is purged into the solution via air pump and anaerobic n2 is purging into the solution during the reaction time the aerobic conditions were the least efficient in adsorbing b from the solution comparing to the other two ambient conditions whereas the anaerobic conditions achieved much higher removal rate than the aerobic before reaching its equilibrium at b concentration of 1 3 mg l while unaerated conditions showed almost similar trend to the anaerobic by reaching final b concentration of 0 4 mg l after 24 h this could be clearly attributed to the possible increase of carbonate ions concentration in the reaction solution caused by co2 dissolution from the atmosphere 3 7 synthesized seawater effect this experiment was conducted to study the effect of applying mg al cldh on synthesized seawater to observe the material effect on removing b in the presence of different co existing ions found in such waters as shown in fig 4b it was clear that b sorption in synthesized seawater with typical seawater b concentration 5 mg l was interfered with the competing co existing ions thus removal of the targeted contaminant was not fully detected consideration of the previous result two more stock solutions synthesized seawater with increased initial b concentration at 20 mg l were used to further study the sorption at different mg al cldh dosages 0 2 and 0 5 g l it was clear that at higher initial b concentrated seawater reasonable sorption was achieved such results can be attributed to having dominating b species corresponding to the competing co existing ions in the solution to be adsorbed on to mg al cldh in this case the 0 2 g l dosage demonstrated higher removal rates than that of 0 5 g l which could be explained by two points happening simultaneously the first would be the competition between b and co existing ions in the solution regardless of the dominance of b species the second point is the availability of the adsorbent dosage corresponding to the initial b concentration which was high resulting in low removal of b from the synthesized solution such phenomenon could be attributed to the possible discrepancies occurred within the adsorbate adsorbent interactions 51 xrd analysis was conducted considering the spent mg al cldh samples with initial b concentration of 20 mg l fig s5 the interference of the different co existing ions with the adsorption of b on mg al cldh was clearly depicted from the xrd patterns however it was in favor of the possible co precipitation of b with the co existing cations ca2 na and k these findings supported the explanation of having dominating b species at higher boron concentration 20 mg l with respect to the competing co existing ions in the solution leading to b sorption onto mg al cldh still the involvement of the interlayered sorption of hbo3 2 and b oh 4 was yet confirmed by the same previously detected peaks 3 8 post reaction changes in mg al cldh tem imaging was conducted for the spent mg al cldh to investigate the shape deformation associated with the reaction with b as shown in fig 5a the hexagonal shape was not maintained after the reaction represented by irregular deformation attributed to the sorbed b on the surface furthermore the interlayered effect was clearly observed in the spent material reflecting the high possibility of the involvement of the interlayered sorption of b additionally sem eds analysis of the spent mg al cldh was conducted for further proof on the presence of the sorbed b in the spent material fig 5b the elemental mapping revealed the good distribution of ldh elements mg and al on the surface which was associated with the sorption and the well distribution as well of b on the surface such results were confirmed by the presence of b peak in the eds spectrum with a weight content ratio of 2 45 3 9 rsm parametric interactions three different regression models were considered linear 2fi and quadratic models the quadratic model was suggested to be the best fitting to b removal by mg al cldh corresponding to the highest r2 highest adequate precision and the lowest aic values comparing to the linear and 2fi models table s2 the predicted r2 0 886 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 864 i e the difference is less than 0 2 moreover the adequate precision value which measures the signal to noise ratio of 24 42 greater than 4 is desirable indicating that the suggested quadratic model can be used to navigate the design space the lack of fit f value implies that there is around 0 01 chance that a lack of fit f value this large could occur due to noise the model f value of 40 49 implies that the model is significant and there is only a 0 01 chance that an f value this large could occur due to noise the significantly low p value 0 0001 of the model indicates that most of the model terms are significant the model terms with p value less than 0 0500 are considered as significant terms hence in the quadratic model a b d e a2 and d2 are the most significant model terms table s3 while values greater than 0 1000 indicate that the model terms are not significant hence some of the model parameters were eliminated from the regression equation because of their insignificancy however there were still considered in the 3d rsm charts as they gave great indication of the interaction effects between the different parameters towards b removal efficiency because of the occurrence of the ambient categoric parameter three regression equations were developed corresponding to the three levels of the ambient conditions eqs s1 s3 from the perturbation charts fig s6 and the parametric effect of linear factors fig s7 it was clear that mg al cldh dosage and initial ph of the solution were the most significant parameters towards the change in b removal efficiency moreover the 3d rsm charts confirmed the proportional inverse interaction effect of reaction parameters on b removal efficiency fig 6 for instance the lower the initial ph and b initial concentration the higher the b removal efficiency moreover the middle high range of mg al cldh dosage values was the suitable range to achieve high b removal efficiency in spite of ph temperature and initial concentration effects 3 10 kinetics four kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion were applied in order to investigate the reaction rate and the associated kinetics parameters of b sorption onto mg al cldh the following linear forms of the kinetic models were considered in the analysis 52 56 1 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t pseudo first order model 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t pseudo second order model 3 q t 1 b ln ab 1 b ln t elovich model 4 q t k i t 1 2 c i intraparticle diffusion model where q e mg g is boron sorption capacity at equilibrium q t mg g is sorption capacity at time t min k 1 min 1 is pseudo first order rate constant k 2 g mg min is pseudo second order rate constant b mg g min is initial sorption rate constant a g mg is elovich rate constant k i mg g min1 2 is intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c i mg g is boundary layer thickness constant kinetic parameters estimated from the slope and intersection values from the linear plots and correlation coefficients r 2 are shown in table 2 the linear plots of the kinetic modeling corresponding to the effect of initial ph reaction temperature initial b concentration and mg al cldh dosage are provided in supplementary materials figs s8 s9 s10 and s11 respectively results showed that the best fitting kinetic model to describe b sorption by mg al cldh was pseudo second order model corresponding to the highest correlation coefficients comparing to the other applied models these results implied that the removal process of b by mg al cldh was mainly governed by chemisorption interactions 28 it was clear that the sorption kinetic rate became higher by approaching towards the neutral conditions while it declined at the strong acidic or alkaline conditions moreover the reaction rate was proportional to the increase in the temperature reflecting the endothermic nature of the reactions as will be confirmed later by a detailed thermodynamic analysis furthermore the initial b concentration significantly affected the kinetic rate where the more the initial concentration the lower the value of kinetic rate constant whereas the sorption capacity at higher concentrations such as 40 and 80 mg l depicted higher values of 18 30 and 34 60 mg g respectively additionally the increase in mg al cldh dosage had a positive effect on the reaction with higher kinetic rate constant values 3 11 isotherm modeling three different isotherm models were applied considering b sorption data at different initial concentrations including langmuir freundlich and radushkevich dubinin r d isotherm models the following linear model formulas were considered for the isotherm analysis 57 62 5 c e q e c e q l 1 q l k l langmuir model 6 ln k f 1 n ln c e freundlich model 7 ln q e ln q rd k rd rtln 1 1 c e 2 radushkevich dubinin r d model where c e mg l is equilibrium concentration q l mg g is maximum sorption capacity k l l mg is langmuir isotherm constant k f l g is freundlich isotherm constant n is heterogeneity constant q rd mg g is maximum r d sorption capacity k rd mol2 kj2 is r d isotherm constant r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant and t k is temperature isotherm parameters were calculated from the slope and intersection values of the linear isotherm plots fig s12 from the presented parameters in table 3 it was clear that langmuir isotherm model was the best fitting model to describe b sorption data with the highest correlation percentage of 99 96 such results suggested the uniformity of the sorption sites energies on mg al cldh 58 61 moreover it was confirmed that b removal by mg al cldh occurred through a mono layer sorption which supported the formerly mentioned kinetic analysis results however freundlich isotherm model showed a good fitting as well with heterogeneity constant n value of 12 447 confirming the presence of heterogeneous sorption sites on the surface of mg al cldh moreover the comparison between the obtained experimental data and the non linear plots of the isotherm model confirmed the validity of langmuir model in describing the b sorption process with the most correlated sorption capacity value 22 10 mg g to the experimental one 21 95 mg g fig 7 calcination showed comparable effect on promoting the scorpion capacity of mg al cldh towards b which was clearly stated in this study as shown in table 4 such results were in a good agreement with previous reported studies confirming the enhancing influence of the calcination process for instance the calcined mg al ldh at 550 c and 450 c resulted in b sorption capacities of 13 and 17 3 mg g respectively while the non calcined ldhs showed lower performances for guo et al 63 b to hydrotalcite ratio b ht 0 5 was far greater than this study s ratio b ht 0 016 nevertheless the presented mg al cldh in this study exhibited a comparable and almost equal b sorption capacities for calcined and non calcined ht respectively correspondingly the non calcined mg al ldh removed only 37 9 mg g of 250 mg l initial b concentration considering a significantly high and impractical sorbent dosage the presented mg al cldh exhibited b sorption capacity of around 22 mg g corresponding to 80 mg l initial concentration fig s13 therefore in terms of initial b concentration mg al cldh dosage and reasonable calcination conditions the current study showed a great potential towards efficient b removal comparing to previously reported studies 3 12 thermodynamics thermodynamic analysis was conducted considering b adsorption experimental data at different reaction temperatures using the following equations 66 68 8 δ g rt ln k 9 lnk δ h rt δ s r where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k k is adsorption equilibrium constant δg is change in gibbs free energy kj mol t is temperature kalvin δs is change in entropy j mol k and δh is change in enthalpy kj mol the calculated values of these thermodynamics parameters presented in table 5 were evaluated by plotting lnk vs 1 t and determining the slope and interception values fig s14 the negative value of δg pointed to the endothermic nature of the removal of b from aqueous solutions by mg al cldh indicating the enhancement in b removal by raising the reaction temperature moreover the positive value of entropy change indicated that the randomness of solid liquid interaction increased within the adsorption process of b the magnitude of enthalpy change 104 04 kj mol and the magnitudes of the change in free energy indicated that b removal by mg al cldh involved both physisorption and chemisorption processes 3 13 regeneration of mg al cldh since the reusability of the spent adsorbent is one the most crucial aspects for real water treatment applications regeneration experiments were conducted to assess the reusability of mg al cldh in b removal from aqueous solutions three consecutive adsorption desorption cycles have been considered and the results are presented in fig s15 the results implied that 1 0 m naoh solution was adequate for the elution of the loaded b on the spent mg al cldh with desorption percentage of around 84 95 and 96 over the three cycles meanwhile such successful desorption process allowed the regenerated mg al cldh to exhibit great performance in b removal within the adsorption cycles to achieve 75 b removal efficiency after the first regeneration cycle followed by a slight decrease in the last two cycles to reach around 68 at the end of the third cycle such results depicted the high potential of the regenerated mg al cldh in achieving comparable b sorption 3 14 removal mechanism the removal of b by mg al cldh involved two possible removal mechanisms a the interlayered sorption of the dominant aqueous b species onto mg al cldh which mainly conducted as anion exchange reactions in consistence with other reported studies 29 64 therefore b anions b oh 4 and hbo3 2 were captured within the reconstructed interlayer of mg al cldh via intercalation as shown in fig 8a 33 which was also confirmed by the bo and boh bonds reflected from the ftir spectrum 10 mg al ldh b oh 4 b oh 4 mg al ldh the second involved step b removal of by mg al cldh is b the possible co precipitation of b species with the co existing cations in the synthesized seawater e g na ca2 and k on the outer surface of the mg al cldh such findings were supported by the appeared xrd peaks which were associated to the formed precipitates na bx ca bx and k bx confirming the possible competition of the co existing ions in seawater with mg al cldh on b removal the proposed removal mechanisms in this study were supported by the current kinetic analysis findings in this study which implied that chemisorption is the main removal mechanism for b removal by mg al cldh following the pseudo second order kinetic model moreover the fitting of the sorption data with langmuir isotherm model depicted the monolayer capturing of b species on mg al cldh furthermore the calculated adsorption free energy e from r d isotherm model was 414 3 kj mol within the range of 8 0 16 0 kj mol confirming that the sorption process is following ion exchange nevertheless the results of thermodynamic analysis revealed the possible contribution of the physisorption in the sorption process such results can be interpreted by the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged b species and the positively charged surface of mg al cldh which was achieved at ph values lower than the point of zero charge pzc ph 9 6 31 69 70 as displayed in fig 8b most of the dominant b species in aqueous solutions are presented around the neutral conditions therefore electrostatic attraction between the b species and mg al cldh were expected to be occurred at lower ph values where mg al cldh surface was positively charged while by raising ph value approaching towards neutral conditions b removal was induced due to the sufficiency of the variant negatively charged b species whereas at strong alkaline conditions lower than pzc the electrostatic repulsion resulted in less b removal that explanation was in a good agreement with the obtained results from ph experiments where ph 9 0 and ph 3 0 showed comparable b removal efficiencies while they were much higher than that at ph 12 0 hence it should be concluded that the optimum ph range for b removal by mg al cldh could be suggested from 5 0 to 9 6 4 conclusions mg al cldh was successfully developed and tested under various conditions to determine the optimum reaction conditions for b removal from aqueous solutions the following implications were determined based on the outcomes from this study 1 the shape of the mg al cldh sorbent could be described as typical hexagonal plate shape with an average size of 20 100 nm 2 it was clear that the sorption kinetic rate became higher by approaching towards the neutral ph conditions while it declined at the strong acidic or alkaline conditions following the pseudo second order kinetic model 3 high b removal rates were observed at high reaction temperatures reflecting the endothermic nature of the reaction and reached equilibrium within less than 6 h at temperature of 70 c 4 calcined adsorbent mg al cldh was capable of removing high b concentration 80 mg l from aqueous solutions with reasonable dosage 2 g l achieving a comparable sorption capacity 22 1 mg g 5 unaerated and anaerobic ambient conditions showed high potential in achieving high b removal whereas aerobic condition caused lower adsorption 6 b sorption in synthesized seawater was interfered with the competing co existing ions thus pretreatment of seawater could be favorable towards higher b removal performance 7 isotherm and thermodynamic modeling confirmed that b removal by mg al cldh occurred

13144,in this study calcined mg al layered double hydroxide mg al cldh was successfully synthesized for boron b removal from aqueous solutions batch experiments were conducted considering various reaction conditions including initial ph reaction temperature initial b concentration mg al cldh dosage ambient condition and co existing ions effect for optimizing b removal efficiency results showed that sorption kinetic rate became higher by approaching towards the neutral ph conditions while it declined at the strong acidic or alkaline conditions mg al cldh was capable of removing high b concentration 80 mg l from aqueous solutions at a reasonable dosage of 2 g l with a comparable sorption capacity 22 1 mg g to other reported studies moreover high b removal rates were observed at high reaction temperatures reflecting the endothermic nature of the reaction and reached equilibrium within less than 6 h at temperature of 70 c moreover results of 3d rsm modeling confirmed that the middle high range of mg al cldh dosage values was the suitable range to achieve high b removal efficiency in spite of ph temperature and initial concentration effects furthermore isotherm modeling confirmed that b removal by mg al cldh occurred via a mono layer sorption and thermodynamic modeling revealed the positive value of entropy change indicating that the randomness of the solid liquid interaction increased within the adsorption process of b spent mg al cldh showed great reusability performance by achieving 67 75 b removal efficiency over three consecutive regeneration cycles confirming the high potential and applicability of the presented adsorbent in real water treatment applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords boron removal mg al layer double hydroxide isotherm modeling kinetics 3d rsm 1 introduction boron b presence in water bodies especially seawater is naturally occurred and generally considered as an essential element for plants animals and even humans at significantly controlled amounts human activities are another crucial source for the occurrence of excessive b concentration in water bodies most of the boron found in water bodies surface water and groundwater are most likely the result of humanmade pollution 1 in surface water b presence is mostly caused by wastewater discharge with high amounts of detergents which contain borate bo3 3 moreover industrial discharge from glass film food preservatives and fertilizers hold a major part in water pollution by boron 1 2 whereas b can be found in groundwater in the forms of borate and borosilicate as a result of sedimentary rocks and soil leaching 3 b concentration in groundwater ranges from 0 3 to 100 mg l while in surface water where the majority of b is occurred at an average concentration of 4 5 mg l 4 the exposure to excessive b concentration in water may cause severe health effects on humans including nervous system disorder and gastrointestinal disorder moreover high b concentrations can harmfully affect plants causing growth retardation 5 hence the world health organization who has set guidelines for b concentration in drinking water to be 0 5 mg l 6 several technologies were considered for the removal of boron from aqueous solutions such as adsorption reverse osmosis ro ion exchange and coagulation electrocoagulation 7 9 ro membranes are advantaged by the long term feasibility and the environmentally friendly features yet they cannot completely remove b from water in such regard ro membranes can efficiently remove borate anions from seawater unlike the neutrally charged boric acid h3bo3 which could be rejected by the membranes in addition to the limitations related to the ph dependency 10 it has been reported that removal rates using ro membranes vary depending on the treatment ph range boric acid recorded rejection rates of 40 60 at ph range of 5 5 9 5 on the other hand in the same ph conditions borate ion registered removal rates at 95 11 the easy implementation as well as the high selectivity to boron species of some synthesized resins are the major driving aspects towards considering ion exchange technology for b removal from aqueous mediums 12 nevertheless this technology is not so efficient at high b concentrations and also can be greatly influenced be several reaction factors e g ph temperature and co existing anions 13 coagulation method is a well known removal technology for b from water still it suffers from the low removal efficiency high operational cost and high rate of the yielded sludge causing secondary pollution 14 such drawbacks can be overcome via the electrocoagulation designed reactors yet the high cost remains an issue meanwhile adsorption is the most commonly used technology for b removal from water due to the simples operation high removal efficiency low cost chemical stability easy regeneration and modification abilities of the adsorbents 15 in such regard various sorbents have been investigated for boron removal such as activated carbon 16 fly ash clays natural minerals biomass based materials 17 metal oxides 18 mesoporous silica nanoparticles complexing membranes 19 and selective resins 20 one of the promising and most efficient are ldhs and ldh like materials 21 having a flexible composition via altering the nature of the interlayer without changing the basic structure as well as the ability to remove a wide range of anions from aqueous mediums are ldhs most favorable advantages thus ldhs are applicable in various fields as catalysts or catalysts precursors anion exchangers flame retardants stabilizers for polymers and electroactive photoactive materials 22 24 many types of ldhs classified by the type of the merged cations in ldh layers have been considered in water treatment applications 25 mg al ldh has been tested and reported to have unique properties in b removal from water including high adsorption capacity exceptional anion exchange rate and mobility of interlayer anions in water molecules 26 it has been previously reported that b adsorption on mg al ldh is greatly enhanced via ldh calcination at high temperatures 500 700 c owing to the structural change in ldh interlayer within calcination process which increases b intake capacity 27 therefore calcined mg al ldh can be considered as one of the most promising ldhs for b removal from aqueous solutions several reported studies focused on investigating b removal by mg al ldh however there are always knowledge gaps found in the literature when it comes to aspects related to reaction parameters optimization for instance some researchers considered very high dosage of mg al ldh 5 20 g l as optimized value which could be hard to be feasible in real applications 28 31 moreover many reports neglected the regeneration desorption performance of the b reacted mg al ldh as well as the reaction temperature and initial ph effects 32 33 furthermore few studies have been concerned on the interaction effects of the reaction conditions towards b removal efficiency by mg al ldh which can be very critical to understand the combined influence of such parameters hence the main aim of this study is to investigate most of the possibly influencing aspects on b removal by calcined mg al ldh including initial ph temperature initial boron concentration mg al ldh dosage aerobic anaerobic conditions and regeneration abilities moreover different characterization techniques have been considered to examine the fresh and reacted materials including transmission and scanning electron microscopies tem and sem coupled with energy dispersive spectrum eds x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir additionally deepen insights into the removal mechanism of boron by mg al ldh were determined considering detailed kinetic isotherm and thermodynamics analyses furthermore one of the novelty aspects in this work is considering the response surface methodology rsm for the determination of the interaction effects between the different reaction parameters towards b removal from aqueous solutions by mg al ldh additionally the regeneration abilities of the b loaded adsorbent were evaluated through adsorption desorption cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials non calcined and calcined mg al ldh were synthesized using the following materials magnesium nitrate hexahydrate mg no3 2 6h2o aluminum nitrate nonahydrate al no3 3 9h2o and sodium hydroxide naoh 34 stock solution of 500 mg l initial b concentration was prepared using boric acid h3bo3 diluted hydrochloric acid hcl and concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 were considered for ph adjustment and b concentration analysis respectively all solutions were prepared using deoxygenated deionized water 2 2 mg al ldh synthesis the preparation of 10 g non calcined mg al ldh was carried out in the duration of three days 700 ml aqueous solution containing 0 1 mol of mg no3 2 6h2o and 0 05 mol of al no3 3 9h2o were mixed vigorously 30 the solution mixture was then added drop wise to 1500 ml of 2 m naoh solution while stirred using a mechanical mixer set at 400 rpm the temperature was kept at 45 3 c during the process the obtained slurry was then heated for 2 h t 85 3 c under slow mixing at 200 rpm the solution was kept in room temperature for 12 h next day the slurry product was separated by centrifugation technique and washed with deionized water several times until ph reached 8 5 9 5 and conductivity was constant the collected solid material was dried at 60 c for 48 h then small part of the dried product was collected for further use as non calcined ldh while the rest was calcined at 550 c for 4 h to be used as calcined ldh mg al cldh the solid material was dry and light enough to be crushed into powder like form which were later kept in a concealed container for the batch experimental use abbas et al 18 reported that sorption of b on magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide reached its maximum sorption capabilities at ph 9 5 and ph 8 0 respectively which was the reason that ph was determined to be ph 8 5 9 5 during synthesis 2 3 characterization the physical chemical characteristics of mg al ldh and mg al cldh composites were investigated by several techniques the shape and morphological features were investigated using transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100f jeol co japan scanning electron microscopic analysis was conducted using sem jcm 6000 jeol co japan coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds for the examination of the surface properties and the elemental mapping of the spent mg al cldh after the reaction with b furthermore additional tem eds analysis was performed for further determination of the changes in the structure of ldh after calcination and reaction with b tem jem 2800 jeol co japan chemical composition and crystallinity of mg al cldh were determined by x ray diffraction xrd analysis using cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 å on ttr rigaku diffractometer set at 40 kv and 40 ma with scanning angle 2θ ranged from 3 to 90 and scanning speed of 2 min 1 35 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was conducted at wavenumber range of 500 4000 cm 1 using ftir device ft ir 4200 jasco japan for the determination of surface functional groups in fresh and spent mg al cldh additionally n2 adsorption desorption measurements were conducted using brunauer emmett and teller bet specific surface area ssa analyzer 3flex micromeritics corp to determine the ssa of the freshly synthesized mg al cldh and the corresponding n2 adsorption desorption isotherm 2 4 batch experiments analysis batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption of b on mg al ldh using polypropylene pp flasks in order to avoid reaction of b with glass trial experiment was conducted first to determine the calcination effect on b removal by mg al ldh considering 5 mg l initial b concentration and 5 g l adsorbent dosage data are not shown mg al cldh showed around 56 enhancement in b removal efficiency comparing to that of mg al ldh after 1 day reaction time hence mg al cldh was considered as the main adsorbent material for reaction parameters investigation all the base line value of the parameters to be considered in the batch experiments were determined based on a previously performed experimental optimization with respect to the highest removal efficiency towards boron solution volume of 100 ml with the following basic initial conditions ph 9 0 temperature of 25 c initial b concentration of 20 mg l and mg al ldh dosage of 2 g l at unaerated conditions to further investigate variations of the reaction parameters a study of their effects on the removal of boron was considered initial ph effect on the removal of b by mg al cldh at different ph levels 3 6 9 and 12 were considered reaction temperature effect was also examined with a range of 25 40 55 and 70 c effect of initial b concentration 5 10 20 40 and 80 mg l and cldh dosage of 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 2 0 g l were studied as well furthermore to study ambient conditions two separate experiments were conducted the anaerobic test was done using nitrogen purging into the solution during the whole time of the experiment to provide deoxygenated environment and aerobic test was conducted by pumping air into the batch throughout the whole experiment as well in order to simulate the real conditions of b removal from real seawater synthesized seawater was considered as batch solution based on the astm standard practice for preparing ocean water d 1141 98 2003 36 the chemical components used for seawater synthesis are as in table s1 were added to 1 l of deoxygenated deionized water in a polypropylene flask and kept as a stock solution comparison was conducted on the removal of b between the synthesized b solution and the synthesized seawater solution with b concentration of 5 mg l samples of 5 ml were withdrawn at specific time intervals during 24 h then analyzed for b concentration using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer the following process was commenced for b concentration analysis 75 ml of sulfuric acid in a 400 ml conical flask one bag of borover 3 b reagent powder packs were added and mixed well for 5 min 35 ml of the above mixed reagent was added to another two flasks 2 ml of deionized water was added to one flask and another 2 ml of the b contaminated water was added to the other flask then mixed well after 25 min of reaction time the solutions were added to measuring vials and wiped of any excesses then measurement was conducted 2 5 regeneration and desorption procedures the reusability of the synthesized mg al cldh was evaluated through adsorption desorption cycles 0 2 g of mg al cldh was added to 100 ml of b solution with initial concentration of 20 mg l adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 9 0 and at room temperature after 4 h reaction time which was enough for b concentration to reach really close to the equilibrium value the spent solid was separated from the solution using vacuum filtration with 0 2 μm filter paper to be later used in the desorption cycle the regeneration of b loaded mg al cldh was conducted using 1 0 m naoh solution for 30 min the process was conducted for three consecutive cycles to expand the assessment range of the reusability performance 2 6 response surface methodology rsm optimization response surface methodology rsm integrated with statistical analysis was conducted considering the experimental data of the investigated parameters to describe their effects on b removal efficiency using mg al cldh hence anova analysis was performed based on the displayed parameters coding and value ranges in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization for characterization of mg al ldh and mg al cldh different characterization techniques were considered and the results are discussed in the following sections 3 1 1 tem analysis tem analysis demonstrated the shape and size of the freshly synthesized mg al cldh and mg al ldh as shown in fig 1 the hexagonal typical plates shape was observed in both cldh and ldh the imaging analysis of tem images revealed a range size of mg al ldh plates of around 20 100 nm furthermore the elemental mapping and eds spectrum confirmed the well distribution of mg al and o on the surface of both cldh and ldh revealing the successful synthesis of the targeted sorbent the presence of c and cu peaks was attributed to the carbon cupper tem grid used for samples preparation 3 1 2 xrd analysis xrd analysis was used to determine the crystalline structure and the characteristic reflections of the fresh and spent mg al cldh samples as shown in fig 2 xrd of the fresh mg al cldh confirmed the successful calcination of the ldh material by the presence of the periclase mgo phase associated with diffraction peaks at 2θ of 43 and 63 37 the calcination process at 550 c caused the formation of mg al based spinel attributed to the small peaks at the 2θ range of 10 to 40 such spinel attributed peaks have been previously observed at other high calcination temperature values of 600 c and 900 c which can be related to both the temperature of calcination as well as the calcination time 3 8 h in the reported studies 38 39 the absence of any hydrotalcite related peaks in the fresh mg al cldh confirmed that the interlayered ldh structure was changed into the mixed mg al oxide form after the reaction with b the rehydration of mg al cldh as well as the intercalation of b anions at the interlayer caused the reconstruction of ldh structure which was confirmed by the typical hydrotalcite characteristic peaks for 003 and 006 planes at 2θ range of 7 and 26 in addition to the other non basal peaks for 018 110 and 113 planes 37 39 furthermore the involvement of mg al complexes in the interlayer sorption of b anions b oh 4 and hbo3 2 was associated with the peaks at 2θ of 33 8 and 36 2 respectively 40 the interlayer space of ldh d was calculated for the spent material to be 0 784 nm based on the previously reported cell parameter c calculations c 3d003 6d006 2 d c 3 which was comparable to the reported values in the literature confirming the intercalation of b anions water and hydroxide ions 41 42 3 1 3 n2 bet measurements bet based measurements of n2 adsorption desorption for mg al cldh is provided in fig s1 the yielded isotherm curves were classified as isotherm iii shape according to iupac classification such h3 type hysteresis reflected the successful description of irregular solids with plate shaped particles furthermore the results of bet ssa analysis showed that mg al cldh has an average pore size range of 3 23 3 97 nm and ssa of around 288 3 m2 g 3 1 4 ftir analysis ftir spectra of fresh and spent mg al cldh is provided in fig s2 broad peaks were observed in both fresh and spent mg al cldh at 3700 3000 cm 1 which were assigned to the oh stretching vibration 43 44 the peak near 1640 cm 1 was attributed to the hoh vibration of the angular deformation of water molecules 45 moreover the peaks at 700 550 cm 1 were assigned to mgo and alo vibrations 44 b sorption was confirmed by the presence of two relatively small peaks at 1500 1300 cm 1 and near 1195 cm 1 which were assigned to bo and boh bonds respectively 46 3 2 initial ph effect the results of the effect of the initial ph on b removal by mg al cldh is shown in fig 3a results revealed that ph 12 0 showed the least removal rate of b throughout the entire reaction time 24 h whereas the other ph values showed much better performance such results reflected the unfavourability of the strong alkaline conditions for b removal from aqueous solutions by mg al cldh almost all other initial ph values showed similar trend and reached equilibrium after around 10 h from starting the experiment ph 9 0 showed a slight improvement in the kinetic rate at the early stage of the reaction with a rapid removal rate to reach b concentration of 7 2 mg l after only 1 h from the start of the experiment it is worth mentioning that ph 3 0 and 6 0 showed a comparable performance to ph 9 0 with an almost identical trend at the later stages nevertheless ph 9 0 was slightly favorable final b concentration of 0 2 mg l after 24 h reaction time in other experiments data are not shown considering lower initial boron concentrations 5 and 10 mg l ph 12 0 showed the same lowest removal rate followed by ph 3 0 in order to understand the effect of initial ph on b removal by mg al cldh salt addition approach was considered for the calculations of point of zero charge phpzc of mg al cldh 0 1 g fresh mg al cldh was added to 50 ml of 0 1 m kcl solution at different initial ph values 3 0 12 0 then kept at room temperature with periodical vigorous hand shaking over 24 h such shaking style was adopted because of the high solubility of ldh materials in water the difference between the final and initial ph was recorded and plotted vs the initial ph for the estimation of phpzc of mg al cldh fig s3 results showed that phpzc of mg al cldh was around 9 8 reflecting the mg al cldh surface is positively charged within a wide range of ph 3 0 9 0 47 this phenomenon could be explained with the change of b species in aqueous solutions under different ph conditions where at ph 3 0 9 0 boric acid h3bo3 is the dominant species and in ph 9 5 12 0 tetrahydroxyborate b oh 4 species are dominant hence this would explain the poor removal performance at the strong alkaline conditions which can be attributed to the possible electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged b species and the negatively charged mg al cldh such results implied that alkaline conditions are not so preferable for b removal by mg al cldh these implications will be confirmed later by detailed kinetic analysis and the proposed removal mechanisms corresponding to the ph conditions and available aqueous b species from the previously discussed results it is concluded that the removal of b species from aqueous solutions onto mg al cldh is ph dependent with the best performance at range of 3 0 9 6 qiu et al 48 reported similar results in accordance of ph effects on the sorption of b onto d ldh 700 with a dosage of 2 5 g l which was higher than that considered in this study though maximum sorption capacity in this study was higher by 22 01 mg g compared to theirs which was 2 37 mg g meanwhile spent mg al cldh samples at ph 3 0 and 9 0 were analyzed using xrd fig s4 results illustrated similar xrd patterns of both samples with a slight difference in intensity count 3 3 temperature effect reaction temperature effect was investigated on the removal of b by mg al cldh as shown in fig 3b with increased reaction temperatures higher removal rates of b in aqueous solutions were observed at temperature 70 c b concentration in the solution reached its equilibrium at less than 6 h with higher removal rate than that of the other temperatures which have not reached the same sorption value even after 24 h of reaction time such results reflected the endothermic nature of the removal process of b by mg al cldh where the higher temperature introduced to the reaction the better the removal efficiency is achieved isaacs et al 31 reported that with increased reaction temperature up to 35 c b sorption capacity onto mg al cldh has decreased compared to lower temperatures such as 15 and 25 c where both showed similar adsorption capacities while in the present study 25 c showed comparable removal performance to the high temperatures approaching to almost full final removal efficiency after 24 h of the reaction time such results confirmed the high applicability of mg al cldh in the real b removal applications which will not favor the high operating temperatures 3 4 initial b concentration effect the effect of initial concentration on b removal by mg al cldh is displayed in fig 3c results showed that even at high concentrations mg al cldh proved to be an efficient sorbent to b up to initial b concentration of 40 mg l 2 g l of mg al cldh was able to efficiently remove b from the solution with high equilibrium rate especially at the lower concentrations 5 10 and 20 mg l with the same mg al cldh dosage initial b concentration of 80 mg l showed promising results in the removal of the contaminant the first 18 h of the experiment but clear desorption was detected at the later stages which was confirmed by the sudden rise in case of 80 mg l to reach 36 1 mg l after 24 h from the start of the reaction so there could be three explanations from our point of view for such trend the first one of course is the possible error in the analysis or during the withdrawal of the sample from the reaction solution which can be relatively eliminated owing to the same observations after duplicating the experiment the second possible reason is that the affinity of the sorbed b species on ldh surface could be affected by the long reaction time 24 h as well as the availability of the remained b species in the solution at such very high initial concentration 49 50 this explanation can be supported by the fact that such final desorption did not occur at the other lower initial concentration values the third possible reason is that the affinity of the adsorbate to the adsorbent could have been affected by the change in the solution ph knowing that ph observations showed an increasing trend over the reaction time which can cause a partial elution of the sorbed b into the solution in conclusion b removal by mg al cldh seemed to be initial concentration independent at low concentration levels while it has a significant effect at high initial concentrations 3 5 mg al cldh dosage effect the results revealed that the higher the mg al cldh dosage the higher the b removal can be achieved fig 3d at the highest dosages 0 2 0 5 and 2 0 g l higher b removal rates were observed comparing to the lower dosage values however even with dosage value of 0 1 g l removal rate was still clear and reached its maximum adsorption at 8 mg l of b residual concentration the trend for dosage value of 2 0 g l showed faster removal rate at the early stage to reach 7 2 mg l b concentration within just the first 30 min while sorption capacity weakened at lower dosages due to the high b species availability compared to mg al cldh dosage the trend of both dosages 0 2 and 0 5 g l were almost identical with a slight superiority to the 0 5 g l dosage b removal capacity was enhanced in case of higher mg al cldh dosage because of the corresponding increase in the available sorption sites on mg al cldh surface while the initial b concentration was constant 3 6 ambient effect in order to consider the effect of the ambient environment unaerated aerobic and anaerobic tests were conducted in the duration of 24 hour reaction time which were compared with unaerated data with the same basic operating variables fig 4a it is worth mentioning that the difference between all the considered ambient conditions is as follows unaerated the flask is sealed with a rubber plug aerobic air is purged into the solution via air pump and anaerobic n2 is purging into the solution during the reaction time the aerobic conditions were the least efficient in adsorbing b from the solution comparing to the other two ambient conditions whereas the anaerobic conditions achieved much higher removal rate than the aerobic before reaching its equilibrium at b concentration of 1 3 mg l while unaerated conditions showed almost similar trend to the anaerobic by reaching final b concentration of 0 4 mg l after 24 h this could be clearly attributed to the possible increase of carbonate ions concentration in the reaction solution caused by co2 dissolution from the atmosphere 3 7 synthesized seawater effect this experiment was conducted to study the effect of applying mg al cldh on synthesized seawater to observe the material effect on removing b in the presence of different co existing ions found in such waters as shown in fig 4b it was clear that b sorption in synthesized seawater with typical seawater b concentration 5 mg l was interfered with the competing co existing ions thus removal of the targeted contaminant was not fully detected consideration of the previous result two more stock solutions synthesized seawater with increased initial b concentration at 20 mg l were used to further study the sorption at different mg al cldh dosages 0 2 and 0 5 g l it was clear that at higher initial b concentrated seawater reasonable sorption was achieved such results can be attributed to having dominating b species corresponding to the competing co existing ions in the solution to be adsorbed on to mg al cldh in this case the 0 2 g l dosage demonstrated higher removal rates than that of 0 5 g l which could be explained by two points happening simultaneously the first would be the competition between b and co existing ions in the solution regardless of the dominance of b species the second point is the availability of the adsorbent dosage corresponding to the initial b concentration which was high resulting in low removal of b from the synthesized solution such phenomenon could be attributed to the possible discrepancies occurred within the adsorbate adsorbent interactions 51 xrd analysis was conducted considering the spent mg al cldh samples with initial b concentration of 20 mg l fig s5 the interference of the different co existing ions with the adsorption of b on mg al cldh was clearly depicted from the xrd patterns however it was in favor of the possible co precipitation of b with the co existing cations ca2 na and k these findings supported the explanation of having dominating b species at higher boron concentration 20 mg l with respect to the competing co existing ions in the solution leading to b sorption onto mg al cldh still the involvement of the interlayered sorption of hbo3 2 and b oh 4 was yet confirmed by the same previously detected peaks 3 8 post reaction changes in mg al cldh tem imaging was conducted for the spent mg al cldh to investigate the shape deformation associated with the reaction with b as shown in fig 5a the hexagonal shape was not maintained after the reaction represented by irregular deformation attributed to the sorbed b on the surface furthermore the interlayered effect was clearly observed in the spent material reflecting the high possibility of the involvement of the interlayered sorption of b additionally sem eds analysis of the spent mg al cldh was conducted for further proof on the presence of the sorbed b in the spent material fig 5b the elemental mapping revealed the good distribution of ldh elements mg and al on the surface which was associated with the sorption and the well distribution as well of b on the surface such results were confirmed by the presence of b peak in the eds spectrum with a weight content ratio of 2 45 3 9 rsm parametric interactions three different regression models were considered linear 2fi and quadratic models the quadratic model was suggested to be the best fitting to b removal by mg al cldh corresponding to the highest r2 highest adequate precision and the lowest aic values comparing to the linear and 2fi models table s2 the predicted r2 0 886 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 864 i e the difference is less than 0 2 moreover the adequate precision value which measures the signal to noise ratio of 24 42 greater than 4 is desirable indicating that the suggested quadratic model can be used to navigate the design space the lack of fit f value implies that there is around 0 01 chance that a lack of fit f value this large could occur due to noise the model f value of 40 49 implies that the model is significant and there is only a 0 01 chance that an f value this large could occur due to noise the significantly low p value 0 0001 of the model indicates that most of the model terms are significant the model terms with p value less than 0 0500 are considered as significant terms hence in the quadratic model a b d e a2 and d2 are the most significant model terms table s3 while values greater than 0 1000 indicate that the model terms are not significant hence some of the model parameters were eliminated from the regression equation because of their insignificancy however there were still considered in the 3d rsm charts as they gave great indication of the interaction effects between the different parameters towards b removal efficiency because of the occurrence of the ambient categoric parameter three regression equations were developed corresponding to the three levels of the ambient conditions eqs s1 s3 from the perturbation charts fig s6 and the parametric effect of linear factors fig s7 it was clear that mg al cldh dosage and initial ph of the solution were the most significant parameters towards the change in b removal efficiency moreover the 3d rsm charts confirmed the proportional inverse interaction effect of reaction parameters on b removal efficiency fig 6 for instance the lower the initial ph and b initial concentration the higher the b removal efficiency moreover the middle high range of mg al cldh dosage values was the suitable range to achieve high b removal efficiency in spite of ph temperature and initial concentration effects 3 10 kinetics four kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion were applied in order to investigate the reaction rate and the associated kinetics parameters of b sorption onto mg al cldh the following linear forms of the kinetic models were considered in the analysis 52 56 1 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t pseudo first order model 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t pseudo second order model 3 q

diffusion rate constant and c i mg g is boundary layer thickness constant kinetic parameters estimated from the slope and intersection values from the linear plots and correlation coefficients r 2 are shown in table 2 the linear plots of the kinetic modeling corresponding to the effect of initial ph reaction temperature initial b concentration and mg al cldh dosage are provided in supplementary materials figs s8 s9 s10 and s11 respectively results showed that the best fitting kinetic model to describe b sorption by mg al cldh was pseudo second order model corresponding to the highest correlation coefficients comparing to the other applied models these results implied that the removal process of b by mg al cldh was mainly governed by chemisorption interactions 28 it was clear that the sorption kinetic rate became higher by approaching towards the neutral conditions while it declined at the strong acidic or alkaline conditions moreover the reaction rate was proportional to the increase in the temperature reflecting the endothermic nature of the reactions as will be confirmed later by a detailed thermodynamic analysis furthermore the initial b concentration significantly affected the kinetic rate where the more the initial concentration the lower the value of kinetic rate constant whereas the sorption capacity at higher concentrations such as 40 and 80 mg l depicted higher values of 18 30 and 34 60 mg g respectively additionally the increase in mg al cldh dosage had a positive effect on the reaction with higher kinetic rate constant values 3 11 isotherm modeling three different isotherm models were applied considering b sorption data at different initial concentrations including langmuir freundlich and radushkevich dubinin r d isotherm models the following linear model formulas were considered for the isotherm analysis 57 62 5 c e q e c e q l 1 q l k l langmuir model 6 ln k f 1 n ln c e freundlich model 7 ln q e ln q rd k rd rtln 1 1 c e 2 radushkevich

constant q rd mg g is maximum r d sorption capacity k rd mol2 kj2 is r d isotherm constant r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant and t k is temperature isotherm parameters were calculated from the slope and intersection values of the linear isotherm plots fig s12 from the presented parameters in table 3 it was clear that langmuir isotherm model was the best fitting model to describe b sorption data with the highest correlation percentage of 99 96 such results suggested the uniformity of the sorption sites energies on mg al cldh 58 61 moreover it was confirmed that b removal by mg al cldh occurred through a mono layer sorption which supported the formerly mentioned kinetic analysis results however freundlich isotherm model showed a good fitting as well with heterogeneity constant n value of 12 447 confirming the presence of heterogeneous sorption sites on the surface of mg al cldh moreover the comparison between the obtained experimental data and the non linear plots of the isotherm model confirmed the validity of langmuir model in describing the b sorption process with the most correlated sorption capacity value 22 10 mg g to the experimental one 21 95 mg g fig 7 calcination showed comparable effect on promoting the scorpion capacity of mg al cldh towards b which was clearly stated in this study as shown in table 4 such results were in a good agreement with previous reported studies confirming the enhancing influence of the calcination process for instance the calcined mg al ldh at 550 c and 450 c resulted in b sorption capacities of 13 and 17 3 mg g respectively while the non calcined ldhs showed lower performances for guo et al 63 b to hydrotalcite ratio b ht 0 5 was far greater than this study s ratio b ht 0 016 nevertheless the presented mg al cldh in this study exhibited a comparable and almost equal b sorption capacities for calcined and non calcined ht respectively correspondingly the non calcined mg al ldh removed only 37 9 mg g of 250 mg l initial b concentration considering a significantly high and impractical sorbent dosage the presented mg al cldh exhibited b sorption capacity of around 22 mg g corresponding to 80 mg l initial concentration fig s13 therefore in terms of initial b concentration mg al cldh dosage and reasonable calcination conditions the current study showed a great potential towards efficient b removal comparing to previously reported studies 3 12 thermodynamics thermodynamic analysis was conducted considering b adsorption experimental data at different reaction temperatures using the following equations 66 68 8 δ g rt ln k 9 lnk δ h rt δ s r where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k k is adsorption equilibrium constant δg is change in gibbs free energy kj mol t is temperature kalvin δs is change in entropy j mol k and δh is change in enthalpy kj mol the calculated values of these thermodynamics parameters presented in table 5 were evaluated by plotting lnk vs 1 t and determining the slope and interception values fig s14 the negative value of δg pointed to the endothermic nature of the removal of b from aqueous solutions by mg al cldh indicating the enhancement in b removal by raising the reaction temperature moreover the positive value of entropy change indicated that the randomness of solid liquid interaction increased within the adsorption process of b the magnitude of enthalpy change 104 04 kj mol and the magnitudes of the change in free energy indicated that b removal by mg al cldh involved both physisorption and chemisorption processes 3 13 regeneration of mg al cldh since the reusability of the spent adsorbent is one the most crucial aspects for real water treatment applications regeneration experiments were conducted to assess the reusability of mg al cldh in b removal from aqueous solutions three consecutive adsorption desorption cycles have been considered and the results are presented in fig s15 the results implied that 1 0 m naoh solution was adequate for the elution of the loaded b on the spent mg al cldh with desorption percentage of around 84 95 and 96 over the three cycles meanwhile such successful desorption process allowed the regenerated mg al cldh to exhibit great performance in b removal within the adsorption cycles to achieve 75 b removal efficiency after the first regeneration cycle followed by a slight decrease in the last two cycles to reach around 68 at the end of the third cycle such results depicted the high potential of the regenerated mg al cldh in achieving comparable b sorption 3 14 removal mechanism the removal of b by mg al cldh involved two possible removal mechanisms a the interlayered sorption of the dominant aqueous b species onto mg al cldh which mainly conducted as anion exchange reactions in consistence with other reported studies 29 64 therefore b anions b oh 4 and hbo3 2 were captured within the reconstructed interlayer of mg al cldh via intercalation as shown in fig 8a 33 which was also confirmed by the bo and boh bonds reflected from the ftir spectrum 10 mg al ldh b oh 4 b oh 4 mg al ldh the second involved step b removal of by mg al cldh is b the possible co precipitation of b species with the co existing cations in the synthesized seawater e g na ca2 and k on the outer surface of the mg al cldh such findings were supported by the appeared xrd peaks which were associated to the formed precipitates na bx ca bx and k bx confirming the possible competition of the co existing ions in seawater with mg al cldh on b removal the proposed removal mechanisms in this study were supported by the current kinetic analysis findings in this study which implied that chemisorption is the main removal mechanism for b removal by mg al cldh following the pseudo second order kinetic model moreover the fitting of the sorption data with langmuir isotherm model depicted the monolayer capturing of b species on mg al cldh furthermore the calculated adsorption free energy e from r d isotherm model was 414 3 kj mol within the range of 8 0 16 0 kj mol confirming that the sorption process is following ion exchange nevertheless the results of thermodynamic analysis revealed the possible contribution of the physisorption in the sorption process such results can be interpreted by the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged b species and the positively charged surface of mg al cldh which was achieved at ph values lower than the point of zero charge pzc ph 9 6 31 69 70 as displayed in fig 8b most of the dominant b species in aqueous solutions are presented around the neutral conditions therefore electrostatic attraction between the b species and mg al cldh were expected to be occurred at lower ph values where mg al cldh surface was positively charged while by raising ph value approaching towards neutral conditions b removal was induced due to the sufficiency of the variant negatively charged b species whereas at strong alkaline conditions lower than pzc the electrostatic repulsion resulted in less b removal that explanation was in a good agreement with the obtained results from ph experiments where ph 9 0 and ph 3 0 showed comparable b removal efficiencies while they were much higher than that at ph 12 0 hence it should be concluded that the optimum ph range for b removal by mg al cldh could be suggested from 5 0 to 9 6 4 conclusions mg al cldh was successfully developed and tested under various conditions to determine the optimum reaction conditions for b removal from aqueous solutions the following implications were determined based on the outcomes from this study 1 the shape of the mg al cldh sorbent could be described as typical hexagonal plate shape with an average size of 20 100 nm 2 it was clear that the sorption kinetic rate became higher by approaching towards the neutral ph conditions while it declined at the strong acidic or alkaline conditions following the pseudo second order kinetic model 3 high b removal rates were observed at high reaction temperatures reflecting the endothermic nature of the reaction and reached equilibrium within less than 6 h at temperature of 70 c 4 calcined adsorbent mg al cldh was capable of removing high b concentration 80 mg l from aqueous solutions with reasonable dosage 2 g l achieving a comparable sorption capacity 22 1 mg g 5 unaerated and anaerobic ambient conditions showed high potential in achieving high b removal whereas aerobic condition caused lower adsorption 6 b sorption in synthesized seawater was interfered with the competing co existing ions thus pretreatment of seawater could be favorable towards higher b removal performance 7 isotherm and thermodynamic modeling confirmed that b removal by mg al cldh occurred through a mono layer sorption and involved both physisorption and chemisorption processes 8 the reusability of the spent mg al cldh showed great performance in b removal at high rates over three consecutive regeneration cycles 9 the core findings of the current study considering the mg al cldh composite and the optimized conditions represent a vital step towards the real applications of b
