analysis of emergy berrios et al 2017 ferraro and gagliostro 2017 fonseca et al 2017 ohnishi et al 2017 shal and hurme 2017 used as an environmental accounting factor franzese et al 2017 pattersona et

have also been carried out on entropy based indicators in ecological network analysis laner et al 2017 ludovisi and scharler 2017 plant growth and development are essentially processes of matter and energy transformation a plant community is thus an open thermodynamic system with plant species as key components and its state changes can be determined by thermodynamic functions rodríguez et al 2016 2017 the total internal energy u of a thermodynamic system contains three interrelated components enthalpy h entropy s and gibbs free energy g engel and reid 2006 of which all are quantitatively related to those commonly applied ecological indices such as primary productivity as a function of biomass and biodiversity as a combination of species richness abudance and evenness molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 analysis of h s and g of a plant community restored on a metal contaminated site should be of high value in implementation of phyto remediation projects and assessment of their effects determination and prediction of the direction of matter and energy flows in ecosystems can provide useful information for ecological management according to the second law of thermodynamics direction of change energy is transformed spontaneously in one direction only towards decrease in intensity gradient engel and reid 2006 which means that the direction of natural changes is determined by intensity factors when it comes to the third law of thermodynamics quantification of entropy however decrease in gibbs free energy δg 0 becomes a criterion for judging the spontaneity of various reactions in fundamental physics and chemistry engel and reid 2006 brown et al 2006 since g is a capacity factor the precondition and limitation for using δg as a direction indicator needs to be clarified to avoid the conflict between the second and third laws of thermodynamics results from previous studies wu et al 2017 showed that following the first and second laws of thermodynamics u h s and g of a restored plant community all increased in the observed period under natural conditions because of solar energy intake and nutrient uptake the criterion δg 0 would then be no longer valid as a spontaneity index for description of the ecological process of a growing and developing plant community subject to the basic relation h g ts the g h ratio will be negatively related to the s h ratio as a function of species richness of an ecosystem the s h ratio is expected to increase with increasing number of bio species biodiversity has been shown to stabilize a number of ecological processes rinella and james 2017 if according to the equilibrium theory in ecology molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 an ecosystem possesses a natural trend towards increase in its species richness before reaching equilibrium there should be a potential trend of decrease in its g h towards increase in its number of species the main objective of this study is to evaluate the rationality of using g h and s h ratios as ecological indicators for description of ecological restoration processes in our previous work wu et al 2017 the conventional expressions for description of various reactions in gas liquid solid and mixed systems have been applied to determine h s and g of the plant communities under study the discussions in the following theoretical section will give further support to the general applicability of the conventional functions for all types of systems including ecosystems 2 theoretical 2 1 precondition for using δg 0 as a spontaneity indicator from the conventional relation engel and reid 2006 1 g ts h u pv v t p g s h u dg tds dh du 0 thus dg tds since t 0 and according to the third law of thermodynamics the sum of entropy of the system and surroundings increases in spontaneous processes which is equivalent to say that the entropy of an isolated system increases in spontaneous processes we can write d s sys s sur ds isolated system 0 and thus dg isolated system 0 it should be noted that both dh du 0 and ds 0 are essential conditions to ensure dg 0 for example in either open or closed systems if dh du 0 dg tds and both dg and ds can be either higher or lower than zero in open and closed systems one may have dh du 0 when the exchange of matter and energy between systems and surroundings reaches equilibrium the direction of the change in g in such systems however is still uncertain as the change in s of the systems ds sys can be either positive or negative when a system is isolated its total internal energy u and mass quantity c t will remain constant while various reactions can take place among its components in general reactions will reach dynamic equilibrium between reactants and products at the final state which means that generally the reactants will not disappear from the system except for parts of their mass being transformed into products examples given in table 1 show that the total number of the components n increases in both combination and decomposition reactions because of the formation of new products increase in n leads to increase in diversity or disorder of system composition namely s while the energy available to perform net work namely g is consumed in the reaction thus given δc t 0 and δu δh 0 in isolated systems δn 0 leads to δs 0 and the unique direction for the change in g is δg 0 the conclusion will then be that the criterion δg 0 can only be used as a spontaneity indicator for isolated systems subject to the condition δs isolated system 0 it is necessary to mention that the spontaneous decrease in g associated with increase in s in the reactions listed in table 1 is due to the decrease in chemical potential μ of the reaction components which since μ is an intensity factor obeys the second law of thermodynamics wu et al 2009 using the decomposition reaction table 1 as an example the gibbs free energy of the reaction system at the initial state will be g 0 c 0 μco where μco denotes the initial chemical potential of d while that at the final equilibrium state will be g e c 1 μd c 2 μa c 3 μb where for a unit volume reaction system c 0 denotes the molar concentration of component d at the initial state while c 1 c 2 and c 3 stand for respectively that of components d a and b at the final state since there is no loss of mass quantity in the reaction c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 the change in g will be δg g e g 0 c 1 μd c 2 μa c 3 μb c 0 μco c 1 μd c 2 μa c 3 μb c 1 c 2 c 3 μco c 1 μd μco c 2 μ a μ co c 3 μ b μ co 0 molar concentration c i and chemical potential μ i are two positively related intensity factors since c 1 c 0 c 2 c 0 and c 3 c 0 we have μd μco 0 μa μco 0 μb μco 0 and thus δg 0 it follows that since c i c 0 and μi μco 0 in all types of reactions that reach dynamic equilibrium under isolated conditions the generalized relation holds δg g e g 0 c i μi μco c iδμi 0 c 0 c i which confirms that the decrease in μ is the cause of the decrease in g natural ecosystems are generally open systems the change in g of a plant community will be positively related to its biomass increment δc t and if δc t 0 δg 0 this means that should the bio growth of a plant community under natural conditions be considered a natural process δg can be higher than zero in spontaneous processes the general belief that the capacity factor g decreases in spontaneous processes needs to be re examined 2 2 precondition for using δ g h 0 as a spontaneity indicator from eq 1 we have 2 g h 1 ts h and d g h d ts h which shows that the precondition for using δ g h 0 as a spontaneity indicator is δ ts h 0 eq 2 offers a theoretical ground for analysis of g and s under given h conditions the theoretical curves in fig 1 show that g h will decrease with increasing ts h with a definition range 0 g h 1 and an intersection point g h ts h 1 2 changes in g h and ts h represent the changes in internal energy distribution and thus determine the direction of transformation or exchange between g and ts theoretically there must be at least one specific factor fig 1 that regulates or controls the direction of internal energy flow since g h and ts h are dimensionless ratios the specific factor must also be dimensionless as will be discussed later this factor is the number of system components or species it is noted that the pattern of the changes in g h and ts h depicted in fig 1 resembles the pattern of the changes in species immigration and extinction rates described by the equilibrium model of island biogeography molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 since in isolated systems where dh du 0 dg 0 d g h 1 h dg 0 showing that g h will change towards the same direction as g in open ecosystems s h is expected to increase with increasing number of bio species it should thus be of value to examine whether or not δ g h 0 can be applied as a potential spontaneity indicator for description of ecological processes 2 3 general validity of conventional thermodynamic functions before relating g h and s h to the number of plant species n it is necessary to justify the general applicability of the conventionally applied thermodynamic functions the chemical potential of the ith component μ i in a multiple component system is defined as the partial derivative of its gibbs free energy g i with respect to its molar quantity c i 3 g i ci t cj ci μ i μi rtln x i xi c i c i c i c t 1 where μ i denotes the standard chemical potential r stands for the gas constant and x i is the ratio of the molar quantity of the ith component c i to the total molar quantity of the system c t from eq 3 we have the gibbs free energy of the ith component 4 g i c i μ i c i μ c irtln x i based on eqs 1 3 and 4 we can further obtain a general expression of g for a plant community consisting of different plant species as system components 5 g g i c i μ i c i μ i rt c iln x i c i μ i rt c iln 1 x i h ts u pv ts c i c ij i 1 2 3 n j 1 2 m i m m i where c ij repesents the mass quantity of the jth plant m i is the number of the individual plants of the ith plant species m denotes the total number of individual plants and n stands for the total number of plant species in a plant community the terms c ij c i m i m and n are the basic factors for determining the commonly used ecologicl indices the molar quantity c i in ecology refers to a concept of standing crop related to net primary productivity ricklefs and relyea 2014 while the number of species n is often directly applied as an index for species richness molles 2016 it is noted that the component ratio x i c i c i 1 is an important factor relating μ i to system composition for a single component or species system where n 1 x i 1 and therefore μi μ i engel and reid 2006 though eq 3 was initially derived from ideal gas systems the basic relationship between μ i and x i holds in general for all types of systems eqs 3 and 4 can be rewritten respecitvely as μ i μ i rtln 1 x i ciμ ciμ i ci rtln 1 x i x i c i c i i c t 1 for generalization of μ i as a function of x i we can use β i f x i as an unknown function of x i to replace rtln 1 x i and transform eqs 3 and 4 into general forms μ i μ i rtln 1 x i μ i f x i μ i β i ciμ i ciμ i ciβ i dividing ci by ci gives x i μ i x i μ i x i β i taking the derivative of each term with respect to x i x i dμ i dx i μ i x i dμ i dx i μ i x i dβ i dx i β i as μ i μ i β i we have x i dμ i dx i x i dμ i dx i x i dβ i dx i by definition μ i is independent of x i namely dμ i dx i 0 and x i dμ i dx i x i dβ i dx i 0 the above relation can be written as x i dμ i dx i x i dβ i dx i k k 0 where k is introduecd as a factor independent of x i subject to x i dμ i dx i k x i dβ i dx i k or dμ i k x i dx i dβ i k x i dx i by integration μ i kln x i c as x i 1 kln x i 0 and μ i reaches its upper limit μ i c μ i μ i we obtain a general expression similar to eq 3 μ i μ i kln x i and a reasonable solution for βi β i kln x i kln 1 x i which confirms the general validity of eqs 3 5 since given t rt is a constant we see the rational connection between k and rt by introducing an enthalpy factor h c i μ i and an entropy factor s r c iln 1 x i wu et al 2017 presented eq 5 as 6 g c i μ i t r c iln 1 x i h ts h ts u pv ts the essential connection between h and h and that between s and s have been discussed in previous study wu et al 2017 from eq 6 we see that the h and s factors are respectively functions of enthalpy h and entropy s as the changes in state functions can be uniquely determined by their differences between states based on eq 6 given volume v and temperature t or pressure p the following relations hold 7 δh δh δ c i μ i δu 8 δs δs δ r c iln 1 x i 9 δg δh tδs δh tδs δ c i μ i tδ r c iln 1 x i bio growth and bio uptake are essentially biological reactions occurring in ecosystems and eqs 7 9 can thus be applied to determine the changes in g h and s for both bio growth and bio uptake of a plant community depending on the interest of study c i in eqs 7 9 can be either biomass or element uptake quantity of the ith plant species in accordance with the concept of chemical potential defined in physical chemistry if c i denotes the biomass quantity of species i μ i stands for its biomass growth potential while if c i denotes its element uptake quantity μ i stands for its element uptake potential in other words when the biomass data are used to calculate h s and g of a plant community the plant community is regarded as a biomass production system if the metal uptake data are used to calculate the three internal energy functions the plant community is regarded as a metal transformation system 2 4 basic assumptions for calculation assumption 1 the dry biomass harvested from or the metal accumulated by different plant species has an equal energy quality in terms of standard chemical potential assumption 1 applies for calculation of both the total dry bio mass quantity and metal uptake quantity by c t c i the additivity of c i demands that the biomass dry matter or the element manganese has an equal energy quality disregarding the difference in plant species and site conditions this is a general approximation made by researchers for comparison of productivity or metal accumulation ability among ecosystems subject to this assumption we have for different plant species i and j at different sites i and ii μ i μ j μ i μ ii μ then the enthalpy factor h becomes h c i μ i μ c i c t μ to eliminate the rt effect eq 6 can be rewritten as g rt h rt s r h rt s r c t μ rt c iln 1 x i it is noticed that g rt h rt s r h rt and s r have the same dimension unit as c t given t μ rt is a dimensionless constant and can be expressed as μ rt ln k and then h rt c t μ rt c tln k defining an average molar quantity as c ci n ct n which gives an average x as a reciprocal of n and an s r as a function of n x c c i c c t 1 n 10 s r c iln 1 x i cln 1 x c tln n s a r the difference between h rt and s a r will be h rt s a r c tln k c tln n c tln k n for a plant community h rt is the upper limit of s a r given t for a site or a habitat when n reaches its upper limit n m s a r reaches h rt h rt s a r c tln k n c tln k n m 0 which gives k n m showing that k is the upper limit of n given t for a plant habitat subject to assumption 1 we have 11 h rt c tln nm and g h g rt h rt 1 ts h 1 s r h rt 1 c iln 1 x i c tln nm if c i c x i x and s r c iln 1 x i s a r c tln n 12 g h 1 ts h 1 c tln n c tln nm 1 ln n ln nm g h 1 ts h which shows that the g h and g h ratios will decrease with increasing n eq 12 thus confirms theoretically that the number of components or species n is the specific factor in fig 1 in other words eq 12 shows that it is the change in n that determines the direction of the internal energy transformation illustrated in fig 1 assumption 2 since nm is the upper limit of n and h rt c tln nm is linearly related to c t use of any nm value will not affect the trend of change in h rt the largest plant species number 66 observed in the non polluted surrounding area nearby the metal contaminated site can be used approximately as nm subject to this approximation the relative values of h rt s r and g rt can be calculated respectively by 13 h rt c tln n m c tln 66 14 s r c iln 1 x i 15 g rt c tln 66 c iln 1 x i 16 g h 1 c iln 1 x i c tln 66 by use of eqs 7 9 we can further obtain the values of δh rt δs r and δg rt 3 experimental detailed experimental information and data have been given in previously published papers wu et al 2017 ouyang et al 2016 the applied remediation measures sampling procedures and analytical methods are briefly described below 3 1 phyto remediation site and applied measures the total experimental area a manganese tailing wasteland xiangtan hunan china was approximately 4 4 ha the area was poor in nitrogen and phosphorus but high in metal contents the highest total content of mn found at the tailing site was 24 727 mg kg the total average contents of pb zn cu cd and cr of the experimental site were also far exceeded the background values of china wu et al 2017 one year old seedlings of paulownia fortunei and koelreuteria bipinnata were transplanted as dominant tree species in mixed rows spacing 2 2 5 m 1000 plants of each species hm2 in spring 2010 a special type of organic manure was applied as base fertilizer to each rooting pit 0 5 0 5 0 5 m in plot i 4 0 hm2 by mixing the manure with the contaminated soil at a ratio of 1 4 the manure contained a metal tolerant bacterial strain isolated from the mining wastes in order to meet the need for both supply of nutrients and reduction of metal toxicity in the rooting area of the transplanted tree species the manure was prepared by taking into consideration the nutrient deficiency and metal toxicity of the tailing site for comparison purpose chemical fertilizers containing equivalent amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were applied in the control plot plot ii 0 2 hm2 in addition a plant community naturally developed under normal soil conditions in the vicinity area plot iii 0 2 hm2 was also investigated 3 2 sampling and analysis soil and plant samples were collected from three fixed standard blocks approximately 667 m2 each in respectively plots i ii and iii in june and october each year from 2010 to 2016 following standard procedures the numbers of individual plant and plant species were counted on site five plants of each species were harvested from each standard sampling block physical and chemical properties of soil samples and dry biomass quantity kg and metal concentration mg kg dry biomass of roots stems and leaves of plant samples were measured by standard methods gb15618 1995 gb3838 2002 gb18918 2002 people s republic of china the relative standard deviations ranged between 8 4 16 4 in biomass measurements and 5 1 18 3 in metal concentration determinations the average values of the measurements were presented in the study 4 result and analysis 4 1 biomass manganese uptake and species number the detailed data of biomass metal uptake and plant species of the restored plant communities have been presented in the previous paper wu et al 2017 the numbers of plant species n in the experimental plots observed in different years are listed in table 2 the significant differences p 0 001 number of standard sampling blocks 3 in both dry matter biomass quantity kg hm2 and mn uptake g hm2 of the plant communities between plots i and ii are shown in fig 2 high survival rates and rapid growth of the transplanted tree species were found to be associated with increased number of native species naturally germinated in plot i showing that the applied phyto remediation method had not only enhanced plant growth and mn uptake but also enriched the area s biodiversity positive correlation between biomass and mn uptake was found in both plots i r2 0 988 and ii r2 0 956 indicating that the growth of the plant community enhanced its total mn uptake the observed increase in n in plot ii table 2 indicated that despite the severe impact of metal contamination the tailing site remained as an available habitat for at least metal tolerant bio species according to the soil seed bank theory tang et al 2006 lin and cao 2009 soil possesses the same seed inventory capacity in a given region in addition to this seeds of other plant species can also be brought into the site through various means from surrounding areas therefore under normal conditions namely the conditions without significant disturbance by natural calamities or man s activities the trend of increase in the number of species of a plant community before reaching equilibrium is essential and inevitable while the differences among plant communities are their increasing rates determined by different site conditions the highest number of plant species found in plot iii in the vicinity uncontaminated area was 66 in both years 2015 and 2016 this could be an indication that the composition of the plant community in plot iii had reached a relatively stable state possible changes in species number in plot iii will be further monitored in future studies to confirm its stability 4 2 internal energy increment and ratio the relative values of h rt s r and g rt calculated by eqs 13 15 using respectively dry biomass and mn uptake data all increased from year 2010 to 2016 in both plots i and ii related increments δh rt δs r and δg rt by eqs 7 9 were all found positive in the observed period with a general increasing trend towards increasing year fig 3 a and b biomass fig 4 a and b mn uptake in contrast attributed to the increase in the number of plant species table 2 the g h ratio decreased while the ts h ratio increased with year and the directions of changes were clear and consistent in plots i and ii fig 3c and d biomass fig 4c and d mn uptake the observed changes in g h and s h calculated by eq 16 agree with the ecological equilibrium model molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 that ecosystems possess natural trends towards increase in their biodiversity and thus support the use of g h and s h as potential spontaneity indicators for description of ecological processes it is noticed in figs 3c d and 4c d that the difference between g h and ts h at the observed end point year 2016 was still big and their estimated values by eq 16 were far from their intersection point g h ts h this suggests the presence of potential trends towards further increase in n in both plots i and ii it is also noticed that the difference between g h and ts h in the whole observed period was much greater in plot i than in plot ii figs 3 and 4 indicating that the plant community in plot i possessed a much higher growth and development potential than that in plot ii though there are numbers of factors affecting species diversity of plant communities zhang and dong 2010 the key factor that resulted in the observed differences in the number and growth rate of the plant species between plots i and ii was apparently the soil remediation method the obtained results confirmed the integrated function of the applied organic manure in reduction of metal toxicities supply of nutrients and improvement of soil properties 5 discussions 5 1 functions of growth and development the theoretical explanation for the observed increase in g s and s h and decrease in g h of the investigated plant communities with increase in their enthalpy h or total internal energy u is that given μ rt h is a single function of biomass quantity c t while g and s are functions of both biomass quantity c t and species number n use of the average component ratio as a reciprocal of n x 1 n offers a better understanding of the changes in h g and s of an ecosystem from eqs 10 and 11 we have δh rt δh rt ln n m δc t δs r δs r ln n δc t δg rt δh rt δs r ln n m n δc t since ln n m 0 ln n 0 and ln n m n 0 if δc t 0 δh 0 δs 0 and δg 0 unlike the total mass quantity in reactions listed in table 1 which remains constant in the reaction process δc t 0 the total bio mass quantity of the investigated plant communities increases in photosynthesis reactions δc t 0 giving thus δh 0 δs 0 and δg 0 as shown in figs 3a b and 4a b plant growth and development are natural processes and thus δg 0 cannot be used as a spontaneity indicator for description of plant growth and development the term ts can be interpreted as the part of internal energy stored by a plant community used for system development relating to changes in system composition structure and organization as a conventional parameter for system complexity or disorder s is an appropriate index for species richness or biodiversity in addition the difference between s r and s a r defined by eq 10 can be used as an ecological index for species evenness since s r s a r 0 at c i c j c and x i x j x as the difference between h and ts the gibbs free energy g is the remaining and thus available part of the internal energy stored by a plant community to support its growth and development i e the part of internal energy available to perform net work for the system to grow and develop theoretically g and ts as state functions referring to an ecosystem are different in their concepts from but quantitatively comparable to the applied terms eco exergy and emergy jørgensen 2000 berrios et al 2017 if for an ecosystem increase in biomass means growth while increase in species richness abundance and diversity means development in accordance with their conventional concepts h s and g can be regarded respectively as functions for growth development and potential capacity to support growth and development 5 2 functions of species richness the significance of eq 12 is that it presents g h and s h based on average mass quantity as a single function of n to be more precise eq 12 states that as an essential property and thus a state function of a thermodynamic system or an ecosystem the number of components or species n determines the ratios of g and ts to h of the system at the macroscopic scale or ecological organization level under study use of average values as basic parameters for description of a population or a system has a solid and rational ground eq 12 has thus a general and profound meaning regarding the mechanism of internal energy distribution and transformation in thermodynamic systems based on eq 12 the g h and s h ratios namely the distribution of h or u or the transformation between g and ts can be uniquely determined by n regardless of the changes in mass quantity c t and total internal energy u the essential trend described by the equation holds logically since for a thermodynamic system or an ecosystem undergoing a process of increase in its number of components or species more and more energy stored by the system needs to be used to maintain its gradually diversified composition and structure this means that as n increases a larger portion of h will be transformed into ts rather than into g resulting in increasing ts h associated with decreasing g h there are two characteristic values of n corresponding to different system state in eq 12 hypothetically for a plant community at a given site with limited space area and solar energy input there should be an upper limit of the number of species n m the n m value would then be a potentially existed characteristic parameter uniquely determined by the nature of the locality as an approximation the plant species number observed in the non polluted surrounding area has been used as n m for calculation in the present study while the real n m could be much higher than the used value another characteristic parameter related to the nature of the habitat would be the n value at the interception point g h ts h 1 2 since at this point enthalpy h will be evenly distributed as g and ts the n value which gives g h ts h 1 2 could possibly be a critical point to indicate the arrival of equilibrium for plant community growth and development further studies are needed to examine these speculations 6 conclusion 1 the number of components or species n is an important system property that determines the ratios of gibbs free energy g and entropy s to enthalpy h 2 as functions of n the g h and s h ratios can be applied as ecological indicators for describing the distribution and transformation of internal energy stored by plant communities 3 the observed changes in g h and s h agree with the ecological theory that ecosystems before reaching equilibrium possess potential trends towards increase in biodiversity 4 the interception point g h ts h 1 2 could be a critical point to indicate the arrival of equilibrium for plant community growth and development further observations on the changes in g h and s h of the restored plant communities are needed to testify this speculation acknowledgment the present study forms part of the projects

25310,a plant community is an open thermodynamic system in accordance with the first and second laws of thermodynamics the total internal energy u of a plant community before reaching equilibrium will increase under natural conditions because of solar energy intake and nutrient uptake as state functions of a thermodynamic system enthalpy h entropy s and gibbs free energy g are related to u by g ts h u pv increase in u will lead to increases in h s and g since given volume v and temperature t or pressure p dg tds dh du 0 the experimental data collected from the plant communities restored on a manganese tailing site confirmed the potential trend of increase in h s and g of the plant communities with increase in their biomass quantity and biodiversity the traditional criterion δg 0 would then be no longer valid as a spontaneity index for description of the ecological process of a growing and developing plant community since g h 1 t s h given t g h will be negatively related to s h the number of plant species n is an essential property of a plant community and as a function of n the s h ratio is expected to increase with increase in species richness under natural conditions resulting in d s h 0 and d g h 0 the change in g h can thus be applied as a thermodynamic parameter to judge the spontaneity of plant community growth and development the results obtained from the

related to those commonly applied ecological indices such as primary productivity as a function of biomass and biodiversity as a combination of species richness abudance and evenness molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 analysis of h s and g of a plant community restored on a metal contaminated site should be of high value in implementation of phyto remediation projects and assessment of their effects determination and prediction of the direction of matter and energy flows in ecosystems can provide useful information for ecological management according to the second law of thermodynamics direction of change energy is transformed spontaneously in one direction only towards decrease in intensity gradient engel and reid 2006 which means that the direction of natural changes is determined by intensity factors when it comes to the third law of thermodynamics quantification of entropy however decrease in gibbs free energy δg 0 becomes a criterion for judging the spontaneity of various reactions in fundamental physics and chemistry engel and reid 2006 brown et al 2006 since g is a capacity factor the precondition and limitation for using δg as a direction indicator needs to be clarified to avoid the conflict between the second and third laws of thermodynamics results from previous studies wu et al 2017 showed that following the first and second laws of thermodynamics u h s and g of a restored plant community all increased in the observed period under natural conditions because of solar energy intake and nutrient uptake the criterion δg 0 would then be no longer valid as a spontaneity index for description of the ecological process of a growing and developing plant community subject to the basic relation h g ts the g h ratio will be negatively related to the s h ratio as a function of species richness of an ecosystem the s h ratio is expected to increase with increasing number of bio species biodiversity has been shown to stabilize a number of ecological processes rinella and james 2017 if according to the equilibrium theory in ecology molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 an ecosystem possesses a natural trend towards increase in its species richness before reaching equilibrium there should be a potential trend of decrease in its g h towards increase in its number of species the main objective of this study is to evaluate the rationality of using g h and s h ratios as ecological indicators for description of ecological restoration processes in our previous work wu et al 2017 the conventional expressions for description of various reactions in gas liquid solid and mixed systems have been applied to determine h s and g of the plant communities under study the discussions in the following theoretical section will give further support to the general applicability of the conventional functions for all types of systems including ecosystems 2 theoretical 2 1 precondition for using δg 0 as a spontaneity indicator from the conventional relation engel and reid 2006 1 g ts h u pv v t p g s h u dg tds dh du 0 thus dg tds since t 0 and according to the third law of thermodynamics the sum of entropy of the system and surroundings increases in spontaneous processes which is equivalent to say that the entropy of an isolated system increases in spontaneous processes we can write d s sys s sur ds isolated system 0 and thus dg isolated system 0 it should be noted that both dh du 0 and ds 0 are essential conditions to ensure dg 0 for example in either open or closed systems if dh du 0 dg tds and both dg and ds can be either higher or lower than zero in open and closed systems one may have dh du 0 when the exchange of matter and energy between systems and surroundings reaches equilibrium the direction of the change in g in such systems however is still uncertain as the change in s of the systems ds sys can be either positive or negative when a system is isolated its total internal energy u and mass quantity c t will remain constant while various reactions can take place among its components in general reactions will reach dynamic equilibrium between reactants and products at the final state which means that generally the reactants will not disappear from the system except for parts of their mass being transformed into products examples given in table 1 show that the total number of the components n increases in both combination and decomposition reactions because of the formation of new products increase in n leads to increase in diversity or disorder of system composition namely s while the energy available to perform net work namely g is consumed in the reaction thus given δc t 0 and δu δh 0 in isolated systems δn 0 leads to δs 0 and the unique direction for the change in g is δg 0 the conclusion will then be that the criterion δg 0 can only be used as a spontaneity indicator for isolated systems subject to the condition δs isolated system 0 it is necessary to mention that the spontaneous decrease in g associated with increase in s in the reactions listed in table 1 is due to the decrease in chemical potential μ of the reaction components which since μ is an intensity factor obeys the second law of thermodynamics wu et al 2009 using the decomposition reaction table 1 as an example the gibbs free energy of the reaction system at the initial state will be g 0 c 0 μco where μco denotes the initial chemical potential of d while that at the final equilibrium state will be g e c 1 μd c 2 μa c 3 μb where for a unit volume reaction system c 0 denotes the molar concentration of component d at the initial state while c 1 c 2 and c 3 stand for respectively that of components d a and b at the final state since there is no loss of mass quantity in the reaction c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 the change in g will be δg g e g 0 c 1 μd c 2 μa c 3 μb c 0 μco c 1 μd c 2 μa c 3 μb c 1 c 2 c 3 μco c 1 μd μco c 2 μ a μ co c 3 μ b μ co 0 molar concentration c i and chemical potential μ i are two positively related intensity factors since c 1 c 0 c 2 c 0 and c 3 c 0 we have μd μco 0 μa μco 0 μb μco 0 and thus δg 0 it follows that since c i c 0 and μi μco 0 in all types of reactions that reach dynamic equilibrium under isolated conditions the generalized relation holds δg g e g 0 c i μi μco c iδμi 0 c 0 c i which confirms that the decrease in μ is the cause of the decrease in g natural ecosystems are generally open systems the change in g of a plant community will be positively related to its biomass increment δc t and if δc t 0 δg 0 this means that should the bio growth of a plant community under natural conditions be considered a natural process δg can be higher than zero in spontaneous processes the general belief that the capacity factor g decreases in spontaneous processes needs to be re examined 2 2 precondition for using δ g h 0 as a spontaneity indicator from eq 1 we have 2 g h 1 ts h and d g h d ts h which shows that the precondition for using δ g h 0 as a spontaneity indicator is δ ts h 0 eq 2 offers a theoretical ground for analysis of g and s under given h conditions the theoretical curves in fig 1 show that g h will decrease with increasing ts h with a definition range 0 g h 1 and an intersection point g h ts h 1 2 changes in g h and ts h represent the changes in internal energy distribution and thus determine the direction of transformation or exchange between g and ts theoretically there must be at least one specific factor fig 1 that regulates or controls the direction of internal energy flow since g h and ts h are dimensionless ratios the specific factor must also be dimensionless as will be discussed later this factor is the number of system components or species it is noted that the pattern of the changes in g h and ts h depicted in fig 1 resembles the pattern of the changes in species immigration and extinction rates described by the equilibrium model of island biogeography molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 since in isolated systems where dh du 0 dg 0 d g h 1 h dg 0 showing that g h will change towards the same direction as g in open ecosystems s h is expected to increase with increasing number of bio species it should thus be of value to examine whether or not δ g h 0 can be applied as a potential spontaneity indicator for description of ecological processes 2 3 general validity of conventional thermodynamic functions before relating g h and s h to the number of plant species n it is necessary to justify the general applicability of the conventionally applied thermodynamic functions the chemical potential of the ith component μ i in a multiple component system is defined as the partial derivative of its gibbs free energy g i with respect to its molar quantity c i 3 g i ci t cj ci μ i μi rtln x i xi c i c i c i c t 1 where μ i denotes the standard chemical potential r stands for the gas constant and x i is the ratio of the molar quantity of the ith component c i to the total molar quantity of the system c t from eq 3 we have the gibbs free energy of the ith component 4 g i c i μ i c i μ c irtln x i based on eqs 1 3 and 4 we can further obtain a general expression of g for a plant community consisting of different plant species as system components 5 g g i c i μ i c i μ i rt c iln x i c i μ i rt c iln 1 x i h ts u pv ts c i c ij i 1 2 3 n j 1 2 m i m m i where c ij repesents the mass quantity of the jth plant m i is the number of the individual plants of the ith plant species m denotes the total number of individual plants and n stands for the total number of plant species in a plant community the terms c ij c i m i m and n are the basic factors for determining the commonly used ecologicl indices the molar quantity c i in ecology refers to a concept of standing crop related to net primary productivity ricklefs and relyea 2014 while the number of species n is often directly applied as an index for species richness molles 2016 it is noted that the component ratio x i c i c i 1 is an important factor relating μ i to system composition for a single component or species system where n 1 x i 1 and therefore μi μ i engel and reid 2006 though eq 3 was initially derived from ideal gas systems the basic relationship between μ i and x i holds in general for all types of systems eqs 3 and 4 can be rewritten respecitvely as μ i μ i rtln 1 x i ciμ ciμ i ci rtln 1 x i x i c i c i i c t 1 for generalization of μ i as a function of x i we can use β i f x i as an unknown function of x i to replace rtln 1 x i and transform eqs 3 and 4 into general forms μ i μ i rtln 1 x i μ i f x i μ i β i ciμ i ciμ i ciβ i dividing ci by ci gives x i μ i x i μ i x i β i taking the derivative of each term with respect to x i x i dμ i dx i μ i x i dμ i dx i μ i x i dβ i dx i β i as μ i μ i β i we have x i dμ i dx i x i dμ i dx i x i dβ i dx i by definition μ i is independent of x i namely dμ i dx i 0 and x i dμ i dx i x i dβ i dx i 0 the above relation can be written as x i dμ i dx i x i dβ i dx i k k 0 where k is introduecd as a factor independent of x i subject to x i dμ i dx i k x i dβ i dx i k or dμ i k x i dx i dβ i k x i dx i by integration μ i kln x i c as x i 1 kln x i 0 and μ i reaches its upper limit μ i c μ i μ i we obtain a general expression similar to eq 3 μ i μ i kln x i and a reasonable solution for βi β i kln x i kln 1 x i which confirms the general validity of eqs 3 5 since given t rt is a constant we see the rational connection between k and rt by introducing an enthalpy factor h c i μ i and an entropy factor s r c iln 1 x i wu et al 2017 presented eq 5 as 6 g c i μ i t r c iln 1 x i h ts h ts u pv ts the essential connection between h and h and that between s and s have been discussed in previous study wu et al 2017 from eq 6 we see that the h and s factors are respectively functions of enthalpy h and entropy s as the changes in state functions can be uniquely determined by their differences between states based on eq 6 given volume v and temperature t or pressure p the following relations hold 7 δh δh δ c i μ i δu 8 δs δs δ r c iln 1 x i 9 δg δh tδs δh tδs δ c i μ i tδ r c iln 1 x i bio growth and bio uptake are essentially biological reactions occurring in ecosystems and eqs 7 9 can thus be applied to determine the changes in g h and s for both bio growth and bio uptake of a plant community depending on the interest of study c i in eqs 7 9 can be either biomass or element uptake quantity of the ith plant species in accordance with the concept of chemical potential defined in physical chemistry if c i denotes the biomass quantity of species i μ i stands for its biomass growth potential while if c i denotes its element uptake quantity μ i stands for its element uptake potential in other words when the biomass data are used to calculate h s and g of a plant community the plant community is regarded as a biomass production system if the metal uptake data are used to calculate the three internal energy functions the plant community is regarded as a metal transformation system 2 4 basic assumptions for calculation assumption 1 the dry biomass harvested from or the metal accumulated by different plant species has an equal energy quality in terms of standard chemical potential assumption 1 applies for calculation of both the total dry bio mass quantity and metal uptake quantity by c t c i the additivity of c i demands that the biomass dry matter or the element manganese has an equal energy quality disregarding the difference in plant species and site conditions this is a general approximation made by researchers for comparison of productivity or metal accumulation ability among ecosystems subject to this assumption we have for different plant species i and j at different sites i and ii μ i μ j μ i μ ii μ then the enthalpy factor h becomes h c i μ i μ c i c t μ to eliminate the rt effect eq 6 can be rewritten as g rt h rt s r h rt s r c t μ rt c iln 1 x i it is noticed that g rt h rt s r h rt and s r have the same dimension unit as c t given t μ rt is a dimensionless constant and can be expressed as μ rt ln k and then h rt c t μ rt c tln k defining an average molar quantity as c ci n ct n which gives an average x as a reciprocal of n and an s r as a function of n x c c i c c t 1 n 10 s r c iln 1 x i cln 1 x c tln n s a r the difference between h rt and s a r will be h rt s a r c tln k c tln n c tln k n for a plant community h rt is the upper limit of s a r given t for a site or a habitat when n reaches its upper limit n m s a r reaches h rt h rt s a r c tln k n c tln k n m 0 which gives k n m showing that k is the upper limit of n given t for a plant habitat subject to assumption 1 we have 11 h rt c tln nm and g h g rt h rt 1 ts h 1 s r h rt 1 c iln 1 x i c tln nm if c i c x i x and s r c iln 1 x i s a r c tln n 12 g h 1 ts h 1 c tln n c tln nm 1 ln n ln nm g h 1 ts h which shows that the g h and g h ratios will decrease with increasing n eq 12 thus confirms theoretically that the number of components or species n is the specific factor in fig 1 in other words eq 12 shows that it is the change in n that determines the direction of the internal energy transformation illustrated in fig 1 assumption 2 since nm is the upper limit of n and h rt c tln nm is linearly related to c t use of any nm value will not affect the trend of change in h rt the largest plant species number 66 observed in the non polluted surrounding area nearby the metal contaminated site can be used approximately as nm subject to this approximation the relative values of h rt s r and g rt can be calculated respectively by 13 h rt c tln n m c tln 66 14 s r c iln 1 x i 15 g rt c tln 66 c iln 1 x i 16 g h 1 c iln 1 x i c tln 66 by use of eqs 7 9 we can further obtain the values of δh rt δs r and δg rt 3 experimental detailed experimental information and data have been given in previously published papers wu et al 2017 ouyang et al 2016 the applied remediation measures sampling procedures and analytical methods are briefly described below 3 1 phyto remediation site and applied measures the total experimental area a manganese tailing wasteland xiangtan hunan china was approximately 4 4 ha the area was poor in nitrogen and phosphorus but high in metal contents the highest total content of mn found at the tailing site was 24 727 mg kg the total average contents of pb zn cu cd and cr of the experimental site were also far exceeded the background values of china wu et al 2017 one year old seedlings of paulownia fortunei and koelreuteria bipinnata were transplanted as dominant tree species in mixed rows spacing 2 2 5 m 1000 plants of each species hm2 in spring 2010 a special type of organic manure was applied as base fertilizer to each rooting pit 0 5 0 5 0 5 m in plot i 4 0 hm2 by mixing the manure with the contaminated soil at a ratio of 1 4 the manure contained a metal tolerant bacterial strain isolated from the mining wastes in order to meet the need for both supply of nutrients and reduction of metal toxicity in the rooting area of the transplanted tree species the manure was prepared by taking into consideration the nutrient deficiency and metal toxicity of the tailing site for comparison purpose chemical fertilizers containing equivalent amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were applied in the control plot plot ii 0 2 hm2 in addition a plant community naturally developed under normal soil conditions in the vicinity area plot iii 0 2 hm2 was also investigated 3 2 sampling and analysis soil and plant samples were collected from three fixed standard blocks approximately 667 m2 each in respectively plots i ii and iii in june and october each year from 2010 to 2016 following standard procedures the numbers of individual plant and plant species were counted on site five plants of each species were harvested from each standard sampling block physical and chemical properties of soil samples and dry biomass quantity kg and metal concentration mg kg dry biomass of roots stems and leaves of plant samples were measured by standard methods gb15618 1995 gb3838 2002 gb18918 2002 people s republic of china the relative standard deviations ranged between 8 4 16 4 in biomass measurements and 5 1 18 3 in metal concentration determinations the average values of the measurements were presented in the study 4 result and analysis 4 1 biomass manganese uptake and species number the detailed data of biomass metal uptake and plant species of the restored plant communities have been presented in the previous paper wu et al 2017 the numbers of plant species n in the experimental plots observed in different years are listed in table 2 the significant differences p 0 001 number of standard sampling blocks 3 in both dry matter biomass quantity kg hm2 and mn uptake g hm2 of the plant communities between plots i and ii are shown in fig 2 high survival rates and rapid growth of the transplanted tree species were found to be associated with increased number of native species naturally germinated in plot i showing that the applied phyto remediation method had not only enhanced plant growth and mn uptake but also enriched the area s biodiversity positive correlation between biomass and mn uptake was found in both plots i r2 0 988 and ii r2 0 956 indicating that the growth of the plant community enhanced its total mn uptake the observed increase in n in plot ii table 2 indicated that despite the severe impact of metal contamination the tailing site remained as an available habitat for at least metal tolerant bio species according to the soil seed bank theory tang et al 2006 lin and cao 2009 soil possesses the same seed inventory capacity in a given region in addition to this seeds of other plant species can also be brought into the site through various means from surrounding areas therefore under normal conditions namely the conditions without significant disturbance by natural calamities or man s activities the trend of increase in the number of species of a plant community before reaching equilibrium is essential and inevitable while the differences among plant communities are their increasing rates determined by different site conditions the highest number of plant species found in plot iii in the vicinity uncontaminated area was 66 in both years 2015 and 2016 this could be an indication that the composition of the plant community in plot iii had reached a relatively stable state possible changes in species number in plot iii will be further monitored in future studies to confirm its stability 4 2 internal energy increment and ratio the relative values of h rt s r and g rt calculated by eqs 13 15 using respectively dry biomass and mn uptake data all increased from year 2010 to 2016 in both plots i and ii related increments δh rt δs r and δg rt by eqs 7 9 were all found positive in the observed period with a general increasing trend towards increasing year fig 3 a and b biomass fig 4 a and b mn uptake in contrast attributed to the increase in the number of plant species table 2 the g h ratio decreased while the ts h ratio increased with year and the directions of changes were clear and consistent in plots i and ii fig 3c and d biomass fig 4c and d mn uptake the observed changes in g h and s h calculated by eq 16 agree with the ecological equilibrium model molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 that ecosystems possess natural trends towards increase in their biodiversity and thus support the use of g h and s h as potential spontaneity indicators for description of ecological processes it is noticed in figs 3c d and 4c d that the difference between g h and ts h at the observed end point year 2016 was still big and their estimated values by eq 16 were far from their intersection point g h ts h this suggests the presence of potential trends towards further increase in n in both plots i and ii it is also noticed that the difference between g h and ts h in the whole observed period was much greater in plot i than in plot ii figs 3 and 4 indicating that the plant community in plot i possessed a much higher growth and development potential than that in plot ii though there are numbers of factors affecting species diversity of plant communities zhang and dong 2010 the key factor that resulted in the observed differences in the number and growth rate of the plant species between plots i and ii was apparently the soil remediation method the obtained results confirmed the integrated function of the applied organic manure in reduction of metal toxicities supply of nutrients and improvement of soil properties 5 discussions 5 1 functions of growth and development the theoretical explanation for the observed increase in g s and s h and decrease in g h of the investigated plant communities with increase in their enthalpy h or total internal energy u is that given μ rt h is a single function of biomass quantity c t while g and s are functions of both biomass quantity c t and species number n use of the average component ratio as a reciprocal of n x 1 n offers a better understanding of the changes in h g and s of an ecosystem from eqs 10 and 11 we have δh rt δh rt ln n m δc t δs r δs r ln n δc t δg rt δh rt δs r ln n m n δc t since ln n m 0 ln n 0 and ln n m n 0 if δc t 0 δh 0 δs 0 and δg 0 unlike the total mass quantity in reactions listed in table 1 which remains constant in the reaction process δc t 0 the total bio mass quantity of the investigated plant communities increases in photosynthesis reactions δc t 0 giving thus δh 0 δs 0 and δg 0 as shown in figs 3a b and 4a b plant growth and development are natural processes and thus δg 0 cannot be used as a spontaneity indicator for description of plant growth and development the term ts can be interpreted as the part of internal energy stored by a plant community used for system development relating to changes in system composition structure and organization as a conventional parameter for system complexity or disorder s is an appropriate index for species richness or biodiversity in addition the difference between s r and s a r defined by eq 10 can be used as an ecological index for species evenness since s r s a r 0 at c i c j c and x i x j x as the difference between h and ts the gibbs free energy g is the remaining and thus available part of the internal energy stored by a plant community to support its growth and development i e the part of internal energy available to perform net work for the system to grow and develop theoretically g and ts as state functions referring to an ecosystem are different in their concepts from but quantitatively comparable to the applied terms eco exergy and emergy jørgensen 2000 berrios et al 2017 if for an ecosystem increase in biomass means growth while increase in species richness abundance and diversity means development in accordance with their conventional concepts h s and g can be regarded respectively as functions for growth development and potential capacity to support growth and development 5 2 functions of species richness the significance of eq 12 is that it presents g h and s h based on average mass quantity as a single function of n to be more precise eq 12 states that as an essential property and thus a state function of a thermodynamic system or an ecosystem the number of components or species n determines the ratios of g and ts to h of the system at the macroscopic scale or ecological organization level under study use of average values as basic parameters for description of a population or a system has a solid and rational ground eq 12 has thus a general and profound meaning regarding the mechanism of internal energy distribution and transformation in thermodynamic systems based on eq 12 the g h and s h ratios namely the distribution of h or u or the transformation between g and ts can be uniquely determined by n regardless of the changes in mass quantity c t and total internal energy u the essential trend described by the equation holds logically since for a thermodynamic system or an ecosystem undergoing a process of increase in its number of components or species more and more energy stored by the system needs to be used to maintain its gradually diversified composition and structure this means that as n increases a larger portion of h will be transformed into ts rather than into g resulting in increasing ts h associated with decreasing g h there are two characteristic values of n corresponding to different system state in eq 12 hypothetically for a plant community at a given site with limited space area and solar energy input there should be an upper limit of the number of species n m the n m value would then be a potentially existed characteristic parameter uniquely determined by the nature of the locality as an approximation the plant species number observed in the non polluted surrounding area has been used as n m for calculation in the present study while the real n m could be much higher than the used value another characteristic parameter related to the nature of the habitat would be the n value at the interception point g h ts h 1 2 since at this point enthalpy h will be evenly distributed as g and ts the n value which gives g h ts h 1 2 could possibly be a critical point to indicate the arrival of equilibrium for plant community growth and development further studies are needed to examine these speculations 6 conclusion 1 the number of components or species n is an important system property that determines the ratios of gibbs free energy g and entropy s to enthalpy h 2 as functions of n the g h and s h ratios can be applied as ecological indicators for describing the distribution and transformation of internal energy stored by plant communities 3 the observed changes in g h and s h agree with the ecological theory that ecosystems before reaching equilibrium possess potential trends towards increase in biodiversity 4 the interception point g h ts h 1 2 could be a critical point to indicate the arrival of equilibrium for plant community growth and development further observations on the changes in g h and s h of the restored plant communities are needed to testify this speculation acknowledgment the present study forms part of the projects

25311,an 80 decline in the eastern population of the monarch butterfly danaus plexippus has prompted conservation efforts to increase summer reproductive success in the midwest united states implementation of conservation practices will create a patchwork of milkweed mainly asclepias spp habitat within agricultural landscapes dominated by corn and soybean production since the monarch butterfly is a vagile species reproductive success is in part a function of both the amount and spatial arrangement of habitat patches in a fragmented landscape to inform conservation planning we developed a spatially explicit agent based model for summer breeding non migratory female monarch butterfly movement and egg laying on an iowa usa landscape our model employs a unique movement algorithm when monarch agents encounter habitat edges that incorporates monarch perceptual range to their host plant and spatial memory of previously visited habitat these behavioral factors are rarely incorporated into animal movement algorithms however they can influence estimates of resource utilization model exploration assessed the distribution and density of eggs laid on a spatially explicit 148 665 ha landscape comprised of 17 land cover classes with varying milkweed densities uncertainty analysis was undertaken by sampling 25 combinations of perceptual range spatial memory flight step length and flight directionality parameters from a total of 256 44 possible combinations movement paths simulated with our new movement algorithm show preferential use of high density milkweed areas that would not be simulated using a correlated random walk increasing perceptual range caused a decrease in the area used by monarch agents and caused a skewed egg distribution where most eggs were laid in relatively few habitat patches increasing spatial memory caused an increase in the area used but decreased the median number of eggs laid in roadside habitat current national and regional monarch conservation goals assume a uniform distribution of milkweed in different land cover classes translating these goals into spatially explicit heterogeneous habitat patches is essential for predicting realized fecundity in the landscape our model provides the foundation to link national and regional monarch conservation goals to fine scale spatial configurations of habitat

new milkweed stems in the midwest can only be achieved through extensive adoption of habitat restoration in primarily privately owned land in agricultural landscapes consequently establishment of

patterns and resulting egg densities in theoretical landscapes vary with different arrangements of habitat patches even though the total amount of added habitat is held constant zalucki and lammers

2017 we have developed a spatially explicit agent based model for non migratory female monarch butterfly movement and egg laying in an iowa usa landscape the model incorporates decision and directional based random walk flight algorithms when the habitat is homogeneous monarch agents move in a correlated random walk corresponding to the directional movement described by zalucki and kitching 1982b in iowa many of these homogeneous areas are corn and soybean fields that are largely devoid of milkweed grasslands and pastures are also large homogeneous areas without discrete internal habitat edges but they may have substantial milkweed populations in these homogeneous areas wild monarch butterflies have been observed to turn more often zalucki and kitching 1982b we model flight patterns in different homogeneous habitat types using different assumptions of directionality higher directionality values create straighter movement paths and lower directionality values

1998 in some situations and especially in homogeneous environments codling et al 2008 smouse et al 2010 but in heterogeneous environments movement algorithms that include interactions of the animal with the environment are often needed johnson et al 1992 codling et al 2008 wallentin 2017 for decision based flight at discrete habitat edges in heterogeneous environments our model uses a unique

smouse et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 however the need to elucidate how these behaviors can influence resource utilization on the landscape has long been recognized lima and zollner 1996 mueller and fagan 2008 mueller et al 2011 and is a growing area of research in landscape ecology turner and gardner 2015 and spatially explicit individual based modeling wallentin 2017 smouse et al 2010 perceptual range is the distance at which animals can detect and respond to resources such as host plants or food resources lima and zollner 1996 perceptual range can have a substantial effect on animal movement as animals cannot react to resources they cannot detect spatial memory is the ability of organisms to remember locations they have previously visited and subsequently avoid or revisit smouse et al 2010 moorcroft 2012 perceptual range and spatial memory likely have a strong effect on the distribution of monarch eggs on the landscape perceptual range in monarch butterflies includes olfactory and visual sensory inputs garlick 2007 visual perceptual range is likely only a few meters garlick 2007 however field observations indicate that olfactory perceptual range for nectar sources could extend hundreds of meters dr orley taylor pers comm depending on the strength of the odor wind speed and direction of the odor plume cardé and willis 2008 observations reported by fisher et al 2017 suggest that olfactory perceptual range in monarch butterflies is 50 to 75 m while monarchs likely have spatial memory the mechanisms and spatial scale of their memory is unclear male butterflies patrol milkweed patches or nectar sources waiting for females zalucki and kitching 1982b suggesting they recognize their patches female butterflies however move extensively among habitat patches zalucki and lammers 2010 and references cited therein memory capabilities are well known in some insects such as honey bees hammer and menzel 1995 and learning behavior in butterflies lewis 1986 and moths cunningham et al 1999 has been documented monarch butterflies learn associations between color and nectar sources blackiston et al 2011 and can remember these associations for up to three days rodrigues and weiss 2012 by incorporating decisional and directional movement in our agent based model we evaluate the following hypotheses 1 greater directionality in poor habitat results in more eggs laid on the landscape as monarch agents spend less time in poor habitat and conversely less directionality in good habitat results in more eggs laid as monarch agents spend more time in good habitat 2 as perceptual range increases there is an associated increase in the number of eggs laid on the landscape because females are better able to find oviposition habitat 3 with longer term spatial memory of previously visited milkweed patches female monarchs will have a greater area of habitat utilization and lay fewer eggs since they spend more time searching for new habitat patches we employ uncertainty analysis of the parameters used for perceptual range spatial memory directionality and step length to determine the effect of parameter assumptions on model outputs marino et al 2008 uncertainty analysis provides insight into plausible values for these parameters and the design of future experimental and observational studies to improve understanding of the role these behavioral elements play in monarch movement and egg laying in fragmented landscapes 2 methods in our model each monarch agent behaves autonomously and interacts with habitat patches to probabilistically choose a direction to move and where to lay eggs our model advances the work of zalucki et al 2016 and parry et al 2017 by incorporating a novel movement algorithm in their movement algorithm agents choose between two adjacent habitat patches and perceptual range was simulated as either 5 or 25 m however monarch butterflies likely have a perceptual range of 75 400 m 50 400 m fisher et al 2017 orley taylor pers comm and thus in heterogeneous landscapes with small habitat patches more than two habitat patches will likely be within range and the model described here allows agents to choose between any habitat patches within their perceptual range other modifications to the movement algorithm include varying directionality according to habitat quality and incorporating spatial memory of recently visited habitat patches whereas zalucki et al 2016 used a simulated model landscape we model monarch butterfly movement and egg laying on a spatially explicit landscape we describe our model for monarch butterfly movement and egg laying in story county iowa following the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 the model is implemented in the repast simphony 2 3 1 platform using the java programming language north et al 2013 see supplemental material a 2 1 model purpose the purpose is to model monarch butterfly movement and egg laying on a spatially explicit iowa usa landscape to better understand the effects of landscape composition and configuration on the distribution of adult female monarchs and their eggs with the long term goal to support evaluation of alternative conservation strategies our purpose here is to explore how uncertainty in monarch perceptual range spatial memory and directionality affect the number of eggs laid on the landscape and the habitat patches in which eggs are laid to motivate further research to refine understanding of monarch movement ecology 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model agents represent individual female monarch butterflies monarch agents move around the landscape laying eggs using a programmed movement algorithm monarch agent movement is simulated over 10 days the approximate egg laying lifespan of an adult female monarch the model is divided into time steps of one day and within each day monarch agents move a defined number of movement steps the initial state of a monarch agent is at a random location in the study area and they hold 410 eggs that can be laid over 10 days monarch agent movement and egg laying decisions are based on interactions with habitat patches habitat patches are delineated in a geographic information system gis as monarch agents interact with the landscape they make decisions to move toward patches based on the characteristics of the patch they currently occupy and other patches they can perceive the model was implemented for story county iowa an area of 148 665 ha 1486 65 km2 fig 1 we ran 25 simulations each with a different combination of parameter values table 2 values were sampled across the range of uncertainty for each parameter in each simulation we used 10 000 monarch agents an estimate of female monarch density obtained from a panel of experts see acknowledgements for the experts consulted 2 2 1 land cover patches we classified the landscape into 17 land cover categories based on relative homogeneity and available data table 1 we created an arcgis polygon shapefile of land cover for import into repast simphony using the 2014 crop data layer cdl 30 m resolution usda 2014 for story county iowa usa we created eight land cover categories corn soybeans forest medium high intensity development low intensity development developed open space grass pasture open water barren landscapes and wetlands we then converted the raster into a shapefile in iowa 12 and 4 of planted corn and soybeans respectively are not glyphosate resistant usda 2015 because non glyphosate resistant corn and soybean fields have a higher density of milkweed pleasants and oberhauser 2013 we randomly selected 12 of the corn and 4 of soybean fields as being planted with non glyphosate resistant crops in iowa roads are found along most public land survey section boundaries resulting in a substantial number of rural roads in the state in story county there are 1536 km of rural roads using a road shapefile we identified all rural roads in the county by excluding roads in urban areas defined according to an urban area shapefile interstate freeways and state highways urban roads interstate freeways and state highways remained in the model as low intensity development as classified in the crop data layer rural road rows are characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of milkweed and milkweed patches hartzler 2010 hartzler pers comm in such a narrow space this heterogeneity is likely to have important effects on monarch agent movement we modelled this heterogeneity as continuous adjacent 50 m square patches along each side of the roads using data from 2010 hartzler 2010 and 2015 hartzler pers comm we created five categories of milkweed density for roads see table 1 railroad rows were represented by buffering a shapefile of the railroad with a 25 m buffer because the step length of the monarch agent is 20 50 m see table 2 we processed the shapefile such that all patches are at least 50 m across in the smallest dimension relative milkweed density among the 17 land cover types was determined from literature sources and experts best professional judgement see acknowledgements a parameter representing milkweed density was assigned to each land cover type table 1 initial values of milkweed density ranged from 0 to 1 but were reduced to 10 of their original value during model calibration see 2 6 the movement algorithm described below uses the milkweed density parameter to determine movement and egg laying decisions relative milkweed density for road rows was determined from 2015 state wide survey data hartzler pers comm pleasants and oberhauser 2013 provide milkweed densities for grasslands pastures and non glyphosate resistance and glyphosate resistant corn and soybeans relative milkweed densities for railroad rows other crops forest and low intensity development were estimated by expert professional judgement the gis shapefile with assigned values of milkweed density was then imported into a repast simphony geographic context the model maintains a running total of the number of eggs laid in each habitat patch 2 3 process overview and scheduling each time step of the model is a day in the life of an egg laying monarch agent within each time step the agents move 5 5 10 km in a sequence of 110 500 movement steps depending on whether the step length is 20 30 40 or 50 m fig 2 agents have opportunities to lay eggs after each step length the egg laying lifespan of captive monarchs varies from 14 to 45 days oberhauser 1997 and averages approximately 28 days depending on temperature zalucki 1981 data on wild monarchs is lacking but they likely have a shorter lifespan zalucki and kitching 1984 monarch agent movement and egg laying is simulated for 10 days see table 2 for monarch parameters on the first day of their egg laying life monarch agents move 10 000 m zalucki et al 2016 movement capacity is thought to decline in lepidoptera as they age e g sappington and burks 2014 consequently the distance they can move each day in the model decreases by 500 m on the 10th day they can move 5500 m consistent with zalucki et al 2016 the number of eggs potentially laid by a female monarch each day decreases over time zalucki 1981 oberhauser 1997 in the model on the first day agents can lay up to 50 eggs starting on day 2 potential eggs laid decreases by two each day and by the last day they can lay 32 eggs consistent with oberhauser 2004 the total possible number of eggs that a monarch agent can lay over 10 days is 410 consistent with urquhart s 1960 reported lifetime fecundity value of 420 eggs and oberhauser s 2004 estimate of 300 400 a movement submodel described in detail in 2 7 incorporates a correlated random walk when only one habitat patch is within perceptual range and a decision based movement when more than one habitat patch is within perceptual range decision based movement includes an algorithm to choose among habitat patches using weighted probabilities of milkweed density and spatial memory finally each agent has a probability of laying eggs in each movement step 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 basic principles the monarch butterfly is a vagile species that moves extensively across the landscape zalucki and kitching 1984 zalucki and lammers 2010 we model non migratory generations that are resident in iowa in july and august monarch butterflies attempt to maximize their fitness by laying eggs in habitat that are most likely to produce adult monarchs monarch agents in the model make movement decisions based on the resources they can perceive on the landscape within their perceptual range and based on which locations they have visited in the past i e spatial memory resource distribution is modelled as habitat patches with varying attractiveness based on milkweed density 2 4 2 emergence the primary emergent outputs are the monarch movement paths and the distribution of eggs on the landscape that arise from the movement behavior of the monarch agents interactions with habitat patches 2 4 3 adaptation monarch agents change their behavior based on milkweed density of habitat patches within their perceptual range they also adapt their movement behavior according to patches they occupied during recent steps 2 4 4 objectives monarch agents objectives are to find oviposition habitat i e patches with milkweed in the fragmented landscape and maximize their fitness by laying eggs in locations most likely to allow growth and development to the adult stage objectives are evaluated by determining the number of eggs laid and how those eggs are distributed on the landscape 2 4 5 learning female monarch agents remember patches they have recently occupied and have a lower probability of returning to those patches 2 4 6 prediction monarch agents do not predict future conditions over the course of their egg laying lifetime 2 4 7 sensing monarch agents are assumed to sense milkweed using olfactory or visual cues bergstrom et al 1994 blackiston et al 2011 garlick 2007 in the model the milkweed density parameter serves as a measure of sensory input 2 4 8 interaction monarch agents do not interact it is conceivable that in nature they interact indirectly by choosing not to lay eggs on milkweed that already have eggs i e a type of density dependence this interaction is not currently incorporated in the model given the limited evidence of this behavior 2 4 9 stochasticity monarch agents choose which patch to move toward according to probabilities calculated for each patch within their perceptual range monarch agents also lay eggs at each movement step as determined by milkweed density monarch agents start at a randomly selected point in the landscape on day 1 2 4 10 observation the model outputs data for habitat patches and monarch agents for habitat patches the model outputs the number of eggs laid in each of the 37 165 patches for each monarch agent the model outputs the number of eggs laid each day the model can output the location latitude and longitude of a monarch agent as x y coordinates at each step to obtain movement trajectories we examined several metrics to describe model behavior and serve as response variables in the uncertainty analysis table 3 we used the x y coordinates of each monarch agent at each step to calculate their habitat utilization distribution which is a metric for how much of the landscape is used worton 1989 this metric can be compared with empirical field data of monarch movement we calculated the area of the utilization distribution for each monarch agent with a dynamic brownian bridge movement model kranstauber et al 2012 using the r package move kranstauber and smolla 2016 we used a 30 m raster thus our utilization distribution estimate is the sum of all 30 30 m raster cells occupied by a monarch agent we calculated the mean proportion of potential eggs laid per monarch agent on day five we calculated median egg density per patch for two habitat types grass pasture and road rows with the most milkweed road row mw 60 100 m 2 we chose these two habitat types for closer examination after evaluating behavior across all habitat types grass pasture patches are medium in size are distributed somewhat randomly across the landscape and have a high density of milkweed pleasants and oberhauser 2013 road rows are considered to be an important habitat component kasten et al 2016 because of their overall large area and connectivity across the state road row patches are generally small but regularly distributed across the landscape and adjacent to other road row patches finally we looked at total cumulative eggs laid in the entire landscape and in the high density road patches and grass pasture patches because of uncertainty in parameter estimates for monarch agents we examine only the relative number of eggs laid per land cover type rather than the absolute number of eggs laid 2 5 initialization the model is initialized by randomly placing the monarch agents across story county for the uncertainty analysis 10 000 monarch agents were used except for the utilization distribution analysis see below for which 1000 agents were used an exploratory study indicated that 10 000 agents was a sufficient sample size for egg density analyses for example two simulations with 10 000 agents with the same parameterization step length 30 perceptual range 50 remembered patches 0 and directionality 0 5 0 75 resulted in a difference of 0 04 in the cumulative eggs laid in the study area 2 744 170 vs 2 743 108 and a correlation of 0 97 for eggs laid in the 37 165 individual patches 2 6 input data the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels in the movement submodel the monarch agents random walk is programmed as a series of steps monarch agents choose a heading 0 360 move the distance of the step length in that direction choose a new heading from their new location move the next step and so on wild monarchs lay eggs singly as they move across the landscape zalucki and kitching 1982a but the rate at which they lay eggs is unclear and likely varies with milkweed density one of us mpz collected data on eight monarchs in florida in 1987 in a diffuse patch of milkweed in a pasture monarchs were followed from milkweed to milkweed as they laid eggs mean egg laying rate was 0 012 eggs m sd 0 006 or about 1 egg per 82 m sd 25 4 a straight step length in the model may represent a more convoluted path of a wild monarch consequently we assumed that monarchs lay 2 eggs per step length if it chooses to lay eggs on that step because egg laying rate is poorly known we make inferences about relative egg densities and postpone inference on absolute egg densities until additional experimental data and or field observations are available the egg laying rate is held constant hence step length serves as a surrogate of egg laying rate our uncertainty analysis evaluates this model assumption agents determine the heading on which to move by evaluating the landscape fig 3 agents have a perceptual range assumed to represent the distance that they can detect milkweed plants through olfactory or visual cues bergstrom et al 1994 garlick 2007 rodrigues and weiss 2012 wild monarchs likely use olfaction for long range detection of milkweed and visual cues at short distances garlick 2007 the agents field of perception is 360 under the assumption that they can detect odor plumes from any direction at each step agents query the modelled landscape and determine how many patches are within the perceptual range if no other patches are within the perceptual range other than the currently occupied patch the agent moves in a correlated random walk in a correlated random walk the heading that the agent moves is determined by a change to the current heading by θ radians the change in heading θ is determined by the formula 1 θ π r 1 d where r is a random number between 0 and 1 chosen by a random number generator and d is the directionality parameter that ranges from 0 to 1 high directionality e g 0 9 causes the agent to move in nearly straight lines and low directionality e g 0 1 causes the agent to move in nearly random directions resulting in very tortuous movement paths we assume directionality increases as habitat quality decreases zalucki and kitching 1982b zalucki 1983 thus directionality for an agent is dependent on the habitat it occupies at each step the monarch agent queries the milkweed density of the current patch and calculates directionality according to eq 2 2 d c u r r e n t d m a x m d d m a x d m i n 0 09 where dcurrent is the directionality for the current patch d max is the maximum possible directionality d min is the minimum possible directionality md is the milkweed density parameter queried from the current patch and the range of milkweed density values in the study area is 0 09 as an example if directionality was set to a range of 0 5 0 75 directionality was 0 5 in the best habitat md 0 09 and increased linearly to 0 75 in the poorest habitat md 0 if more than one patch is detected within the perceptual range the agent must choose which patch to move toward i e decisional flight monarch agents are assumed to have a higher probability of moving toward patches with higher milkweed density based on laboratory and greenhouse studies suggesting that increased number of milkweed plants result in an increased intensity of olfactory and or visual cues bergstrom et al 1994 rodrigues and weiss 2012 garlick 2007 monarch agent attractiveness to a patch is based on the milkweed density parameter after adjustments an attractiveness probability is calculated for each patch within the perceptual range in a two step process in the first step the milkweed density parameter for each patch is scaled according to the area of the patch within perceptual range the model calculates the area of each patch within the perceptual range i e the area of overlap between the perceptual range and the landscape patches and multiplies that area by the milkweed density parameter for example if a patch covers 50 of the perceived area of the monarch agent and the milkweed density parameter for that patch is 0 1 the scaled attractiveness probability 0 5 0 1 0 05 this adjustment controls for the fact that the more area of a patch is within the perceptual range there is a greater likelihood of more milkweed providing olfactory and or visual cues increasing its attractiveness without this function very small patches with high milkweed density are nearly exclusively chosen by the monarch agents simulations not shown which is not consistent with field observations that indicate the monarch is a vagile species zalucki and kitching 1982b zalucki and suzuki 1987 ries and debinski 2001 zalucki and lammers 2010 attractiveness probability is next adjusted based on the monarch agent s interaction with the patch in recent steps it is assumed monarchs have spatial memory blackiston et al 2011 rodrigues and weiss 2012 and have a lower probability of returning to small patches previously visited and evaluated for oviposition potential and thus more likely to visit habitat not yet evaluated this behavior is realized by saving a list of the most recently visited patches the size of the list corresponds to the spatial memory parameter if spatial memory 10 identification numbers of the last 10 patches visited are saved in the list which may all be the same patch if it is a large area of habitat at each step the identification number of the patch occupied by the agent is added to the top of the list and the identification number of the oldest patch is dropped from the list when choosing among patches within the perceptual range each patch is checked against the list and the probability of moving toward a patch is reduced if it is on the list under the assumption that monarchs remember relatively small patches on the landscape better than large patches we reduce the effect of remembering patches as a function of patch area the remembered probability is reduced by a scalar generated using the logistic eq 3 as 3 1 1 e 2 a 0 92 where a is the area of the patch fig 4 using this equation patches above approximately 3 ha have a scalar of nearly 1 and thus have a negligible effect when calculating attractiveness patches at the smallest size of approximately 0 25 ha have a scalar of 0 18 thus there is a strong effect for small patches which have the attractiveness probability reduced to 18 of its initial value when the milkweed density parameter has been adjusted by area and memory to calculate the final attractiveness probability for each patch the adjusted probabilities which constitute a multinomial distribution are normalized to sum to 1 a random number from 0 to 1 then determines which patch is chosen when the patch is chosen the model performs a query to determine the heading to the point of the patch nearest the monarch agent the monarch then moves on that heading for the distance of one step length if the monarch agent chooses the patch it currently occupies it moves in a correlated random walk after the monarch agent moves the cumulative distance moved that day is updated if the cumulative distance moved is the maximum daily distance the monarch ends movement for that day 2 8 model calibration model parameterization and calibration involves optimizing parameters such that the model gives more realistic results thiele et al 2014 in the case of monarch butterflies our information is limited zalucki 1983 estimated that approximately 50 of potential eggs were laid each day which was supported by limited field data therefore we calibrated the milkweed density parameter to values that resulted in approximately half of available eggs being laid each day our original estimates of the relative egg densities elicited from our experts were scaled to be between 0 and 1 calibration resulted in the original values being reduced by 90 table 1 2 9 computational resources we ran simulations on the yeti computer cluster operated by the advanced research computing facility of the united states geological survey denver co and on a 32 core machine on the iowa state university campus each simulation takes from 0 25 to over 12 h depending on the parameterization this is largely due to the high resolution large scale spatial dataset used and thus a large number of habitat patches iterated and stored in memory code profiling revealed that the most computationally intensive operations were calculation of the area of overlap of the perceptual range buffer and the habitat patches 2 10 analysis we begin with a comparison of graphical output of movement paths under a variety of parameterization scenarios visual inspection of model output is an important aspect of model evaluation bennett et al 2013 and in our case provides important insight into movement patterns because observations of monarch flight at the spatial scales simulated in the model are not available in the scientific literature we asked five experts in monarch butterfly behavior to independently evaluate the simulated movement patterns see acknowledgements the experts provided opinions as to which panels in fig 5 best represent female monarch movement paths as well as the characteristics of the movement paths that formed the basis of their opinion subsequently we estimated the egg density in habitat patches in a subset of story county including estimates of the proportion of eggs laid in each land cover type because of the uncertainty in some parameters we examine the distribution of the proportion of eggs laid in each land cover type across all 25 parameter combinations as described below global uncertainty analysis marino et al 2008 thiele et al 2014 was used to investigate responses of model outputs utilization distribution mean proportion of eggs laid per agent on day five median egg density per grass pasture patch median egg density per road rows total eggs laid in grass pasture patches total eggs laid in road rows and total eggs laid in the study area to uncertainty in four monarch parameters perceptual range spatial memory directionality and step length this analysis provides insight into how these factors affect movement and egg laying of monarch agents step length has important effects on model outputs for example the number of eggs laid per meter moved depends on step length because we kept the number of eggs laid per step constant i e two eggs are laid at the end of each step assuming the agent choses to lay eggs regardless of step length consequently smaller step lengths should result in a larger number of eggs laid per meter four values were evaluated per parameter see table 3 which results in 256 44 possible parameter combinations for the uncertainty analysis twenty five parameter combinations were selected using latin hypercube sampling mckay and beckman 1979 r package lhs perceptual range spatial memory and step length were treated as continuous variables directionality was treated as a categorical variable and considered in four scenarios for each scenario directionality varied from dmin the minimum directionality that occurs in good habitat to dmax the maximum directionality that occurs in poor habitat the four scenarios were low directionality in good habitat dmin 0 1 and poor habitat dmax 0 2 low directionality in good habitat dmin 0 1 and high directionality in poor habitat dmax 0 9 an intermediate scenario dmin 0 5 and dmax 0 75 and high directionality in good habitat dmin 0 8 and poor habitat dmax 0 9 as discussed previously the model incorporates a correlated random walk in patches outside the monarch agents perceptual range and a decision based movement algorithm when two or more different habitat patches are adjoined within the perceptual range the outcome of the decision based movement algorithm is dependent on assumptions of perceptual range and spatial memory an uncertainty analysis including a null assumption that perceptual range is 0 m was not included given the literature see 2 4 7 that documents monarchs do perceive milkweed and nectar sources through visual and olfactory cues however a null assumption of no spatial memory was included in the uncertainty analysis given the more tenuous nature of the best available experimental data simulation results were analyzed using a linear multiple regression meta model thiele et al 2014 exploratory analyses indicated that a multiple regression approach was sufficient because the relationships between model output variables and monarch parameters were generally linear i e r2 was above 0 7 which is the cutoff recommended by saltelli et al 2004 2008 we report the amount of variation in the response variable explained by each parameter using a sensitivity index saltelli et al 2004 2008 sensitivity si for parameter i is calculated as 4 s i s s i s s t where sst is the total sum of squares and ssi is the sum of squares for parameter i when it is first in the model regression coefficients and graphs of predicted response variables are provided in the supplementary materials c because the parameters are non orthogonal the order of variables in the linear regression affects the direction of the regression coefficients consequently the four predictor variables were added to the model using a stepwise algorithm using package stepaic in r with lowest aic variables added first 3 results simulated movement behavior of monarch butterflies are depicted in fig 5 under all 25 model parameter combinations we found that the simulated monarch agents spent their time in areas with high milkweed density such as road rows with occasional forays into agricultural fields where milkweed was modelled as rare or non existent a correlated random walk alone in which monarch agents do not respond to land cover types would not replicate these movement paths four of the five expert panelists considered panel c to be the best representation of monarch movement paths while one panelist considered panel a to be the best parameterization all of our panelists generally cited similar rationale for choosing c or a female monarch butterflies move long distances across the landscape do not stay in one habitat patch for long and are a vagile species that disperses their eggs widely the amount of time monarch agents spent in agricultural fields and how far they moved across the landscape was affected by the parameter values see fig 5a f with a long perceptual range 400 m the monarch agent remained at the cluster of patches at a road intersection and failed to leave that cluster fig 5b whereas with a 50 m perceptual range the monarch agent moved more widely fig 5b agents with longer term spatial memory 100 patches remembered formed less dense clusters of movement in road rows fig 5b relative to those with fewer patches remembered 10 patches remembered fig 5a longer term spatial memory resulted in monarch agents more readily leaving a location and finding higher quality habitat not previously visited although longer term spatial memory 100 remembered patches allows a monarch agent to occasionally leave clusters of patches at road intersections large perceptual range 400 m results in the agent utilizing much less of the landscape fig 5d as compared to an agent with a shorter perceptual range 50 m fig 4a fig 5d when directionality is high in poor habitat 0 9 fig 5e the agent movement path is more linear as compared to tortuous movement paths with low directionality in poor habitat 0 02 fig 5f the land cover types that accumulated the most eggs in the model across all 25 parameter combinations were road rows grassland pasture and non glyphosate resistant corn fig 6 7 the proportion of eggs laid in rows 19 49 was highly variable across simulations indicating that more precise values for perceptual range and spatial memory would reduce variability in quantifying use of rows grassland and pastures have the next highest accumulated eggs varying from 24 to 42 of eggs laid non glyphosate resistant corn constitutes 12 of the corn fields and is assumed to have relatively good higher milkweed density consistent with 15 34 of eggs being laid in these patches all other habitats accumulate relatively few eggs 3 1 effect of varying perceptual range on monarch movement and egg laying perceptual range had an important effect on how monarch agents move and how eggs were distributed across the landscape table 4 except for step length which is a model construct perceptual range explained more of the variance in utilization distribution median egg density in road rows and median egg density in grass pasture than spatial memory or directionality larger perceptual ranges resulted in monarch agents failing to move from groups of patches with high milkweed density resulting in smaller utilization distributions see supplementary material b and c a small perceptual range resulted in a higher median egg density in road rows as well as more evenly distributed eggs in these patches fig 8 with a large perceptual range median egg density was lower because eggs accumulated in a few patches and many patches had few or no eggs fig 8 median egg density decreased in both road row and grass pasture habitat as perceptual range increased though more so in road rows supplementary material b and c the proportion of eggs laid and total eggs laid in road rows grass pastures and the full study area were largely unaffected by changes in perceptual range contrary to our hypothesis supplementary material b and c in summary perceptual range affected where eggs were laid on the landscape but not the cumulative total number of eggs 3 2 effect of varying the spatial memory on monarch movement and egg laying spatial memory was the most important factor affecting the total eggs laid in road rows other than step length table 4 longer spatial memory decreased the total number of eggs laid in road rows consistent with our hypothesis see supplementary material b and c spatial memory explained 10 18 of variation in utilization distribution proportion of eggs laid median egg density in grass pasture and total eggs laid in the study area spatial memory explained very little of the variation in total eggs laid in grass pasture increasing spatial memory increased the area of the utilization distribution consistent with our hypothesis supplementary material b and c longer term spatial memory also decreased the proportion of eggs laid the total eggs laid in the study area and the median egg density in grass pasture supplementary material b and c 3 3 effect of varying directionality on monarch movement and egg laying directionality explained 40 44 of variation in proportion of eggs laid total eggs laid in grass pasture and total eggs laid in the study area table 4 when directionality was low 0 1 in good habitat monarch agents stayed longer in grass pasture habitat and laid more eggs thus increasing the values of the above mentioned output parameters supplementary material b and c directionality explained 18 of the variation in utilization distribution area high directionality in poor habitat increased the area of the utilization distribution as monarch agents moved farther from places they had been especially those areas without milkweed such glyphosate resistant corn and soybean fields supplementary material b and c directionality had the smallest effect on egg density in road rows and total eggs laid in road rows table 4 higher directionality in good and poor habitat increased median egg density in road rows and total eggs in road rows to some degree supplementary material b and c likely because agents moving in straighter movement paths were more likely to find a road row 3 4 effect of varying step length on model output step length explained the largest proportion of variation in all response variables except median egg density in road rows and median egg density in grass pasture table 4 longer step lengths increased the area of the utilization distribution but decreased all other response variables supplementary material b and c longer step lengths lead to farther movement increasing the area of the utilization distribution but longer step lengths meant fewer opportunities to lay eggs decreasing all other response variables 4 discussion perceptual range is implicitly included in many individual based models as the local area with which an agent may interact wallentin 2017 but spatial heterogeneity of habitat within that perceptual range as we have modelled here has rarely been included in individual based models our results show that perceptual range and spatial memory can be critical input parameters lima and zollner 1996 called for increased attention to the impacts of animal behavior at the landscape scale and wallentin 2017 specifically called for more attention to spatial structure as a constraint on animal movement in spatial simulation studies we found that perceptual range in particular has a dramatic effect on how monarch agents move and lay eggs on the landscape perceptual range in monarch butterflies as with most phytophagous insects is poorly understood garlick 2007 cardé and willis 2008 but has important implications for model behavior when perceptual range was large the model estimated that monarch agents have a much smaller utilization distribution and lay eggs in relatively few habitat patches with a small perceptual range eggs are more evenly distributed on the landscape monarch butterflies are a vagile species zalucki and kitching 1984 ries and debinski 2001 zalucki and lammers 2010 and our modelled movements with a smaller perceptual ranges are consistent with such behavior experimental determination of perceptual range up to several 100 m in free ranging monarch butterflies will aid in refining this model input increasing spatial memory can influence monarch agent movement but the effect is most apparent at fine scales the habitat in road rows is comprised of relatively small patches as a result monarch agents can avoid a patch visited in recent steps which results in lowered egg densities in road rows as spatial memory increases see supplemental material b and c in larger grass pasture patches which have an intermediate milkweed density value and in which several steps can be required to leave a patch there is no decline in total eggs in grass pasture patches as spatial memory increases see supplemental material b and c and a marginal trend of lower egg density supplemental material b and c this response may reflect that while monarch agents remember a large grassland pasture patch visited in previous steps once back in the patch it may take numerous steps before they depart a large area with a moderate milkweed density our model does not currently include spatially explicit placement of high density milkweed patches within the grass pasture patches because there is no systematically collected data available on milkweed patch sizes stem densities and spatial distributions for this land cover class collection of field survey data on milkweed patch characteristics within larger land cover classes such as grass pasture would permit an evaluation of the extent to which estimated total eggs or egg density in a large patch is sensitive to spatial memory of explicitly located high density milkweed patches our results showed that different model parameterizations had little effect on the total number of eggs laid in story county even though the monarch agents exhibited a diversity of complex movements and associated egg density patterns in the landscape the finding that total eggs laid did not significantly vary may be related to the observation that random walk models approximate a diffusion process at some scales and with large sample sizes turchin 1998 codling et al 2008 while diffusion models can play an important role in quantitative movement analysis turchin 1998 in our case a diffusion approximation would obscure movement and egg distribution patterns that have implications in predicting population responses for example higher rates of parasitism and predation likely occur in patches with high monarch and or milkweed densities zalucki and kitching 1982c bartel et al 2011 stenoien et al 2016 thus it is critical to predict where eggs will be laid in the landscape as well as how many eggs will be laid to fully inform conservation benefits and risks of different habitat restoration scenarios directionality had the greatest effect on the mean proportion of eggs laid the total eggs laid in the study area and total eggs laid in grass pasture less directionality in good habitat resulted in more eggs laid overall likely because monarch agents executed more steps in grass pasture patches and therefore laid more eggs field observations indicate that directionality is higher for monarchs in poor habitat straighter flight patterns and lower more tortuous patterns in good habitat zalucki and kitching 1982b zalucki 1983 step length is a discrete representation of a continuous process turchin 1998 and thus has an effect on model results we found that step length affected the total eggs laid in grass pastures road rows and the county because the egg laying rate number of eggs laid per m was different with different step lengths the sensitivity of the model to step length will be an important issue to address when attempting to estimate absolute numbers of eggs laid egg laying rate can easily be fixed as a constant rate per m independent of step length similar to the model of parry et al 2017 but empirical data is needed to determine monarch egg laying rates in different land cover types nail et al 2015 reported an average of 0 043 eggs per milkweed or 1 egg per 23 milkweed in the sites they surveyed but such data is not easily converted to an egg laying rate additional empirical data is needed to reasonably estimate egg laying rate in a variety of land cover types with different milkweed densities regardless of egg laying rate step length also affected the utilization distribution to control for the effect of step length on utilization distribution future versions of the model could refine the movement algorithm movement decisions could be based on habitat evaluations that occur at a constant rate that is independent of the step length currently decisions are made at the end of each step length alternatively a variable step length could be drawn from a distribution derived from empirical observations of distances traveled in set time periods zalucki and kitching 1982b found natural monarch step lengths to be auto correlated another consideration for precise modeling of step lengths systematic observational data of wild monarchs flight steps in a variety of iowa and midwestern landscapes would provide the information needed to ascertain the extent to which future model calibration or refinement is needed the landscape we evaluated has patches of vastly different sizes which has implications for model behavior for example modeling monarch movement in the narrow but abundant road row habitat is critical a correlated random walk would not capture monarch movement well in such a long narrow habitat further the road rows are quite heterogeneous in milkweed density with patches of various sizes scattered throughout hartzler 2010 kasten et al 2016 because of the long narrow nature of the road row habitat it was necessary to model this heterogeneity as a grid corn and soybean fields on the other hand are highly homogeneous habitat and a correlated random walk is likely adequate for modeling movement in these patches grassland and pastures have more heterogeneity than corn fields but because they are typically in larger blocks a correlated random walk appears adequate to model movement as discussed previously empirical data is needed to better quantify and model heterogeneity within grass pasture habitat coordinating experimental studies with the development of mathematical models can provide an efficient means to advance knowledge restif et al 2012 in this case development of the model and evaluation of its outputs identified areas of additional research that would help reduce uncertainty in assigning attributes to monarch agents i e perceptual range spatial memory step length land cover patches e g milkweed density in different land cover classes and model outputs e g egg densities in multiple habitat patches in adjoining land cover classes for example while kasten et al 2016 found increasing monarch egg density with increasing milkweed density in rows consistent with model predictions to more fully evaluate the model s predictions requires egg density data sets in adjoining land cover classes and at a spatial scale similar to that used in the model large scale monitoring programs for monarchs and milkweed which are being designed and piloted e g mjv 2016 may provide the needed information in particular milkweed density and egg density estimates from a statistically rigorous sampling scheme for the land cover types in our model comparing experimental or field survey data to model outputs is however not the only approach to evaluate uncertainty in physical and mathematical models wallentin 2017 batty and torrens 2005 as noted previously additional experimental research can advance fundamental understanding of monarch behavior and in turn advance the mechanistic basis of the model s movement algorithm our uncertainty analysis establishes high priority areas of additional research that include improved understanding of perceptual range and spatial memory the effect of landscape configuration on egg density in individual patches also needs to be evaluated in future modeling and empirical studies model results indicated some patches that have identical size shape and milkweed density have varying egg densities this varying egg density is likely a function of the landscape configuration of surrounding patches various measures of landscape configuration and composition have been developed comprehensive modeling and field surveys are needed to identify factors that render some habitat patches better egg laying sites than others model results to date inform several hypotheses about how landscape configuration factors might affect egg density for example the distance of a habitat patch to a road row seems likely to affect the ability of monarchs to find the patch employing a proximity index i e the amount of habitat within a certain distance of a patch may provide some insights gustafson and parker 1992 because of the extensive pattern of corridors and isolation of individual patches that are not road rows an analysis of connectivity may provide insights kindlmann and burel 2008 a sound understanding of the effect of landscape configuration will maximize habitat restoration effectiveness by providing the information necessary to create habitat patches that will attract high egg density conservation planning is typically made in the face of uncertainty polasky et al 2018 formulation of habitat restoration options to support monarch butterfly conservation is no exception based on correlations of trends in estimated milkweed stems in the north central u s to estimated annual overwintering monarch populations habitat conservation goals expressed as the number of new milkweed stems have been proposed at the county level assuming a uniform distribution of stems in different land cover classes thogmartin et al 2017 rohweder and thogmartin 2015 translating these goals into explicit landscapes with habitat patches of varying quality and in different spatial patterns is needed to predict realized fecundity based on current and future conservation management practices our simulation of female monarch movement which assumes spatial memory and subsequent egg laying in a spatially explicit agricultural landscape in the north central u s suggests establishment of a relatively large number of small habitat patches dispersed at distances within the monarch s perceptual range will result in greater realized fecundity and subsequent adult recruitment rather than establishment of a smaller number of large habitat patches that are dispersed at distances beyond the perceptual range the model presented here provides context to prioritize experimental studies to reduce uncertainty in monarch movement behavior and to formulate landscape scale survey designs to assess monarch habitat utilization the modeling framework can also contribute to decision support tools needed by county state or regional planning groups exploring the relative benefits of different conservation strategies for enhancing habitat in different land cover classes our model provides the foundation to help address challenging monarch butterfly conservation management issues by linking broad scale goals to fine scale spatial configuration of milkweed patches acknowledgments we thank john pleasants iowa

25311,an 80 decline in the eastern population of the monarch butterfly danaus plexippus has prompted conservation efforts to increase summer reproductive success in the midwest united states implementation of conservation practices will create a patchwork of milkweed mainly asclepias spp habitat within agricultural landscapes dominated by corn and soybean production since the monarch butterfly is a vagile species reproductive success is in part a function of both the amount and spatial arrangement of habitat patches in a fragmented landscape to inform conservation planning we developed a spatially explicit agent based model for summer breeding non migratory female monarch butterfly movement and egg laying on an iowa usa landscape our model employs a unique movement algorithm when monarch agents encounter habitat edges that incorporates monarch perceptual range to their host plant and spatial memory of previously visited habitat these behavioral factors are rarely incorporated into animal movement algorithms however they can influence estimates of resource utilization model exploration assessed the distribution and density of eggs laid on a spatially explicit 148 665 ha landscape comprised of 17 land cover classes with varying milkweed densities uncertainty analysis was undertaken by sampling 25 combinations of perceptual range spatial memory flight step length and flight directionality parameters from a total of 256 44 possible combinations movement paths simulated with our new movement algorithm show preferential use of high density milkweed areas that would not be simulated using a correlated random walk increasing perceptual range caused a decrease in the area used by monarch agents and caused a skewed egg distribution where most eggs were laid in relatively few habitat patches increasing spatial memory caused an increase in the area used but decreased the median number of eggs laid in roadside habitat current national and regional monarch conservation goals assume a uniform distribution of milkweed in different land cover classes translating these goals into spatially explicit heterogeneous habitat patches is essential for predicting realized fecundity in the landscape our model provides the foundation to link national and regional monarch conservation goals to fine scale spatial configurations of habitat

introduction the north american eastern population of the monarch butterfly danaus plexippus has declined by 80 over the past two decades semmens et al 2016 increasing summer reproductive success in the midwest united states has been identified as a high priority for monarch conservation oberhauser et al 2017 flockhart et al 2015 monarch butterflies oviposit only on milkweed species mainly asclepias spp and primarily common milkweed asclepias syriaca in the midwest malcolm et al 1993 to increase monarch populations to level that would reduce the probability of quasi extinction by 50 over 20 years pleasants 2017 and thogmartin et al 2017 estimated that 1 3 1 6 billion additional milkweed stems need to be added to the u s midwest the current amount of common milkweed stems in the midwest is estimated to be approximately 1 3 billion the majority of which is in publically owned grasslands land enrolled in conservation programs such as the united states department of agriculture s conservation reserve program crp road right of ways rows which are the strips of public or private property along both sides of roads that are maintained by government transportation agencies and or private landowners and miscellaneous non agricultural habitat pleasants and oberhauser 2013 pleasants 2017 thogmartin et al 2017 analyses by thogmartin et al 2017 indicate that adding 1 3 1 6 billion new milkweed stems in the midwest can only be achieved through extensive adoption of habitat restoration in primarily privately owned land in agricultural landscapes consequently establishment of milkweed and forage plants in rural roadsides marginal crop land portions of existing crp land pastures and grassland and grassy areas bordering crop fields will create a patchwork of habitat within agricultural landscapes dominated by corn and soybean production since the monarch butterfly is a vagile species that can travel up to 15 km d zalucki et al 2016 female monarch flight and ovipositing patterns and resulting egg densities in theoretical landscapes vary with different arrangements of habitat patches even though the total amount of added habitat is held constant zalucki and lammers 2010 zalucki et al 2016 because monarch reproduction is expected to be a function of both the amount and spatial arrangement of existing and new habitat the means to predict movement and egg distribution in a spatially explicit context is critical to understanding the strengths and limitations of conservation planning scenarios for states in the u s midwest agent based modeling is well suited to address the effects of different spatially explicit landscape configurations on animal population dynamics deangelis and mooij 2005 grimm et al 2005 railsback et al 2006 railsback and grimm 2011 building on previous experience with agent based modeling of monarchs in a theoretical landscape zalucki et al 2016 and helicoverpa spp in explicit australian agricultural landscapes parry et al 2017 we have developed a spatially explicit agent based model for non migratory female monarch butterfly movement and egg laying in an iowa usa landscape the model incorporates decision and directional based random walk flight algorithms when the habitat is homogeneous monarch agents move in a correlated random walk corresponding to the directional movement described by zalucki and kitching 1982b in iowa many of these homogeneous areas are corn and soybean fields that are largely devoid of milkweed grasslands and pastures are also large homogeneous areas without discrete internal habitat edges but they may have substantial milkweed populations in these homogeneous areas wild monarch butterflies have been observed to turn more often zalucki and kitching 1982b we model flight patterns in different homogeneous habitat types using different assumptions of directionality higher directionality values create straighter movement paths and lower directionality values create more tortuous movement paths correlated random walk algorithms are reasonable for modeling animal movement jones 1977 kareiva and shigesada 1983 zalucki 1983 bovet and benhamou 1988 turchin 1998 in some situations and especially in homogeneous environments codling et al 2008 smouse et al 2010 but in heterogeneous environments movement algorithms that include interactions of the animal with the environment are often needed johnson et al 1992 codling et al 2008 wallentin 2017 for decision based flight at discrete habitat edges in heterogeneous environments our model uses a unique random walk movement algorithm that incorporates monarch perceptual range and spatial memory these behavioral factors are rarely incorporated into animal movement algorithms siniff and jessen 1969 smouse et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 however the need to elucidate how these behaviors can influence resource utilization on the landscape has long been recognized lima and zollner 1996 mueller and fagan 2008 mueller et al 2011 and is a growing area of research in landscape ecology turner and gardner 2015 and spatially explicit individual based modeling wallentin 2017 smouse et al 2010 perceptual range is the distance at which animals can detect and respond to resources such as host plants or food resources lima and zollner 1996 perceptual range can have a substantial effect on animal movement as animals cannot react to resources they cannot detect spatial memory is the ability of organisms to remember locations they have previously visited and subsequently avoid or revisit smouse et al 2010 moorcroft 2012 perceptual range and spatial memory likely have a strong effect on the distribution of monarch eggs on the landscape perceptual range in monarch butterflies includes olfactory and visual sensory inputs garlick 2007 visual perceptual range is likely only a few meters garlick 2007 however field observations indicate that olfactory perceptual range for nectar sources could extend hundreds of meters dr orley taylor pers comm depending on the strength of the odor wind speed and direction of the odor plume cardé and willis 2008 observations reported by fisher et al 2017 suggest that olfactory perceptual range in monarch butterflies is 50 to 75 m while monarchs likely have spatial memory the mechanisms and spatial scale of their memory is unclear male butterflies patrol milkweed patches or nectar sources waiting for females zalucki and kitching 1982b suggesting they recognize their patches female butterflies however move extensively among habitat patches zalucki and lammers 2010 and references cited therein memory capabilities are well known in some insects such as honey bees hammer and menzel 1995 and learning behavior in butterflies lewis 1986 and moths cunningham et al 1999 has been documented monarch butterflies learn associations between color and nectar sources blackiston et al 2011 and can remember these associations for up to three days rodrigues and weiss 2012 by incorporating decisional and directional movement in our agent based model we evaluate the following hypotheses 1 greater directionality in poor habitat results in more eggs laid on the landscape as monarch agents spend less time in poor habitat and conversely less directionality in good habitat results in more eggs laid as monarch agents spend more time in good habitat 2 as perceptual range increases there is an associated increase in the number of eggs laid on the landscape because females are better able to find oviposition habitat 3 with longer term spatial memory of previously visited milkweed patches female monarchs will have a greater area of habitat utilization and lay fewer eggs since they spend more time searching for new habitat patches we employ uncertainty analysis of the parameters used for perceptual range spatial memory directionality and step length to determine the effect of parameter assumptions on model outputs marino et al 2008 uncertainty analysis provides insight into plausible values for these parameters and the design of future experimental and observational studies to improve understanding of the role these behavioral elements play in monarch movement and egg laying in fragmented landscapes 2 methods in our model each monarch agent behaves autonomously and interacts with habitat patches to probabilistically choose a direction to move and where to lay eggs our model advances the work of zalucki et al 2016 and parry et al 2017 by incorporating a novel movement algorithm in their movement algorithm agents choose between two adjacent habitat patches and perceptual range was simulated as either 5 or 25 m however monarch butterflies likely have a perceptual range of 75 400 m 50 400 m fisher et al 2017 orley taylor pers comm and thus in heterogeneous landscapes with small habitat patches more than two habitat patches will likely be within range and the model described here allows agents to choose between any habitat patches within their perceptual range other modifications to the movement algorithm include varying directionality according to habitat quality and incorporating spatial memory of recently visited habitat patches whereas zalucki et al 2016 used a simulated model landscape we model monarch butterfly movement and egg laying on a spatially explicit landscape we describe our model for monarch butterfly movement and egg laying in story county iowa following the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 the model is implemented in the repast simphony 2 3 1 platform using the java programming language north et al 2013 see supplemental material a 2 1 model purpose the purpose is to model monarch butterfly movement and egg laying on a spatially explicit iowa usa landscape to better understand the effects of landscape composition and configuration on the distribution of adult female monarchs and their eggs with the long term goal to support evaluation of alternative conservation strategies our purpose here is to explore how uncertainty in monarch perceptual range spatial memory and directionality affect the number of eggs laid on the landscape and the habitat patches in which eggs are laid to motivate further research to refine understanding of monarch movement ecology 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model agents represent individual female monarch butterflies monarch agents move around the landscape laying eggs using a programmed movement algorithm monarch agent movement is simulated over 10 days the approximate egg laying lifespan of an adult female monarch the model is divided into time steps of one day and within each day monarch agents move a defined number of movement steps the initial state of a monarch agent is at a random location in the study area and they hold 410 eggs that can be laid over 10 days monarch agent movement and egg laying decisions are based on interactions with habitat patches habitat patches are delineated in a geographic information system gis as monarch agents interact with the landscape they make decisions to move toward patches based on the characteristics of the patch they currently occupy and other patches they can perceive the model was implemented for story county iowa an area of 148 665 ha 1486 65 km2 fig 1 we ran 25 simulations each with a different combination of parameter values table 2 values were sampled across the range of uncertainty for each parameter in each simulation we used 10 000 monarch agents an estimate of female monarch density obtained from a panel of experts see acknowledgements for the experts consulted 2 2 1 land cover patches we classified the landscape into 17 land cover categories based on relative homogeneity and available data table 1 we created an arcgis polygon shapefile of land cover for import into repast simphony using the 2014 crop data layer cdl 30 m resolution usda 2014 for story county iowa usa we created eight land cover categories corn soybeans forest medium high intensity development low intensity development developed open space grass pasture open water barren landscapes and wetlands we then converted the raster into a shapefile in iowa 12 and 4 of planted corn and soybeans respectively are not glyphosate resistant usda 2015 because non glyphosate resistant corn and soybean fields have a higher density of milkweed pleasants and oberhauser 2013 we randomly selected 12 of the corn and 4 of soybean fields as being planted with non glyphosate resistant crops in iowa roads are found along most public land survey section boundaries resulting in a substantial number of rural roads in the state in story county there are 1536 km of rural roads using a road shapefile we identified all rural roads in the county by excluding roads in urban areas defined according to an urban area shapefile interstate freeways and state highways urban roads interstate freeways and state highways remained in the model as low intensity development as classified in the crop data layer rural road rows are characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of milkweed and milkweed patches hartzler 2010 hartzler pers comm in such a narrow space this heterogeneity is likely to have important effects on monarch agent movement we modelled this heterogeneity as continuous adjacent 50 m square patches along each side of the roads using data from 2010 hartzler 2010 and 2015 hartzler pers comm we created five categories of milkweed density for roads see table 1 railroad rows were represented by buffering a shapefile of the railroad with a 25 m buffer because the step length of the monarch agent is 20 50 m see table 2 we processed the shapefile such that all patches are at least 50 m across in the smallest dimension relative milkweed density among the 17 land cover types was determined from literature sources and experts best professional judgement see acknowledgements a parameter representing milkweed density was assigned to each land cover type table 1 initial values of milkweed density ranged from 0 to 1 but were reduced to 10 of their original value during model calibration see 2 6 the movement algorithm described below uses the milkweed density parameter to determine movement and egg laying decisions relative milkweed density for road rows was determined from 2015 state wide survey data hartzler pers comm pleasants and oberhauser 2013 provide milkweed densities for grasslands pastures and non glyphosate resistance and glyphosate resistant corn and soybeans relative milkweed densities for railroad rows other crops forest and low intensity development were estimated by expert professional judgement the gis shapefile with assigned values of milkweed density was then imported into a repast simphony geographic context the model maintains a running total of the number of eggs laid in each habitat patch 2 3 process overview and scheduling each time step of the model is a day in the life of an egg laying monarch agent within each time step the agents move 5 5 10 km in a sequence of 110 500 movement steps depending on whether the step length is 20 30 40 or 50 m fig 2 agents have opportunities to lay eggs after each step length the egg laying lifespan of captive monarchs varies from 14 to 45 days oberhauser 1997 and averages approximately 28 days depending on temperature zalucki 1981 data on wild monarchs is lacking but they likely have a shorter lifespan zalucki and kitching 1984 monarch agent movement and egg laying is simulated for 10 days see table 2 for monarch parameters on the first day of their egg laying life monarch agents move 10 000 m zalucki et al 2016 movement capacity is thought to decline in lepidoptera as they age e g sappington and burks 2014 consequently the distance they can move each day in the model decreases by 500 m on the 10th day they can move 5500 m consistent with zalucki et al 2016 the number of eggs potentially laid by a female monarch each day decreases over time zalucki 1981 oberhauser 1997 in the model on the first day agents can lay up to 50 eggs starting on day 2 potential eggs laid decreases by two each day and by the last day they can lay 32 eggs consistent with oberhauser 2004 the total possible number of eggs that a monarch agent can lay over 10 days is 410 consistent with urquhart s 1960 reported lifetime fecundity value of 420 eggs and oberhauser s 2004 estimate of 300 400 a movement submodel described in detail in 2 7 incorporates a correlated random walk when only one habitat patch is within perceptual range and a decision based movement when more than one habitat patch is within perceptual range decision based movement includes an algorithm to choose among habitat patches using weighted probabilities of milkweed density and spatial memory finally each agent has a probability of laying eggs in each movement step 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 basic principles the monarch butterfly is a vagile species that moves extensively across the landscape zalucki and kitching 1984 zalucki and lammers 2010 we model non migratory generations that are resident in iowa in july and august monarch butterflies attempt to maximize their fitness by laying eggs in habitat that are most likely to produce adult monarchs monarch agents in the model make movement decisions based on the resources they can perceive on the landscape within their perceptual range and based on which locations they have visited in the past i e spatial memory resource distribution is modelled as habitat patches with varying attractiveness based on milkweed density 2 4 2 emergence the primary emergent outputs are the monarch movement paths and the distribution of eggs on the landscape that arise from the movement behavior of the monarch agents interactions with habitat patches 2 4 3 adaptation monarch agents change their behavior based on milkweed density of habitat patches within their perceptual range they also adapt their movement behavior according to patches they occupied during recent steps 2 4 4 objectives monarch agents objectives are to find oviposition habitat i e patches with milkweed in the fragmented landscape and maximize their fitness by laying eggs in locations most likely to allow growth and development to the adult stage objectives are evaluated by determining the number of eggs laid and how those eggs are distributed on the landscape 2 4 5 learning female monarch agents remember patches they have recently occupied and have a lower probability of returning to those patches 2 4 6 prediction monarch agents do not predict future conditions over the course of their egg laying lifetime 2 4 7 sensing monarch agents are assumed to sense milkweed using olfactory or visual cues bergstrom et al 1994 blackiston et al 2011 garlick 2007 in the model the milkweed density parameter serves as a measure of sensory input 2 4 8 interaction monarch agents do not interact it is conceivable that in nature they interact indirectly by choosing not to lay eggs on milkweed that already have eggs i e a type of density dependence this interaction is not currently incorporated in the model given the limited evidence of this behavior 2 4 9 stochasticity monarch agents choose which patch to move toward according to probabilities calculated for each patch within their perceptual range monarch agents also lay eggs at each movement step as determined by milkweed density monarch agents start at a randomly selected point in the landscape on day 1 2 4 10 observation the model outputs data for habitat patches and monarch agents for habitat patches the model outputs the number of eggs laid in each of the 37 165 patches for each monarch agent the model outputs the number of eggs laid each day the model can output the location latitude and longitude of a monarch agent as x y coordinates at each step to obtain movement trajectories we examined several metrics to describe model behavior and serve as response variables in the uncertainty analysis table 3 we used the x y coordinates of each monarch agent at each step to calculate their habitat utilization distribution which is a metric for how much of the landscape is used worton 1989 this metric can be compared with empirical field data of monarch movement we calculated the area of the utilization distribution for each monarch agent with a dynamic brownian bridge movement model kranstauber et al 2012 using the r package move kranstauber and smolla 2016 we used a 30 m raster thus our utilization distribution estimate is the sum of all 30 30 m raster cells occupied by a monarch agent we calculated the mean proportion of potential eggs laid per monarch agent on day five we calculated median egg density per patch for two habitat types grass pasture and road rows with the most milkweed road row mw 60 100 m 2 we chose these two habitat types for closer examination after evaluating behavior across all habitat types grass pasture patches are medium in size are distributed somewhat randomly across the landscape and have a high density of milkweed pleasants and oberhauser 2013 road rows are considered to be an important habitat component kasten et al 2016 because of their overall large area and connectivity across the state road row patches are generally small but regularly distributed across the landscape and adjacent to other road row patches finally we looked at total cumulative eggs laid in the entire landscape and in the high density road patches and grass pasture patches because of uncertainty in parameter estimates for monarch agents we examine only the relative number of eggs laid per land cover type rather than the absolute number of eggs laid 2 5 initialization the model is initialized by randomly placing the monarch agents across story county for the uncertainty analysis 10 000 monarch agents were used except for the utilization distribution analysis see below for which 1000 agents were used an exploratory study indicated that 10 000 agents was a sufficient sample size for egg density analyses for example two simulations with 10 000 agents with the same parameterization step length 30 perceptual range 50 remembered patches 0 and directionality 0 5 0 75 resulted in a difference of 0 04 in the cumulative eggs laid in the study area 2 744 170 vs 2 743 108 and a correlation of 0 97 for eggs laid in the 37 165 individual patches 2 6 input data the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels in the movement submodel the monarch agents random walk is programmed as a series of steps monarch agents choose a heading 0 360 move the distance of the step length in that direction choose a new heading from their new location move the next step and so on wild monarchs lay eggs singly as they move across the landscape zalucki and kitching 1982a but the rate at which they lay eggs is unclear and likely varies with milkweed density one of us mpz collected data on eight monarchs in florida in 1987 in a diffuse patch of milkweed in a pasture monarchs were followed from milkweed to milkweed as they laid eggs mean egg laying rate was 0 012 eggs m sd 0 006 or about 1 egg per 82 m sd 25 4 a straight step length in the model may represent a more convoluted path of a wild monarch consequently we assumed that monarchs lay 2 eggs per step length if it chooses to lay eggs on that step because egg laying rate is poorly known we make inferences about relative egg densities and postpone inference on absolute egg densities until additional experimental data and or field observations are available the egg laying rate is held constant hence step length serves as a surrogate of egg laying rate our uncertainty analysis evaluates this model assumption agents determine the heading on which to move by evaluating the landscape fig 3 agents have a perceptual range assumed to represent the distance that they can detect milkweed plants through olfactory or visual cues bergstrom et al 1994 garlick 2007 rodrigues and weiss 2012 wild monarchs likely use olfaction for long range detection of milkweed and visual cues at short distances garlick 2007 the agents field of perception is 360 under the assumption that they can detect odor plumes from any direction at each step agents query the modelled landscape and determine how many patches are within the perceptual range if no other patches are within the perceptual range other than the currently occupied patch the agent moves in a correlated random walk in a correlated random walk the heading that the agent moves is determined by a change to the current heading by θ radians the change in heading θ is determined by the formula 1 θ π r 1 d where r is a random number between 0 and 1 chosen by a random number generator and d is the directionality parameter that ranges from 0 to 1 high directionality e g 0 9 causes the agent to move in nearly straight lines and low directionality e g 0 1 causes the agent to move in nearly random directions resulting in very tortuous movement paths we assume directionality increases as habitat quality decreases zalucki and kitching 1982b zalucki 1983 thus directionality for an agent is dependent on the habitat it occupies at each step the monarch agent queries the milkweed density of the current patch and calculates directionality according to eq 2 2 d c u r r e n t d m a x m d d m a x d m i n 0 09 where dcurrent is the directionality for the current patch d max is the maximum possible directionality d min is the minimum possible directionality md is the milkweed density parameter queried from the current patch and the range of milkweed density values in the study area is 0 09 as an example if directionality was set to a range of 0 5 0 75 directionality was 0 5 in the best habitat md 0 09 and increased linearly to 0 75 in the poorest habitat md 0 if more than one patch is detected within the perceptual range the agent must choose which patch to move toward i e decisional flight monarch agents are assumed to have a higher probability of moving toward patches with higher milkweed density based on laboratory and greenhouse studies suggesting that increased number of milkweed plants result in an increased intensity of olfactory and or visual cues bergstrom et al 1994 rodrigues and weiss 2012 garlick 2007 monarch agent attractiveness to a patch is based on the milkweed density parameter after adjustments an attractiveness probability is calculated for each patch within the perceptual range in a two step process in the first step the milkweed density parameter for each patch is scaled according to the area of the patch within perceptual range the model calculates the area of each patch within the perceptual range i e the area of overlap between the perceptual range and the landscape patches and multiplies that area by the milkweed density parameter for example if a patch covers 50 of the perceived area of the monarch agent and the milkweed density parameter for that patch is 0 1 the scaled attractiveness probability 0 5 0 1 0 05 this adjustment controls for the fact that the more area of a patch is within the perceptual range there is a greater likelihood of more milkweed providing olfactory and or visual cues increasing its attractiveness without this function very small patches with high milkweed density are nearly exclusively chosen by the monarch agents simulations not shown which is not consistent with field observations that indicate the monarch is a vagile species zalucki and kitching 1982b zalucki and suzuki 1987 ries and debinski 2001 zalucki and lammers 2010 attractiveness probability is next adjusted based on the monarch agent s interaction with the patch in recent steps it is assumed monarchs have spatial memory blackiston et al 2011 rodrigues and weiss 2012 and have a lower probability of returning to small patches previously visited and evaluated for oviposition potential and thus more likely to visit habitat not yet evaluated this behavior is realized by saving a list of the most recently visited patches the size of the list corresponds to the spatial memory parameter if spatial memory 10 identification numbers of the last 10 patches visited are saved in the list which may all be the same patch if it is a large area of habitat at each step the identification number of the patch occupied by the agent is added to the top of the list and the identification number of the oldest patch is dropped from the list when choosing among patches within the perceptual range each patch is checked against the list and the probability of moving toward a patch is reduced if it is on the list under the assumption that monarchs remember relatively small patches on the landscape better than large patches we reduce the effect of remembering patches as a function of patch area the remembered probability is reduced by a scalar generated using the logistic eq 3 as 3 1 1 e 2 a 0 92 where a is the area of the patch fig 4 using this equation patches above approximately 3 ha have a scalar of nearly 1 and thus have a negligible effect when calculating attractiveness patches at the smallest size of approximately 0 25 ha have a scalar of 0 18 thus there is a strong effect for small patches which have the attractiveness probability reduced to 18 of its initial value when the milkweed density parameter has been adjusted by area and memory to calculate the final attractiveness probability for each patch the adjusted probabilities which constitute a multinomial distribution are normalized to sum to 1 a random number from 0 to 1 then determines which patch is chosen when the patch is chosen the model performs a query to determine the heading to the point of the patch nearest the monarch agent the monarch then moves on that heading for the distance of one step length if the monarch agent chooses the patch it currently occupies it moves in a correlated random walk after the monarch agent moves the cumulative distance moved that day is updated if the cumulative distance moved is the maximum daily distance the monarch ends movement for that day 2 8 model calibration model parameterization and calibration involves optimizing parameters such that the model gives more realistic results thiele et al 2014 in the case of monarch butterflies our information is limited zalucki 1983 estimated that approximately 50 of potential eggs were laid each day which was supported by limited field data therefore we calibrated the milkweed density parameter to values that resulted in approximately half of available eggs being laid each day our original estimates of the relative egg densities elicited from our experts were scaled to be between 0 and 1 calibration resulted in the original values being reduced by 90 table 1 2 9 computational resources we ran simulations on the yeti computer cluster operated by the advanced research computing facility of the united states geological survey denver co and on a 32 core machine on the iowa state university campus each simulation takes from 0 25 to over 12 h depending on the parameterization this is largely due to the high resolution large scale spatial dataset used and thus a large number of habitat patches iterated and stored in memory code profiling revealed that the most computationally intensive operations were calculation of the area of overlap of the perceptual range buffer and the habitat patches 2 10 analysis we begin with a comparison of graphical output of movement paths under a variety of parameterization scenarios visual inspection of model output is an important aspect of model evaluation bennett et al 2013 and in our case provides important insight into movement patterns because observations of monarch flight at the spatial scales simulated in the model are not available in the scientific literature we asked five experts in monarch butterfly behavior to independently evaluate the simulated movement patterns see acknowledgements the experts provided opinions as to which panels in fig 5 best represent female monarch movement paths as well as the characteristics of the movement paths that formed the basis of their opinion subsequently we estimated the egg density in habitat patches in a subset of story county including estimates of the proportion of eggs laid in each land cover type because of the uncertainty in some parameters we examine the distribution of the proportion of eggs laid in each land cover type across all 25 parameter combinations as described below global uncertainty analysis marino et al 2008 thiele et al 2014 was used to investigate responses of model outputs utilization distribution mean proportion of eggs laid per agent on day five median egg density per grass pasture patch median egg density per road rows total eggs laid in grass pasture patches total eggs laid in road rows and total eggs laid in the study area to uncertainty in four monarch parameters perceptual range spatial memory directionality and step length this analysis provides insight into how these factors affect movement and egg laying of monarch agents step length has important effects on model outputs for example the number of eggs laid per meter moved depends on step length because we kept the number of eggs laid per step constant i e two eggs are laid at the end of each step assuming the agent choses to lay eggs regardless of step length consequently smaller step lengths should result in a larger number of eggs laid per meter four values were evaluated per parameter see table 3 which results in 256 44 possible parameter combinations for the uncertainty analysis twenty five parameter combinations were selected using latin hypercube sampling mckay and beckman 1979 r package lhs perceptual range spatial memory and step length were treated as continuous variables directionality was treated as a categorical variable and considered in four scenarios for each scenario directionality varied from dmin the minimum directionality that occurs in good habitat to dmax the maximum directionality that occurs in poor habitat the four scenarios were low directionality in good habitat dmin 0 1 and poor habitat dmax 0 2 low directionality in good habitat dmin 0 1 and high directionality in poor habitat dmax 0 9 an intermediate scenario dmin 0 5 and dmax 0 75 and high directionality in good habitat dmin 0 8 and poor habitat dmax 0 9 as discussed previously the model incorporates a correlated random walk in patches outside the monarch agents perceptual range and a decision based movement algorithm when two or more different habitat patches are adjoined within the perceptual range the outcome of the decision based movement algorithm is dependent on assumptions of perceptual range and spatial memory an uncertainty analysis including a null assumption that perceptual range is 0 m was not included given the literature see 2 4 7 that documents monarchs do perceive milkweed and nectar sources through visual and olfactory cues however a null assumption of no spatial memory was included in the uncertainty analysis given the more tenuous nature of the best available experimental data simulation results were analyzed using a linear multiple regression meta model thiele et al 2014 exploratory analyses indicated that a multiple regression approach was sufficient because the relationships between model output variables and monarch parameters were generally linear i e r2 was above 0 7 which is the cutoff recommended by saltelli et al 2004 2008 we report the amount of variation in the response variable explained by each parameter using a sensitivity index saltelli et al 2004 2008 sensitivity si for parameter i is calculated as 4 s i s s i s s t where sst is the total sum of squares and ssi is the sum of squares for parameter i when it is first in the model regression coefficients and graphs of predicted response variables are provided in the supplementary materials c because the parameters are non orthogonal the order of variables in the linear regression affects the direction of the regression coefficients consequently the four predictor variables were added to the model using a stepwise algorithm using package stepaic in r with lowest aic variables added first 3 results simulated movement behavior of monarch butterflies are depicted in fig 5 under all 25 model parameter combinations we found that the simulated monarch agents spent their time in areas with high milkweed density such as road rows with occasional forays into agricultural fields where milkweed was modelled as rare or non existent a correlated random walk alone in which monarch agents do not respond to land cover types would not replicate these movement paths four of the five expert panelists considered panel c to be the best representation of monarch movement paths while one panelist considered panel a to be the best parameterization all of our panelists generally cited similar rationale for choosing c or a female monarch butterflies move long distances across the landscape do not stay in one habitat patch for long and are a vagile species that disperses their eggs widely the amount of time monarch agents spent in agricultural fields and how far they moved across the landscape was affected by the parameter values see fig 5a f with a long perceptual range 400 m the monarch agent remained at the cluster of patches at a road intersection and failed to leave that cluster fig 5b whereas with a 50 m perceptual range the monarch agent moved more widely fig 5b agents with longer term spatial memory 100 patches remembered formed less dense clusters of movement in road rows fig 5b relative to those with fewer patches remembered 10 patches remembered fig 5a longer term spatial memory resulted in monarch agents more readily leaving a location and finding higher quality habitat not previously visited although longer term spatial memory 100 remembered patches allows a monarch agent to occasionally leave clusters of patches at road intersections large perceptual range 400 m results in the agent utilizing much less of the landscape fig 5d as compared to an agent with a shorter perceptual range 50 m fig 4a fig 5d when directionality is high in poor habitat 0 9 fig 5e the agent movement path is more linear as compared to tortuous movement paths with low directionality in poor habitat 0 02 fig 5f the land cover types that accumulated the most eggs in the model across all 25 parameter combinations were road rows grassland pasture and non glyphosate resistant corn fig 6 7 the proportion of eggs laid in rows 19 49 was highly variable across simulations indicating that more precise values for perceptual range and spatial memory would reduce variability in quantifying use of rows grassland and pastures have the next highest accumulated eggs varying from 24 to 42 of eggs laid non glyphosate resistant corn constitutes 12 of the corn fields and is assumed to have relatively good higher milkweed density consistent with 15 34 of eggs being laid in these patches all other habitats accumulate relatively few eggs 3 1 effect of varying perceptual range on monarch movement and egg laying perceptual range had an important effect on how monarch agents move and how eggs were distributed across the landscape table 4 except for step length which is a model construct perceptual range explained more of the variance in utilization distribution median egg density in road rows and median egg density in grass pasture than spatial memory or directionality larger perceptual ranges resulted in monarch agents failing to move from groups of patches with high milkweed density resulting in smaller utilization distributions see supplementary material b and c a small perceptual range resulted in a higher median egg density in road rows as well as more evenly distributed eggs in these patches fig 8 with a large perceptual range median egg density was lower because eggs accumulated in a few patches and many patches had few or no eggs fig 8 median egg density decreased in both road row and grass pasture habitat as perceptual range increased though more so in road rows supplementary material b and c the proportion of eggs laid and total eggs laid in road rows grass pastures and the full study area were largely unaffected by changes in perceptual range contrary to our hypothesis supplementary material b and c in summary perceptual range affected where eggs were laid on the landscape but not the cumulative total number of eggs 3 2 effect of varying the spatial memory on monarch movement and egg laying spatial memory was the most important factor affecting the total eggs laid in road rows other than step length table 4 longer spatial memory decreased the total number of eggs laid in road rows consistent with our hypothesis see supplementary material b and c spatial memory explained 10 18 of variation in utilization distribution proportion of eggs laid median egg density in grass pasture and total eggs laid in the study area spatial memory explained very little of the variation in total eggs laid in grass pasture increasing spatial memory increased the area of the utilization distribution consistent with our hypothesis supplementary material b and c longer term spatial memory also decreased the proportion of eggs laid the total eggs laid in the study area and the median egg density in grass pasture supplementary material b and c 3 3 effect of varying directionality on monarch movement and egg laying directionality explained 40 44 of variation in proportion of eggs laid total eggs laid in grass pasture and total eggs laid in the study area table 4 when directionality was low 0 1 in good habitat monarch agents stayed longer in grass pasture habitat and laid more eggs thus increasing the values of the above mentioned output parameters supplementary material b and c directionality explained 18 of the variation in utilization distribution area high directionality in poor habitat increased the area of the utilization distribution as monarch agents moved farther from places they had been especially those areas without milkweed such glyphosate resistant corn and soybean fields supplementary material b and c directionality had the smallest effect on egg density in road rows and total eggs laid in road rows table 4 higher directionality in good and poor habitat increased median egg density in road rows and total eggs in road rows to some degree supplementary material b and c likely because agents moving in straighter movement paths were more likely to find a road row 3 4 effect of varying step length on model output step length explained the largest proportion of variation in all response variables except median egg density in road rows and median egg density in grass pasture table 4 longer step lengths increased the area of the utilization distribution but decreased all other response variables supplementary material b and c longer step lengths lead to farther movement increasing the area of the utilization distribution but longer step lengths meant fewer opportunities to lay eggs decreasing all other response variables 4 discussion perceptual range is implicitly included in many individual based models as the local area with which an agent may interact wallentin 2017 but spatial heterogeneity of habitat within that perceptual range as we have modelled here has rarely been included in individual based models our results show that perceptual range and spatial memory can be critical input parameters lima and zollner 1996 called for increased attention to the impacts of animal behavior at the landscape scale and wallentin 2017 specifically called for more attention to spatial structure as a constraint on animal movement in spatial simulation studies we found that perceptual range in particular has a dramatic effect on how monarch agents move and lay eggs on the landscape perceptual range in monarch butterflies as with most phytophagous insects is poorly understood garlick 2007 cardé and willis 2008 but has important implications for model behavior when perceptual range was large the model estimated that monarch agents have a much smaller utilization distribution and lay eggs in relatively few habitat patches with a small perceptual range eggs are more evenly distributed on the landscape monarch butterflies are a vagile species zalucki and kitching 1984 ries and debinski 2001 zalucki and lammers 2010 and our modelled movements with a smaller perceptual ranges are consistent with such behavior experimental determination of perceptual range up to several 100 m in free ranging monarch butterflies will aid in refining this model input increasing spatial memory can influence monarch agent movement but the effect is most apparent at fine scales the habitat in road rows is comprised of relatively small patches as a result monarch agents can avoid a patch visited in recent steps which results in lowered egg densities in road rows as spatial memory increases see supplemental material b and c in larger grass pasture patches which have an intermediate milkweed density value and in which several steps can be required to leave a patch there is no decline in total eggs in grass pasture patches as spatial memory increases see supplemental material b and c and a marginal trend of lower egg density supplemental material b and c this response may reflect that while monarch agents remember a large grassland pasture patch visited in previous steps once back in the patch it may take numerous steps before they depart a large area with a moderate milkweed density our model does not currently include spatially explicit placement of high density milkweed patches within the grass pasture patches because there is no systematically collected data available on milkweed patch sizes stem densities and spatial distributions for this land cover class collection of field survey data on milkweed patch characteristics within larger land cover classes such as grass pasture would permit an evaluation of the extent to which estimated total eggs or egg density in a large patch is sensitive to spatial memory of explicitly located high density milkweed patches our results showed that different model parameterizations had little effect on the total number of eggs laid in story county even though the monarch agents exhibited a diversity of complex movements and associated egg density patterns in the landscape the finding that total eggs laid did not significantly vary may be related to the observation that random walk models approximate a diffusion process at some scales and with large sample sizes turchin 1998 codling et al 2008 while diffusion models can play an important role in quantitative movement analysis turchin 1998 in our case a diffusion approximation would obscure movement and egg distribution patterns that have implications in predicting population responses for example higher rates of parasitism and predation likely occur in patches with high monarch and or milkweed densities zalucki and kitching 1982c bartel et al 2011 stenoien et al 2016 thus it is critical to predict where eggs will be laid in the landscape as well as how many eggs will be laid to fully inform conservation benefits and risks of different habitat restoration scenarios directionality had the greatest effect on the mean proportion of eggs laid the total eggs laid in the study area and total eggs laid in grass pasture less directionality in good habitat resulted in more eggs laid overall likely because monarch agents executed more steps in grass pasture patches and therefore laid more eggs field observations indicate that directionality is higher for monarchs in poor habitat straighter flight patterns and lower more tortuous patterns in good habitat zalucki and kitching 1982b zalucki 1983 step length is a discrete representation of a continuous process turchin 1998 and thus has an effect on model results we found that step length affected the total eggs laid in grass pastures road rows and the county because the egg laying rate number of eggs laid per m was different with different step lengths the sensitivity of the model to step length will be an important issue to address when attempting to estimate absolute numbers of eggs laid egg laying rate can easily be fixed as a constant rate per m independent of step length similar to the model of parry et al 2017 but empirical data is needed to determine monarch egg laying rates in different land cover types nail et al 2015 reported an average of 0 043 eggs per milkweed or 1 egg per 23 milkweed in the sites they surveyed but such data is not easily converted to an egg laying rate additional empirical data is needed to reasonably estimate egg laying rate in a variety of land cover types with different milkweed densities regardless of egg laying rate step length also affected the utilization distribution to control for the effect of step length on utilization distribution future versions of the model could refine the movement algorithm movement decisions could be based on habitat evaluations that occur at a constant rate that is independent of the step length currently decisions are made at the end of each step length alternatively a variable step length could be drawn from a distribution derived from empirical observations of distances traveled in set time periods zalucki and kitching 1982b found natural monarch step lengths to be auto correlated another consideration for precise modeling of step lengths systematic observational data of wild monarchs flight steps in a variety of iowa and midwestern landscapes would provide the information needed to ascertain the extent to which future model calibration or refinement is needed the landscape we evaluated has patches of vastly different sizes which has implications for model behavior for example modeling monarch movement in the narrow but abundant road row habitat is critical a correlated random walk would not capture monarch movement well in such a long narrow habitat further the road rows are quite heterogeneous in milkweed density with patches of various sizes scattered throughout hartzler 2010 kasten et al 2016 because of the long narrow nature of the road row habitat it was necessary to model this heterogeneity as a grid corn and soybean fields on the other hand are highly homogeneous habitat and a correlated random walk is likely adequate for modeling movement in these patches grassland and pastures have more heterogeneity than corn fields but because they are typically in larger blocks a correlated random walk appears adequate to model movement as discussed previously empirical data is needed to better quantify and model heterogeneity within grass pasture habitat coordinating experimental studies with the development of mathematical models can provide an efficient means to advance knowledge restif et al 2012 in this case development of the model and evaluation of its outputs identified areas of additional research that would help reduce uncertainty in assigning attributes to monarch agents i e perceptual range spatial memory step length land cover patches e g milkweed density in different land cover classes and model outputs e g egg densities in multiple habitat patches in adjoining land cover classes for example while kasten et al 2016 found increasing monarch egg density with increasing milkweed density in rows consistent with model predictions to more fully evaluate the model s predictions requires egg density data sets in adjoining land cover classes and at a spatial scale similar to that used in the model large scale monitoring programs for monarchs and milkweed which are being designed and piloted e g mjv 2016 may provide the needed information in particular milkweed density and egg density estimates from a statistically rigorous sampling scheme for the land cover types in our model comparing experimental or field survey data to model outputs is however not the only approach to evaluate uncertainty in physical and mathematical models wallentin 2017 batty and torrens 2005 as noted previously additional experimental research can advance fundamental understanding of monarch behavior and in turn advance the mechanistic basis of the model s movement algorithm our uncertainty analysis establishes high priority areas of additional research that include improved understanding of perceptual range and spatial memory the effect of landscape configuration on egg density in individual patches also needs to be evaluated in future modeling and empirical studies model results indicated some patches that have identical size shape and milkweed density have varying egg densities this varying egg density is likely a function of the landscape configuration of surrounding patches various measures of landscape configuration and composition have been developed comprehensive modeling and field surveys are needed to identify factors that render some habitat patches better egg laying sites than others model results to date inform several hypotheses about how landscape configuration factors might affect egg density for example the distance of a habitat patch to a road row seems likely to affect the ability of monarchs to find the patch employing a proximity index i e the amount of habitat within a certain distance of a patch may provide some insights gustafson and parker 1992 because of the extensive pattern of corridors and isolation of individual patches that are not road rows an analysis of connectivity may provide insights kindlmann and burel 2008 a sound understanding of the effect of landscape configuration will maximize habitat restoration effectiveness by providing the information necessary to create habitat patches that will attract high egg density conservation planning is typically made in the face of uncertainty polasky et al 2018 formulation of habitat restoration options to support monarch butterfly conservation is no exception based on correlations of trends in estimated milkweed stems in the north central u s to estimated annual overwintering monarch populations habitat conservation goals expressed as the number of new milkweed stems have been proposed at the county level assuming a uniform distribution of stems in different land cover classes thogmartin et al 2017 rohweder and thogmartin 2015 translating these goals into explicit landscapes with habitat patches of varying quality and in different spatial patterns is needed to predict realized fecundity based on current and future conservation management practices our simulation of female monarch movement which assumes spatial memory and subsequent egg laying in a spatially explicit agricultural landscape in the north central u s suggests establishment of a relatively large number of small habitat patches dispersed at distances within the monarch s perceptual range will result in greater realized fecundity and subsequent adult recruitment rather than establishment of a smaller number of large habitat patches that are dispersed at distances beyond the perceptual range the model presented here provides context to prioritize experimental studies to reduce uncertainty in monarch movement behavior and to formulate landscape scale survey designs to assess monarch habitat utilization the modeling framework can also contribute to decision support tools needed by county state or regional planning groups exploring the relative benefits of different conservation strategies for enhancing habitat in different land cover classes our model provides the foundation to help address challenging monarch butterfly conservation management issues by linking broad scale goals to fine scale spatial configuration of milkweed patches acknowledgments we thank john pleasants iowa

25312,monitoring animal populations is central to wildlife and fisheries management and the use of n mixture models toward these efforts has markedly increased in recent years nevertheless relatively little work has evaluated estimator performance when basic assumptions are violated moreover diagnostics to identify when bias in parameter estimates from n mixture models is likely is largely unexplored we simulated count data sets using 837 combinations of detection probability number of sample units number of survey occasions and type and extent of heterogeneity in abundance or detectability we fit poisson n mixture models to these data quantified the bias associated with each combination and evaluated if the parametric bootstrap goodness of fit gof test can be used to indicate bias in parameter estimates we also explored if assumption violations can be diagnosed prior to fitting n mixture models in doing so we propose a new model diagnostic which we term the quasi coefficient of variation qcv n mixture models performed well when assumptions were met and detection probabilities were moderate i e 0 3 and the performance of the estimator improved with increasing survey occasions and sample units however the magnitude of bias in estimated mean abundance with even slight amounts of unmodeled heterogeneity was substantial the parametric bootstrap gof test did not perform well as a diagnostic for bias in parameter estimates when detectability and sample sizes were low the results indicate the qcv is useful to diagnose potential bias and that potential bias associated with unidirectional trends in abundance or detectability can be diagnosed using poisson regression this study represents the most thorough assessment to date of assumption violations and diagnostics when fitting n mixture models using the most commonly implemented error distribution unbiased estimates of population state variables are needed to properly inform management decision making therefore we also discuss alternative approaches to yield unbiased estimates of population state variables using similar data types and we stress that there is no substitute for an effective sample design that is grounded upon well defined management objectives keywords abundance count data detection goodness of fit monitoring n mixture model 1 introduction abundance is a population state variable of considerable interest to wildlife and fisheries managers as it is frequently used to inform state dependent decision making williams et al 2002 accordingly natural resource monitoring programs often concentrate on tracking the distribution and abundance of populations within and among landscapes yet a census is rarely if ever executed afield because at least a portion of a population inevitably remain undetected particularly when monitoring rare or elusive species thompson 2004 hence monitoring data need to be corrected for incomplete detection to properly inform management decision making n mixture models represent a class of hierarchical models that are increasingly used to correct monitoring count data by explicitly modeling population level processes along with the underlying detection process royle 2004a this approach models the number of individuals counted c at sample unit i during survey occasion t as binomial random variables c i t b i n o m i a l n i p where ni is abundance at sample unit i and p is detection probability i e the probability of detecting an individual in the population given it is available for detection by treating abundance as an independent random variable generated from a statistical distribution i e poisson negative binomial zero inflated poisson etc the model is able to estimate detection probability perhaps the primary appeal of this approach over alternative abundance estimation techniques such as capture recapture models is that n mixture models only require relatively inexpensive convenient to collect and less invasive spatially and temporally replicated count data of unmarked individuals also explanatory variables that may influence abundance and detection probability can be included using generalized linear models glms extensions to the original parameterization continue to be developed increasing the overall flexibility and usefulness of this approach reviewed in dénes et al 2015 like all estimators n mixture models require a set of assumptions that should be considered prior to fitting the model specifically these models assume population closure i e no immigration emigration births or deaths across replicate survey occasions within a primary occasion i e within a sampling season individuals are not double counted during a single survey occasion individuals are detected independently from each other individual heterogeneity in detection probability is negligible and the data match the distributional assumptions of the model new developments have enabled managers to relax and at times even overcome some of these basic assumptions still it is evident that n mixture models yield imprecise estimates with small sample sizes and unstable estimates when detection probabilities are low royle 2004a mcintyre et al 2012 couturier et al 2013 yamaura 2013 veech et al 2016 barker et al 2017 or when heterogeneity in abundance or detection probability is not modeled kéry and royle 2016 veech et al 2016 but see kéry 2017 diagnostics to identify when parameter estimates from n mixture models are likely to be biased are largely unexplored in practice potential sample size issues can be avoided by monitoring a greater number of sample units or increasing the number of primary occasions e g yamaura et al 2011 furthermore sample size requirements can be evaluated via data simulation nonetheless diagnosing potential problems associated with low detectability and unmodeled heterogeneity in model parameters is much more difficult a common recommendation is to avoid fitting n mixture models when detectability is too low or when there is evidence unmodeled heterogeneity is too high while this recommendation is statistically valid it is of little real value to managers because detection probability is often unknown a priori that is managers typically only have the count data in hand and variation in those data is complicated by heterogeneity in both abundance and detection probability parametric bootstrapping procedures can be implemented as a goodness of fit gof test when fitting models using a maximum likelihood framework presumably allowing managers to evaluate how well the model fits the data yet parametric bootstrapping procedures can suffer from substantial sample error and gof tests for hierarchical models in general are considered underdeveloped and in need of further evaluation kéry and royle 2016 nevertheless although not the original intention and never formally evaluated the parametric bootstrap gof test for n mixture models is often portrayed as assessing the validity in the parameter estimates derived from the models given count data of unmarked individuals are increasingly used to inform management decision making it is imperative that potential biases and diagnostics are thoroughly evaluated here we begin by briefly describing types of heterogeneity that may arise in count data using common sample designs using these scenarios as a foundation we simulate replicated count data across a gradient of detection probability to assess the bias in estimated abundances at various types and extents of unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data we also evaluate the performance of the parametric bootstrap gof test when used to diagnose bias in parameter estimates furthermore we explore the extent to which assumption violations can be diagnosed prior to fitting n mixture models in doing so we propose a new diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates which we term the quasi coefficient of variation hereafter qcv finally we discuss alternative procedures to estimate population state variables that can be implemented using similar monitoring data when assumption violations are suspected but cannot be resolved 2 methods 2 1 general description of the scenarios heterogeneity in count data can arise from process variation i e true variation in abundance and variation in sample error i e variation in the detectability of individuals here we focus on five scenarios that represent common sample designs used to monitor animal populations scenario 1 represents the ideal sample design where all statistical assumptions are met this scenario serves as a baseline and allows for the examination of bias associated with variable detectability scenario 2 represents a sample design in which random heterogeneity in abundance is present this represents a case where individuals enter i e are recruited and immigrate and leave i e die and emigrate the sample units across survey occasions within a primary occasion scenario 3 also represents a case where there is heterogeneity in abundance but the heterogeneity is unidirectional i e decreasing which can occur if survey protocols are invasive i e trap or net captures flipping cover objects rocks logs or cover boards electrofishing etc and individuals leave the sample units or perish after each survey occasion within a primary occasion although we focus on a decrease in abundance here the same patterns in bias can be expected if abundances increase across survey occasions scenario 4 represents a sample design in which random unmodeled heterogeneity in detection probability is present like scenario 2 this can be associated with an assortment of factors but our rationale was to capture a case where explanatory variables that may influence detection probability were omitted such as habitat behavior etc last scenario 5 represents a sample design where detection probability decreases across survey occasions within a primary occasion this pattern could be associated with sample designs that cause individuals to become more vigilant and by extension less detectable after each survey occasion changing environmental conditions that influence detectability i e rain obscuring tracks or feces during sign surveys animal activity patterns that vary in synchrony with the mating season etc again although we focus on a downward trend the same patterns can be expected if detectability increases across survey occasions 2 2 simulating population and monitoring data we simulated population and monitoring count data using the scenarios outlined above as a foundation for each scenario data were simulated across a range in detection probability ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 by 0 2 number of sample units 25 50 or 100 number of survey occasions 3 6 or 12 and type and extent of heterogeneity in true abundance or detection probability see sections 2 2 1 2 2 5 for specific details this resulted in the evaluation of 837 combinations which were each simulated for 1000 iterations within program r r core team 2016 the simulation code is provided in appendix a 2 2 1 scenario 1 for scenario 1 true abundance for each sample unit was generated assuming a poisson process where mean true abundance among sample units λ was randomized by sampling from a uniform distribution ranging from 1 to 50 observation error was then simulated to generate count data using a binomial process we used this same approach when simulating data for scenarios 2 5 except we induced heterogeneity in abundance or detection probability 2 2 2 scenario 2 for scenario 2 we induced random heterogeneity in true abundance specifically we treated the initial true abundance for each sample unit as the mean true abundance and generated a true abundance for each survey occasion by sampling from a gamma distribution using the respective sample unit mean abundance and a desired coefficient of variation c v s d x in true abundance which ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 by 0 1 the randomly generated true abundances were rounded to the nearest individual notably the poisson process can sometimes sample a value of 0 when λ is low in which case a coefficient of variation cannot be calculated therefore when a sample unit had a mean true abundance of 0 the mean true abundance for that sample unit was increased to 1 and λ was recalculated based on the updated values these extents of temporal heterogeneity in abundance are generally less than what is reported for stream dwelling bull trout salvelinus confluentu cv 0 71 1 14 al chokhachy et al 2009 warm water stream fishes cv 0 35 1 57 peterson and rabeni 1995 and metamorph western toads anaxyrus boreas cv 0 58 chelgren et al 2011 2 2 3 scenario 3 for scenario 3 we induced a decline in true abundance across survey occasions that is we treated the initial true abundance for each sample unit as the true abundance during the first survey occasion we then generated true abundance during survey occasion t 1 by sampling from a binomial distribution using the sample unit specific abundance in survey occasion t and a desired probability of remaining in a sample unit i e one minus the probability of leaving a sample unit the probability of leaving a sample unit ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 by 0 1 this range is within the bounds of what has been estimated for animals in the field for example it was estimated that 2 6 28 5 and 11 0 41 7 of bull trout and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss respectively move out of unblocked 50 m sample units when surveying individuals by electrofishing or snorkeling peterson et al 2005 2 2 4 scenario 4 for scenario 4 we incorporated random heterogeneity in detection probability here we treated the initial detection probability as the mean parameter and sampled a detection probability for each survey occasion sample unit combination using a beta distribution and a desired coefficient of variation in detectability which ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 by 0 1 importantly a mean detection probability of 0 9 and a coefficient of variation of 0 4 or 0 5 does not exist therefore these combinations were not included in the simulations again the induced variability in detection probability is well within the variation of capture efficiencies found in the literature high variability in capture efficiency has been documented for foskett speckled dace rhinichthys osculus ssp and borax lake chub gila boraxobius in desert spring systems with small and large sized foskett speckled dace having a 7 1 and 1 5 times lower odds respectively of being captured than medium sized foskett speckled dace in tule marsh habitats and small and large sized borax lake chub having a 2 9 and 2 1 times lower odds respectively of being captured than medium sized borax lake chub in lake habitats peterson et al 2015 in the same study capture probabilities varied markedly across habitat types for foskett speckled dace range for medium size fish on survey occasion 1 0 2 0 5 and borax lake chub range for medium size fish on survey occasion 1 0 18 0 56 furthermore there was an eight fold difference in the odds of capturing adult oregon spotted frog rana pretiosa among ponds chelgren et al 2008 2 2 5 scenario 5 for scenario 5 we induced a decline in detection probability across survey occasions here we treated the initial detection probability as the detection probability during the first survey occasion and estimated detection probability during survey occasion t 1 as p t 1 p t p r e d where p r e d is the reduction in detection probability after each survey occasion and ranged from 1 25 to 2 by 0 25 this variability is also comparable to what has been estimated with field data for instance capture probabilities for bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout o clarki lewisi were 1 15 1 79 and 1 69 1 96 times lower respectively after each successive pass when using a multipass electrofishing removal sample design peterson et al 2004 and the respective capture and recapture probabilities for foskett speckled dace were 2 0 and 2 5 times lower across survey occasions when sampling with minnow traps peterson et al 2015 similarly capture probability for metamorph oregon spotted frogs was 3 45 times higher after their initial capture within a primary occasion duarte et al 2017b 2 3 fitting n mixture models although other parameterizations are available the poisson distribution is the most frequently implemented error distribution for the abundance parameter when fitting n mixture models we fit n mixture models assuming a poisson error distribution for abundance to the 837 000 simulated count data sets within program r using the pcount function from the unmarked package fiske and chandler 2011 preliminary simulations were conducted to ensure the specified k value which represents the maximum possible abundance during the primary occasion did not influence output estimates furthermore a try function was used to catch errors associated with non convergence when fitting the n mixture models the code used to fit the n mixture models is provided in appendix a first we fit intercept models to each data set to evaluate model performance that is no explanatory variables were included on model parameters when exploring patterns in the simulated count data however the results suggested that potential issues associated with unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability can be diagnosed prior to fitting the n mixture model see section 2 5 3 also sources of unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability are sometimes known by managers a priori we were curious if bias associated with this assumption violation can be overcome during analyses through the use of a trend explanatory variable on the detection parameter therefore we also fit poisson n mixture models that included an explanatory variable on detection probability that represented the survey occasion importantly if the data were simulated with only 3 survey occasions the variable was treated as a factor variable otherwise the variable was treated as a continuous variable this increased the number of simulated count data sets to 1197 000 2 4 relative bias to evaluate n mixture model performance we focused on the discrepancy in the estimated mean abundance λ ˆ and the true mean abundance λ that was used to simulate each data set j specifically we estimated relative bias b ˆ as b ˆ j λ ˆ j λ j λ j thus if the relative bias estimate is positive the model overestimated the true mean abundance and if the relative bias estimate is negative the model underestimated the true mean abundance furthermore the relative bias estimate can be interpreted as the percent bias where a relative bias estimate of 0 5 would indicate a 50 overestimate of true mean abundance relative bias estimates were summarized for each of the 1197 combinations of simulated data using the central tendency i e the mean of the 1000 iterations omitting any iterations that did not converge 2 5 diagnostics we evaluated if we could diagnose whether fitting an n mixture model will produce biased estimates using three different approaches all procedures took place within program r using a try function to discard output that contained errors when fitting the models the code used to carry out model diagnostic evaluations is provided in appendix a 2 5 1 parametric bootstrap goodness of fit test we evaluated if the parametric bootstrap gof test was a viable diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates when fitting n mixture models specifically this procedure involved estimating pearson χ2 statistics for the count data used to fit the model and the count data sets simulated during the bootstrapping procedure here 1000 data sets were simulated based on the specified structure of the n mixture model and the χ2 statistics for the count data used to fit the model and the count data sets simulated during the bootstrapping procedure were compared to determine the probability of observing as large of a value by random chance we considered p 0 05 to indicate a lack of fit this evaluation was implemented using the nmix gof test function of the aiccmodavg package mazerolle 2015 to evaluate the performance of the parametric bootstrap gof test to diagnose bias in parameter estimates we calculated the proportion of iterations that were true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives we considered a lack of fit to be a potential indication of bias and a mean abundance estimate to be biased when the absolute value of the relative bias was 0 5 thus a true positive is when the gof test indicated a lack of fit and the estimate was biased a true negative is when the gof test indicated decent fit and the estimate was unbiased a false positive is when the gof test indicated a lack of fit and the estimate was unbiased and a false negative is when the gof test indicated a decent fit and the estimate was biased we performed this evaluation for 200 iterations for all combinations of scenario 1 however for computational efficiency we restricted this evaluation to 200 iterations with detection probabilities of 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 for scenarios 2 5 2 5 2 quasi coefficient of variation we also investigated if assumption violations can be diagnosed prior to fitting the n mixture model we focused on a fundamental assumption of n mixture models which is that the data must match the distributional assumptions of the model as stated above n mixture models assume the number of individuals counted are a binomial process therefore the count data should share the characteristics of a binomial distribution a combination of the number of independent trials n and the probability of success p defines the form of a binomial distribution using the probability density function f x n p n x p x 1 p n x where x is the number of successes the mean and variance for the binomial distribution are e x n p and v a r x n p 1 p respectively therefore if a process follows a binomial distribution it is constrained to the relationship shown in fig 1 this readily translates over to count data because the expected number of individuals counted is related to true abundance and detection probability as c n p here the count abundance and detection probability represent the respective mean number of independent trials and probability of success of the binomial distribution we evaluated this relationship by matching the qcv with the mean count and relating them to the bias in parameter estimates from n mixture models the qcv is calculated as the unmodeled standard deviation in the count data within a sample unit divided by the mean count the mean count is simply the mean of all of the counts in the monitoring data set the unmodeled standard deviation in the count data within a sample unit was estimated by fitting a generalized linear mixed model glmm with survey occasions nested within sample units to the untransformed count data and extracting the residual standard deviation the glmms were fit using the lme4 package bates et al 2015 we note that the intercept from the above glmm could be used in place of the mean count to calculate the qcv again we considered a mean abundance estimate to be biased when the absolute value of the relative bias was 0 5 for computational efficiency we restricted this evaluation to 200 iterations from each of the original 837 combinations of simulated data 2 5 3 poisson regression we also evaluated if assumption violations due to unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detection probability can be diagnosed before fitting an n mixture model given the dependence of the count data on both abundance and detection probability i e c n p a unidirectional trend in either parameter should translate into a unidirectional trend in the count data assuming the magnitude of the directionality is large compared to the variability in the effect therefore we fit a poisson glm with an explanatory variable for survey occasion and evaluated if the slope i e the effect of survey occasion was statistically significant α 0 05 we fit the glms to all 1000 iterations from each of the original 837 combinations of simulated data to ensure any pattern uncovered was not due to random chance 3 results the n mixture model with a poisson error distribution performed well when statistical assumptions were met i e scenario 1 and the detection probability was 0 3 fig 2 and appendix b also the performance of the n mixture model improved when increasing the number of survey occasions and sample units however the model overestimated mean abundance with even slight amounts of unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data and increasing the number of survey occasions exacerbated the problem fig 3 and appendix b when count data were simulated while matching the assumptions of n mixture models i e scenario 1 and detection probabilities were 0 3 the parametric bootstrap gof test performed well in diagnosing bias in parameter estimates fig 4 and appendix c indeed disagreements were minimal in such cases and most erred on the side of caution in that they indicated a lack of fit when the absolute value of the relative bias was 0 5 when detection probabilities were low however it was common for the gof test to indicate good fit despite the absolute value of the relative bias being 0 5 these false negative errors increased with a lower number of survey occasions and sample units these same patterns were detected for count data simulated under scenarios 2 5 fig 5 and appendix c the probability of bias i e relative bias of 0 5 increased with increasing qcv and mean of the count data fig 6 based on the range of simulated values probability of bias was 100 when the mean count was 5 and the qcv was 0 4 the results indicated that potential bias in parameter estimates associated with unidirectional trends in abundance or detectability can be diagnosed prior to fitting an n mixture model under the simulated conditions when inducing unidirectional trends in abundance or detectability 98 2 and 99 8 of the count data from scenario 3 and 5 respectively had a statistically significant trend in counts across survey occasions with respective mean effect sizes of 0 2790 and 0 4726 when slopes were statistically significant conversely the respective percent of the count data that had a statistically significant trend across survey occasions from scenarios 1 2 and 4 was 30 3 55 3 and 53 2 with respective mean effect sizes of 0 0002 0 0002 and 0 0001 when slopes were statistically significant the bias in the estimated mean abundance that is associated with unidirectional trends in true abundance or detection probability was substantially reduced albeit still substantial in some cases when fitting n mixture models with a survey occasion explanatory variable on detection probability fig 7 and appendix b 4 discussion this study represents the most thorough assessment to date of assumption violations and model diagnostics when fitting poisson n mixture models our results confirm that the n mixture model is a reliable abundance estimator when detectability is 0 3 but the results also demonstrate that the n mixture model produces mean abundance estimates with substantial bias with even slight amounts of unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data for example the simulated number of individuals that left or entered a sample unit between survey occasions under the random heterogeneity in abundance scenario averaged 2 5 and 5 individuals for a coefficient of variation at 0 1 and 0 2 respectively we believe and the literature supports that the levels of heterogeneity simulated were reasonable and may even underestimate actual heterogeneity in the field it seems the parametric bootstrap gof test is not a reliable diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates when detectability is low and sample sizes are limited even with large bias in the estimates the results also suggest that the qcv is a straightforward and reasonable approach to help diagnose potential bias in parameter estimates particularly when it is not clear if low detectability or unmodeled heterogeneity are an issue given data in hand are the only information accessible to managers reliable diagnostics to identify potential bias in abundance estimates are needed to minimize the influence of poor or misleading information used to manage wildlife and fisheries populations it is clear that n mixture models can have a poor fit and produce unbiased parameter estimates or vice versa depending on the underlying ecological or sampling processes generating the monitoring count data figs 4 and 5 the qcv diagnostic is based on the idea that the variation in counts among survey occasions within a sample unit should be binomially distributed thus this statistic is only intended to evaluate the fundamental assumption of n mixture models that the counts are binomially distributed and it should be used in conjunction with other model diagnostics including the parametric bootstrap gof test importantly the cutoff decision on what degree of bias is acceptable depends on the decision making process and the level of accuracy needed to make good decisions based on population size we chose a 50 relative bias as our cutoff because it represents a high degree of bias that would often be problematic particularly when managing species of concern in step with this thinking the qcv diagnostic plot i e fig 6 was created using parameter estimates from models fit to data that were simulated from specific ranges of abundance and detection probability along with our cutoff for what constitutes a biased estimate thus analysts should take care when using the plot to evaluate potential violations with their own data nonetheless some general patterns were apparent for instance raw count data with qcv 0 4 should be considered suspect particularly if mean counts are relatively large it is also important to note that we simulated within sample unit heterogeneity that in practice could be reduced by including explanatory variables on model parameters in these instances the qcv can be calculated by fitting a glmm with survey occasions nested within sample units and with the inclusion of all standardized explanatory variables under consideration and dividing the estimated residual standard deviation by the estimated intercept notably this diagnostic will prove to be useful because capture probabilities 0 3 that require unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data be relatively low to meet the assumptions of a binomial distribution are common karanth and nichols 1998 bailey et al 2004 grabowski et al 2009 price and peterson 2010 wylie et al 2010 duarte et al 2011 meador et al 2011 brown et al 2014 howell et al 2016 and many more our results suggest unmodeled unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability can also be diagnosed using a poisson regression prior to fitting an n mixture model however it is worth noting our scenarios had compounded loss across survey occasions and are a worst case scenario albeit biologically realistic where the reduction in detection probability over time is additive and individuals do not return to the sample unit within a primary occasion after leaving other scenarios could also be conceived and evaluated heterogeneity in count data can occur both among and within sample units several approaches have been developed to handle extra variation in count data among sample units including the use of a negative binomial distribution zero inflated poisson models wenger and freeman 2008 joseph et al 2009 and through the inclusion of random effects kéry et al 2009 importantly although a negative binomial distribution is relevant it does not always produce ecologically reasonable parameter estimates kéry et al 2005 joseph et al 2009 kéry 2017 in contrast there are few approaches that can accommodate extra heterogeneity within sample units for example the inclusion of a beta binomial distribution to model detectability can help overcome bias resulting from detection probabilities that are correlated among individuals within a sample unit martin et al 2011 dorazio et al 2013 the inclusion of random effects to allow detection probabilities to simultaneously vary among and within sample units may accommodate heterogeneity in the count data that is not modeled using explanatory variables kéry and schaub 2012 however more robust data are needed to support the fitting of models with random effects therefore this approach may not be feasible in many cases where count data are sparse a commonly used method to accommodate extra heterogeneity when the parametric bootstrap gof test indicates a lack of fit is to use an overdispersion parameter to adjust inflate the standard errors of the point estimates mackenzie and bailey 2004 kéry and royle 2016 we note however that such an adjustment would not alter the point estimates themselves and point estimates are typically what managers use to interpret spatial and temporal patterns of abundance for wildlife and fisheries populations our simulations suggest that when unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability is relatively small the resulting bias can be partially mitigated through the inclusion of a survey occasion explanatory variable on detection probability in the case where individuals leave a sample unit within a primary occasion the heterogeneity appears to translate into a detection issue and the abundance estimates when including a survey occasion explanatory variable on detection probability are interpretable as the total number of individuals ever present in the sample unit during the primary occasion i e the superpopulation abundance given this did not always result in unbiased parameter estimates a more reliable tactic may be to break up the count data into shorter intervals where animal movement into or out of sample units is negligible and restrict the analysis to a subset of the data hostetter et al 2015 duarte et al 2017a or fit open population n mixture models where each of the newly created shorter intervals is a primary occasion kéry et al 2009 chandler et al 2011 dail and madsen 2011 hostetler and chandler 2015 but see bellier et al 2016 the fact that the estimated mean abundance across sample units is biased when unmodeled heterogeneity is present in the count data is not surprising and is a broadly known limitation among practitioners perhaps what is surprising is the magnitude of the bias at even low levels of unmodeled heterogeneity our aim of this paper is not to say replicated count data are useless if n mixture models cannot be reliably fit outside of harvest management or take allowance decisions we rarely encounter a case where information on total abundance is needed to implement effective management strategies other approaches are available that may be less sensitive to such heterogeneity in count data for example occupancy models offer an approach to estimate the occurrence of species while accounting for imperfect detection using detection non detection data which can be derived from count data mackenzie et al 2002 tyre et al 2003 furthermore occurrence patterns can serve as a useful proxy of abundance for some species clare et al 2015 linden et al 2017 but see ellis et al 2013 if higher resolution information is desired or an occupancy abundance relationship is not apparent managers could fit occupancy models with multiple states where each state represents the relative abundance of a population i e absent present and present and abundant royle 2004b royle and link 2005 martin et al 2010 if one is simply interested in modeling variation in abundance and detectability simultaneously as a function of explanatory variables poisson glmms are also a viable alternative to n mixture models when analyzing replicated count data of unmarked populations link and sauer 1997 barker et al 2017 finally if total abundance is still the population state variable of interest combining count data with more intensive capture recapture data at a subset of sample units or in a subset of primary occasions can increase the reliability of detection probably estimates and by extension improve abundance estimates this could be accomplished using at least two approaches 1 managers could fix detection probability of count data to the estimated capture probability from the capture recapture data e g chelgren and dunham 2015 2 perhaps a more elegant approach is for managers to borrow strength across the different data sets using an integrated model and model detection parameters as random effects drawn from a common logit normal distribution e g grabowski et al 2009 both of these approaches assume the survey method is similar between the data sets therefore it would be unreasonable to treat the detection probabilities from visual point count surveys and capture probabilities from trapping sessions as interchangeable because these probabilities are likely to be very different due to the different survey methods 5 conclusions we present the most thorough evaluation of assumption violations and diagnostics when fitting poisson n mixture models our results demonstrate the high degree of sensitivity n mixture models have to assumption violations associated with unmodeled heterogeneity in count data within a sample unit it seems not all sources of heterogeneity in count data are equal with respect to bias in parameter estimates this can be seen in fig 3 with varying relative bias across the different scenarios we simulated and that random individual heterogeneity in detection probability does not seem to result in biased estimates when detectability is moderate warren et al 2013 veech et al 2016 collectively this highlights the importance of evaluating different sources and extents of heterogeneity in count data and their effect on the reliability of population state variable estimates used to manage wildlife and fisheries populations we demonstrate that the parametric bootstrap gof test is not a reliable diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates when detectability is low and sample sizes are limited moreover we propose a new straightforward approach to diagnose potential bias in parameter estimates by evaluating if the count data are binomially distributed which is a fundamental assumption of n mixture models we also discuss alternative estimation approaches managers could implement using similar data types to derive unbiased estimates of population state variables and properly inform management decision making importantly statistically accounting for unmodeled heterogeneity is a post hoc approach that should be considered a last resort we stress that there is no substitute for an effective sample design and we recommend managers develop clear objectives for management prior to implementing monitoring programs or be flexible to adjustments in current monitoring efforts with objectives in mind managers are able to simulate monitoring data under various sample designs to establish more efficient and effective monitoring programs monitoring for the sake of monitoring without clear management objectives may result in data that cannot reliably estimate

25312,monitoring animal populations is central to wildlife and fisheries management and the use of n mixture models toward these efforts has markedly increased in recent years nevertheless relatively little work has evaluated estimator performance when basic assumptions are violated moreover diagnostics to identify when bias in parameter estimates from n mixture models is likely is largely unexplored we simulated count data sets using 837 combinations of detection probability number of sample units number of survey occasions and type and extent of heterogeneity in abundance or detectability we fit poisson n mixture models to these data quantified the bias associated with each combination and evaluated if the parametric bootstrap goodness of fit gof test can be used to indicate bias in parameter estimates we also explored if assumption violations can be diagnosed prior to fitting n mixture models in doing so we propose a new model diagnostic which we term the quasi coefficient of variation qcv n mixture models performed well when assumptions were met and detection probabilities were moderate i e 0 3 and the performance of the estimator improved with increasing survey occasions and sample units however the magnitude of bias in estimated mean abundance with even slight amounts of unmodeled heterogeneity was substantial the parametric bootstrap gof test did not perform well as a diagnostic for bias in parameter estimates when detectability and sample sizes were low the results indicate the qcv is useful to diagnose potential bias and that potential bias associated with unidirectional trends in abundance or detectability can be diagnosed using poisson regression this study represents the most thorough assessment to date of assumption violations and diagnostics when fitting n mixture models using the most commonly implemented error distribution unbiased estimates of population state variables are needed to properly inform management decision making therefore we also discuss alternative approaches to yield unbiased estimates of population state variables using similar data types and we stress that there is no substitute for an effective sample design that is grounded upon well defined management objectives keywords abundance count data detection goodness of fit monitoring n mixture model 1 introduction abundance is a population state variable of considerable interest to wildlife and fisheries managers as it is frequently used to inform state dependent decision making williams et al 2002 accordingly natural resource monitoring programs often concentrate on tracking the distribution and abundance of populations within and among landscapes yet a census is rarely if ever executed afield because at least a portion of a population inevitably remain undetected particularly when monitoring rare or elusive species thompson 2004 hence monitoring data need to be corrected for incomplete detection to properly inform management decision making n mixture models represent a class of hierarchical models that are increasingly used to correct monitoring count data by explicitly modeling population level processes along with the underlying detection process royle 2004a this approach models the number of individuals counted c at sample unit i during survey occasion t as binomial random variables c i t b i n o m i a l n i p where ni is abundance at sample unit i and p is detection probability i e the probability of detecting an individual in the population given it is available for detection by treating abundance as an independent random variable generated from a statistical distribution i e poisson negative binomial zero inflated poisson etc the model is able to estimate detection probability perhaps the primary appeal of this approach over alternative abundance estimation techniques such as capture recapture models is that n mixture models only require relatively inexpensive convenient to collect and less invasive spatially and temporally replicated count data of unmarked individuals also explanatory variables that may influence abundance and detection probability can be included using generalized linear models glms extensions to the original parameterization continue to be developed increasing the overall flexibility and usefulness of this approach reviewed in dénes et al 2015 like all estimators n mixture models require a set of assumptions that should be considered prior to fitting the model specifically these models assume population closure i e no immigration emigration births or deaths across replicate survey occasions within a primary occasion i e within a sampling season individuals are not double counted during a single survey occasion individuals are detected independently from each other individual heterogeneity in detection probability is negligible and the data match the distributional assumptions of the model new developments have enabled managers to relax and at times even overcome some of these basic assumptions still it is evident that n mixture models yield imprecise estimates with small sample sizes and unstable estimates when detection probabilities are low royle 2004a mcintyre et al 2012 couturier et al 2013 yamaura 2013 veech et al 2016 barker et al 2017 or when heterogeneity in abundance or detection probability is not modeled kéry and royle 2016 veech et al 2016 but see kéry 2017 diagnostics to identify when parameter estimates from n mixture models are likely to be biased are largely unexplored in practice potential sample size issues can be avoided by monitoring a greater number of sample units or increasing the number of primary occasions e g yamaura et al 2011 furthermore sample size requirements can be evaluated via data simulation nonetheless diagnosing potential problems associated with low detectability and unmodeled heterogeneity in model parameters is much more difficult a common recommendation is to avoid fitting n mixture models when detectability is too low or when there is evidence unmodeled heterogeneity is too high while this recommendation is statistically valid it is of little real value to managers because detection probability is often unknown a priori that is managers typically only have the count data in hand and variation in those data is complicated by heterogeneity in both abundance and detection probability parametric bootstrapping procedures can be implemented as a goodness of fit gof test when fitting models using a maximum likelihood framework presumably allowing managers to evaluate how well the model fits the data yet parametric bootstrapping procedures can suffer from substantial sample error and gof tests for hierarchical models in general are considered underdeveloped and in need of further evaluation kéry and royle 2016 nevertheless although not the original intention and never formally evaluated the parametric bootstrap gof test for n mixture models is often portrayed as assessing the validity in the parameter estimates derived from the models given count data of unmarked individuals are increasingly used to inform management decision making it is imperative that potential biases and diagnostics are thoroughly evaluated here we begin by briefly describing types of heterogeneity that may arise in count data using common sample designs using these scenarios as a foundation we simulate replicated count data across a gradient of detection probability to assess the bias in estimated abundances at various types and extents of unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data we also evaluate the performance of the parametric bootstrap gof test when used to diagnose bias in parameter estimates furthermore we explore the extent to which assumption violations can be diagnosed prior to fitting n mixture models in doing so we propose a new diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates which we term the quasi coefficient of variation hereafter qcv finally we discuss alternative procedures to estimate population state variables that can be implemented using similar monitoring data when assumption violations are suspected but cannot be resolved 2 methods 2 1 general description of the scenarios heterogeneity in count data can arise from process variation i e true variation in abundance and variation in sample error i e variation in the detectability of individuals here we focus on five scenarios that represent common sample designs used to monitor animal populations scenario 1 represents the ideal sample design where all statistical assumptions are met this scenario serves as a baseline and allows for the examination of bias associated with variable detectability scenario 2 represents a sample design in which random heterogeneity in abundance is present this represents a case where individuals enter i e are recruited and immigrate and leave i e die and emigrate the sample units across survey occasions within a primary occasion scenario 3 also represents a case where there is heterogeneity in abundance but the heterogeneity is unidirectional i e decreasing which can occur if survey protocols are invasive i e trap or net captures flipping cover objects rocks logs or cover boards electrofishing etc and individuals leave the sample units or perish after each survey occasion within a primary occasion although we focus on a decrease in abundance here the same patterns in bias can be expected if abundances increase across survey occasions scenario 4 represents a sample design in which random unmodeled heterogeneity in detection probability is present like scenario 2 this can be associated with an assortment of factors but our rationale was to capture a case where explanatory variables that may influence detection probability were omitted such as habitat behavior etc last scenario 5 represents a sample design where detection probability decreases across survey occasions within a primary occasion this pattern could be associated with sample designs that cause individuals to become more vigilant and by extension less detectable after each survey occasion changing environmental conditions that influence detectability i e rain obscuring tracks or feces during sign surveys animal activity patterns that vary in synchrony with the mating season etc again although we focus on a downward trend the same patterns can be expected if detectability increases across survey occasions 2 2 simulating population and monitoring data we simulated population and monitoring count data using the scenarios outlined above as a foundation for each scenario data were simulated across a range in detection probability ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 by 0 2 number of sample units 25 50 or 100 number of survey occasions 3 6 or 12 and type and extent of heterogeneity in true abundance or detection probability see sections 2 2 1 2 2 5 for specific details this resulted in the evaluation of 837 combinations which were each simulated for 1000 iterations within program r r core team 2016 the simulation code is provided in appendix a 2 2 1 scenario 1 for scenario 1 true abundance for each sample unit was generated assuming a poisson process where mean true abundance among sample units λ was randomized by sampling from a uniform distribution ranging from 1 to 50 observation error was then simulated to generate count data using a binomial process we used this same approach when simulating data for scenarios 2 5 except we induced heterogeneity in abundance or detection probability 2 2 2 scenario 2 for scenario 2 we induced random heterogeneity in true abundance specifically we treated the initial true abundance for each sample unit as the mean true abundance and generated a true abundance for each survey occasion by sampling from a gamma distribution using the respective sample unit mean abundance and a desired coefficient of variation c v s d x in true abundance which ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 by 0 1 the randomly generated true abundances were rounded to the nearest individual notably the poisson process can sometimes sample a value of 0 when λ is low in which case a coefficient of variation cannot be calculated therefore when a sample unit had a mean true abundance of 0 the mean true abundance for that sample unit was increased to 1 and λ was recalculated based on the updated values these extents of temporal heterogeneity in abundance are generally less than what is reported for stream dwelling bull trout salvelinus confluentu cv 0 71 1 14 al chokhachy et al 2009 warm water stream fishes cv 0 35 1 57 peterson and rabeni 1995 and metamorph western toads anaxyrus boreas cv 0 58 chelgren et al 2011 2 2 3 scenario 3 for scenario 3 we induced a decline in true abundance across survey occasions that is we treated the initial true abundance for each sample unit as the true abundance during the first survey occasion we then generated true abundance during survey occasion t 1 by sampling from a binomial distribution using the sample unit specific abundance in survey occasion t and a desired probability of remaining in a sample unit i e one minus the probability of leaving a sample unit the probability of leaving a sample unit ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 by 0 1 this range is within the bounds of what has been estimated for animals in the field for example it was estimated that 2 6 28 5 and 11 0 41 7 of bull trout and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss respectively move out of unblocked 50 m sample units when surveying individuals by electrofishing or snorkeling peterson et al 2005 2 2 4 scenario 4 for scenario 4 we incorporated random heterogeneity in detection probability here we treated the initial detection probability as the mean parameter and sampled a detection probability for each survey occasion sample unit combination using a beta distribution and a desired coefficient of variation in detectability which ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 by 0 1 importantly a mean detection probability of 0 9 and a coefficient of variation of 0 4 or 0 5 does not exist therefore these combinations were not included in the simulations again the induced variability in detection probability is well within the variation of capture efficiencies found in the literature high variability in capture efficiency has been documented for foskett speckled dace rhinichthys osculus ssp and borax lake chub gila boraxobius in desert spring systems with small and large sized foskett speckled dace having a 7 1 and 1 5 times lower odds respectively of being captured than medium sized foskett speckled dace in tule marsh habitats and small and large sized borax lake chub having a 2 9 and 2 1 times lower odds respectively of being captured than medium sized borax lake chub in lake habitats peterson et al 2015 in the same study capture probabilities varied markedly across habitat types for foskett speckled dace range for medium size fish on survey occasion 1 0 2 0 5 and borax lake chub range for medium size fish on survey occasion 1 0 18 0 56 furthermore there was an eight fold difference in the odds of capturing adult oregon spotted frog rana pretiosa among ponds chelgren et al 2008 2 2 5 scenario 5 for scenario 5 we induced a decline in detection probability across survey occasions here we treated the initial detection probability as the detection probability during the first survey occasion and estimated detection probability during survey occasion t 1 as p t 1 p t p r e d where p r e d is the reduction in detection probability after each survey occasion and ranged from 1 25 to 2 by 0 25 this variability is also comparable to what has been estimated with field data for instance capture probabilities for bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout o clarki lewisi were 1 15 1 79 and 1 69 1 96 times lower respectively after each successive pass when using a multipass electrofishing removal sample design peterson et al 2004 and the respective capture and recapture probabilities for foskett speckled dace were 2 0 and 2 5 times lower across survey occasions when sampling with minnow traps peterson et al 2015 similarly capture probability for metamorph oregon spotted frogs was 3 45 times higher after their initial capture within a primary occasion duarte et al 2017b 2 3 fitting n mixture models although other parameterizations are available the poisson distribution is the most frequently implemented error distribution for the abundance parameter when fitting n mixture models we fit n mixture models assuming a poisson error distribution for abundance to the 837 000 simulated count data sets within program r using the pcount function from the unmarked package fiske and chandler 2011 preliminary simulations were conducted to ensure the specified k value which represents the maximum possible abundance during the primary occasion did not influence output estimates furthermore a try function was used to catch errors associated with non convergence when fitting the n mixture models the code used to fit the n mixture models is provided in appendix a first we fit intercept models to each data set to evaluate model performance that is no explanatory variables were included on model parameters when exploring patterns in the simulated count data however the results suggested that potential issues associated with unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability can be diagnosed prior to fitting the n mixture model see section 2 5 3 also sources of unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability are sometimes known by managers a priori we were curious if bias associated with this assumption violation can be overcome during analyses through the use of a trend explanatory variable on the detection parameter therefore we also fit poisson n mixture models that included an explanatory variable on detection probability that represented the survey occasion importantly if the data were simulated with only 3 survey occasions the variable was treated as a factor variable otherwise the variable was treated as a continuous variable this increased the number of simulated count data sets to 1197 000 2 4 relative bias to evaluate n mixture model performance we focused on the discrepancy in the estimated mean abundance λ ˆ and the true mean abundance λ that was used to simulate each data set j specifically we estimated relative bias b ˆ as b ˆ j λ ˆ j λ j λ j thus if the relative bias estimate is positive the model overestimated the true mean abundance and if the relative bias estimate is negative the model underestimated the true mean abundance furthermore the relative bias estimate can be interpreted as the percent bias where a relative bias estimate of 0 5 would indicate a 50 overestimate of true mean abundance relative bias estimates were summarized for each of the 1197 combinations of simulated data using the central tendency i e the mean of the 1000 iterations omitting any iterations that did not converge 2 5 diagnostics we evaluated if we could diagnose whether fitting an n mixture model will produce biased estimates using three different approaches all procedures took place within program r using a try function to discard output that contained errors when fitting the models the code used to carry out model diagnostic evaluations is provided in appendix a 2 5 1 parametric bootstrap goodness of fit test we evaluated if the parametric bootstrap gof test was a viable diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates when fitting n mixture models specifically this procedure involved estimating pearson χ2 statistics for the count data used to fit the model and the count data sets simulated during the bootstrapping procedure here 1000 data sets were simulated based on the specified structure of the n mixture model and the χ2 statistics for the count data used to fit the model and the count data sets simulated during the bootstrapping procedure were compared to determine the probability of observing as large of a value by random chance we considered p 0 05 to indicate a lack of fit this evaluation was implemented using the nmix gof test function of the aiccmodavg package mazerolle 2015 to evaluate the performance of the parametric bootstrap gof test to diagnose bias in parameter estimates we calculated the proportion of iterations that were true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives we considered a lack of fit to be a potential indication of bias and a mean abundance estimate to be biased when the absolute value of the relative bias was 0 5 thus a true positive is when the gof test indicated a lack of fit and the estimate was biased a true negative is when the gof test indicated decent fit and the estimate was unbiased a false positive is when the gof test indicated a lack of fit and the estimate was unbiased and a false negative is when the gof test indicated a decent fit and the estimate was biased we performed this evaluation for 200 iterations for all combinations of scenario 1 however for computational efficiency we restricted this evaluation to 200 iterations with detection probabilities of 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 for scenarios 2 5 2 5 2 quasi coefficient of variation we also investigated if assumption violations can be diagnosed prior to fitting the n mixture model we focused on a fundamental assumption of n mixture models which is that the data must match the distributional assumptions of the model as stated above n mixture models assume the number of individuals counted are a binomial process therefore the count data should share the characteristics of a binomial distribution a combination of the number of independent trials n and the probability of success p defines the form of a binomial distribution using the probability density function f x n p n x p x 1 p n x where x is the number of successes the mean and variance for the binomial distribution are e x n p and v a r x n p 1 p respectively therefore if a process follows a binomial distribution it is constrained to the relationship shown in fig 1 this readily translates over to count data because the expected number of individuals counted is related to true abundance and detection probability as c n p here the count abundance and detection probability represent the respective mean number of independent trials and probability of success of the binomial distribution we evaluated this relationship by matching the qcv with the mean count and relating them to the bias in parameter estimates from n mixture models the qcv is calculated as the unmodeled standard deviation in the count data within a sample unit divided by the mean count the mean count is simply the mean of all of the counts in the monitoring data set the unmodeled standard deviation in the count data within a sample unit was estimated by fitting a generalized linear mixed model glmm with survey occasions nested within sample units to the untransformed count data and extracting the residual standard deviation the glmms were fit using the lme4 package bates et al 2015 we note that the intercept from the above glmm could be used in place of the mean count to calculate the qcv again we considered a mean abundance estimate to be biased when the absolute value of the relative bias was 0 5 for computational efficiency we restricted this evaluation to 200 iterations from each of the original 837 combinations of simulated data 2 5 3 poisson regression we also evaluated if assumption violations due to unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detection probability can be diagnosed before fitting an n mixture model given the dependence of the count data on both abundance and detection probability i e c n p a unidirectional trend in either parameter should translate into a unidirectional trend in the count data assuming the magnitude of the directionality is large compared to the variability in the effect therefore we fit a poisson glm with an explanatory variable for survey occasion and evaluated if the slope i e the effect of survey occasion was statistically significant α 0 05 we fit the glms to all 1000 iterations from each of the original 837 combinations of simulated data to ensure any pattern uncovered was not due to random chance 3 results the n mixture model with a poisson error distribution performed well when statistical assumptions were met i e scenario 1 and the detection probability was 0 3 fig 2 and appendix b also the performance of the n mixture model improved when increasing the number of survey occasions and sample units however the model overestimated mean abundance with even slight amounts of unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data and increasing the number of survey occasions exacerbated the problem fig 3 and appendix b when count data were simulated while matching the assumptions of n mixture models i e scenario 1 and detection probabilities were 0 3 the parametric bootstrap gof test performed well in diagnosing bias in parameter estimates fig 4 and appendix c indeed disagreements were minimal in such cases and most erred on the side of caution in that they indicated a lack of fit when the absolute value of the relative bias was 0 5 when detection probabilities were low however it was common for the gof test to indicate good fit despite the absolute value of the relative bias being 0 5 these false negative errors increased with a lower number of survey occasions and sample units these same patterns were detected for count data simulated under scenarios 2 5 fig 5 and appendix c the probability of bias i e relative bias of 0 5 increased with increasing qcv and mean of the count data fig 6 based on the range of simulated values probability of bias was 100 when the mean count was 5 and the qcv was 0 4 the results indicated that potential bias in parameter estimates associated with unidirectional trends in abundance or detectability can be diagnosed prior to fitting an n mixture model under the simulated conditions when inducing unidirectional trends in abundance or detectability 98 2 and 99 8 of the count data from scenario 3 and 5 respectively had a statistically significant trend in counts across survey occasions with respective mean effect sizes of 0 2790 and 0 4726 when slopes were statistically significant conversely the respective percent of the count data that had a statistically significant trend across survey occasions from scenarios 1 2 and 4 was 30 3 55 3 and 53 2 with respective mean effect sizes of 0 0002 0 0002 and 0 0001 when slopes were statistically significant the bias in the estimated mean abundance that is associated with unidirectional trends in true abundance or detection probability was substantially reduced albeit still substantial in some cases when fitting n mixture models with a survey occasion explanatory variable on detection probability fig 7 and appendix b 4 discussion this study represents the most thorough assessment to date of assumption violations and model diagnostics when fitting poisson n mixture models our results confirm that the n mixture model is a reliable abundance estimator when detectability is 0 3 but the results also demonstrate that the n mixture model produces mean abundance estimates with substantial bias with even slight amounts of unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data for example the simulated number of individuals that left or entered a sample unit between survey occasions under the random heterogeneity in abundance scenario averaged 2 5 and 5 individuals for a coefficient of variation at 0 1 and 0 2 respectively we believe and the literature supports that the levels of heterogeneity simulated were reasonable and may even underestimate actual heterogeneity in the field it seems the parametric bootstrap gof test is not a reliable diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates when detectability is low and sample sizes are limited even with large bias in the estimates the results also suggest that the qcv is a straightforward and reasonable approach to help diagnose potential bias in parameter estimates particularly when it is not clear if low detectability or unmodeled heterogeneity are an issue given data in hand are the only information accessible to managers reliable diagnostics to identify potential bias in abundance estimates are needed to minimize the influence of poor or misleading information used to manage wildlife and fisheries populations it is clear that n mixture models can have a poor fit and produce unbiased parameter estimates or vice versa depending on the underlying ecological or sampling processes generating the monitoring count data figs 4 and 5 the qcv diagnostic is based on the idea that the variation in counts among survey occasions within a sample unit should be binomially distributed thus this statistic is only intended to evaluate the fundamental assumption of n mixture models that the counts are binomially distributed and it should be used in conjunction with other model diagnostics including the parametric bootstrap gof test importantly the cutoff decision on what degree of bias is acceptable depends on the decision making process and the level of accuracy needed to make good decisions based on population size we chose a 50 relative bias as our cutoff because it represents a high degree of bias that would often be problematic particularly when managing species of concern in step with this thinking the qcv diagnostic plot i e fig 6 was created using parameter estimates from models fit to data that were simulated from specific ranges of abundance and detection probability along with our cutoff for what constitutes a biased estimate thus analysts should take care when using the plot to evaluate potential violations with their own data nonetheless some general patterns were apparent for instance raw count data with qcv 0 4 should be considered suspect particularly if mean counts are relatively large it is also important to note that we simulated within sample unit heterogeneity that in practice could be reduced by including explanatory variables on model parameters in these instances the qcv can be calculated by fitting a glmm with survey occasions nested within sample units and with the inclusion of all standardized explanatory variables under consideration and dividing the estimated residual standard deviation by the estimated intercept notably this diagnostic will prove to be useful because capture probabilities 0 3 that require unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data be relatively low to meet the assumptions of a binomial distribution are common karanth and nichols 1998 bailey et al 2004 grabowski et al 2009 price and peterson 2010 wylie et al 2010 duarte et al 2011 meador et al 2011 brown et al 2014 howell et al 2016 and many more our results suggest unmodeled unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability can also be diagnosed using a poisson regression prior to fitting an n mixture model however it is worth noting our scenarios had compounded loss across survey occasions and are a worst case scenario albeit biologically realistic where the reduction in detection probability over time is additive and individuals do not return to the sample unit within a primary occasion after leaving other scenarios could also be conceived and evaluated heterogeneity in count data can occur both among and within sample units several approaches have been developed to handle extra variation in count data among sample units including the use of a negative binomial distribution zero inflated poisson models wenger and freeman 2008 joseph et al 2009 and through the inclusion of random effects kéry et al 2009 importantly although a negative binomial distribution is relevant it does not always produce ecologically reasonable parameter estimates kéry et al 2005 joseph et al 2009 kéry 2017 in contrast there are few approaches that can accommodate extra heterogeneity within sample units for example the inclusion of a beta binomial distribution to model detectability can help overcome bias resulting from detection probabilities that are correlated among individuals within a sample unit martin et al 2011 dorazio et al 2013 the inclusion of random effects to allow detection probabilities to simultaneously vary among and within sample units may accommodate heterogeneity in the count data that is not modeled using explanatory variables kéry and schaub 2012 however more robust data are needed to support the fitting of models with random effects therefore this approach may not be feasible in many cases where count data are sparse a commonly used method to accommodate extra heterogeneity when the parametric bootstrap gof test indicates a lack of fit is to use an overdispersion parameter to adjust inflate the standard errors of the point estimates mackenzie and bailey 2004 kéry and royle 2016 we note however that such an adjustment would not alter the point estimates themselves and point estimates are typically what managers use to interpret spatial and temporal patterns of abundance for wildlife and fisheries populations our simulations suggest that when unidirectional heterogeneity in abundance or detectability is relatively small the resulting bias can be partially mitigated through the inclusion of a survey occasion explanatory variable on detection probability in the case where individuals leave a sample unit within a primary occasion the heterogeneity appears to translate into a detection issue and the abundance estimates when including a survey occasion explanatory variable on detection probability are interpretable as the total number of individuals ever present in the sample unit during the primary occasion i e the superpopulation abundance given this did not always result in unbiased parameter estimates a more reliable tactic may be to break up the count data into shorter intervals where animal movement into or out of sample units is negligible and restrict the analysis to a subset of the data hostetter et al 2015 duarte et al 2017a or fit open population n mixture models where each of the newly created shorter intervals is a primary occasion kéry et al 2009 chandler et al 2011 dail and madsen 2011 hostetler and chandler 2015 but see bellier et al 2016 the fact that the estimated mean abundance across sample units is biased when unmodeled heterogeneity is present in the count data is not surprising and is a broadly known limitation among practitioners perhaps what is surprising is the magnitude of the bias at even low levels of unmodeled heterogeneity our aim of this paper is not to say replicated count data are useless if n mixture models cannot be reliably fit outside of harvest management or take allowance decisions we rarely encounter a case where information on total abundance is needed to implement effective management strategies other approaches are available that may be less sensitive to such heterogeneity in count data for example occupancy models offer an approach to estimate the occurrence of species while accounting for imperfect detection using detection non detection data which can be derived from count data mackenzie et al 2002 tyre et al 2003 furthermore occurrence patterns can serve as a useful proxy of abundance for some species clare et al 2015 linden et al 2017 but see ellis et al 2013 if higher resolution information is desired or an occupancy abundance relationship is not apparent managers could fit occupancy models with multiple states where each state represents the relative abundance of a population i e absent present and present and abundant royle 2004b royle and link 2005 martin et al 2010 if one is simply interested in modeling variation in abundance and detectability simultaneously as a function of explanatory variables poisson glmms are also a viable alternative to n mixture models when analyzing replicated count data of unmarked populations link and sauer 1997 barker et al 2017 finally if total abundance is still the population state variable of interest combining count data with more intensive capture recapture data at a subset of sample units or in a subset of primary occasions can increase the reliability of detection probably estimates and by extension improve abundance estimates this could be accomplished using at least two approaches 1 managers could fix detection probability of count data to the estimated capture probability from the capture recapture data e g chelgren and dunham 2015 2 perhaps a more elegant approach is for managers to borrow strength across the different data sets using an integrated model and model detection parameters as random effects drawn from a common logit normal distribution e g grabowski et al 2009 both of these approaches assume the survey method is similar between the data sets therefore it would be unreasonable to treat the detection probabilities from visual point count surveys and capture probabilities from trapping sessions as interchangeable because these probabilities are likely to be very different due to the different survey methods 5 conclusions we present the most thorough evaluation of assumption violations and diagnostics when fitting poisson n mixture models our results demonstrate the high degree of sensitivity n mixture models have to assumption violations associated with unmodeled heterogeneity in count data within a sample unit it seems not all sources of heterogeneity in count data are equal with respect to bias in parameter estimates this can be seen in fig 3 with varying relative bias across the different scenarios we simulated and that random individual heterogeneity in detection probability does not seem to result in biased estimates when detectability is moderate warren et al 2013 veech et al 2016 collectively this highlights the importance of evaluating different sources and extents of heterogeneity in count data and their effect on the reliability of population state variable estimates used to manage wildlife and fisheries populations we demonstrate that the parametric bootstrap gof test is not a reliable diagnostic to identify bias in parameter estimates when detectability is low and sample sizes are limited moreover we propose a new straightforward approach to diagnose potential bias in parameter estimates by evaluating if the count data are binomially distributed which is a fundamental assumption of n mixture models we also discuss alternative estimation approaches managers could implement using similar data types to derive unbiased estimates of population state variables and properly inform management decision making importantly statistically accounting for unmodeled heterogeneity is a post hoc approach that should be considered a last resort we stress that there is no substitute for an effective sample design and we recommend managers develop clear objectives for management prior to implementing monitoring programs or be flexible to adjustments in current monitoring efforts with objectives in mind managers are able to simulate monitoring data under various sample designs to establish more efficient and effective monitoring programs monitoring for the sake of monitoring without clear management objectives may result in data that cannot reliably estimate

25313,aquatox coupled water quality and estuarine hydrodynamic model based on food web was implemented to simulate the temporal variations of gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration re in haihe estuary of north china also the parameter sensitivity was calculated and the main factors of gpp and re were analyzed results showed that gpp ranged from 16 to 1789 mg o2 m 2 d 1 and re from 56 to 1083 mg o2 m 2 d 1 respectively gpp and re exhibited significant temporal variation and both reached the highest level in june however gpp and re reduced in july and august which could be explained by the increase of turbidity caused by high freshwater inflow discharge in rainy season maximum photosynthetic rate of blue greens was the most sensitive parameter to gpp re was strongly related to temperature the most sensitive parameter was average epilimnetic temperature a significant negative correlation was found between gpp re and freshwater inflow furthermore significant direct and indirect effects of tidal height on gpp were observed by path analysis increased turbidity induced by tidal action might explain the influence on gpp keywords primary production ecosystem respiration estuarine ecosystem aquatox 1 introduction estuarine areas are at the interface between land and sea in which many critical physical chemical processes occur such as dynamic mixing of fresh and oceanic waters sediment deposition and pollutant retention dale et al 2004 engle et al 2007 fu et al 2014 cindrić et al 2015 shen et al 2015 however natural variability of river inputs to estuaries had been greatly modified by human activities such as dam construction and flood protection burke et al 2009 mittal et al 2014 nidzieko et al 2014 freshwater inflow was likely to eliminate in most estuaries azevedo et al 2010 2014 shen et al 2015 yan et al 2016 and its tidal behaviour was changed vieira and bordalo 2000 azevedo et al 2008 these changes caused alterations of biological communities in species composition diversity abundance and distribution then estuarine ecosystem metabolism chicharo et al 2006 greet et al 2011 rovira et al 2012 webb et al 2012 belmar et al 2013 tang et al 2015 as important indicators of ecosystem metabolism gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration re played important roles in biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems an analysis of 350 published studies of aquatic ecosystem metabolism revealed that this research had been done predominantly in north america 68 usa and canada with fewer in europe 27 and very few in asia and africa 6 staehr et al 2012 most of the past studies were on descriptive studies of annual seasonal or daily changes of primary production and respiration and the development of new techniques to measure net ecosystem production several approaches such as bottle and chamber incubations kemp et al 1997 gazeau et al 2005 the diel open water technique caffrey 2003 staehr and sand jensen 2007 tang et al 2015 and oxygen isotopes quay et al 1995 ostrom et al 2005 had been applied to aquatic ecosystems to estimate gpp and re in recent years modeling has eventually become an important topic staehr et al 2012 coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical models had been used to analysis the relationship between physical chemical processes and ecosystem metabolism for example trancoso et al 2005 found that hydrodynamic conditions might be important for the productivity of phytoplankton and macroalgae after the application of a 3d hydrodynamic ecological model into ria de aveiro portugal to simulate estuarine dynamics and productivity of these two primary producers azevedo et al 2010 2014 implemented a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model to evaluate the influence of different freshwater discharge regimes on phytoplankton biomass and production of the douro estuary tang et al 2015 developed a system dynamics model for the middle water body to simulate diel do variability and sequentially net ecosystem metabolism the results showed the critical effects of artificial hydrological alterations to ecological processes in estuarine ecosystems however the focus of most studies was on phytoplankton community other biological communities such as macrophyte periphyton zooplankton and zoobenthos communities were ignored moreover gpp and re were driven by a series of environmental factors such as temperature salinity wind light nutrients hydrodynamics even biological feeding in estuarine ecosystem caffrey 2003 caffrey et al 2014 testa and kemp 2008 azevedo et al 2008 rochelle newall et al 2011 parker et al 2012 tang et al 2015 the effects of a single stressor were difficult to separate from that of other stressors e g predation therefore it was significant to take into account combined pressure such as water quantity water quality and biological feeding aquatox model is a general water ecological model that represents the combined environmental fate and effects of conventional pollutants such as nutrients and sediments and toxic chemicals in aquatic ecosystems park and clough 2014 which was described extensively in the literatures park et al 2008 applied the aquatox model to simulate ecosystem environmental fate and ecological effects of pollutants in lakes and other aquatic ecosystems and obtained direct or indirect influence of various factors on the lakes niu et al 2016 predicted the variations of nutrient with the changes of plant and animal species in a landscape lake using aquatox model clough et al 2017 estimated natural resource injuries for the deepwater horizon oil release using aquatox release 3 1 aquatox model was also applied in determining the ecological risk assessment of organic chemicals in aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2013 zhang and liu 2014 lombardo et al 2015 however the studies of aquatox model application mainly focused on the variances of ecosystem structural metrics measured by biomass when affected by light nutrient or chemical stressors the functional metrics such as gpp and re were reported less the aim of the study was to develop an aquatox model for estuarine ecosystem and simulate the temporal change of gpp and re in estuarine ecosystem analyze the main factors of gpp and re by stepwise multiple regression analysis and path analysis based on the model output it perhaps is the first application of aquatox in gpp and re simulation of estuarine ecosystem the study is helpful for us to understand correlation between physical chemical processes and ecosystem metabolism and gives information for estuarine ecosystem management 2 model and materials 2 1 model description aquatox developed by us epa in 2002 for release 1 is updated in 2014 for release 3 1 plus the model

populations and detritus it can be implemented as a truly complex food web model and provides a means for simulations of aquatic ecosystem metabolism even in estuarine environment gpp is defined as

measured by elemental analyzer in state key joint laboratory of environmental simulation and pollution control of beijing normal university the characteristics of hydrological and water physicochemical parameters in haihe estuary were shown in table 2 the initial biomass of phytoplankton blue greens greens diatoms and zooplankton copepod rotifer were obtained in the literature zhang et al 2011 2015 biomass of macrophytes myriophyllum were analyzed according to chen et al 2005 the sampling methods of myriophyllum was as follows three 2 m 2 m quadrats were set in each plot the samples were taken into sealed polyethylene bags after foreign substance being picked out the myriophyllum was weighed with electronic balance the biomass of benthic macroinvertebrate surf clam crab shrimp and fish carp catfish were obtained in the literature the biological parameters of each population were given in tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 3 model calibration and validation in order to improve the agreement between model output and a data set adjustment of some model parameters and constants was made under control conditions i e without toxicant during the 8 month survey period parameters listed in table 5 were adjusted for calibration primary production was significant correlated with the biomass of primary producers wang et al 2010 model calibration for haihe estuary using biological community biomass as the primary target against with model output was optimized calibration adequacy was evaluated subjectively based on generally approximate concordance with observed data as determined through graphical comparisons of model output and observed data quantitative measures to evaluate the adequacy of the calibration and model performance were also employed the modified index of agreement d1 and the modified coefficient of efficiency e1 legates and mccabe 1999 are robust measures of how well central tendencies of predicted and observed results correspond the equations of d1 and e1 are as follows d 1 1 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n p i o o i o e 1 1 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i o where oi is an observed value at each time pi is a predicted value at each time ō is a mean observed value n is number of observed value five categories were classified according to model performance henriksen et al 2003 when the values of d1 and e1 were in the range of 0 0 20 model performance were classified as very bad in the range of 0 20 0 50 model performance were classified as bad for the range of 0 50 0 65 model performance were good for the range of 0 65 0 85 and 0 85 1 model performance were very good and excellent root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae are popular statistical method to test model performances in model studies the equations of rmse and mae were as follows r s m e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 m a e 1 n i 1 n o i p i where oi is the measured data and pi is the predicted value the value of rmse and mae closer to zero indicates a better fit to observed value table 6 provides values of the goodness of fit criteria computed for the simulated biological state variables 2 4 sensitivity analysis to estimate possible variability or uncertainty for each item of the input data and deduce probable errors in the output the highest possible sensitivity input parameters should be identified aquatox includes a built in nominal range sensitivity analysis which varies each user specified parameter and loading by plus and minus a given percentage and ranks them according to how much each input affects the target output the sensitivity is calculated by the following expression s e n s i t i v i t y r e s u l t p o s r e s u l t b a s e l i n e r e s u l t n e g r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 2 r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 100 p c t c h a n g e d where sensitivity normalized sensitivity statistic resultscenario averaged aquatox result for a given endpoint given a positive change in the input parameter a negative change in the input parameter or no change in the input parameter baseline pctchanged percent that the input parameter is modified in the positive and negative directions in this sensitivity analysis a 15 change was made in tested parameters simulation period was from april 1 2011 to november 30 2011 the tested parameters include not only parameters of producers but also parameters of consumers table 5 as well as site characteristics mean depth maximum depth epilimnetic temperature hypolimnetic temperature average light and average light range and some initial conditions 2 5 data analysis aquatox outputs from april 1 2011 to november 30 2011 were exported and saved in excel format careful comparison between gpp re and environmental factors was made by regression linear analysis with spss 16 0 spss inc chicago usa in order to further clarify the direct effects of environmental factors on gpp and re and indirect effects of environmental factors due to interaction among them on gpp and re path analysis was carried out by constraining environmental variables using spss 16 0 path analysis was developed as a method of decomposing correlations into different pieces for interpretation of effects which is closely related to multiple regression a direct path coefficient is given after a significance test for significant variables and an indirect path coefficient is calculated according to path analysis theory 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the comparisons between model outputs and observed data were exhibited in fig 3 visual comparison of the observed and simulated data indicated that the model adequately described the dynamics of six community biomass during different periods as shown in table 6 d1 ranged from 0 62 to 0 79 e1 were in the range of 0 50 to 0 67 which meant model performances were good or very good according to the defined categories the mean value of d1 for phytoplankton was the highest and d1 for periphyton was the lowest e1 for phytoplankton was the maximum and for fish the minimum rmse and mae were relatively little all were below 0 150 the rmse of periphyton zooplankton benthic macroinvertebrate and fish as well as mae of periphyton macrophyte zooplankton benthic macroinvertebrate and fish were very small closer to zero therefore model simulations provided a satisfied representation of biological community biomass in haihe estuary in early summer phytoplankton grew quickly and its biomass was the highest fig 3a the biomass of benthic diatom peaked in summer and early autumn fig 3b zooplankton biomass was in the order spring summer autumn fig 3d the biomass of macrophyte benthic macroinvertebrate and fish all peaked in summer and early autumn fig 3c e f 3 2 sensitivity analysis the end results of sensitivity analysis were exhibited by tornado diagrams in the tornado diagram red lines represent model results when the given parameter is reduced by the user input percentage while blue lines represent a positive change in the parameter 100 sensitivity means that a 15 change in the parameter results in a 15 change in the endpoint fig 4 a and b showed the parameters that greatly contributed to variation of gpp and re respectively where a 15 change was made in tested parameters the larger the sensitivity the greater model parameter contribution was to gpp or re obviously gpp was most sensitive to blue greens parameters especially these of maximum photosynthetic rate temperature response slope and optimal temperature fig 4 a in the simulation blue greens comprised 30 of the predicted biomass moreover the results indicated that if the blue greens maximum photosynthetic rate were to be rised gpp would be a significant increase reduced the blue greens temperature response slope and optimal temperature the blue greens would thrive in cooler water and cause a gpp increase in the simulation site characteristics such as average light intensity water volume maximum water depth and temperature also had significant effects on gpp other sensitive parameters include mortality coefficient for surf clam maximum consumption for rotifer respiration rate for shrimp and mortality coefficient for catfish these are predators for algae and macrophyte however the tornado diagram reflected a unidirectional response to these parameters gpp had a slight increase whether these predators increased or decreased an explanation of this phenomenon might result from equilibrium states of aquatic ecosystem which illustrated the importance of food chain interactions when using aquatox model compared with gpp calculated sensitivity statistics for re were generally lower re was strongly related to temperature the most sensitive parameter was average epilimnetic temperature increasing epilimnetic temperature caused an increase to re initial water volume was also important other sensitive parameters for this category were dominated by dominant population effects such as phytoplankton greens and blue greens and zooplankton rotifer 3 3 temporal variation of gpp and re significant temporal variations of gpp and re in haihe estuary were exhibited in fig 5 it was illustrated that gpp ranged from 16 to 1789 mg o2 m 2 d 1 and re from 56 to 1083 mg o2 m 2 d 1 in haihe estuary respectively gpp was the highest in early summer and apparently higher than this in spring and autumn which was in accordance with the biomass of phytoplankton cai et al 2013 in summer photo plankton grew rapidly and peaked due to high temperature and light availability re in spring was the highest followed by summer and the lowest in autumn which was not consistent with the variations of gpp results suggested that pn ranged from 1046 to 1038 mg o2 m 2 d 1 in summer pn was greater than zero gpp re which indicated that aquatic ecosystem was net autotrophic in spring and autumn pn was less than zero gpp re and aquatic ecosystem was net heterotrophic 3 4 relation between gpp re and environmental factors the important point of the study was to ascertain the existence of possible relationships between gpp re and environmental factors after long time exposure to stressor factors ecosystem function was supposed to get integrative responses adapted to them the results of regression linear analysis illustrated fairly good correlations of gpp with light do fi wv copepod and rotifer table 7 re also showed significant relation with t tn tp do fi copepod rotifer shrimp and crab pn exhibited significant correlation with light trans do and toc in path analysis t x1 light x2 salinity x3 tn x4 tp x5 trans x6 do x7 bod5 x8 fi x9 th x10 wv x11 copepod x12 rotifer x13 surf clam x14 shrimp x15 crab x16 carp x17 and catfish x18 were selected as independent variable and gpp y or re y as dependent variable after a significance test according to path analysis theory the direct path coefficient and indirect path coefficient between dependent variable and independent variables were illustrated in tables 8a and 8b the higher the absolute value of path coefficient was the greater the impact as shown in table 8a among the eighteen variables the direct effect of light and the indirect effect of tn on gpp were the highest with the absolute values of direct path coefficient and indirect path coefficient 0 558 and 0 696 respectively the direct effect of environmental parameters on gpp ordered as follows light th t tn fi copepod from table 8b we could find that the direct effect of t on re was the highest with direct path coefficient 0 690 the direct effects of environmental parameters on re were in the order t do rotifer tn bod5 salinity fi the indirect effect of tn was the highest with maximum of indirect path coefficient 0 989 4 discussion 4 1 variation of gpp and re as described in table 9 the mean value of gpp in haihe estuary was much lower than this in haihe river hydrodynamic characteristics of estuarine ecosystem were perhaps the main factor influencing the gpp which would be discussed in the next meanwhile the mean value of gpp in haihe estuary was slightly higher than this in bohai bay furthermore gpp in haihe estuary was lower than those in florida coast and apalachicola bay of america douro estuary of portuguesa yellow river estuary yangtze river estuary and pearl river estuary of china among these estuaries except douro estuary of portuguesa other estuaries lies below 38 latitude north higher temperature and light intensity might be the main factors influencing gpp the latitude of douro estuary 41 14 n was slightly higher than that of haihe estuary 38 9 n since temperature and light intensity conditions were similar other factors influencing gpp might be higher river flow or lower salinity of douro estuary which might favour freshwater phytoplankton production azevedo et al 2006 the mean value of pn in haihe estuary was 157 mg o2 m 2 d 1 which meant aquatic ecosystem was net autotrophic in fact this phenomenon occurred in summer only aquatic ecosystem was net heterotrophic in spring and autumn the possible reasons were as follows first large amount of oxygen was consumed by biological degradation of organic pollutants due to inputs of organic pollutants upstream second primary production of phytoplankton was inhibited because of high turbidity in haihe estuary third metabolism of heterotrophic organism consumed large amount of oxygen as a results of its high proportion in community composition compared with other estuaries in the world pn in haihe estuary was lower than these in florida coast and monterey bay of america and higher than these in apalachicola bay of america yellow river estuary and yangtze river estuary of china 4 2 effects of light intensity on gpp and re gpp and re were driven by a series of environmental factors in haihe estuary such as temperature nutrients hydrodynamics etc as exhibited in fig 5 gpp and re peaked in summer june such variation had been observed in previous studies in mexico estuary caffrey et al 2014 yellow river estuary shen et al 2015 and pearl river estuary jiang et al 2010 furthermore gpp and re in some everglades hagerthey et al 2010 lakes staehr and sand jensen 2007 yan et al 2014 reached the highest level in summer the increase of gpp and re in summer might be stimulated by photosynthetically active radiation the portion of total solar radiation in the waveband 0 4 0 7 μm ross and sulev 2000 increasing solar radiation 233 56 62 54 wm 2 determined high photosynthetically active radiation in summer and subsequently higher photosynthesis rate shen et al 2015 the light intensity of haihe estuary reached the highest value in july from fig 6 a however in july and august gpp and re decreased according to fitch and christine 2014 penetration depth of light intensity was influenced by water transparency in haihe estuary very fine silt existed at the bottom and suspended as a response to hydrodynamics therefore intenser hydrodynamics induced higher turbidity suspended matter determined light quantity and spectral quality at a given depth which in turn affected photosynthetic output obrador and pretus 2008 furthermore in july and august the turbidity increased under high freshwater inflow which explained the decrease of gpp and re in summer in spring and autumn despite similar temperature and light intensity re in spring was higher than those in autumn which was likely to be explained by higher nutrient and lower freshwater inflow from the river especially an increase of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus stimulated microbial activity fig 6b rn in spring was much higher than those in autumn consequently the minimum of pn was detectable in spring in general aquatic ecosystem was net autotrophic in summer and net heterotrophic in spring and autumn similar results were found in previous studies in yellow river estuary liu 2015 which indicated that despite high inputs of organic pollutants metabolism restoration of estuary in summer was faster than those in other seasons due to high temperature nutrient and photosynthetically active radiation 4 3 effects of hydrodynamics on gpp and re a temporal analysis of gpp and re in haihe estuary showed that they were greatly influenced by hydrodynamics freshwater inflow fi and tidal height th are often used as important indicators of hydrodynamic characteristics in estuarine ecosystem in the model the estuarine ecosystem was assumed to have two layers the two layers were assumed to vary with freshwater inflow and daily tidal hydrodynamics water property in upper layer was distinct with those in lower layer in upper layer of water in haihe estuary negative relation was observed between gpp and fi in lower layer of water negative correlations were also found between fi and gpp re and pn furthermore th was correlated with re the dynamics of gpp and re varied in response to fi change increases in stream flow wind driven mixing and sediment resuspension elicited clear responses in magnitude and balance of ecosystem primary production and community respiration staehr et al 2012 high flow was often accompanied by pulsed inputs of inorganic nutrients dissolved organic carbon and suspended sediments which could induce both positive and negative effects on primary production and respiration staehr et al 2010 however in response to extreme disturbances e g floods surface sediments such as periphyton and different trophic food web would be damaged rendering the aquatic ecosystem heterotrophic and difficult to recover rapidly gerull et al 2012 the growth of phytoplankton response to flow magnitude resulted in lower or higher primary production azevedo et al 2008 2014 in douro estuary negative relation was observed between river flow and primary production explained by a lower residence time and light availability under higher flows and by a lower input of phytoplankton biomass and nutrients from the river azevedo et al 2008 nevertheless inverse relationship was obtained in further studies which might be explained by lower salinity and therefore higher chlorophyll a and nitrate levels leading to higher primary production azevedo et al 2014 in yellow river estuary gpp re and pn were still relatively high after short time high flow shen et al 2015 therefore effects of fi on gpp and re were significant different even in the same estuary in haihe estuary significant negative correlation between gpp or re and fi was shown table 7 fi played an important role in the gpp and re with direct path coefficient 0 175 and indirect path coefficient 0 08 for gpp tables 8a and with direct path coefficient 0 006 and indirect path coefficient 0 111 for re table 8b although the values of direct path coefficient were relatively low fi influenced gpp and re by other factors such as tn which could be found in table 8a with indirect path coefficient 0 337 by tn and 0 651 by tn in table 8b furthermore negative relation between gpp or re and fi could also be inferred from figs 5 and 6 b in which gpp and re increased when fi fell in may 2011 whereas gpp re decreased when fi increased despite of high temperature and light intensity in july 2011 and gpp re remained low in august to november 2011 as unique hydrology characteristics of estuarine ecosystem tidal action greatly influenced physical and chemical properties of water e g salinity and turbidity maccready and geyer 2010 and then ecosystem functions such as gpp and re nidzieko et al 2014 th was the important indicator of tidal dynamics as illustrated in table 7 th was not significant correlated with gpp and re however the results of path analysis exhibited significant direct and indirect effect of th on gpp table 8a increased turbidity induced by tidal action might explain the influence on gpp according to guo 2010 pn was influenced by tidal action and related to changes in the size of tide in yangtze river estuary in january pn was close to zero and their difference between spring and neap tides was small in april and july gpp in spring tide was higher than those in neap tide negative correlation between pn and th was found and daily net ecosystem production varied largely which not only made pn and th show simple linear relation syed et al 2006 aurela et al 2007 whether pn was greater than zero or less than zero was depended on tide action the estuarine ecosystem was autotrophic when spring tide turned into neap tide and heterotrophic when neap tide into spring tide nidzieko et al 2014 in addition tidal action reduced community respiration especially in growing season however compared with other wetlands not affected by tidal hydrodynamics estuarine wetlands could transport a large amount of organic matter to coastal waters meanwhile a large number of organic matter inshore can also be tansported to estuary turner et al 1979 in haihe estuary hydrodynamics induced high turbidity due to a high sediment load especially when sudden freshwater inflow discharged shen et al 2015 and tides occurred the impact of turbidity on pn might be more prominent under high temperature tang et al 2015 which was in accordance with the results in our study in haihe estuary freshwater inflow was discharged irregularly after the construction of haihe gate gpp and re decreased surprisingly in july and august high turbidity caused by high freshwater inflow in rainy season may be one main factor in addition the increase of some phytoplankton biomass due to lower salinity when higher freshwater inflow discharged was less than offset by lower light availability and input of nutrients from the river azevedo et al 2008 2014 therefore freshwater inflow management is important for the influence of freshwater inflow on primary production in estuarine ecosystem 4 4 effects of other factors on gpp and re predation of consumers also affected gpp and re by food chain interactions significant correlations were observed between gpp and zooplankton between re and zooplankton as well as benthic macroinvertebrate table 7 as dominant population of haihe estuary in spring and summer a massive increase of planktonic greens induced the rapid growth of zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrate which fed on planktonic greens kim et al 2000 flores et al 2005 then gpp and re increased in autumn a decrease in planktonic algae resulted in the decrease of zooplankton from results of tables 8a and 8b feeding effect of copepod on gpp and that of rotifer on re were found although the direct path coefficient between them was relatively lower the indirect effect of zooplankton on gpp and re by other factors should not be ignored salinity was not significantly correlative with gpp and re from table 7 however the indirect effect of salinity on re was found in table 8b with higher indirect path coefficient 0 605 which was incompletely consistent with a previous study in yangtze river estuary gong et al 2015 explained by negative correlation between salinity and primary production lower salinity might favour the growth of freshwater phytoplankton and implied higher primary production azevedo et al 2014 and respiration caffrey et al 2014 generally gpp and re were influenced by a series of environmental factors in estuarine area which could be simulated by state and driving variables in the model the application of aquatox 3 1 plus to the estuary has provided a useful tool for estuarine ecosystem management it has given useful estimates for the estuarine ecosystem function because the model contains multiple parameter libraries can not only simulate water quality water quantity and different population biomass according to the actual situation of the object but also can simulate complex food web the model also can be used to control the biomass of producers and consumers then to control the gross primary production and ecosystem respiration by adjusting the freshwater inflow or other parameters sensitivity analysis to compute error and estimate uncertainty in ecosystem metabolism measurements improves their applicability for addressing resource management questions the difference between gpp and re can be used to evaluate what has been called the trophic state of an aquatic ecosystem dodds and cole 2007 deviations from gpp re balance means that the aquatic ecosystem responses to recent or nearby perturbations yvon durocher et al 2010 furthermore aquatox linking to climate hydrological and hydro dynamic models can simulate more complex integrated environmental effects on the aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusion a food web coupled water quality and water quantity model was implemented to exploringly simulate gross primary production and ecosystem respiration of estuarine ecosystem in north china moreover the parameter sensitivity and the influences of environmental factors on gross primary production and community respiration were analyzed after model calibration significant temporal variations of gpp and re in haihe estuary were exhibited the ecosystem was net autotrophic in summer and heterotrophic in spring and autumn gpp was most sensitive to blue greens parameters especially these of maximum photosynthetic rate temperature response slope and optimal temperature re was strongly related to temperature and the most sensitive parameter was average epilimnetic temperature gpp and re were influenced by a series of environmental factors in haihe estuary the increase of gpp and re might be stimulated by light intensity meanwhile freshwater inflow and tidal height played an important role in estuarine environment furthermore salinity predation by food web as well as interaction among factors should not be ignored although water quality water quantity biota and tidal fluctuations were considered in the model which was able to simulate the estuarine biogeochemical temporal dynamics some issues arose that need further work before full validation can be achieved one of issues is the lack of hourly tidal fluctuations in which aquatox time step is one day that prevents a better estimation of tidal hydrodynamics effect on gpp and re

25313,aquatox coupled water quality and estuarine hydrodynamic model based on food web was implemented to simulate the temporal variations of gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration re in haihe estuary of north china also the parameter sensitivity was calculated and the main factors of gpp and re were analyzed results showed that gpp ranged from 16 to 1789 mg o2 m 2 d 1 and re from 56 to 1083 mg o2 m 2 d 1 respectively gpp and re exhibited significant temporal variation and both reached the highest level in june however gpp and re reduced in july and august which could be explained by the increase of turbidity caused by high freshwater inflow discharge in rainy season maximum photosynthetic rate of blue greens was the most sensitive parameter to gpp re was strongly related to temperature the most sensitive parameter was average epilimnetic temperature a significant negative correlation was found between gpp re and freshwater inflow furthermore significant direct and indirect effects of tidal height on gpp were observed by path analysis increased turbidity induced by tidal action might explain the influence on gpp keywords primary production ecosystem respiration estuarine ecosystem aquatox 1 introduction estuarine areas are at the interface between land and sea in which many critical physical chemical processes occur such as dynamic mixing of fresh and oceanic waters sediment deposition and pollutant retention dale et al 2004 engle et al 2007 fu et al 2014 cindrić et al 2015 shen et al 2015 however natural variability of river inputs to estuaries had been greatly modified by human activities such as dam construction and flood protection burke et al 2009 mittal et al 2014 nidzieko et al 2014 freshwater inflow was likely to eliminate in most estuaries azevedo et al 2010 2014 shen et al 2015 yan et al 2016 and its tidal behaviour was changed vieira and bordalo 2000 azevedo et al 2008 these changes caused alterations of biological communities in species composition diversity abundance and distribution then estuarine ecosystem metabolism chicharo et al 2006 greet et al 2011 rovira et al 2012 webb et al 2012 belmar et al 2013 tang et al 2015 as important indicators of ecosystem metabolism gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration re played important roles in biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems an analysis of 350 published studies of aquatic ecosystem metabolism revealed that this research had been done predominantly in north america 68 usa and canada with fewer in europe 27 and very few in asia and africa 6 staehr et al 2012 most of the past studies were on descriptive studies of annual seasonal or daily changes of primary production and respiration and the development of new techniques to measure net ecosystem production several approaches such as bottle and chamber incubations kemp et al 1997 gazeau et al 2005 the diel open water technique caffrey 2003 staehr and sand jensen 2007 tang et al 2015 and oxygen isotopes quay et al 1995 ostrom et al 2005 had been applied to aquatic ecosystems to estimate gpp and re in recent years modeling has eventually become an important topic staehr et al 2012 coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical models had been used to analysis the relationship between physical chemical processes and ecosystem metabolism for example trancoso et al 2005 found that hydrodynamic conditions might be important for the productivity of phytoplankton and macroalgae after the application of a 3d hydrodynamic ecological model into ria de aveiro portugal to simulate estuarine dynamics and productivity of these two primary producers azevedo et al 2010 2014 implemented a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model to evaluate the influence of different freshwater discharge regimes on phytoplankton biomass and production of the douro estuary tang et al 2015 developed a system dynamics model for the middle water body to simulate diel do variability and sequentially net ecosystem metabolism the results showed the critical effects of artificial hydrological alterations to ecological processes in estuarine ecosystems however the focus of most studies was on phytoplankton community other biological communities such as macrophyte periphyton zooplankton and zoobenthos communities were ignored moreover gpp and re were driven by a series of environmental factors such as temperature salinity wind light nutrients hydrodynamics even biological feeding in estuarine ecosystem caffrey 2003 caffrey et al 2014 testa and kemp 2008 azevedo et al 2008 rochelle newall et al 2011 parker et al 2012 tang et al 2015 the effects of a single stressor were difficult to separate from that of other stressors e g predation therefore it was significant to take into account combined pressure such as water quantity water quality and biological feeding aquatox model is a general water ecological model that represents the combined environmental fate and effects of conventional pollutants such as nutrients and sediments and toxic chemicals in aquatic ecosystems park and clough 2014 which was described extensively in the literatures park et al 2008 applied the aquatox model to simulate ecosystem environmental fate and ecological effects of pollutants in lakes and other aquatic ecosystems and obtained direct or indirect influence of various factors on the lakes niu et al 2016 predicted the variations of nutrient with the changes of plant and animal species in a landscape lake using aquatox model clough et al 2017 estimated natural resource injuries for the deepwater horizon oil release using aquatox release 3 1 aquatox model was also applied in determining the ecological risk assessment of organic chemicals in aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2013 zhang and liu 2014 lombardo et al 2015 however the studies of aquatox model application mainly focused on the variances of ecosystem structural metrics measured by biomass when affected by light nutrient or chemical stressors the functional metrics such as gpp and re were reported less the aim of the study was to develop an aquatox model for estuarine ecosystem and simulate the temporal change of gpp and re in estuarine ecosystem analyze the main factors of gpp and re by stepwise multiple regression analysis and path analysis based on the model output it perhaps is the first application of aquatox in gpp and re simulation of estuarine ecosystem the study is helpful for us to understand correlation between physical chemical processes and ecosystem metabolism and gives information for estuarine ecosystem management 2 model and materials 2 1 model description aquatox developed by us epa in 2002 for release 1 is updated in 2014 for release 3 1 plus the model includes five parameter libraries and contains a large number of model parameters the model parameters provide relevant coefficients for the process functions users can use the default input parameters of the model itself and also specify values in terms of the specific circumstances of simulated objects aquatox considers several trophic levels including producer populations consumer populations and detritus it can be implemented as a truly complex food web model and provides a means for simulations of aquatic ecosystem metabolism even in estuarine environment gpp is defined as the total autotrophic conversion of inorganic carbon to organic forms re is the total oxidation of organic c to inorganic c by both heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms where re is the sum of the respiration of the autotrophs ra and that of the heterotrophic organisms rh lovett et al 2006 dodds and cole 2007 net ecosystem production pn is the difference between gpp and re pn gpp re and reflects the balance between all anabolic pn 0 and catabolic processes pn 0 fig 1 provides conceptual model of different trophic biological communities of aquatic ecosystem with gpp re and pn dominant species found in haihe estuary had been modeled with aquatox release 3 1 plus in the study these are three phytoplankton one periphyton one macrophyte two zooplankton three benthic macroinvertebrate

city the average temperature was 12 3 and the water depth 5 10 m this is a shallow water area with a mild slope 0 001 0 008 and fine silt bottom 0 02 mm now river runoff decreased to less than 9 108 m3 y due to water extraction or dam construction in the upstream of haihe river lei et al 2007 after the construction of haihe gate tidal regime was characterized by a standing wave behaviour and the topography of the estuary was changed sand shoals appeared 5 km away from the haihe gate with its length 5 6 km and width 6 km the reclamation of tianjin lingang industrial area along the bay was another factor impacting the topography of haihe estuary the presence of these impacts was significant to hydrodynamics of haihe estuary in aquatox output parameters hydrodynamics were represented by inflowh2o called freshwater inflow in the study and tidal height amplitudes and epochs for 4 parameters of tidal range m2 principal lunar semidiurnal constituent s2 principal solar semidiurnal

measured by elemental analyzer in state key joint laboratory of environmental simulation and pollution control of beijing normal university the characteristics of hydrological and water physicochemical parameters in haihe estuary were shown in table 2 the initial biomass of phytoplankton blue greens greens diatoms and zooplankton copepod rotifer were obtained in the literature zhang et al 2011 2015 biomass of macrophytes myriophyllum were analyzed according to chen et al 2005 the sampling methods of myriophyllum was as follows three 2 m 2 m quadrats were set in each plot the samples were taken into sealed polyethylene bags after foreign substance being picked out the myriophyllum was weighed with electronic balance the biomass of benthic macroinvertebrate surf clam crab shrimp and fish carp catfish were obtained in the literature the biological parameters of each population were given in tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 3 model calibration and validation in order to improve the agreement between model output and a data set adjustment of some model parameters and constants was made under control conditions i e without toxicant during the 8 month survey period parameters listed in table 5 were adjusted for calibration primary production was significant correlated with the biomass of primary producers wang et al 2010 model calibration for haihe estuary using biological community biomass as the primary target against with model output was optimized calibration adequacy was evaluated subjectively based on generally approximate concordance with observed data as determined through graphical comparisons of model output and observed data quantitative measures to evaluate the adequacy of the calibration and model performance were also employed the modified index of agreement d1 and the modified coefficient of efficiency e1 legates and mccabe 1999 are robust measures of how well central tendencies of predicted and observed results correspond the equations of d1 and e1 are as follows d 1 1 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n p i o o i o e 1 1 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i o where oi is an observed value at each time pi is a predicted value at each time ō is a mean observed value n is number of observed value five categories were classified according to model performance henriksen et al 2003 when the values of d1 and e1 were in the range of 0 0 20 model performance were classified as very bad in the range of 0 20 0 50 model performance were classified as bad for the range of 0 50 0 65 model performance were good for the range of 0 65 0 85 and 0 85 1 model performance were very good and excellent root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae are popular statistical method to test model performances in model studies the equations of rmse and mae were as follows r s m e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 m a e 1 n i 1 n o i p i where oi is the measured data and pi is the predicted value the value of rmse and mae closer to zero indicates a better fit to observed value table 6 provides values of the goodness of fit criteria computed for the simulated biological state variables 2 4 sensitivity analysis to estimate possible variability or uncertainty for each item of the input data and deduce probable errors in the output the highest possible sensitivity input parameters should be identified aquatox includes a built in nominal range sensitivity analysis which varies each user specified parameter and loading by plus and minus a given percentage and ranks them according to how much each input affects the target output the sensitivity is calculated by the following expression s e n s i t i v i t y r e s u l t p o s r e s u l t b a s e l i n e r e s u l t n e g r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 2 r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 100 p c t c h a n g e d where sensitivity normalized sensitivity statistic resultscenario averaged aquatox result for a given endpoint given a positive change in the input parameter a negative change in the input parameter or no change in the input parameter baseline pctchanged percent that the input parameter is modified in the positive and negative directions in this sensitivity analysis a 15 change was made in tested parameters simulation period was from april 1 2011 to november 30 2011 the tested parameters include not only parameters of producers but also parameters of consumers table 5 as well as site characteristics mean depth maximum depth epilimnetic temperature hypolimnetic temperature average light and average light range and some initial conditions 2 5 data analysis aquatox outputs from april 1 2011 to november 30 2011 were exported and saved in excel format careful comparison between gpp re and environmental factors was made by regression linear analysis with spss 16 0 spss inc chicago usa in order to further clarify the direct effects of environmental factors on gpp and re and indirect effects of environmental factors due to interaction among them on gpp and re path analysis was carried out by constraining environmental variables using spss 16 0 path analysis was developed as a method of decomposing correlations into different pieces for interpretation of effects which is closely related to multiple regression a direct path coefficient is given after a significance test for significant variables and an indirect path coefficient is calculated according to path analysis theory 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the comparisons between model outputs and observed data were exhibited in fig 3 visual comparison of the observed and simulated data indicated that the model adequately described the dynamics of six community biomass during different periods as shown in table 6 d1 ranged from 0 62 to 0 79 e1 were in the range of 0 50 to 0 67 which meant model performances were good or very good according to the defined categories the mean value of d1 for phytoplankton was the highest and d1 for periphyton was the lowest e1 for phytoplankton was the maximum and for fish the minimum rmse and mae were relatively little all were below 0 150 the rmse of periphyton zooplankton benthic macroinvertebrate and fish as well as mae of periphyton macrophyte zooplankton benthic macroinvertebrate and fish were very small closer to zero therefore model simulations provided a satisfied representation of biological community biomass in haihe estuary in early summer phytoplankton grew quickly and its biomass was the highest fig 3a the biomass of benthic diatom peaked in summer and early autumn fig 3b zooplankton biomass was in the order spring summer autumn fig 3d the biomass of macrophyte benthic macroinvertebrate and fish all peaked in summer and early autumn fig 3c e f 3 2 sensitivity analysis the end results of sensitivity analysis were exhibited by tornado diagrams in the tornado diagram red lines represent model results when the given parameter is reduced by the user input percentage while blue lines represent a positive change in the parameter 100 sensitivity means that a 15 change in the parameter results in a 15 change in the endpoint fig 4 a and b showed the parameters that greatly contributed to variation of gpp and re respectively where a 15 change was made in tested parameters the larger the sensitivity the greater model parameter contribution was to gpp or re obviously gpp was most sensitive to blue greens parameters especially these of maximum photosynthetic rate temperature response slope and optimal temperature fig 4 a in the simulation blue greens comprised 30 of the predicted biomass moreover the results indicated that if the blue greens maximum photosynthetic rate were to be rised gpp would be a significant increase reduced the blue greens temperature response slope and optimal temperature the blue greens would thrive in cooler water and cause a gpp increase in the simulation site characteristics such as average light intensity water volume maximum water depth and temperature also had significant effects on gpp other sensitive parameters include mortality coefficient for surf clam maximum consumption for rotifer respiration rate for shrimp and mortality coefficient for catfish these are predators for algae and macrophyte however the tornado diagram reflected a unidirectional response to these parameters gpp had a slight increase whether these predators increased or decreased an explanation of this phenomenon might result from equilibrium states of aquatic ecosystem which illustrated the importance of food chain interactions when using aquatox model compared with gpp calculated sensitivity statistics for re were generally lower re was strongly related to temperature the most sensitive parameter was average epilimnetic temperature increasing epilimnetic temperature caused an increase to re initial water volume was also important other sensitive parameters for this category were dominated by dominant population effects such as phytoplankton greens and blue greens and zooplankton rotifer 3 3 temporal variation of gpp and re significant temporal variations of gpp and re in haihe estuary were exhibited in fig 5 it was illustrated that gpp ranged from 16 to 1789 mg o2 m 2 d 1 and re from 56 to 1083 mg o2 m 2 d 1 in haihe estuary respectively gpp was the highest in early summer and apparently higher than this in spring and autumn which was in accordance with the biomass of phytoplankton cai et al 2013 in summer photo plankton grew rapidly and peaked due to high temperature and light availability re in spring was the highest followed by summer and the lowest in autumn which was not consistent with the variations of gpp results suggested that pn ranged from 1046 to 1038 mg o2 m 2 d 1 in summer pn was greater than zero gpp re which indicated that aquatic ecosystem was net autotrophic in spring and autumn pn was less than zero gpp re and aquatic ecosystem was net heterotrophic 3 4 relation between gpp re and environmental factors the important point of the study was to ascertain the existence of possible relationships between gpp re and environmental factors after long time exposure to stressor factors ecosystem function was supposed to get integrative responses adapted to them the results of regression linear analysis illustrated fairly good correlations of gpp with light do fi wv copepod and rotifer table 7 re also showed significant relation with t tn tp do fi copepod rotifer shrimp and crab pn exhibited significant correlation with light trans do and toc in path analysis t x1 light x2 salinity x3 tn x4 tp x5 trans x6 do x7 bod5 x8 fi x9 th x10 wv x11 copepod x12 rotifer x13 surf clam x14 shrimp x15 crab x16 carp x17 and catfish x18 were selected as independent variable and gpp y or re y as dependent variable after a significance test according to path analysis theory the direct path coefficient and indirect path coefficient between dependent variable and independent variables were illustrated in tables 8a and 8b the higher the absolute value of path coefficient was the greater the impact as shown in table 8a among the eighteen variables the direct effect of light and the indirect effect of tn on gpp were the highest with the absolute values of direct path coefficient and indirect path coefficient 0 558 and 0 696 respectively the direct effect of environmental parameters on gpp ordered as follows light th t tn fi copepod from table 8b we could find that the direct effect of t on re was the highest with direct path coefficient 0 690 the direct effects of environmental parameters on re were in the order t do rotifer tn bod5 salinity fi the indirect effect of tn was the highest with maximum of indirect path coefficient 0 989 4 discussion 4 1 variation of gpp and re as described in table 9 the mean value of gpp in haihe estuary was much lower than this in haihe river hydrodynamic characteristics of estuarine ecosystem were perhaps the main factor influencing the gpp which would be discussed in the next meanwhile the mean value of gpp in haihe estuary was slightly higher than this in bohai bay furthermore gpp in haihe estuary was lower than those in florida coast and apalachicola bay of america douro estuary of portuguesa yellow river estuary yangtze river estuary and pearl river estuary of china among these estuaries except douro estuary of portuguesa other estuaries lies below 38 latitude north higher temperature and light intensity might be the main factors influencing gpp the latitude of douro estuary 41 14 n was slightly higher than that of haihe estuary 38 9 n since temperature and light intensity conditions were similar other factors influencing gpp might be higher river flow or lower salinity of douro estuary which might favour freshwater phytoplankton production azevedo et al 2006 the mean value of pn in haihe estuary was 157 mg o2 m 2 d 1 which meant aquatic ecosystem was net autotrophic in fact this phenomenon occurred in summer only aquatic ecosystem was net heterotrophic in spring and autumn the possible reasons were as follows first large amount of oxygen was consumed by biological degradation of organic pollutants due to inputs of organic pollutants upstream second primary production of phytoplankton was inhibited because of high turbidity in haihe estuary third metabolism of heterotrophic organism consumed large amount of oxygen as a results of its high proportion in community composition compared with other estuaries in the world pn in haihe estuary was lower than these in florida coast and monterey bay of america and higher than these in apalachicola bay of america yellow river estuary and yangtze river estuary of china 4 2 effects of light intensity on gpp and re gpp and re were driven by a series of environmental factors in haihe estuary such as temperature nutrients hydrodynamics etc as exhibited in fig 5 gpp and re peaked in summer june such variation had been observed in previous studies in mexico estuary caffrey et al 2014 yellow river estuary shen et al 2015 and pearl river estuary jiang et al 2010 furthermore gpp and re in some everglades hagerthey et al 2010 lakes staehr and sand jensen 2007 yan et al 2014 reached the highest level in summer the increase of gpp and re in summer might be stimulated by photosynthetically active radiation the portion of total solar radiation in the waveband 0 4 0 7 μm ross and sulev 2000 increasing solar radiation 233 56 62 54 wm 2 determined high photosynthetically active radiation in summer and subsequently higher photosynthesis rate shen et al 2015 the light intensity of haihe estuary reached the highest value in july from fig 6 a however in july and august gpp and re decreased according to fitch and christine 2014 penetration depth of light intensity was influenced by water transparency in haihe estuary very fine silt existed at the bottom and suspended as a response to hydrodynamics therefore intenser hydrodynamics induced higher turbidity suspended matter determined light quantity and spectral quality at a given depth which in turn affected photosynthetic output obrador and pretus 2008 furthermore in july and august the turbidity increased under high freshwater inflow which explained the decrease of gpp and re in summer in spring and autumn despite similar temperature and light intensity re in spring was higher than those in autumn which was likely to be explained by higher nutrient and lower freshwater inflow from the river especially an increase of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus stimulated microbial activity fig 6b rn in spring was much higher than those in autumn consequently the minimum of pn was detectable in spring in general aquatic ecosystem was net autotrophic in summer and net heterotrophic in spring and autumn similar results were found in previous studies in yellow river estuary liu 2015 which indicated that despite high inputs of organic pollutants metabolism restoration of estuary in summer was faster than those in other seasons due to high temperature nutrient and photosynthetically active radiation 4 3 effects of hydrodynamics on gpp and re a temporal analysis of gpp and re in haihe estuary showed that they were greatly influenced by hydrodynamics freshwater inflow fi and tidal height th are often used as important indicators of hydrodynamic characteristics in estuarine ecosystem in the model the estuarine ecosystem was assumed to have two layers the two layers were assumed to vary with freshwater inflow and daily tidal hydrodynamics water property in upper layer was distinct with those in lower layer in upper layer of water in haihe estuary negative relation was observed between gpp and fi in lower layer of water negative correlations were also found between fi and gpp re and pn furthermore th was correlated with re the dynamics of gpp and re varied in response to fi change increases in stream flow wind driven mixing and sediment resuspension elicited clear responses in magnitude and balance of ecosystem primary production and community respiration staehr et al 2012 high flow was often accompanied by pulsed inputs of inorganic nutrients dissolved organic carbon and suspended sediments which could induce both positive and negative effects on primary production and respiration staehr et al 2010 however in response to extreme disturbances e g floods surface sediments such as periphyton and different trophic food web would be damaged rendering the aquatic ecosystem heterotrophic and difficult to recover rapidly gerull et al 2012 the growth of phytoplankton response to flow magnitude resulted in lower or higher primary production azevedo et al 2008 2014 in douro estuary negative relation was observed between river flow and primary production explained by a lower residence time and light availability under higher flows and by a lower input of phytoplankton biomass and nutrients from the river azevedo et al 2008 nevertheless inverse relationship was obtained in further studies which might be explained by lower salinity and therefore higher chlorophyll a and nitrate levels leading to higher primary production azevedo et al 2014 in yellow river estuary gpp re and pn were still relatively high after short time high flow shen et al 2015 therefore effects of fi on gpp and re were significant different even in the same estuary in haihe estuary significant negative correlation between gpp or re and fi was shown table 7 fi played an important role in the gpp and re with direct path coefficient 0 175 and indirect path coefficient 0 08 for gpp tables 8a and with direct path coefficient 0 006 and indirect path coefficient 0 111 for re table 8b although the values of direct path coefficient were relatively low fi influenced gpp and re by other factors such as tn which could be found in table 8a with indirect path coefficient 0 337 by tn and 0 651 by tn in table 8b furthermore negative relation between gpp or re and fi could also be inferred from figs 5 and 6 b in which gpp and re increased when fi fell in may 2011 whereas gpp re decreased when fi increased despite of high temperature and light intensity in july 2011 and gpp re remained low in august to november 2011 as unique hydrology characteristics of estuarine ecosystem tidal action greatly influenced physical and chemical properties of water e g salinity and turbidity maccready and geyer 2010 and then ecosystem functions such as gpp and re nidzieko et al 2014 th was the important indicator of tidal dynamics as illustrated in table 7 th was not significant correlated with gpp and re however the results of path analysis exhibited significant direct and indirect effect of th on gpp table 8a increased turbidity induced by tidal action might explain the influence on gpp according to guo 2010 pn was influenced by tidal action and related to changes in the size of tide in yangtze river estuary in january pn was close to zero and their difference between spring and neap tides was small in april and july gpp in spring tide was higher than those in neap tide negative correlation between pn and th was found and daily net ecosystem production varied largely which not only made pn and th show simple linear relation syed et al 2006 aurela et al 2007 whether pn was greater than zero or less than zero was depended on tide action the estuarine ecosystem was autotrophic when spring tide turned into neap tide and heterotrophic when neap tide into spring tide nidzieko et al 2014 in addition tidal action reduced community respiration especially in growing season however compared with other wetlands not affected by tidal hydrodynamics estuarine wetlands could transport a large amount of organic matter to coastal waters meanwhile a large number of organic matter inshore can also be tansported to estuary turner et al 1979 in haihe estuary hydrodynamics induced high turbidity due to a high sediment load especially when sudden freshwater inflow discharged shen et al 2015 and tides occurred the impact of turbidity on pn might be more prominent under high temperature tang et al 2015 which was in accordance with the results in our study in haihe estuary freshwater inflow was discharged irregularly after the construction of haihe gate gpp and re decreased surprisingly in july and august high turbidity caused by high freshwater inflow in rainy season may be one main factor in addition the increase of some phytoplankton biomass due to lower salinity when higher freshwater inflow discharged was less than offset by lower light availability and input of nutrients from the river azevedo et al 2008 2014 therefore freshwater inflow management is important for the influence of freshwater inflow on primary production in estuarine ecosystem 4 4 effects of other factors on gpp and re predation of consumers also affected gpp and re by food chain interactions significant correlations were observed between gpp and zooplankton between re and zooplankton as well as benthic macroinvertebrate table 7 as dominant population of haihe estuary in spring and summer a massive increase of planktonic greens induced the rapid growth of zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrate which fed on planktonic greens kim et al 2000 flores et al 2005 then gpp and re increased in autumn a decrease in planktonic algae resulted in the decrease of zooplankton from results of tables 8a and 8b feeding effect of copepod on gpp and that of rotifer on re were found although the direct path coefficient between them was relatively lower the indirect effect of zooplankton on gpp and re by other factors should not be ignored salinity was not significantly correlative with gpp and re from table 7 however the indirect effect of salinity on re was found in table 8b with higher indirect path coefficient 0 605 which was incompletely consistent with a previous study in yangtze river estuary gong et al 2015 explained by negative correlation between salinity and primary production lower salinity might favour the growth of freshwater phytoplankton and implied higher primary production azevedo et al 2014 and respiration caffrey et al 2014 generally gpp and re were influenced by a series of environmental factors in estuarine area which could be simulated by state and driving variables in the model the application of aquatox 3 1 plus to the estuary has provided a useful tool for estuarine ecosystem management it has given useful estimates for the estuarine ecosystem function because the model contains multiple parameter libraries can not only simulate water quality water quantity and different population biomass according to the actual situation of the object but also can simulate complex food web the model also can be used to control the biomass of producers and consumers then to control the gross primary production and ecosystem respiration by adjusting the freshwater inflow or other parameters sensitivity analysis to compute error and estimate uncertainty in ecosystem metabolism measurements improves their applicability for addressing resource management questions the difference between gpp and re can be used to evaluate what has been called the trophic state of an aquatic ecosystem dodds and cole 2007 deviations from gpp re balance means that the aquatic ecosystem responses to recent or nearby perturbations yvon durocher et al 2010 furthermore aquatox linking to climate hydrological and hydro dynamic models can simulate more complex integrated environmental effects on the aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusion a food web coupled water quality and water quantity model was implemented to exploringly simulate gross primary production and ecosystem respiration of estuarine ecosystem in north china moreover the parameter sensitivity and the influences of environmental factors on gross primary production and community respiration were analyzed after model calibration significant temporal variations of gpp and re in haihe estuary were exhibited the ecosystem was net autotrophic in summer and heterotrophic in spring and autumn gpp was most sensitive to blue greens parameters especially these of maximum photosynthetic rate temperature response slope and optimal temperature re was strongly related to temperature and the most sensitive parameter was average epilimnetic temperature gpp and re were influenced by a series of environmental factors in haihe estuary the increase of gpp and re might be stimulated by light intensity meanwhile freshwater inflow and tidal height played an important role in estuarine environment furthermore salinity predation by food web as well as interaction among factors should not be ignored although water quality water quantity biota and tidal fluctuations were considered in the model which was able to simulate the estuarine biogeochemical temporal dynamics some issues arose that need further work before full validation can be achieved one of issues is the lack of hourly tidal fluctuations in which aquatox time step is one day that prevents a better estimation of tidal hydrodynamics effect on gpp and re

25314,under the proposition that all college students are able to learn to think in more systemic ways and understand the value of systems modeling for assisting their thinking i designed a course for freshmen with no more than basic algebra in this course the students were exposed to basic systems concepts with a focus on system dynamics modeling using donella meadows thinking in systems of a permaculture based food production system they were given a basic problem how much land area would be needed to collect enough solar energy in food plant photosynthesis per year to feed a community of fifty vegetarians they were told that the farm would be in the seattle wa usa area so they could find the average monthly insolation values several additional rate constants and conversion factors were provided so they could build a spreadsheet based model to generate the number of calories needed this paper provides anecdotal evidence that systems theory naïve students were able to successfully build a model in teams but also were able to apply systems thinking to aspects of their own lives as demonstrated in essays individuals many students reported seeing the world differently as a result of the course particularly seeing how different aspects of the world are connected through various relations as a result of these successes the course was upgraded to be a little more advanced for upper division students 2 problem project based learning ppbl a pedagogy for active learning keywords 2 systems thinking naïve learners system dynamics food production model problem and project based learning 1 introduction systems thinking has been defined differently by different authors but almost always indirectly even when the term thinking is used explicitly churchman 1968 meadows 2008 von bertalanffy 1969 weinberg 2001 many writers in the field of systems science seem to assume that there is a cognitive process thinking that is somehow better or at least enhanced by the content of thought being systems for an exception see checkland 1999 3 4 all authors of course go on to define what a system is that is what constitutes the conceptual framework of systemness and leave it to the readers imagination as to what systems thinking actually is all are convinced that once a person grasps the essence of systemness they will embark on a new kind of thinking in which they will see the world differently in my experience in teaching systems science to what i will call naïve students i e those who had never been exposed to the concept of systemness previously i have to conclude that those writers were correct over the last decade in teaching systems principles and methodologies to general studies students those who are non science majors seeking university distribution credits in science and to students explicitly studying computer science and engineering at levels from entering freshmen to graduate students in a master s program i have observed the majority of these students undergo a distinct change in their modes of thinking about the world and even their own lives rather than follow in the footsteps of my predecessor writers on this subject i want to provide a definition of systems thinking that will serve as a basis for making observations of students thinking modes and their evolution throughout the course these observations are pre scientific to be certain made casually but i hope with some scientific insights they may provide a basis for developing a more rigorous approach to the field of education in systems science systems thinking then is the cognitive ability of a person to perceive wholeness of a thing 3 3 the word thing is one of the most useful nouns in english similar words serving the same purposes are found in most other languages it serves as a placeholder for designating an object or relation between two objects prior to specifying what the thing is that such a word seems to exist in so many if not all languages suggests that the brain has a kind of template for systemness that is innate to perceive the connections between the thing and other things with which it interacts causally and to perceive the internal composition of sub things themselves interconnected and interacting to produce the thing itself they are able to see systems in the world and how those systems are connected more broadly but moreover they are able to see how the systems are organized for purposes and how if they fail to serve those purposes they will not be able to persist as systems finally it means that a person is able to use knowledge of systems to reason about the future states of the world based on those systems behaviors it should be clear from this description definition that much thinking fits in this model that is to say human beings naturally think in modes that reflect some implicit systemness even if only subconsciously c f arsenault and buchsbaum 2015 huth et al 2012 re representations mobus and anderson 2016 re language of thought or systemese mobus 1994 re causal modeling in the brain were it otherwise the world which is a system of systems would be unintelligible however the kind of systems thinking that most writers refer to is explicit or conscious systems thinking that is a person is consciously aware of the web of connections that link components together to make a system they are aware of the causal nature of the dynamics of components and how that results in the behavior of the whole and so on the significant difference between subconscious and conscious systems thinking is that the former is more or less taken for granted that is just common sense whereas the latter results in one becoming aware of non obvious aspects of a system that are part of systemness but not always immediately perceptible for example many complex systems like an organization have fuzzy boundaries that have to be inferred from understanding how systems interface with their environments something that can only be obtained through explicit understanding of boundary properties thus the proposition for teaching systems science i e explicit systems thinking is that it enables students to achieve greater reasoning power about the real systems they encounter because they have an explicit template for the patterns that must exist in those systems regardless of the specific medium i e biological social or ecological embedding those systems 2 background 2 1 course description name introduction to systems science credit hours 5 quarter hours class meets for 4 h each week with significant outside assignments class size 20 30 this course was designed with a summer stipend grant from the milgard school of business center for leadership and social responsibility faculty innovation support it was designed as a problem and project based course wherein lectures are kept to a minimum and the students learn by doing see section 3 1 the author had been teaching systems science in various other courses for general education and drew upon that experience to construct a course suitable for a wide audience the course as described in this paper has been taught for four years as both a 1st year required core course and as a service course for students needing science credits 2 2 student profiles students who took these courses ranged from liberal arts majors to environmental and computer science engineering they also ranged from entering freshmen through seniors in undergraduate programs a more advanced form of the course was offered to graduate students in a master s of computer science program most of the undergraduate students especially the lower division students came into the course with fairly weak mathematical maturity not an uncommon factor today most had some kind of lab based science in high school or as freshmen in college however i discovered early on that their retention of what they had been exposed to was nil for example most had some biology courses but when probed to recall how dna is transcribed to messenger rna and that providing the basis for protein synthesis the most common response could be summarized as i remember we talked about that but i don t remember the details 4 4 this is in fact one of the most common statements i hear in teaching computer science courses that have several prerequisite courses in which concepts and skills are meant to be retained for the later courses in other words many of the students taking these courses were profoundly ignorant when it came to any depth in science or math the basic course design was developed with three different student profiles in mind the first involved entering 1st year students who were required to take a series of core courses covering various university requirements in general education i e natural science math social science and humanities the university had designed the 1st year courses to give students an orientation experience that was to include interdisciplinary approaches to the general education subjects the second group of students were mostly upper division students who needed additional science credits toward the university requirements in this course i assumed that students would already be oriented to university level work so added some greater depth to some of the topics a final group was composed of master s level graduate students in computer science in this course i added a great deal more work in computer simulation development rather than using a spreadsheet to implement models these students were required to write the programs in languages like c or java in this article i will only be discussing the undergraduate versions of the courses with particular attention on the 1st year version as the change from naïve to informed thinker was most dramatic in this group 2 3 learning objectives the students were exposed to many aspects of systems science and systems thinking i set forth a few learning objectives that they could achieve that i could assess through their problem solving project accomplishment and exams these were 1 identify the major attributes of systemness in everyday encounters with real world systems 2 construct several kinds of models of relatively simple systems in the real world i e conceptual as well as dynamical 3 become able to interpret graphs generated by system dynamics models and reason about the underlying causes of behavior 3 pedagogy 3 1 problem and project based learning the main form of pedagogy used in these courses has been based on a combination of problem and project based learning ppbl 5 5 these methods are well explained in wikipedia articles https en wikipedia org wiki problem based learning and https en wikipedia org wiki project based learning accessed 7 02 2017 both of these methods are used often separately and described differently but both involve active learning by students in small groups teams where the objective is for the students to produce artifacts e g reports models or computer programs that answer particular requirements in both methods the students are given an objective e g a problem to solve or a larger research development project in which they must discover ways to approach solutions under the watchful eyes of the teacher who acts as a coach and guide but does not provide specific techniques unless the students get stuck it has been shown that both of these forms of learning lead to deeper grasp of the principles and procedures of a subject mergendoller et al 2006 as well as longer retention strobel and van barneveld 2009 6 6 the author has verified this through personal observations i teach a sequence of courses in computer architecture organization and operating systems the sequence builds on knowledge learned in the previous course students who took my first and second courses which were ppbl based performed much better in comprehensive final exams in the third course os than students in the same class but who had taken other sections from other teachers in the first two courses that used fairly standard lecture test based pedagogy other benefits reported for both of these approaches include enhanced life long learning and stronger orientation toward multi disciplinarity dods 1997 3 2 course structure and relation to the content in the course reported here the general schedule included the first five weeks of a ten week academic quarter devoted to a sequence of problems of increasing complexity designed to instill the major aspects of systemness principles of systems science such as how to see a system as a network of interrelations between component parts and identify circular causal relations i e feedback loops these were largely developed using various simple modeling methods the last five weeks were devoted to a team project involving constructing a fairly complex computer model of a system this project required students to draw on what they had learned in working the problems in order to be successful in producing the larger system model see section 4 for more about the curriculum 3 3 textbook i assigned readings from donella meadows 2008 book thinking in systems a primer this is a short very readable book where ms meadows has provided very simple explanations and examples that naïve students do not have trouble following the readings were parsed out in synchrony with the week s problem see below in curriculum in addition to the meadows book i provided students with extracts from holmgren s 2002 work and chapter 1 from mobus and kalton 2015 because some of the language used in these references differed somewhat i provided a short vocabulary reference to ease translation from one author to another 4 curriculum in this section 1 outline the basic curriculum content used in the course a central theme was the system for producing sufficient food to feed a small community most students today have a very vague notion of where their food comes from beyond buying it in a grocery store 4 1 setting the context of systems thinking permaculture one of the keys to developing a successful ppbl curriculum is establishing an overarching context for the problems and projects moreover the context has to involve something that provides motivation being something that students are already interested in or realize they have a lack of understanding in this course this is achieved by introducing them to the idea that they might one day have to grow their own food this part is a bit tricky in the first week we discuss the way in which societal institutions like the financial system seem to be faltering many students are actually already aware that there is something we call a new normal that is not the growth economy of their parents generation 7 7 in fact the real growth economy was between the end of wwii and the early 1970s when gdp increases in excess of 5 per year were not uncommon growth has been declining since and has been less than 4 on average since the 1980s nevertheless economists continue to insist that a return to the post war growth rates should be possible and desirable more people do seem to be aware that there is some possibility of a societal collapse that will mean individuals and families will need to become more self sufficient in the future we don t dwell on this eventuality in the class but cover it as a possible future and proceed to discuss how growing one s own food or for a community might be achieved i introduce them to an already functioning community concept called permaculture permanent culture as a systems approach to holistic living part of which includes organic gardening see holmgren 2002 most students respond reasonably well to this introduction their interests in learning more about a techy sounding notion systems science as it might apply to food production is usually triggered and their receptiveness to the need to learn concepts as well as methods is increased permaculture is precisely the application of systems thinking to creating and maintaining a sustainable living system for a small community 8 8 specifically the founders of permaculture gave credit to howard t odum s development of systems ecology as a major source of inspiration and guidance see holmgren 2002 odum et al 2004 and wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki permaculture accessed 7 04 2017 it does involve individual members of the community participating in all of the work processes needed to sustain it some students might not see this as a desirable condition in contrast to spending time on line in social media for example at the same time in class time open conversations about permaculture reveal that many students do grasp the sense in which participating in the work of the community adds meaning to one s life beyond gossip and entertainment for me personally this is encouraging 4 2 introducing principles of systems science and systems thinking the first four weeks of the course are devoted to introducing students to explicit principles of systems science mobus and kalton 2015 we do not cover the whole subject as presented in the referenced textbook rather the students are given copies of the introductory chapter of the book which has a survey of the major principles and their interrelations to one another and short lectures on the most cogent principles relevant to the course are given in this same time frame students are given weekly problems to be worked on in pairs each problem is related to the principle s covered in that week for example chapters 3 and 4 cover hierarchical organization and network relations respectively students are given the problem of analyzing the university administration from the chancellor down to department heads and show using a conceptual map how these are related to one another e g how the vice chancellor of academics relates to the deans and directors the students produce a typical organization chart but it also has cross linkages showing some of the interrelations between for example associate vice chancellors having various subsidiary duties that need to work with one another not only do the students learn about graphic representations of organization they also learn a great deal about how their university is managed by a hierarchy of administrators the main principles covered in some depth include representation e g conceptual mapping hierarchical organization network relations complexity related to hierarchies and composition dynamics the latter three subjects are introduced in the context of system dynamics modeling other principles covered in overview include auto organization emergence and evolution information computation and cybernetics simple control feedback all of these subjects are discussed with several examples from everyday experience with very little in the way of mathematics so that the general studies audience can relate to the concepts being covered graphics taken from mobus and kalton 2015 are used to illustrate the concepts and provide students with models of how to represent them all of these principles are related to similar concepts raised in meadows 2008 4 3 building models a central and main concept skill in this course is learning how to construct models of systems of interest that can be used to make predictions of future performance or answer critical questions which is what we do in this course the majority of students in the course have heard of the phrase model of a system or intuitively grasp the idea of using models of systems to understand them better few however have a clue as to how to construct a model based on mathematical relations that can be used to explore complex dynamics so the objective of the curriculum is to teach students through experiential learning how to analyze a system and construct a working model that can be used to answer critical questions in the undergraduate courses we construct models in several of the problems and in the project using conventional spreadsheet software every student these days has a laptop or notebook with some version of microsoft s excel or its equivalent columns are used to represent variables and their transformations rows are used to represent time steps in a time series the software has the capacity to generate graphic displays of the time series so that students can more readily understand the dynamics of system the concept of modeling dynamic systems is the core of the meadows book 2008 the series of problems described below all involve developing skills in constructing various models especially dynamic simulation models the curriculum follows the book fairly closely 4 4 a typical problem sequence the first five weeks of a quarter are spent working on a sequence of problems that are meant to teach students aspects of systems thinking as well as prepare them for the final project described in section 4 5 below the main skill they develop in this course and the main concepts they need to grasp are related to modeling in the lectures 9 9 i prefer the term chalk talk to lecture since these are short usually 15 20 min and involve drawing pictures on the whiteboard in class i cover the principles but always relating them to the way we create models of systems in order to understand those systems better if students keep up with the reading they generally have little trouble following these lectures and i use question asking and responses to gauge how well they have absorbed the reading if i sense that a significant proportion of students are lagging behind in the reading i will throw a pop quiz their way and this seems to keep them motivated to keep up in these weeks i present a series on increasingly sophisticated principles and examples see the figures below the students usually in groups of two then set about applying the principle s to some aspect of the food production process i use various examples of the principles so that they are exposed to the fact that the principles apply broadly 4 4 1 week 1 the first problem involves using meadows diagrammatic tools to build a conceptual model of something the students know something about i give them a number of suggestions of things they could begin to think of as systems fig 1 shows a sample of a conceptual model of the system composed of my refrigerator and me the objective of this problem is to get the students starting to think of how stocks or reservoirs and flows are arranged along with the concepts of control and influences e g me deciding when i need to go shopping boundaries and inputs and outputs students are asked to consider things or situations in their lives and try to envision them in this systems framework for some students this is a cognitive hurdle trying to understand the meaning of terms like stock or flow and how things in their lives can be characterized in this way other students seem to be able to develop the intuitions about these terms quite readily for example one student who had a job as an assistant manager in a clothing department in a well known retail outlet immediately realized that the backroom inventory was a large stock and clothing items flowed from that stock to the smaller floor inventory her model consisted of an inflow from a central warehouse to the store inventory and then to the floor display inventory and then out to customers 4 4 2 week 2 the second week of the course focused on the methods of system decomposition into subsystems i deviate from meadows diagrammatic methods in that i use a process semantics that encapsulates subsystems into ovals fig 2 shows a library system in which the various control subsystems are encapsulated as computational processes we start with a simple system composed of a stock shelves of books new titles come from outside from vendors they are put on shelves and entered into the library index books are loaned out to borrowers the students are then asked to decompose this system looking for the various decision processes that act to obtain new books appropriately shelve and catalog the books and oversee the loaning process in this exercise students are learning about the decomposition process as well as working with the concepts of controls we walk through the initial decomposition shown in the figure so that they get the idea of looking for decisions that need to be processed in order to move books through the system they see that a librarian actually has several jobs to do in this system and they learn about classifying decision processes i also introduce them to the basics of cybernetics negative and positive feedback e g how to keep the fixed volume of shelving from being overloaded from ordering new books without sending old books to recycling this exercise is backed up with readings from meadows along with some additional readings in cybernetics most important in this aspect is to show them that what they do in making decisions in their lives is an exercise in cybernetic principles for example when they decide to not go see a particular movie because it got bad reviews in rottentomatos com how they were using information in feedback from the reviewers to influence a decision had the movie gotten good reviews they would be influenced to go see it the point of decomposition is to show students how a system is comprised of smaller simpler subsystems in a hierarchical organization 4 4 3 week 3 in week three we start to get serious about dynamics how stocks change over time due to fluctuations in inflows and outflows we start with a simple model as in fig 3 what meadows calls a one bathtub model here we build a simplified spreadsheet model that includes controls and feedback so that students can see how decisions increasing or decreasing flow rates will cause the level in a stock to move up or down this model is a simplified version of a population model future levels depend on rates and current levels the objective of this exercise is to get students familiar with the way changing a constant rate constant or gain factor influences the behavior of the stock level they are asked to choose different values for gain or decay factors and then run the model generating graphs of the stock level over time this allows the students to interact directly with dynamical systems and observe how slight changes in constants can influence the overall behavior of the system students are required to write short essays about what they see happening typical of their writing students report at first being confused about why selecting values for the factors caused such different behaviors in the levels fig 4 shows an equilibrium state in which inflow equals outflow so the level stays at whatever level it started out usually randomized an objective of the exercise is to have students try to find a set of factors that will cause the stock level to approach an ideal value and then set the factors such that level is maintained what they have to discover is that they need to for example set the gain factor higher than the decay factor at first and then when the level gets closer to the ideal set the two values to be equal prizes are given for the student teams that get closest to the ideal and stay there after 1000 iterations at the end of the week we introduce the concept of noise or probabilistic systems fig 4 they re run the simulations now with various levels of noise injected into the control this exercise makes it clear that noisy inputs can create significant problems in coming to an equilibrium state as previously often times where students had been able to achieve equilibrium in fewer than 1000 iterations it now took them more than 2000 the concept of a noise filter is introduced to show them how they can gain better control again a simple finite impulse response fir filter is introduced see the figure that makes it relatively easy to achieve equilibrium again within the original 1000 steps students are not expected to grasp the nature of filters deeply but they are expected to understand how they make the problem of control more tractable through direct experience 4 4 4 week 4 in week four we develop a more complex multi stock and control factor model this is a week spent integrating what had been learned in the first three weeks and exploration of issues of complexity by this point students have become very familiar with the procedures of developing conceptual visual models of systems and translating those into spreadsheet computations in the second half of the week we re introduce the ideas about growing food systemically and begin the discussion of what we will need to do in order to build a model system to answer the key question how much land will be needed to grow enough food for 500 average people 4 4 5 week 5 in this week we start to make this question more meaningful most of the students have had some kind of introduction to photosynthesis biology is a required course for high school graduates but are not really conversant with the process of plant growth i use images from my own garden that show stages of plant growth cabbages and bush beans mostly to convey the ideas of rate of growth and maturation of edible crops 10 10 on a personal note it is very sad that so many students today are completely ignorant of what it takes to grow food most express amazement that i am able to grow produce that looks just like what you buy in the store through the week we begin to improve the model so that more stages stocks and flow rates are included for a more realistic picture of how sunlight is converted into edible biomass in many ways this is the most enjoyable part of the course because this is where students finally are exposed to how food is produced i have come to believe that this revelation is the single most motivating factor in their beginning to grasp the significance of systems thinking and modeling once we have built out a general model of food production we start in earnest the process of building a working model the first step is the acquisition of the original energy input data discussed above and shown in fig 5 this graph drives home the fact that sunlight availability and subsequent photosynthesis productivity is highly variable throughout the year the importance of this is in realizing that food grown during the productive months 5 8 in the northern hemisphere has to compensate for low growth months 1 4 and 9 12 through the appropriate management of stocks we ignore the notion of importing foods from other regions by the end of week 5 in a ten week quarter system the students have learned a significant amount about systems and modeling them from week 6 on we focus on the project of building a much more comprehensive model of a permaculture farm capable of sustaining 500 individuals throughout the year the students are left to devise their own model versions based on their understanding of the process i provide guidance to teams on an as needed basis when they get stuck or are going off on a tangent that would be non productive but in large i leave them to pursue their own paths in answering the primary research question about the amount of land required to no great surprise most of the teams derive very nearly similar answers lending support to the notion that the average general studies student has the intellectual capacity to grasp the systems approach 4 5 solving an important problem with systems thinking and modeling in our case the question we posed in the project is how many square meters of land would be needed to grow enough vegetables of mixed varieties to feed a community of 500 average vegetarian individuals living near seattle washington the students are expected to construct a working model of a permaculture farm i provide them with a starter model as in fig 5 below i then guide them through the process of analyzing the more complex issues that will result in a more complex model they take the next 5 weeks to do a system decomposition and decide what factors to include in their models they work in teams of two or three people the majority of class time is taken up with them working on the project and me circulating through the room asking each team to explain to me what they are doing at each stage of the project their objective is to produce a working model spreadsheet that produces reasonable numbers by the start of week 10 the final results of multiple teams do not always agree but are generally within an order of magnitude during the last class time each team demonstrates their model and its results graphs showing the dynamical behavior of each of the elements of the project question see table 1 below in order to make this project a bit simpler so it can be done in a five week period we use average calories per unit weight across the variety of food stuffs grown e g carrots wheat cabbages etc we also employ time averages over the course of converting solar energy into consumable nutrition and use monthly average data so that the model can be built in a conventional spreadsheet program admittedly the model is greatly simplified relative to the details that would embody a more realistic version however the objective of this course is just to get students familiar with the process of building a system model that is relatively realistic and understandable within the framework of a single ten week quarter the students are walked through the process of getting solar radiation data measured in kilowatt hours per unit area through the average process of photosynthesis and the amount of biomass increase that is consumable by humans e g fruiting bodies the technique is to ask students in the whole class to think about how to get the value of the next variable in a series across the spreadsheet table 1 provides the set of variables and factors that were used to compute a final solution to the question how much land will be needed to feed 500 people basic outline of the model i used a socratic method to get students to think about what factors were needed in the sequence given in table 1 for example after explaining the difference between units of measure of energy in joules btus and physiological calories i ask them what they will need to know in order to get from solar input in kwh per unit area per month to calories per unit area per month as a rule this tends to be a difficult thing for freshmen and for about half of the general studies upper division students the application of conversion factors to get from one unit to another is unfortunately still not clearly understood by many undergraduates on the other hand this is an opportunity to get the students to work through the process with something that they do understand the context of once they do work through this initial conversion the ones that follow e g computing the number of calories embodied in biomass became much easier students began to get the process by which we get to the numbers desired from the numbers given via these conversion factors some of the data needed such as the insolation data for a given geographical region i require the students to extract from a database given the latitude and longitude of a location e g seattle wa they are asked to produce a table of average monthly insolation per square meter there are a number of databases having these numbers but they come in a variety of units of measure for example units of time hours vs days or area meters vs feet so one of the first challenges for students is how to get the data into the form needed for the modeling project this is where the weekly problem work comes into play obtaining the insolation data in the proper form is posed as the fourth problem in the series of weekly problems thus the students learn a valuable skill finding data and converting to a usable form prior to actually starting the final project building the model 5 observations in this last section i want to offer some observations regarding how the average general studies that is non science major student assimilates and uses systems thinking and a systems approach to understanding complex systems most of the students freshmen and upper division alike are not science majors our campus only offers bs degrees in computer science engineering and environmental science the freshmen are still considered general studies students even if they express an interest in the sciences which are few in my surveys of desired majors at the start of the course so the majority of students in both versions of the class have little more than casual interest in science 5 1 throughout the course in the first class of the quarter i take a survey to find out not only what majors or interests students have but also what they already know about systems science the questions i asked sought to determine how aware students were of the principles and the role they played in understanding things in the world as systems for example complexity of a system is a property of 1 the number of components that make up the system 2 the number of different kinds of components 3 the hierarchy of organization i e components being composed of smaller components 4 all of the above 5 none of the above answer 4 very few students get this right most answer either 1 or 2 some answer 5 when i ve asked students to explain why they did not choose 4 they confessed that they didn t understand what 3 meant and therefore thought the answer could not be 4 this is not surprising upon deeper inquiry it turns out that most students while knowing the word hierarchy could not describe what it meant some equated it with bureaucracy so they had a vague sense of layers of authority if not function other questions involved dynamics or behavior such as what is are the important variable s to measure over time to describe the state of a pendulum most students have some idea that what is important is where the pendulum is as it swings but do not know why this matters again deeper inquiry revealed that most students were satisfied with their own intuitions folk physics and did not think there was anything more to dynamics than just the fact that things moved similar results came from questions regarding network structures information feedback and self organization processes i feel completely justified in asserting that these students are vaguely aware of a general notion of organization and dynamics but can be easily described as naïve similar questions were asked at the end of the course the final exam to assess their learning as a result of the course i wish i could report substantial improvements across the board however the practical interpretation of the final exam results is that students had become aware of the concepts and that they were important to understand but the depth of their explicit understanding had not improved substantially what differed in the course was their implicit understanding of systemness this was demonstrated in their successful completion of the project there were some notable variations among the models produced such as the number of nodes e g the boxes and controls shown in fig 1 above and the flows interconnecting them there were for example some differences in decision processes as in fig 3 however all of the models showed the same basic and generally correct overall structure and functions all tracked embodied energy through a feedforward process with appropriate storage stages as justified by the assumptions explicitly made e g boundaries in their reports there was a small amount of variability in the final answer vis à vis the amount of land needed about an order of magnitude in most cases with a mean value very close to the reasonable number the structures were described in their reports as a flow network feedback and feedforward controls were explicitly described and related to the appropriate stocks e g biomass growing in the field biomass in harvested storage etc these results show that in stark contrast to the students explicit grasp of systems theory still somewhat weak their implicit understanding was quite high as a final exercise i like to have an open discussion about how they show understanding by doing whereas they still seem to be struggling with the theoretical concepts the final exam is given before the final presentation of models and reports this way i go armed with the results of their exam results which i report to the class after their public presentations of their projects using a few of the concepts from questions on the exam the ones most students did poorly on i ask them to relate the concept to their projects and challenge them to explain why they got it right on the project but didn t seem to get it on the exam this is something of a revelation to many students who upon reflection make the connection between the concept and what they did in their projects for example a question about the mass energy balance of flow networks is usually answered incorrectly by 60 of the students on the exam but they are able to explain the principles conservation of mass and energy plus second law effects as implemented in their model calculations if there were more time i would love to give a second final exam to see if this reflection exercise made a substantial difference in their grasp of the principles unfortunately a ten week quarter doesn t give this luxury 5 2 after the course a number of students who have taken one of my systems courses have communicated with me several quarters later or even after graduation a number of computer science and engineering students who took my course as an elective showed up in one of my upper division classes such as operating systems where they informed me that the systems course made them much more aware of the internals of other complex systems and how they worked together to produce the whole system behavior operating systems is a particularly good course in which to continue exploring issues of complexity hierarchical organization control and feedback and other general systems aspects it was not hard to detect how those students who had the systems course were applying that knowledge to do this exploration in addition to seeing students in later courses i have had a number of former students especially from the freshman core courses send me e mails years later remarking how helpful systems thinking had been for them in other courses and jobs it would be very interesting to do a more rigorous longitudinal investigation to see how former students fared as a result of having had a course in systems thinking 6 conclusions this article has provided an anecdotal report on results of teaching systems naïve college students some aspects of systems science and modeling in an attempt to enhance their systems thinking abilities that is to make their thinking about the world more explicit than mere intuitions the key observations that naïve students do have the ability to develop systems sensibilities that they can learn how to construct and use simple conceptual and mathematical models and that they do see the world differently i e as a system of systems as a result of this course lend weight to the idea that a course like this could be taught more broadly students are more motivated to learn when the subject is couched in terms of a meaningful context in this case they were ostensibly learning something about how food gets from sunlight to the store by seeing the process as a semi formal system what they learned was a way to think about any such system and most importantly from my perspective to realize that systems they see in the world are connected and interact they made progress in thinking more holistically about the world i have become convinced that the average college student can learn to think more systemically about how the world works they can think in terms of models of systems as a tool for understanding system behaviors under varying conditions and assumptions also i strongly believe that students who have taken this course develop a much stronger capacity for critical thinking systems thinking requires someone to think causally which is known to increase their tendency to ask questions sloman and fernbach 2017 52 58 that latter factor is what is needed for critical thinking skills when you need to explain why something works the way it does how the internal components work together you develop a stronger curiosity about the other things around you 
25314,under the proposition that all college students are able to learn to think in more systemic ways and understand the value of systems modeling for assisting their thinking i designed a course for freshmen with no more than basic algebra in this course the students were exposed to basic systems concepts with a focus on system dynamics modeling using donella meadows thinking in systems of a permaculture based food production system they were given a basic problem how much land area would be needed to collect enough solar energy in food plant photosynthesis per year to feed a community of fifty vegetarians they were told that the farm would be in the seattle wa usa area so they could find the average monthly insolation values several additional rate constants and conversion factors were provided so they could build a spreadsheet based model to generate the number of calories needed this paper provides anecdotal evidence that systems theory naïve students were able to successfully build a model in teams but also were able to apply systems thinking to aspects of their own lives as demonstrated in essays individuals many students reported seeing the world differently as a result of the course particularly seeing how different aspects of the world are connected through various relations as a result of these successes the course was upgraded to be a little more advanced for upper division students 2 problem project based learning ppbl a pedagogy for active learning keywords 2 systems thinking naïve learners system dynamics food production model problem and project based learning 1 introduction systems thinking has been defined differently by different authors but almost always indirectly even when the term thinking is used explicitly churchman 1968 meadows 2008 von bertalanffy 1969 weinberg 2001 many writers in the field of systems science seem to assume that there is a cognitive process thinking that is somehow better or at least enhanced by the content of thought being systems for an exception see checkland 1999 3 4 all authors of course go on to define what a system is that is what constitutes the conceptual framework of systemness and leave it to the readers imagination as to what systems thinking actually is all are convinced that once a person grasps the essence of systemness they will embark on a new kind of thinking in which they will see the world differently in my experience in teaching systems science to what i will call naïve students i e those who had never been exposed to the concept of systemness previously i have to conclude that those writers were correct over the last decade in teaching systems principles and methodologies to general studies students those who are non science majors seeking university distribution credits in science and to students explicitly studying computer science and engineering at levels from entering freshmen to graduate students in a master s program i have observed the majority of these students undergo a distinct change in their modes of thinking about the world and even their own lives rather than follow in the footsteps of my predecessor writers on this subject i want to provide a definition of systems thinking that will serve as a basis for making observations of students thinking modes and their evolution throughout the course these observations are pre scientific to be certain made casually but i hope with some scientific insights they may provide a basis for developing a more rigorous approach to the field of education in systems science systems thinking then is the cognitive ability of a person to perceive wholeness of a thing 3 3 the word thing is one of the most useful nouns in english similar words serving the same purposes are found in most other languages it serves as a placeholder for designating an object or relation between two objects prior to specifying what the thing is that such a word seems to exist in so many if not all languages suggests that the brain has a kind of template for systemness that is innate to perceive the connections between the thing and other things with which it interacts causally and to perceive the internal composition of sub things themselves interconnected and interacting to produce the thing itself they are able to see systems in the world and how those systems are connected more broadly but moreover they are able to see how the systems are organized for purposes and how if they fail to serve those purposes they will not be able to persist as systems finally it means that a person is able to use knowledge of systems to reason about the future states of the world based on those systems behaviors it should be clear from this description definition that much thinking fits in this model that is to say human beings naturally think in modes that reflect some implicit systemness even if only subconsciously c f arsenault and buchsbaum 2015 huth et al 2012 re representations mobus and anderson 2016 re language of thought or systemese mobus 1994 re causal modeling in the brain were it otherwise the world which is a system of systems would be unintelligible however the kind of systems thinking that most writers refer to is explicit or conscious systems thinking that is a person is consciously aware of the web of connections that link components together to make a system they are aware of the causal nature of the dynamics of components and how that results in the behavior of the whole and so on the significant difference between subconscious and conscious systems thinking is that the former is more or less taken for granted that is just common sense whereas the latter results in one becoming aware of non obvious aspects of a system that are part of systemness but not always immediately perceptible for example many complex systems like an organization have fuzzy boundaries that have to be inferred from understanding how systems interface with their environments something that can only be obtained through explicit understanding of boundary properties thus the proposition for teaching systems science i e explicit systems thinking is that it enables students to achieve greater reasoning power about the real systems they encounter because they have an explicit template for the patterns that must exist in those systems regardless of the specific medium i e biological social or ecological embedding those systems 2 background 2 1 course description name introduction to systems science credit hours 5 quarter hours class meets for 4 h each week with significant outside assignments class size 20 30 this course was designed with a summer stipend grant from the milgard school of business center for leadership and social responsibility faculty innovation support it was designed as a problem and project based course wherein lectures are kept to a minimum and the students learn by doing see section 3 1 the author had been teaching systems science in various other courses for general education and drew upon that experience to construct a course suitable for a wide audience the course as described in this paper has been taught for four years as both a 1st year required core course and as a service course for students needing science credits 2 2 student profiles students who took these courses ranged from liberal arts majors to environmental and computer science engineering they also ranged from entering freshmen through seniors in undergraduate programs a more advanced form of the course was offered to graduate students in a master s of computer science program most of the undergraduate students especially the lower division students came into the course with fairly weak mathematical maturity not an uncommon factor today most had some kind of lab based science in high school or as freshmen in college however i discovered early on that their retention of what they had been exposed to was nil for example most had some biology courses but when probed to recall how dna is transcribed to messenger rna and that providing the basis for protein synthesis the most common response could be summarized as i remember we talked about that but i don t remember the details 4 4 this is in fact one of the most common statements i hear in teaching computer science courses that have several prerequisite courses in which concepts and skills are meant to be retained for the later courses in other words many of the students taking these courses were profoundly ignorant when it came to any depth in science or math the basic course design was developed with three different student profiles in mind the first involved entering 1st year students who were required to take a series of core courses covering various university requirements in general education i e natural science math social science and humanities the university had designed the 1st year courses to give students an orientation experience that was to include interdisciplinary approaches to the general education subjects the second group of students were mostly upper division students who needed additional science credits toward the university requirements in this course i assumed that students would already be oriented to university level work so added some greater depth to some of the topics a final group was composed of master s level graduate students in computer science in this course i added a great deal more work in computer simulation development rather than using a spreadsheet to implement models these students were required to write the programs in languages like c or java in this article i will only be discussing the undergraduate versions of the courses with particular attention on the 1st year version as the change from naïve to informed thinker was most dramatic in this group 2 3 learning objectives the students were exposed to many aspects of systems science and systems thinking i set forth a few learning objectives that they could achieve that i could assess through their problem solving project accomplishment and exams these were 1 identify the major attributes of systemness in everyday encounters with real world systems 2 construct several kinds of models of relatively simple systems in the real world i e conceptual as well as dynamical 3 become able to interpret graphs generated by system dynamics models and reason about the underlying causes of behavior 3 pedagogy 3 1 problem and project based learning the main form of pedagogy used in these courses has been based on a combination of problem and project based learning ppbl 5 5 these methods are well explained in wikipedia articles https en wikipedia org wiki problem based learning and https en wikipedia org wiki project based learning accessed 7 02 2017 both of these methods are used often separately and described differently but both involve active learning by students in small groups teams where the objective is for the students to produce artifacts e g reports models or computer programs that answer particular requirements in both methods the students are given an objective e g a problem to solve or a larger research development project in which they must discover ways to approach solutions under the watchful eyes of the teacher who acts as a coach and guide but does not provide specific techniques unless the students get stuck it has been shown that both of these forms of learning lead to deeper grasp of the principles and procedures of a subject mergendoller et al 2006 as well as longer retention strobel and van barneveld 2009 6 6 the author has verified this through personal observations i teach a sequence of courses in computer architecture organization and operating systems the sequence builds on knowledge learned in the previous course students who took my first and second courses which were ppbl based performed much better in comprehensive final exams in the third course os than students in the same class but who had taken other sections from other teachers in the first two courses that used fairly standard lecture test based pedagogy other benefits reported for both of these approaches include enhanced life long learning and stronger orientation toward multi disciplinarity dods 1997 3 2 course structure and relation to the content in the course reported here the general schedule included the first five weeks of a ten week academic quarter devoted to a sequence of problems of increasing complexity designed to instill the major aspects of systemness principles of systems science such as how to see a system as a network of interrelations between component parts and identify circular causal relations i e feedback loops these were largely developed using various simple modeling methods the last five weeks were devoted to a team project involving constructing a fairly complex computer model of a system this project required students to draw on what they had learned in working the problems in order to be successful in producing the larger system model see section 4 for more about the curriculum 3 3 textbook i assigned readings from donella meadows 2008 book thinking in systems a primer this is a short very readable book where ms meadows has provided very simple explanations and examples that naïve students do not have trouble following the readings were parsed out in synchrony with the week s problem see below in curriculum in addition to the meadows book i provided students with extracts from holmgren s 2002 work and chapter 1 from mobus and kalton 2015 because some of the language used in these references differed somewhat i provided a short vocabulary reference to ease translation from one author to another 4 curriculum in this section 1 outline the basic curriculum content used in the course a central theme was the system for producing sufficient food to feed a small community most students today have a very vague notion of where their food comes from beyond buying it in a grocery store 4 1 setting the context of systems thinking permaculture one of the keys to developing a successful ppbl curriculum is establishing an overarching context for the problems and projects moreover the context has to involve something that provides motivation being something that students are already interested in or realize they have a lack of understanding in this course this is achieved by introducing them to the idea that they might one day have to grow their own food this part is a bit tricky in the first week we discuss the way in which societal institutions like the financial system seem to be faltering many students are actually already aware that there is something we call a new normal that is not the growth economy of their parents generation 7 7 in fact the real growth economy was between the end of wwii and the early 1970s when gdp increases in excess of 5 per year were not uncommon growth has been declining since and has been less than 4 on average since the 1980s nevertheless economists continue to insist that a return to the post war growth rates should be possible and desirable more people do seem to be aware that there is some possibility of a societal collapse that will mean individuals and families will need to become more self sufficient in the future we don t dwell on this eventuality in the class but cover it as a possible future and proceed to discuss how growing one s own food or for a community might be achieved i introduce them to an already functioning community concept called permaculture permanent culture as a systems approach to holistic living part of which includes organic gardening see holmgren 2002 most students respond reasonably well to this introduction their interests in learning more about a techy sounding notion systems science as it might apply to food production is usually triggered and their receptiveness to the need to learn concepts as well as methods is increased permaculture is precisely the application of systems thinking to creating and maintaining a sustainable living system for a small community 8 8 specifically the founders of permaculture gave credit to howard t odum s development of systems ecology as a major source of inspiration and guidance see holmgren 2002 odum et al 2004 and wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki permaculture accessed 7 04 2017 it does involve individual members of the community participating in all of the work processes needed to sustain it some students might not see this as a desirable condition in contrast to spending time on line in social media for example at the same time in class time open conversations about permaculture reveal that many students do grasp the sense in which participating in the work of the community adds meaning to one s life beyond gossip and entertainment for me personally this is encouraging 4 2 introducing principles of systems science and systems thinking the first four weeks of the course are devoted to introducing students to explicit principles of systems science mobus and kalton 2015 we do not cover the whole subject as presented in the referenced textbook rather the students are given copies of the introductory chapter of the book which has a survey of the major principles and their interrelations to one another and short lectures on the most cogent principles relevant to the course are given in this same time frame students are given weekly problems to be worked on in pairs each problem is related to the principle s covered in that week for example chapters 3 and 4 cover hierarchical organization and network relations respectively students are given the problem of analyzing the university administration from the chancellor down to department heads and show using a conceptual map how these are related to one another e g how the vice chancellor of academics relates to the deans and directors the students produce a typical organization chart but it also has cross linkages showing some of the interrelations between for example associate vice chancellors having various subsidiary duties that need to work with one another not only do the students learn about graphic representations of organization they also learn a great deal about how their university is managed by a hierarchy of administrators the main principles covered in some depth include representation e g conceptual mapping hierarchical organization network relations complexity related to hierarchies and composition dynamics the latter three subjects are introduced in the context of system dynamics modeling other principles covered in overview include auto organization emergence and evolution information computation and cybernetics simple control feedback all of these subjects are discussed with several examples from everyday experience with very little in the way of mathematics so that the general studies audience can relate to the concepts being covered graphics taken from mobus and kalton 2015 are used to illustrate the concepts and provide students with models of how to represent them all of these principles are related to similar concepts raised in meadows 2008 4 3 building models a central and main concept skill in this course is learning how to construct models of systems of interest that can be used to make predictions of future performance or answer critical questions which is what we do in this course the majority of students in the course have heard of the phrase model of a system or intuitively grasp the idea of using models of systems to understand them better few however have a clue as to how to construct a model based on mathematical relations that can be used to explore complex dynamics so the objective of the curriculum is to teach students through experiential learning how to analyze a system and construct a working model that can be used to answer critical questions in the undergraduate courses we construct models in several of the problems and in the project using conventional spreadsheet software every student these days has a laptop or notebook with some version of microsoft s excel or its equivalent columns are used to represent variables and their transformations rows are used to represent time steps in a time series the software has the capacity to generate graphic displays of the time series so that students can more readily understand the dynamics of system the concept of modeling dynamic systems is the core of the meadows book 2008 the series of problems described below all involve developing skills in constructing various models especially dynamic simulation models the curriculum follows the book fairly closely 4 4 a typical problem sequence the first five weeks of a quarter are spent working on a sequence of problems that are meant to teach students aspects of systems thinking as well as prepare them for the final project described in section 4 5 below the main skill they develop in this course and the main concepts they need to grasp are related to modeling in the lectures 9 9 i prefer the term chalk talk to lecture since these are short usually 15 20 min and involve drawing pictures on the whiteboard in class i cover the principles but always relating them to the way we create models of systems in order to understand those systems better if students keep up with the reading they generally have little trouble following these lectures and i use question asking and responses to gauge how well they have absorbed the reading if i sense that a significant proportion of students are lagging behind in the reading i will throw a pop quiz their way and this seems to keep them motivated to keep up in these weeks i present a series on increasingly sophisticated principles and examples see the figures below the students usually in groups of two then set about applying the principle s to some aspect of the food production process i use various examples of the principles so that they are exposed to the fact that the principles apply broadly 4 4 1 week 1 the first problem involves using meadows diagrammatic tools to build a conceptual model of something the students know something about i give them a number of suggestions of things they could begin to think of as systems fig 1 shows a sample of a conceptual model of the system composed of my refrigerator and me the objective of this problem is to get the students starting to think of how stocks or reservoirs and flows are arranged along with the concepts of control and influences e g me deciding when i need to go shopping boundaries and inputs and outputs students are asked to consider things or situations in their lives and try to envision them in this systems framework for some students this is a cognitive hurdle trying to understand the meaning of terms like stock or flow and how things in their lives can be characterized in this way other students seem to be able to develop the intuitions about these terms quite readily for example one student who had a job as an assistant manager in a clothing department in a well known retail outlet immediately realized that the backroom inventory was a large stock and clothing items flowed from that stock to the smaller floor inventory her model consisted of an inflow from a central warehouse to the store inventory and then to the floor display inventory and then out to customers 4 4 2 week 2 the second week of the course focused on the methods of system decomposition into subsystems i deviate from meadows diagrammatic methods in that i use a process semantics that encapsulates subsystems into ovals fig 2 shows a library system in which the various control subsystems are encapsulated as computational processes we start with a simple system composed of a stock shelves of books new titles come from outside from vendors they are put on shelves and entered into the library index books are loaned out to borrowers the students are then asked to decompose this system looking for the various decision processes that act to obtain new books appropriately shelve and catalog the books and oversee the loaning process in this exercise students are learning about the decomposition process as well as working with the concepts of controls we walk through the initial decomposition shown in the figure so that they get the idea of looking for decisions that need to be processed in order to move books through the system they see that a librarian actually has several jobs to do in this system and they learn about classifying decision processes i also introduce them to the basics of cybernetics negative and positive feedback e g how to keep the fixed volume of shelving from being overloaded from ordering new books without sending old books to recycling this exercise is backed up with readings from meadows along with some additional readings in cybernetics most important in this aspect is to show them that what they do in making decisions in their lives is an exercise in cybernetic principles for example when they decide to not go see a particular movie because it got bad reviews in rottentomatos com how they were using information in feedback from the reviewers to influence a decision had the movie gotten good reviews they would be influenced to go see it the point of decomposition is to show students how a system is comprised of smaller simpler subsystems in a hierarchical organization 4 4 3 week 3 in week three we start to get serious about dynamics how stocks change over time due to fluctuations in inflows and outflows we start with a simple model as in fig 3 what meadows calls a one bathtub model here we build a simplified spreadsheet model that includes controls and feedback so that students can see how decisions increasing or decreasing flow rates will cause the level in a stock to move up or down this model is a simplified version of a population model future levels depend on rates and current levels the objective of this exercise is to get students familiar with the way changing a constant rate constant or gain factor influences the behavior of the stock level they are asked to choose different values for gain or decay factors and then run the model generating graphs of the stock level over time this allows the students to interact directly with dynamical systems and observe how slight changes in constants can influence the overall behavior of the system students are required to write short essays about what they see happening typical of their writing students report at first being confused about why selecting values for the factors caused such different behaviors in the levels fig 4 shows an equilibrium state in which inflow equals outflow so the level stays at whatever level it started out usually randomized an objective of the exercise is to have students try to find a set of factors that will cause the stock level to approach an ideal value and then set the factors such that level is maintained what they have to discover is that they need to for example set the gain factor higher than the decay factor at first and then when the level gets closer to the ideal set the two values to be equal prizes are given for the student teams that get closest to the ideal and stay there after 1000 iterations at the end of the week we introduce the concept of noise or probabilistic systems fig 4 they re run the simulations now with various levels of noise injected into the control this exercise makes it clear that noisy inputs can create significant problems in coming to an equilibrium state as previously often times where students had been able to achieve equilibrium in fewer than 1000 iterations it now took them more than 2000 the concept of a noise filter is introduced to show them how they can gain better control again a simple finite impulse response fir filter is introduced see the figure that makes it relatively easy to achieve equilibrium again within the original 1000 steps students are not expected to grasp the nature of filters deeply but they are expected to understand how they make the problem of control more tractable through direct experience 4 4 4 week 4 in week four we develop a more complex multi stock and control factor model this is a week spent integrating what had been learned in the first three weeks and exploration of issues of complexity by this point students have become very familiar with the procedures of developing conceptual visual models of systems and translating those into spreadsheet computations in the second half of the week we re introduce the ideas about growing food systemically and begin the discussion of what we will need to do in order to build a model system to answer the key question how much land will be needed to grow enough food for 500 average people 4 4 5 week 5 in this week we start to make this question more meaningful most of the students have had some kind of introduction to photosynthesis biology is a required course for high school graduates but are not really conversant with the process of plant growth i use images from my own garden that show stages of plant growth cabbages and bush beans mostly to convey the ideas of rate of growth and maturation of edible crops 10 10 on a personal note it is very sad that so many students today are completely ignorant of what it takes to grow food most express amazement that i am able to grow produce that looks just like what you buy in the store through the week we begin to improve the model so that more stages stocks and flow rates are included for a more realistic picture of how sunlight is converted into edible biomass in many ways this is the most enjoyable part of the course because this is where students finally are exposed to how food is produced i have come to believe that this revelation is the single most motivating factor in their beginning to grasp the significance of systems thinking and modeling once we have built out a general model of food production we start in earnest the process of building a working model the first step is the acquisition of the original energy input data discussed above and shown in fig 5 this graph drives home the fact that sunlight availability and subsequent photosynthesis productivity is highly variable throughout the year the importance of this is in realizing that food grown during the productive months 5 8 in the northern hemisphere has to compensate for low growth months 1 4 and 9 12 through the appropriate management of stocks we ignore the notion of importing foods from other regions by the end of week 5 in a ten week quarter system the students have learned a significant amount about systems and modeling them from week 6 on we focus on the project of building a much more comprehensive model of a permaculture farm capable of sustaining 500 individuals throughout the year the students are left to devise their own model versions based on their understanding of the process i provide guidance to teams on an as needed basis when they get stuck or are going off on a tangent that would be non productive but in large i leave them to pursue their own paths in answering the primary research question about the amount of land required to no great surprise most of the teams derive very nearly similar answers lending support to the notion that the average general studies student has the intellectual capacity to grasp the systems approach 4 5 solving an important problem with systems thinking and modeling in our case the question we posed in the project is how many square meters of land would be needed to grow enough vegetables of mixed varieties to feed a community of 500 average vegetarian individuals living near seattle washington the students are expected to construct a working model of a permaculture farm i provide them with a starter model as in fig 5 below i then guide them through the process of analyzing the more complex issues that will result in a more complex model they take the next 5 weeks to do a system decomposition and decide what factors to include in their models they work in teams of two or three people the majority of class time is taken up with them working on the project and me circulating through the room asking each team to explain to me what they are doing at each stage of the project their objective is to produce a working model spreadsheet that produces reasonable numbers by the start of week 10 the final results of multiple teams do not always agree but are generally within an order of magnitude during the last class time each team demonstrates their model and its results graphs showing the dynamical behavior of each of the elements of the project question see table 1 below in order to make this project a bit simpler so it can be done in a five week period we use average calories per unit weight across the variety of food stuffs grown e g carrots wheat cabbages etc we also employ time averages over the course of converting solar energy into consumable nutrition and use monthly average data so that the model can be built in a conventional spreadsheet program admittedly the model is greatly simplified relative to the details that would embody a more realistic version however the objective of this course is just to get students familiar with the process of building a system model that is relatively realistic and understandable within the framework of a single ten week quarter the students are walked through the process of getting solar radiation data measured in kilowatt hours per unit area through the average process of photosynthesis and the amount of biomass increase that is consumable by humans e g fruiting bodies the technique is to ask students in the whole class to think about how to get the value of the next variable in a series across the spreadsheet table 1 provides the set of variables and factors that were used to compute a final solution to the question how much land will be needed to feed 500 people basic outline of the model i used a socratic method to get students to think about what factors were needed in the sequence given in table 1 for example after explaining the difference between units of measure of energy in joules btus and physiological calories i ask them what they will need to know in order to get from solar input in kwh per unit area per month to calories per unit area per month as a rule this tends to be a difficult thing for freshmen and for about half of the general studies upper division students the application of conversion factors to get from one unit to another is unfortunately still not clearly understood by many undergraduates on the other hand this is an opportunity to get the students to work through the process with something that they do understand the context of once they do work through this initial conversion the ones that follow e g computing the number of calories embodied in biomass became much easier students began to get the process by which we get to the numbers desired from the numbers given via these conversion factors some of the data needed such as the insolation data for a given geographical region i require the students to extract from a database given the latitude and longitude of a location e g seattle wa they are asked to produce a table of average monthly insolation per square meter there are a number of databases having these numbers but they come in a variety of units of measure for example units of time hours vs days or area meters vs feet so one of the first challenges for students is how to get the data into the form needed for the modeling project this is where the weekly problem work comes into play obtaining the insolation data in the proper form is posed as the fourth problem in the series of weekly problems thus the students learn a valuable skill finding data and converting to a usable form prior to actually starting the final project building the model 5 observations in this last section i want to offer some observations regarding how the average general studies that is non science major student assimilates and uses systems thinking and a systems approach to understanding complex systems most of the students freshmen and upper division alike are not science majors our campus only offers bs degrees in computer science engineering and environmental science the freshmen are still considered general studies students even if they express an interest in the sciences which are few in my surveys of desired majors at the start of the course so the majority of students in both versions of the class have little more than casual interest in science 5 1 throughout the course in the first class of the quarter i take a survey to find out not only what majors or interests students have but also what they already know about systems science the questions i asked sought to determine how aware students were of the principles and the role they played in understanding things in the world as systems for example complexity of a system is a property of 1 the number of components that make up the system 2 the number of different kinds of components 3 the hierarchy of organization i e components being composed of smaller components 4 all of the above 5 none of the above answer 4 very few students get this right most answer either 1 or 2 some answer 5 when i ve asked students to explain why they did not choose 4 they confessed that they didn t understand what 3 meant and therefore thought the answer could not be 4 this is not surprising upon deeper inquiry it turns out that most students while knowing the word hierarchy could not describe what it meant some equated it with bureaucracy so they had a vague sense of layers of authority if not function other questions involved dynamics or behavior such as what is are the important variable s to measure over time to describe the state of a pendulum most students have some idea that what is important is where the pendulum is as it swings but do not know why this matters again deeper inquiry revealed that most students were satisfied with their own intuitions folk physics and did not think there was anything more to dynamics than just the fact that things moved similar results came from questions regarding network structures information feedback and self organization processes i feel completely justified in asserting that these students are vaguely aware of a general notion of organization and dynamics but can be easily described as naïve similar questions were asked at the end of the course the final exam to assess their learning as a result of the course i wish i could report substantial improvements across the board however the practical interpretation of the final exam results is that students had become aware of the concepts and that they were important to understand but the depth of their explicit understanding had not improved substantially what differed in the course was their implicit understanding of systemness this was demonstrated in their successful completion of the project there were some notable variations among the models produced such as the number of nodes e g the boxes and controls shown in fig 1 above and the flows interconnecting them there were for example some differences in decision processes as in fig 3 however all of the models showed the same basic and generally correct overall structure and functions all tracked embodied energy through a feedforward process with appropriate storage stages as justified by the assumptions explicitly made e g boundaries in their reports there was a small amount of variability in the final answer vis à vis the amount of land needed about an order of magnitude in most cases with a mean value very close to the reasonable number the structures were described in their reports as a flow network feedback and feedforward controls were explicitly described and related to the appropriate stocks e g biomass growing in the field biomass in harvested storage etc these results show that in stark contrast to the students explicit grasp of systems theory still somewhat weak their implicit understanding was quite high as a final exercise i like to have an open discussion about how they show understanding by doing whereas they still seem to be struggling with the theoretical concepts the final exam is given before the final presentation of models and reports this way i go armed with the results of their exam results which i report to the class after their public presentations of their projects using a few of the concepts from questions on the exam the ones most students did poorly on i ask them to relate the concept to their projects and challenge them to explain why they got it right on the project but didn t seem to get it on the exam this is something of a revelation to many students who upon reflection make the connection between the concept and what they did in their projects for example a question about the mass energy balance of flow networks is usually answered incorrectly by 60 of the students on the exam but they are able to explain the principles conservation of mass and energy plus second law effects as implemented in their model calculations if there were more time i would love to give a second final exam to see if this reflection exercise made a substantial difference in their grasp of the principles unfortunately a ten week quarter doesn t give this luxury 5 2 after the course a number of students who have taken one of my systems courses have communicated with me several quarters later or even after graduation a number of computer science and engineering students who took my course as an elective showed up in one of my upper division classes such as operating systems where they informed me that the systems course made them much more aware of the internals of other complex systems and how they worked together to produce the whole system behavior operating systems is a particularly good course in which to continue exploring issues of complexity hierarchical organization control and feedback and other general systems aspects it was not hard to detect how those students who had the systems course were applying that knowledge to do this exploration in addition to seeing students in later courses i have had a number of former students especially from the freshman core courses send me e mails years later remarking how helpful systems thinking had been for them in other courses and jobs it would be very interesting to do a more rigorous longitudinal investigation to see how former students fared as a result of having had a course in systems thinking 6 conclusions this article has provided an anecdotal report on results of teaching systems naïve college students some aspects of systems science and modeling in an attempt to enhance their systems thinking abilities that is to make their thinking about the world more explicit than mere intuitions the key observations that naïve students do have the ability to develop systems sensibilities that they can learn how to construct and use simple conceptual and mathematical models and that they do see the world differently i e as a system of systems as a result of this course lend weight to the idea that a course like this could be taught more broadly students are more motivated to learn when the subject is couched in terms of a meaningful context in this case they were ostensibly learning something about how food gets from sunlight to the store by seeing the process as a semi formal system what they learned was a way to think about any such system and most importantly from my perspective to realize that systems they see in the world are connected and interact they made progress in thinking more holistically about the world i have become convinced that the average college student can learn to think more systemically about how the world works they can think in terms of models of systems as a tool for understanding system behaviors under varying conditions and assumptions also i strongly believe that students who have taken this course develop a much stronger capacity for critical thinking systems thinking requires someone to think causally which is known to increase their tendency to ask questions sloman and fernbach 2017 52 58 that latter factor is what is needed for critical thinking skills when you need to explain why something works the way it does how the internal components work together you develop a stronger curiosity about the other things around you
