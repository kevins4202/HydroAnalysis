seabed with different normalized heights of the structure h d subjected to a boundary layer flow at different reynolds numbers re with different normalized thicknesses of the boundary layer δ d are carried out in the present study here d is the characteristic length of the flow and is set as the width of the rectangular cross section in the present study the hydrodynamic quantities of the flow on the partially buried ribs are studied by using 2d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model by comparing the simulation results with the published experimental measurements it can be concluded that the rans model with the k ω sst turbulence model can provide satisfactory numerical results moreover parametric studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of r e δ d and h d on the hydrodynamic quantities i e the drag coefficient c d the lift coefficient c l and the recirculation length x r d of the wake behind the

have declined worldwide in recent decades artificial reefs are one of the most important technical methods to attract and concentrate fish increase fish abundance and diversity and to potentially improve and rehabilitate the coastal ecosystems bohnsack and sutherland 1985 garcia and newton 1994 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 pauly et al 2002 lan et al 2004 fao 2014 artificial reefs are structures constructed on the seabed to create upwelling currents in front of the reefs and eddy currents behind the reefs he and shi 1995 kim et al 2016 upwelling currents help to promote the exchange layers of seawater increase the water nutrient transport from the sea bottom to the surface and enhance the bait diffusion around the reef area while eddy currents provide the fish with favorable conditions baine 2001 haro et al 2004 because of their simple geometries and low manufacturing costs the concrete cubic artificial reefs are used frequently in practice moreover many investigations have been carried out on the flow field characteristics of cubic reefs by wind tunnel experiments flume experiments and numerical simulation technology based on computational fluid dynamics cfd tang et al 2007 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 cui et al 2011 liu and su 2013 huang et al 2014 shao et al 2014 wang et al 2018 after the artificial reefs are set on the seabed they may be drifted away and overturned from the original location due to the drag and lift forces acted by the surrounding flow these hydrodynamic forces are closely related to the stability of the artificial reefs furthermore most of the artificial reefs are found to be embedded in the erodible sediment on the seabed which means that the height of the artificial reefs exposed to the flow decreases the different heights of the artificial reefs in the flow may affect the hydrodynamic quantities therefore it is necessary to perform numerical studies on the flow around artificial reefs on the seabed with different buried depth and study the hydrodynamic forces acted on them in the present study a partially buried 2d rib with a rectangular cross section is used as a simplified model of the real cubic artificial reefs on the seabed many factors affect the flow around the wall mounted structures such as the reynolds number the incident boundary layer thickness δ of the incoming flow and the height of the structure h exposed to the flow here the reynolds number is defined as r e u d ν where u is the free stream velocity d is the width of the rib cross section and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the wall mounted structures are usually under extreme subsea environmental conditions kuijpers and nielsen 2016 reported that the maximum current velocity near the seabed is in the order of 1 m s and r e is in the order of 1 0 10 6 for a submerged structure on the seabed with a height of 1 m several previous researchers have performed experimental and numerical studies on the flow around wall mounted structures at high reynolds numbers good and joubert 1968 carried out experiments on the flow around two dimensional vertical plates and found that the drag coefficient c d varies logarithmically with respect to δ d subjected to a boundary layer flow at high r e 1 0 10 6 4 0 10 7 with δ d 1 2 arie et al 1975 performed experimental studies on the pressure distribution around rectangular cylinders subjected to a turbulent boundary layer at reynolds numbers of 3 41 10 4 r e 1 19 10 5 with different free stream velocity u and normalized thicknesses of the incident boundary layer δ d the experimental measurements were used by tauqeer et al 2017 to verify their numerical study for flows around subsea square structures using the k ε turbulence model at r e 1 19 10 5 the experimental and numerical results of the drag coefficients were in good agreement with each other the normalized recirculation length x r d has also been extensively studied by several previous researchers here x r is defined as the horizontal distance between the separation point at the leading edge of the structure and the flow reattachment location downstream of the structure the length of the recirculation region behind a two dimensional 2d rectangular obstacle was investigated experimentally by bergeles and athanassiadis 1983 with a single hot wire it was concluded that x r d decreases linearly with the increasing width of the rectangular structure by conducting the experiments on the flow over a rectangular cross section castro 1984 found that x r d decreases with increasing δ d the turbulent flow over a square rib structure at r e 1 32 10 4 with δ d 0 75 was experimentally studied by liu et al 2008 tauqeer et al 2017 have reached the similar conclusion by solving the 2d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations using the standard k ε model at a high reynolds number of r e 1 0 10 6 in addition the numerical results of the horizontal velocity profiles around the structure reported by tauqeer et al 2017 showed good agreement with the experimental measurements performed by liu et al 2008 the flow around a circular cylinder were studied by solving rans equations with the k ɛ k ω and k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence models at r e ranging from 1 0 10 3 to 7 0 10 3 in akoz and kirkgoz 2009 the numerical results the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l were compared with the experimental data obtained by particle image velocimetry piv measurements it was found that the numerical modeling using either of the k ω or k ω sst turbulence models could give reasonable results it was also shown that x r d increases with increasing r e it can be seen from the previous studies that efforts have been mainly put on the flow over the wall mounted structures subjected to a turbulent boundary layer flow with different normalized thicknesses δ d in the present study in order to meet the needs of investigating the flow around the subsea artificial reefs on the seabed the hydrodynamic effects on partially buried 2d ribs with a rectangular cross section are studied using 2d rans equations with the k ω sst turbulence model menter 1993 systematically in the present simulations r e ranges from 5 12 10 4 to 5 0 10 5 which is within the ranges of re found in the measurements of flow around artificial reefs reported by kim et al 1981 re 1 1 10 4 1 2 10 6 and tong et al 2018 maximum re 8 84 10 5 1 32 10 6 δ d varies from 0 25 to 2 55 and h d varies from 0 25 to 1 0 in order to validate the simulation results the drag coefficients c d are compared with the published experimental measurements reported by arie et al 1975 and the numerical results given by tauqeer et al 2017 while the horizontal velocity profiles are compared with the published experimental measurements reported by liu et al 2008 after the validation study the effects of r e δ d and h d on the hydrodynamic quantities such as the drag coefficients c d lift coefficients c l and the recirculation length x r d are investigated the wall shear stress and the flow patterns are also studied and discussed the numerical set up including the numerical methods computation domain and boundary conditions as well as the convergence studies are presented in section 2 the results and discussions are given in section 3 conclusions are made in section 4 2 numerical set up 2 1 flow model the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the conservation of mass and momentum of the flow can be written as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p

fluid density p denotes the dynamic pressure u i denotes the fluctuating part of the velocity and u i u j indicates the reynolds stress component in the present study the k ω sst turbulence model is adopted menter 1993 1994 that is a combination of the k ω and k ε models the k ω model of wilcox 1998 is used near the wall region of the domain while the standard k ε model of jones and launder 1973 is used in the outer wake region and in the free shear layers according to menter et al 2003 the equations of k and ω can be given by 3 k t u i k x i p k β ω k x i ν σ k ν t k x i 4 ω t u i ω x i α s

is used meanwhile simplefoam a solver based on semi implicit method for pressure linked equations is adopted the spatial schemes for gradient laplacian and divergence are gauss linear bounded gauss linear upwind and gauss linear limited corrected respectively as shown in fig 1 a computational domain of 25 d 56 d length height is set in the cartesian coordinate system here d is the width of the 2d rib h is the height of the rib δ d is the normalized thicknesses of the incoming boundary layer flow and o is the center of the rib bottom edge the distance from the inlet to o is 15 5 d while the distance from outlet to o is set as 40 5 d according to ong et al 2010 where numerical simulations are performed on the flow around a circular cylinder close to a seabed a computational domain with the inlet located at 10 d upstream and the outlet located at 20 d downstream from the center of the cylinder can eliminate the far field effect on the structure the upper boundary is set as 9 4 d from the center of the cylinder to ensure the boundaries have no effect on the flow around the cylinder therefore it can be concluded that the computational domain in the present study 25 d 56 d is sufficiently large the boundary conditions used for the numerical simulations are as follows 1 the inlet velocity is a boundary layer flow with a logarithmic profile in order to directly compare the simulation results to the experimental measurements reported by arie et al 1975 directly a velocity profile is created by curve fitting the experimental boundary layer as shown in fig 2 this velocity profile is used for all the simulations in the present study the value of the vertical velocity in the y direction at the inlet is set as zero and the value of k and ε is calculated as follows 9 k y

denotes the karman constant and l is assumed to be the turbulent length scale brørs 1999 ong et al 2009 2010 2 at the outlet u 1 u 2 k and ω are specified as zero gradient and the pressure is set to be zero 3 at the top u 1 u u 2 0 k ω and the pressure are specified as zero gradient 4 on the surface of the 2d rib and the bottom wall a no slip wall boundary condition u 1 u 2 0 is adopted the standard near wall conditions for k and ω is applied on the surface of the 2d rib and the bottom wall when using these near wall functions the criteria of y 30 must be satisfied and y is expressed as 12 y δ y u t ν where δ y is the distance of the first grid away from the wall 2 3 grid generation and convergence study structured grids are adopted for the simulations in the present study an example of the grid used for the 2d rib with a height of h d 1 0 is shown in fig 3 a grid convergence study has been carried out for the flow with 4 sets of meshes a 1 a 4 at r e 5 12 10 4 5 10 5 with δ d 0 73 and h d 1 0 the variations of c d c l and x r d are obtained as shown in table 1 c d and c l are calculated as c d f d 0 5 ρ a u 2 and c l f l 0 5 ρ a u 2 here f d and f l are computed from the total force acting on the surface of the structures and a is the projected area of the structure the relative difference is obtained by n i 1 n i n i i 1 3 here n i represents the quantities of the different meshes it can be seen from table 1 that the relative differences of the numbers of the elements between cases are all larger than 30 while those of c d c l and x r d between the cases are generally smaller than 1 since the wall functions are applied in all the simulations the average values of y for all the simulations are kept between 34 and 40 therefore the meshes for the four different cases at different r e have achieved sufficient grid resolutions the number of elements marked with bold font are used in the simulations with different δ d 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation study in order to perform the validation of the present 2d rans with the k ω sst turbulence model for the flow around a wall mounted 2d rib with h d 1 0 the comparisons among the present simulation results the published experimental data by arie et al 1975 and the published numerical results by tauqeer et al 2017 at different combinations of r e and δ d are performed the drag coefficients c d are compared at r e 3 41 10 4 1 19 10 5 with δ d 0 73 2 55 as shown in table 2 from the table it can be seen that the present numerical results are in good agreement with the published experimental data and numerical results with a maximum discrepancy of 5 2 a further validation is performed by comparing the horizontal velocity profiles at 8 different horizontal locations between the numerical results of the present study and the published experimental measurements given by liu et al 2008 as shown in fig 4 for comparison the present simulations are conducted at r e 1 32 10 4 with δ d 0 75 where the flow condition is the same as that of the experiments by liu et al 2008 in fig 4 it can be observed that the two results show a good agreement at the locations near the rib from x d 3 5 to x d 1 25 only a slight difference between the velocity profiles in the present study and the experimental data appears at locations of x d 5 52 and 11 25 it can also be found that except at the upstream location of x d 3 5 and the separation point of x d 0 5 the velocity profiles at the other six either upstream or downstream locations all have negative velocity parts close to the wall moreover there are larger negative velocity parts at the downstream locations of x d 1 25 5 25 and 11 25 indicating that a recirculation zone has been developed behind the rib after the validation study in terms of c d and the horizontal velocity profiles it can be concluded that the present rans simulations with the k ω sst turbulence model is suitable for predicting the flow around a wall mounted 2d rib with a rectangular cross section subjected to a boundary layer flow at high r e 3 2 hydrodynamic quantities in order to study the effects of r e δ d and h d on the hydrodynamic quantities of the flow around the partially buried 2d ribs two series of simulations are performed in the simulations of the first one h d is kept constant as 1 0 and δ d is chosen to be 0 25 0 50 0 73 and 1 0 r e is set to be 5 12 10 4 1 19 10 5 3 00 10 5 and 5 00 10 5 in the simulations of the second series of the simulations δ d is kept constant as 0 73 and h d is chosen to be 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 1 0 r e is also set as 5 12 10 4 1 19 10 5 3 00 10 5 and 5 00 10 5 the hydrodynamic quantities of these two series of the simulations are shown in tables 3 and 4 3 3 effect of re on the hydrodynamic quantities the variation of c d c l and x r d at different r e are displayed in fig 5 four δ d are considered in the present study it can be seen that c d c l and x r d increase when r e increases from 5 12 10 4 to 5 00 10 5 in particular the rate of change of these three hydrodynamic quantities decreases with the increasing r e and finally the three hydrodynamic quantities become stable akoz and kirkgoz 2009 reported the same variation trend in their study 3 4 effect of δ d on the hydrodynamic quantities the effect of the normalized thickness of the incident boundary layer δ d 0 25 1 00 on the hydrodynamic quantities with h d 1 0 is illustrated in fig 6 from the figure it can be observed that the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c l decrease when the δ d increases this is because the larger δ d causes smaller averaged incident flow velocity that the 2d rib is subjected to due to the conservation of energy the pressure difference between the front face and back face of the 2d rib is lower with a larger δ d resulting in a lower drag coefficient the lower lift coefficient can be attributed to a similar reason it can also be found that the x r d increases slightly with the increasing δ d 3 5 effect of h d on hydrodynamic quantities simulations with different h d from 0 25 to 1 00 with a constant δ d 0 73 are performed to examine its effects on c d c l and x r d as shown in fig 7 it is obvious that all the hydrodynamic quantities c d c l and x r d increase monotonically with the increasing h d the physical explanation for the variation trend can be outlined as follows when h d is smaller the averaged flow velocity defined as the spatial averaged of the turbulence boundary layer profile from the bottom to the height of the partially buried 2d ribs in the leading edge of the structure is smaller as illustrated in fig 8 the blocking effect of the structures to the flow becomes weaker when h d is smaller and this results in lower pressure differences and hence lower drag forces the smaller h d also leads to a lower separated velocity at the top leading edge of the structures resulting in a lower recirculation length furthermore when h d is smaller the vertical distance of the separated flow which reattaches the bottom of the domain is shorter and this also leads to a smaller x r d therefore based on these two reasons it can be confirmed that x r d decreases with the decreasing h d 3 6 wall shear stress and flow patterns the wall shear stress τ on the surface of the bottom wall is studied τ is given as 13 τ μ u y y 0 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid 3 6 1 effect of δ d on the wall shear stress in the present study the non dimensional bottom wall shear stress τ τ along the horizontal direction for the entire domain and around the front face of the 2d rib at different r e and δ d with a constant h d 1 0 are illustrated in fig 9 here τ is the undisturbed bottom wall shear stress the τ τ for the entire domain at r e 1 19 10 5 are shown in fig 9 a and the one at r e 5 0 10 5 is displayed in fig 9 c the results around the front face of the 2d rib with zoom in plots are shown in fig 9 b and d respectively from the figures the following phenomena can be observed 1 because of the lower viscous effect with the increasing r e the absolute value of τ τ is the lowest at r e 5 0 10 5 2 due to the backflow caused by the block effects of the 2d rib there is a small negative τ τ in front of the 2d rib with decreasing δ d the velocity gradient in the vertical direction is higher and induces higher negative peak value of τ τ 3 owing to the recirculation motions the bottom wall shear stress has a large negative region behind the 2d rib see fig 9 a and c the absolute peak value of the negative bottom wall shear stress region increases with the increasing δ d 3 6 2 effect of h d on the wall shear stress the effect of h d on τ τ along the bottom surface for the entire domain and around the front face of the 2d rib at r e 5 0 105 and δ d 0 73 are shown in fig 10 it can be found that 1 the negative τ τ region in front of the 2d rib is smaller with higher absolute peak values with the decreasing h d 2 due to the reduced recirculation length behind the 2d rib with the decreasing h d the negative τ τ region behind the 2d rib becomes smaller and the absolute peak value decreases the location of the peak value tends to be closer to the structures 3 6 3 flow patterns the streamlines are illustrated in fig 11 at r e 5 0 10 5 with δ d 0 73 and different h d from the figure it can be observed clearly that there are three main recirculation motions around the 2d rib at the front corner of the 2d rib the flow hits the 2d rib and creates a downflow towards the bottom boundary and then reverse their direction because of the bottom wall therefore a vortex is formed around the front corner with the decreasing h d the vortex becomes smaller the second one is the largest and is generated by the shear layer separation after the front top edge of the 2d rib the third recirculation motion is formed at the downward corner of the 2d rib and is induced by the large recirculation motion it also becomes smaller with the decreasing h d due to the weaker large recirculation behind the 2d rib moreover both the height and the length of the largest recirculation increase with the increasing h d because the separation velocity becomes larger and the distance for the flow to reattach the bottom wall becomes longer 4 conclusions in the present study two dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent boundary layer flows at high reynolds numbers around a partially buried 2d rib with a rectangular cross section are performed based on the rans equations combined with the k ω sst model and the wall functions the effects of different reynolds numbers r e different normalized thicknesses of the incident boundary layer flow δ d and different normalized heights of the 2d rib exposed to the flow h d on the hydrodynamic quantities are studied systematically in the validation study the simulation results of the drag coefficient c d are compared with the published experimental measurements reported by arie et al 1975 and the numerical results given by tauqeer et al 2017 while the horizontal velocity profiles are compared with the experimental measurements reported by liu et al 2008 the results are in good agreement with the published experimental and numerical data after the validation study it can be concluded that the present rans simulations with the k ω sst turbulence model is suitable for predicting the flow around partially buried 2d ribs subjected to a boundary layer flow at high r e based on the simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the drag coefficient c d lift coefficient c l and the normalized recirculation length x r d increase with increasing r e and then tend to be stable at larger r e the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c l decrease while x r d increases slightly with the increasing δ d the hydrodynamic quantities c d c l and x r d all increase monotonically with the increasing h d due to stronger blocking effects of the structure to the flow 2 the amplitudes of the wall shear stress on the surface of the bottom wall i e τ τ decreases when the r e increases a small negative region in front of the 2d rib and a larger negative region of τ τ behind the 2d rib are found the absolute peak value of the negative τ τ in front of the 2d rib increases with the decreasing δ d the absolute peak value of the negative τ τ behind the 2d rib decreases with the decreasing h d 3 three main recirculation motions around the 2d rib can be observed the first vortex is formed at front corner of the 2d rib the second the largest is generated by the shear layer separation after the front top edge of the 2d rib and the third is formed at the downward corner of the 2d rib moreover both the height and the length of the largest recirculation

turbulence models could give reasonable results it was also shown that x r d increases with increasing r e it can be seen from the previous studies that efforts have been mainly put on the flow over the wall mounted structures subjected to a turbulent boundary layer flow with different normalized thicknesses δ d in the present study in order to meet the needs of investigating the flow around the subsea artificial reefs on the seabed the hydrodynamic effects on partially buried 2d ribs with a rectangular cross section are studied using 2d rans equations with the k ω sst turbulence model menter 1993 systematically in the present simulations r e ranges from 5 12 10 4 to 5 0 10 5 which is within the ranges of re found in the measurements of flow around artificial reefs reported by kim et al

coefficients c d are compared with the published experimental measurements reported by arie et al 1975 and the numerical results given by tauqeer et al 2017 while the horizontal velocity profiles are compared with the published experimental measurements reported by liu et al 2008 after the validation study the effects of r e δ d and h d on the hydrodynamic quantities such as the drag coefficients c d lift coefficients c l and the recirculation length x r d are investigated the wall shear stress and the flow patterns are also studied and discussed the numerical set up including the numerical

fluid density p denotes the dynamic pressure u i denotes the fluctuating part of the velocity and u i u j indicates the reynolds stress component in the present study the k ω sst turbulence model is adopted menter 1993 1994 that is a combination of the k ω and k ε models the k ω model of wilcox 1998 is used near the wall region of the domain while the standard k ε model of jones and launder 1973 is used in the outer wake region and in the free shear layers according to menter et al 2003 the equations of k and ω can be given by 3 k t u i k x i p k β ω k x i ν σ k ν t k x i 4 ω t u i ω x i α s

is used meanwhile simplefoam a solver based on semi implicit method for pressure linked equations is adopted the spatial schemes for gradient laplacian and divergence are gauss linear bounded gauss linear upwind and gauss linear limited corrected respectively as shown in fig 1 a computational domain of 25 d 56 d length height is set in the cartesian coordinate system here d is the width of the 2d rib h is the height of the rib δ d is the normalized thicknesses of the incoming boundary layer flow and o is the center of the rib bottom edge the distance from the inlet to o is 15 5 d while the distance from outlet to o is set as 40 5 d according to ong et al 2010 where numerical simulations are performed on the flow around a circular cylinder close to a seabed a computational domain with the inlet located at 10 d upstream and the outlet located at 20 d downstream from the center of the cylinder can eliminate the far field effect on the structure the upper boundary is set as 9 4 d from the center of the cylinder to ensure the boundaries have no effect on the flow around the cylinder therefore it can be concluded that the computational domain in the present study 25 d 56 d is sufficiently large the boundary conditions used for the numerical simulations are as follows 1 the inlet velocity is a boundary layer flow with a logarithmic profile in order to directly compare the simulation results to the experimental measurements reported by arie et al 1975 directly a velocity profile is created by curve fitting the experimental boundary layer as shown in fig 2 this velocity profile is used for all the simulations in the present study the value of the vertical velocity in the y direction at the inlet is set as zero and the value of k and ε is calculated as follows 9 k y max c μ 1 2 1 y δ 1 y δ u t 2 0 00001 u 2 10 ω k 0 5 c μ 0 5 l 11 l min κ y 1 3 5 y δ 1 c μ δ here c μ 0 09 is the turbulent viscosity constant u t represents the bottom wall friction velocity κ 0 41 denotes the karman constant and l is assumed to be the turbulent length scale brørs 1999 ong et al 2009 2010 2 at the outlet u 1 u 2 k and ω are specified as zero gradient and the pressure is set to be zero 3 at the top u 1 u u 2 0 k ω and the pressure are specified as zero gradient 4 on the surface of the 2d rib and the bottom wall a no slip wall boundary condition u 1 u 2 0 is adopted the standard near wall conditions for k and ω is applied on the surface of the 2d rib and the bottom wall when using these near wall functions the criteria of y 30 must be satisfied and y is expressed as 12 y δ y u t ν where δ y is the distance of the first grid away from the wall 2 3 grid generation and convergence study structured grids are adopted for the simulations in the present study an example of the grid used for the 2d rib with a height of h d 1 0 is shown in fig 3 a grid convergence study has been carried out for the flow with 4 sets of meshes a 1 a 4 at r e 5 12 10 4 5 10 5 with δ d 0 73 and h d 1 0 the variations of c d c l and x r d are obtained as shown in table 1 c d and c l are calculated as c d f d 0 5 ρ a u 2 and c l f l 0 5 ρ a u 2 here f d and f l are computed from the total force acting on the surface of the structures and a is the projected area of the structure the relative difference is obtained by n i 1 n i n i i 1 3 here n i represents the quantities of the different meshes it can be seen from table 1 that the relative differences of the numbers of the elements between cases are all larger than 30 while those of c d c l and x r d between the cases are generally smaller than 1 since the wall functions are applied in all the simulations the average values of y for all the simulations are kept between 34 and 40 therefore the meshes for the four different cases at different r e have achieved sufficient grid resolutions the number of elements marked with bold font are used in the simulations with different δ d 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation study in order to perform the validation of the present 2d rans with the k ω sst turbulence model for the flow around a wall mounted 2d rib with h d 1 0 the comparisons among the present simulation results the published experimental data by arie et al 1975 and the published numerical results by tauqeer et al 2017 at different combinations of r e and δ d are performed the drag coefficients c d are compared at r e 3 41 10 4 1 19 10 5 with δ d 0 73 2 55 as shown in table 2 from the table it can be seen that the present numerical results are in good agreement with the published experimental data and numerical results with a maximum discrepancy of 5 2 a further validation is performed by comparing the horizontal velocity profiles at 8 different horizontal locations between the numerical results of the present study and the published experimental measurements given by liu et al 2008 as shown in fig 4 for comparison the present simulations are conducted at r e 1 32 10 4 with δ d 0 75 where the flow condition is the same as that of the experiments by liu et al 2008 in fig 4 it can be observed that the two results show a good agreement at the locations near the rib from x d 3 5 to x d 1 25 only a slight difference between the velocity profiles in the present study and the experimental data appears at locations of x d 5 52 and 11 25 it can also be found that except at the upstream location of x d 3 5 and the separation point of x d 0 5 the velocity profiles at the other six either upstream or downstream locations all have negative velocity parts close to the wall moreover there are larger negative velocity parts at the downstream locations of x d 1 25 5 25 and 11 25 indicating that a recirculation zone has been developed behind the rib after the validation study in terms of c d and the horizontal velocity profiles it can be concluded that the present rans simulations with the k ω sst turbulence model is suitable for predicting the flow around a wall mounted 2d rib with a rectangular cross section subjected to a boundary layer flow at high r e 3 2 hydrodynamic quantities in order to study the effects of r e δ d and h d on the hydrodynamic quantities of the flow around the partially buried 2d ribs two series of simulations are performed in the simulations of the first one h d is kept constant as 1 0 and δ d is chosen to be 0 25 0 50 0 73 and 1 0 r e is set to be 5 12 10 4 1 19 10 5 3 00 10 5 and 5 00 10 5 in the simulations of the second series of the simulations δ d is kept constant as 0 73 and h d is chosen to be 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 1 0 r e is also set as 5 12 10 4 1 19 10 5 3 00 10 5 and 5 00 10 5 the hydrodynamic quantities of these two series of the simulations are shown in tables 3 and 4 3 3 effect of re on the hydrodynamic quantities the variation of c d c l and x r d at different r e are displayed in fig 5 four δ d are considered in the present study it can be seen that c d c l and x r d increase when r e increases from 5 12 10 4 to 5 00 10 5 in particular the rate of change of these three hydrodynamic quantities decreases with the increasing r e and finally the three hydrodynamic quantities become stable akoz and kirkgoz 2009 reported the same variation trend in their study 3 4 effect of δ d on the hydrodynamic quantities the effect of the normalized thickness of the incident boundary layer δ d 0 25 1 00 on the hydrodynamic quantities with h d 1 0 is illustrated in fig 6 from the figure it can be observed that the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c l decrease when the δ d increases this is because the larger δ d causes smaller averaged incident flow velocity that the 2d rib is subjected to due to the conservation of energy the pressure difference between the front face and back face of the 2d rib is lower with a larger δ d resulting in a lower drag coefficient the lower lift coefficient can be attributed to a similar reason it can also be found that the x r d increases slightly with the increasing δ d 3 5 effect of h d on hydrodynamic quantities simulations with different h d from 0 25 to 1 00 with a constant δ d 0 73 are performed to examine its effects on c d c l and x r d as shown in fig 7 it is obvious that all the hydrodynamic quantities c d c l and x r d increase monotonically with the increasing h d the physical explanation for the variation trend can be outlined as follows when h d is smaller the averaged flow velocity defined as the spatial averaged of the turbulence boundary layer profile from the bottom to the height of the partially buried 2d ribs in the leading edge of the structure is smaller as illustrated in fig 8 the blocking effect of the structures to the flow becomes weaker when h d is smaller and this results in lower pressure differences and hence lower drag forces the smaller h d also leads to a lower separated velocity at the top leading edge of the structures resulting in a lower recirculation length furthermore when h d is smaller the vertical distance of the separated flow which reattaches the bottom of the domain is shorter and this also leads to a smaller x r d therefore based on these two reasons it can be confirmed that x r d decreases with the decreasing h d 3 6 wall shear stress and flow patterns the wall shear stress τ on the surface of the bottom wall is studied τ is given as 13 τ μ u y y 0 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid 3 6 1 effect of δ d on the wall shear stress in the present study the non dimensional bottom wall shear stress τ τ along the horizontal direction for the entire domain and around the front face of the 2d rib at different r e and δ d with a constant h d 1 0 are illustrated in fig 9 here τ is the undisturbed bottom wall shear stress the τ τ for the entire domain at r e 1 19 10 5 are shown in fig 9 a and the one at r e 5 0 10 5 is displayed in fig 9 c the results around the front face of the 2d rib with zoom in plots are shown in fig 9 b and d respectively from the figures the following phenomena can be observed 1 because of the lower viscous effect with the increasing r e the absolute value of τ τ is the lowest at r e 5 0 10 5 2 due to the backflow caused by the block effects of the 2d rib there is a small negative τ τ in front of the 2d rib with decreasing δ d the velocity gradient in the vertical direction is higher and induces higher negative peak value of τ τ 3 owing to the recirculation motions the bottom wall shear stress has a large negative region behind the 2d rib see fig 9 a and c the absolute peak value of the negative bottom wall shear stress region increases with the increasing δ d 3 6 2 effect of h d on the wall shear stress the effect of h d on τ τ along the bottom surface for the entire domain and around the front face of the 2d rib at r e 5 0 105 and δ d 0 73 are shown in fig 10 it can be found that 1 the negative τ τ region in front of the 2d rib is smaller with higher absolute peak values with the decreasing h d 2 due to the reduced recirculation length behind the 2d rib with the decreasing h d the negative τ τ region behind the 2d rib becomes smaller and the absolute peak value decreases the location of the peak value tends to be closer to the structures 3 6 3 flow patterns the streamlines are illustrated in fig 11 at r e 5 0 10 5 with δ d 0 73 and different h d from the figure it can be observed clearly that there are three main recirculation motions around the 2d rib at the front corner of the 2d rib the flow hits the 2d rib and creates a downflow towards the bottom boundary and then reverse their direction because of the bottom wall therefore a vortex is formed around the front corner with the decreasing h d the vortex becomes smaller the second one is the largest and is generated by the shear layer separation after the front top edge of the 2d rib the third recirculation motion is formed at the downward corner of the 2d rib and is induced by the large recirculation motion it also becomes smaller with the decreasing h d due to the weaker large recirculation behind the 2d rib moreover both the height and the length of the largest recirculation increase with the increasing h d because the separation velocity becomes larger and the distance for the flow to reattach the bottom wall becomes longer 4 conclusions in the present study two dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent boundary layer flows at high reynolds numbers around a partially buried 2d rib with a rectangular cross section are performed based on the rans equations combined with the k ω sst model and the wall functions the effects of different reynolds numbers r e different normalized thicknesses of the incident boundary layer flow δ d and different normalized heights of the 2d rib exposed to the flow h d on the hydrodynamic quantities are studied systematically in the validation study the simulation results of the drag coefficient c d are compared with the published experimental measurements reported by arie et al 1975 and the numerical results given by tauqeer et al 2017 while the horizontal velocity profiles are compared with the experimental measurements reported by liu et al 2008 the results are in good agreement with the published experimental and numerical data after the validation study it can be concluded that the present rans simulations with the k ω sst turbulence model is suitable for predicting the flow around partially buried 2d ribs subjected to a boundary layer flow at high r e based on the simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the drag coefficient c d lift coefficient c l and the normalized recirculation length x r d increase with increasing r e and then tend to be stable at larger r e the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c l decrease while x r d increases slightly with the increasing δ d the hydrodynamic quantities c d c l and x r d all increase monotonically with the increasing h d due to stronger blocking effects of the structure to the flow 2 the amplitudes of the wall shear stress on the surface of the bottom wall i e τ τ decreases when the r e increases a small negative region in front of the 2d rib and a larger negative region of τ τ behind the 2d rib are found the absolute peak value of the negative τ τ in front of the 2d rib increases with the decreasing δ d the absolute peak value of the negative τ τ behind the 2d rib decreases with the decreasing h d 3 three main recirculation motions around the 2d rib can be observed the first vortex is formed at front corner of the 2d rib the second the largest is generated by the shear layer separation after the front top edge of the 2d rib and the third is formed at the downward corner of the 2d rib moreover both the height and the length of the largest recirculation

22096,this paper presents a numerical study of the effect of spring stiffness and mass ratio on flow induced vibration fiv of a square cylinder placed at four different incidence angles α 0 10 22 5 45 the fiv is dominated by vortex induced vibration viv while another common form of fiv galloping is only found at α 0 a period doubled mode which has a half of the shedding frequency of a fix body frequency component is found in all incidence angles except 0 for these cases of α 22 5 4 5 there exists a limiting mass ratio beyond which period doubled does not exist however all mass ratio has a period doubled mode at α 10 due to its high asymmetry the parameter of effective elasticity k e f f 1 combined by mass ratio and spring stiffness is introduced in this paper for the period double mode and galloping another effective elasticity k e f f 0 5 related to half of the frequency of a fix body is needed the results show that the different flow regimes is a function of the effective elasticity rather than the reduce velocity with the change of mass ratio and spring stiffness by using the effective elasticity the limited mass ratio for occurrence of galloping can be determined keywords flow induced vibration square cylinder mass ratio spring stiffness effect elasticity 1 introduction flow induced vibration is an important problem in many fields of engineering such as marine cables flexible riser in petroleum productions and other marine applications bridges derakhshandeh and alam 2019 there are two typical phenomena of fiv viv and galloping viv of a circular cylinder has been extensively investigated in a range of reduced velocity the reduced velocity is defined as u u f n h with u f n h being the fluid velocity natural frequency and the length of the cross section perpendicular to the flow respectively this led to a large of work well covered in the review articles by williamson and govardhan 2004 williamson and govardhan 2008 and bearman 2011 khalak and williamson 1999 carried out a series of experiments on viv of a circular cylinder for low mass damping they found that the response consists of three branches initial branch lower branch and upper branch compared with the circular cylinder the square cylinder is less well documented sen and mittal 2011 cao and tamura 2017 arif and hasan 2019a arif and hasan 2019b arif and hasan 2019c apart from viv the galloping is another important phenomenon in fiv of a square cylinder galloping is characterized by large oscillation amplitude with a frequency much lower than the vortex shedding frequency amandolese and hemon 2010 performed an experiment on free vibration of a square cylinder with low damping they found a transient regime between the initial and lower branch joly et al 2012 studied transverse galloping of a square cylinder by a sinusoidal quasi steady model the critical reynolds number for the onset of galloping is 140 they found that galloping amplitude decreased abruptly for decreasing values of mass ratio close to 3 at re 200 and they developed an analytical model to explain this phenomenon there is less attention paid to a cylinder with an incidence angle α if the structure is not symmetric the incidence angle plays an important role in the response of the system nemes et al 2012 reported an experiment investigation on the influence of incidence angle on the fiv of a square cylinder for the range of 10 α 25 they found a new mode they referred to this new mode as the higher branch for its oscillation amplitude larger than the upper branch zhao et al 2014 found that in fact this mode is actually a kind of subharmonic viv cui et al 2015 investigated the fiv of a rectangular cylinder and a square cylinder at three different incidence angles 0 22 5 45 by two dimensional numerical simulations the higher branch at 22 5 that was observed in experiments was predicted well by the numerical simulations banafsheh et al seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 studied experimentally the fiv of a triangular prism allowed to oscillated in the transverse direction the incidence angle is varying from 0 to 6 0 the higher branch was found at the incidence angles α 3 0 3 5 massai et al 2018a studied the effect of incidence angle on fiv of a rectangular cylinder which has a side ratio 1 5 three different response types of the incidence angle were identified based on the amplitude and frequency leontini and thompson 2013 presented a study of the effect of corner radius on fiv of a square cylinder at α 45 seven different response types were distinguished below a critical radius a period doubled mode was found the period doubled in fact is higher branch zhao et al 2013 presented a numerical study on two degree of freedom vibrations of a square cylinder with incidence angle α 0 22 5 45 at re 100 there was two lock in regimes of α 22 5 leontini et al 2018 studied numerically the fiv of an elliptical cross section which has an aspect ratio 1 5 at various incidence angles from 0 to 9 0 for angles between 3 0 α 5 5 the period doubled was found zhao et al 2018 experimentally studied the fiv of a semicircular placed at two incidence angles of α 0 and α 18 0 they found that the cylinder exhibits viv and galloping for the case of α 0 and the fiv was dominated by viv for α 18 0 besides the cylinder cross section the parameters are important in fiv of the system include mass ratio m structural damping ζ spring stiffness and reynolds number re the mass ratio shiels et al 2001 investigated a series of spring stiffness and mass ratio parameters of fiv of a circular cylinder with a viscous vortex method mass ratio and spring stiffness was combined to be a single parameter effective elasticity k e f f k 4 π 2 f 2 m where f is the primary frequency of cylinder response and k k is the nondimensional spring stiffness and the single parameter completely defined the fiv response garg et al 2018 have investigated the effect of mass ratio prandtl number and richardson number on viv of a circular cylinder in the presence of thermal buoyancy sen and mittal 2015 studied the effects of mass ratio on free vibrations of a square cylinder the parameters were re 50 200 and f n 14 39 re the mass ratio was set to 1 5 10 20 galloping is not observed until the mass ratio greeter than 5 sourav and sen 2019 found that the exact mass ratio was 3 4 soti et al 2018 studied the effect of damping on viv of a circular cylinder by water channel experiments increased damping was found to reduce the range of synchronization region zhang et al 2018 studied the effects of damping ratio and mass ratio on fim of a square cylinder galloping would disappear as damping ratio increased to 0 8 while most of previous work focus on the effect of system parameters on the fiv of a cylinder with no incidence angle limited attention has been given to a square cylinder placed with a incidence angle zhao et al 2019 investigated experimentally the effect of mass ratio on the fiv of a square cylinder placed at different incidence angles that work is based on zhao et al 2014 and the incidence angles they choose was α 0 20 45 for the α 20 case there exists a critical mass ratio above which the period doubled does not persist in this paper a spectral element method is used to investigate fiv of a square cylinder with an incidence angle at a reynolds number of 200 typical fiv experiments and numerical simulations are performed by varying the flow speed at a given mass and spring stiffness or focused on a single mass ratio of the square cylinder the current numerical simulations consider the effect of mass ratio and spring stiffness on fiv of a square with an incidence angle respectively a series of simulations are conducted over the range 0 5 k 10 and 2 m 10 in increments of 0 5 four incidence angles α 0 10 22 5 45 are selected compare with the experiments in zhao et al 2014 and zhao et al 2019 the incidence angle α 10 is contained in this simulation for its high asymmetry the response in α 10 is different from α 22 5 even though they all have higher branch for the α 22 5 case the higher branch will disappear with mass ratio increasing to 5 5 however higher branch exist in all mass ratio in α 10 different flow modes are distinguished on the k m map it is found that different flow regimes are related to the effective elasticity rather than the reduced velocity 2 method and validation 2 1 numerical method a schematic of the transverse fiv of a square cylinder with a variable incidence angle is given in fig 1 the governing equations are

with the inlet and lateral boundaries placed 20d from the center of the body and the outlet is situated 30d away from the center of the body for the velocity a dirichlet condition u 1 v 0 is set at the inlet and lateral boundaries and a neumann condition u 0 v 0 at the outlet a no slip condition u 0 v 0 is set on the surface of the cylinder for the pressure a high order neumann condition karniadakis et al 1991 is set at all boundaries except outlet where a dirichlet condition p 0 is used a second order time splitting scheme karniadakis et al 1991 is used for time integration with a time step δ t u h 0 005 the simulations are conducted using a spectral element method cantwell et al 2015 the computational domain is split to 700 triangular macro elements as shown in fig 2 the spatial convergence is realized as the order of the polynomial shape functions n increases with the same macro elements table 1 shows values of displacement amplitude a y and root mean square rms lift coefficient c l for different polynomial orders the displacement amplitude a y is defined as a y y max y min 2 d with y max and y min being the maximum and the minimum transverse displacement respectively the relative difference δ is compared with the result of n 8 the table shows that the difference in these quantities are relatively small less than 1 as n 8 and this satisfies the convergence requirements therefore n 8 is used for the current study 2 2 validation in order to validate the numerical method flow past a stationary square cylinder at re 200 and a viv of square cylinder at incidence angle 22 5 are simulated and the results are compared with other numerical results published in previous literature table 2 shows the comparison of the numerical results with the published results for a stationary cylinder in literature the strouhal number is defined as s t f s h u where f s is the vortex shedding frequency the drag coefficient c d is defined as c d 2 f x ρ u 2 h with f x being the stream force for the body the predicted time averaged mean c d and strouhal number s t by the present model compare favorably with other numerical results fig 3 compares the present numerical results with those by zhao et al 2013 the variation of a y with the reduced velocity u from the present agrees well with zhao et al 2013 the difference between the two studies is less than 5 except at u 7 it may because of that the response is desynchronisation at this reduced velocity 3 results 3 1 flow regimes as a function of nondimensional spring stiffness and mass ratio at α 22 5 the fiv of the square cylinder is first investigated for the case of α 22 5 the flow response is similar to that of a circular cylinder except a period doubled mode six different regimes mode i v and desynchronisation have been identified based on the wake vortex shedding and displacement response images of vorticity time traces and normalized fast fourier transform fft results of displacement of each modes are shown in fig 4 fig 5 presents the simulation results for the case of α 22 5 the frequency ratio f r is defined as f r f s t with f f h u being nondimensional frequency the results show that flow regimes is affected by mass ratio and spring stiffness but the frequency of the cylinder response is almost not affected the primary frequency of the body mode i iii iv v is close to strouhal frequency rather than the natural frequency of the body the amplitude of lift force and displacement were used for the fact that the incidence angle of the body will generate non mean lift and displacement mode i and ii is similar to the initial branch of a circular cylinder khalak and williamson 1996 with small vibration amplitude mode ii consists of two frequencies the natural structural frequency f n and the vortex shedding frequency of the fixed cylinder as shown in fig 4 b the primary body vibration frequency in the range of mode ii is decrease to the strouhal vortex shedding frequency as mass ratio increasing in fig 5 a mode ii can be quasiperiodic influenced by the vortex in the wake as mode ii loss its stability the wake vorticity becomes more complicated and the mode becomes desynchronisation as shown in fig 6 the desynchronisation is related to mode competition between mode ii and mode iii leontini and thompson 2013 compared with mode ii the desynchronisation has a another small positive vortex due to the large displacement amplitude which is similar to mode iii mode iii shows a p s wake as shown in fig 4 c the positive vortex from the bottom side splits into a large and a small vortex and forms this mode the phase between body displacement and lift force can be 0 or 18 0 resulting large or small lift force as shown in fig 7 the amplitude of displacement is similar in the two case but the lift coefficient of fig 7 a is twice that of fig 7 b mode iv shows a type of subharmonic viv with a frequency close to half of the strouhal frequency as shown in fig 4 d this mode is first defined as higher branch by nemes nemes et al 2012 and period doubled by leontini leontini et al 2018 besides the sub harmonic f 2 harmonic of f 4 is present within the mode iv region at α 22 5 in fig 8 it was also found in a rectangular cylinder by massai massai et al 2018b experimentally the response of mode v is similar to mode i in vorticity and body motion but there is a difference in the phase between the body displacement and the lift force the lift force amplitude in the range of mode i and mode v is almost constant and close to the fixed body it seems because of the lower displacement amplitude in these two modes 3 2 the concept of effective elasticity the concept of effective elasticity was firstly brought by shiels et al 2001 in the research of viv of a circular cylinder if damping is zero and the cylinder is sinusoidal mass ratio m and nondimensional spring stiffness k can be combined into a single effective dimensionless parameter k e f f for the circular cylinder the parameter h equals to d if pure sinusoidal motion y a sin 2 π f τ equation 3 becomes 4 2 π 2 f 2 m k a sin 2 π f τ 1 2 c sin 2 π f τ or 5 k e f f a 1 2 c l where the effective elasticity k e f f is defined by 6 k e f f k 4 π 2 f 2 m for any k m which make k e f f the same the cylinder motion will be the same therefore the single parameter k e f f then completely defines the system at a given value of reynolds number and their results suggested that the damping coefficient smaller than 1 0 2 has little effect on the motion especially at low values of mass ratio for the fiv of a square cylinder at α 22 5 the response is similar with circular cylinder except a subharmonic mode which has a half primary frequency component so there are two effective elasticity in the square cylinder as in equation 7 7 k e f f 0 5 k π 2 d 2 h 2 m f 2 k e f f 1 k 4 π 2 d 2 h 2 m f 2 it can be seen from equation 7 that for any choices k m which keep k e f f i constant a single response is consistent with the governing equation of motion however there does not exist two groups of k m that can make k e f f 0 5 and k e f f 1 equal so for higher branch regime the spring stiffness is as important as the mass ratio there are two values worth noting when k e f f 1 0 the phase φ between the displacement and vortex shedding changes from 0 to 18 0 as the f in the periodic oscillations is very close to s t so when k e f f 1 0 the corresponding reduced velocity will be u 1 f 1 s t another notable effective stiffness value is k e f f 0 5 0 and the corresponding reduced velocity is u 2 s t it is the switch of φ from 18 0 to 90 as shown in zhao et al 2018 fig 9 presents contours of the effective elasticity k e f f 1 and k e f f 0 5 for the case of α 22 5 the range of different regimes except mode iv only relate to k e f f 1 mode i exists on the range of k e f f 1 5 5 mode ii exists on the range of 3 5 k e f f 1 5 5 mode iii consists in the range of 2 k e f f 1 2 for it needs large amplitudes mode v exist on the range of k e f f 1 2 it is remarkable that some of desynchronisation exists on the range of k e f f 1 2 because of the larger frequency of the response mode iv exists over the range 0 k e f f 0 5 2 2 k e f f 1 0 the dependence of this mode on k e f f 0 5 and k e f f 1 can be understood as described by zhao et al 2014 it was hypothesized that the period doubled mode is caused by vorticity produced at the rear surface of the body due to the motion it can explain that mode iv only exists in the range of k e f f 1 0 k e f f 0 5 0 the second negative vortex is related to the body motion this means the vortex shedding mode is sensitive to the effective elasticity once k e f f 0 5 exceeds a given value the subharmonic synchronization cannot be maintained fig 10 presents the relationship between the boundaries on the map of fig 5 d and effective elasticity parameters the primary frequency f is set to be a constant to make the different effective elasticity parameters being a straight line in the k m map the range of flow regime can be represented by the values of different effective elasticity if flow regime is related to the reduced velocity u the boundary lines will pass through the origin 3 3 the response for different incidence angles to discuss the impact of α on the viv response of a square cylinder another three different incidence angles α 0 1 0 45 were chosen fig 11 shows the contours of response as a function of mass ratio and spring stiffness for the case of α 0 compared with the fiv of a square cylinder with an incidence angle the fiv of a square at α 0 has a galloping branch the onset of galloping is marked with the mismatch of vortex shedding and body oscillation and high displacement amplitude the flow regimes are shown in fig 11 d and there has no mode i iii in α 0 there is a transition region between galloping and mode v which is desynchronisation with low displacement amplitude as shown in fig 14 fig 12 and fig 13 show the contours of the effective elasticity parameters and the relationship between the boundaries and the effective elasticity parameters for the case of α 0 the range of galloping is k e f f 0 5 k π 2 f 2 m 0 9 as m decreases k needs to be reduced to meets this condition resulting in galloping at a higher u this suggests that there exists a critical mass ratio which is 0 9 π 2 f 2 2 8 as k 0 below which galloping disappears u the mass ratio 2 8 is the minimum value for galloping and the onset of transition regime k e f f 0 5 0 is close to u 2 s t the experiments in zhao et al 2018 for a semicircular showed that the phase between flow force and the displacement jumps from 0 to 18 0 at u 5 6 and decreases after u 10 which is the onset of transition regime from the perspective of the effective stiffness u 5 6 represents k e f f 1 0 and u 10 for k e f f 0 5 0 this could explain the double relationship between the two reduced velocity fig 15 presents the results for the case of α 1 0 the primary frequency in mode iv changes to be half of the strouhal number for α 1 0 it does indeed share many features with α 22 5 however there still some difference between the two different incidence angles as can be seen in fig 15 d mode iv exists on all the m cases for α 1 0 while there exists a limiting mass ratio beyond which period doubled does not exist for α 22 5 for mode iv or period doubled is caused by the acceleration of the rear surface of the body the surface needs to be approximately aligned with the direction of the acceleration of the body for lower values of α e g α 1 0 it easier to implement and so there is no limited mass ratio for mode iv fig 16 and fig 17 show the contours of the effective elasticity and the relationship between the boundaries and effective elasticity for the case of α 1 0 meanwhile mode iii only exists on the range of k e f f 1 0 and the range becomes much smaller than α 22 5 it seems that some cases convert from mode iii to mode v as displacement amplitude decrease at α 1 0 fig 18 shows the result of α 4 5 the range of mode iv is worst in α 4 5 but it is opposite for mode iii fig 19 and fig 20 show the contours of the effective elasticity and the relationship between the boundaries and effective elasticity for the case of α 4 5 there are three striking features for α 4 5 firstly mode i is not been found perhaps it appears in higher k or lower u secondly for mode iii the small vortex can be generate from either side of the wake as shown in fig 21 thirdly the desynchronisation as shown in fig 22 is a quasi periodic p s mode and the region is related to mass ratio and disappeared at high mass ratio further investigation is required to completely understand this phenomenon the experiments in zhao 2019 zhao et al 2019 show that onset of desynchronisation varies with m for α 4 5 i e u 7 5 for m 2 64 u 7 for m 7 5 u 6 7 for m 10 u 6 4 for m 15 this phenomenon can be explained well by the effective elasticity in fig 23 after converting the u to corresponding k the k scales with m and the slope is close to 4 π 2 d 2 s t 2 h 2 the red line represents k e f f 1 1 3 and the primary frequency is set to f 0 17 4 conclusions the effect of spring stiffness and mass ratio on the flow induced vibration of a square cylinder placed at four different incidence angles α 0 1 0 22 5 45 has been investigated by using a spectral element method the cylinder oscillates only in the transverse direction with zero structural damping for the α 0 case the structural response exhibits viv transition and galloping for other cases the response is dominated by viv five different periodic flow modes including the period doubled mode which is a type of subharmonic viv have been identified based on vortex shedding and body motion the period doubled mode is found in all incidence angle except α 0 and its range becomes narrower as incidence angle α increases for α 22 5 45 there exists a critical mass ratio above which the period double disappears which was found in experiment before however all the m case exhibits the period doubled for the α 1 0 case due to its high asymmetry the parameter of effective elasticity k e f f 1 firstly used in the viv of a circular cylinder is introduced to describe the effect of mass ratio and spring stiffness on the fiv of a square cylinder compared with the circular cylinder another effective elasticity k e f f 0 5 related to half of the strouhal frequency is needed the results show that the range of different flow regimes is related to the value of effective elasticity for the same incidence angle one of the necessary conditions of the existence of period doubled is k e f f 1 0 k e f f 0 5 0 the scope of galloping follows k e f f 0 5 0 9 this means that there exists a critical mass ratio m c r i t 2 8 below which galloping disappears it is found that the incidence angle has significant effects on the existence of period doubled by varying the rear face of the body the flow mode is highly dependent on the effective elasticity and incidence angle future studies should also investigate

22096,this paper presents a numerical study of the effect of spring stiffness and mass ratio on flow induced vibration fiv of a square cylinder placed at four different incidence angles α 0 10 22 5 45 the fiv is dominated by vortex induced vibration viv while another common form of fiv galloping is only found at α 0 a period doubled mode which has a half of the shedding frequency of a fix body frequency component is found in all incidence angles except 0 for these cases of α 22 5 4 5 there exists a limiting mass ratio beyond which period doubled does not exist however all mass ratio has a period doubled mode at α 10 due to its high asymmetry the parameter of effective elasticity k e f f 1 combined by mass ratio and spring stiffness is introduced in this paper for the period double mode and galloping another effective elasticity k e f f 0 5 related to half of the frequency of a fix body is needed the results show that the different flow regimes is a function of the effective elasticity rather than the reduce velocity with the change of mass ratio and spring stiffness by using the effective elasticity the limited mass ratio for occurrence of galloping can be determined keywords flow induced vibration square cylinder mass ratio spring stiffness effect elasticity 1 introduction flow induced vibration is an important problem in many fields of engineering such as marine cables flexible riser in petroleum productions and other marine applications bridges derakhshandeh and alam 2019 there are two typical phenomena of fiv viv and galloping viv of a circular cylinder has been extensively investigated in a range of reduced velocity the reduced velocity is defined as u u f n h with u f n h being the fluid velocity natural frequency and the length of the cross section perpendicular to the flow respectively this led to a large of work well covered in the review articles by williamson and govardhan 2004 williamson and govardhan 2008 and bearman 2011 khalak and williamson 1999 carried out a series of experiments on viv of a circular cylinder for low mass damping they found that the response consists of three branches initial branch lower branch and upper branch compared with the circular cylinder the square cylinder is less well documented sen and mittal 2011 cao and tamura 2017 arif and hasan 2019a arif and hasan 2019b arif and hasan 2019c apart from viv the galloping is another important phenomenon in fiv of a square cylinder galloping is characterized by large oscillation amplitude with a frequency much lower than the vortex shedding frequency amandolese and hemon 2010 performed an experiment on free vibration of a square cylinder with low damping they found a transient regime between the initial and lower branch joly et al 2012 studied transverse galloping of a square cylinder by a sinusoidal quasi steady model the critical reynolds number for the onset of galloping is 140 they found that galloping amplitude decreased abruptly for decreasing values of mass ratio close to 3 at re 200 and they developed an analytical model to explain this phenomenon there is less attention paid to a cylinder with an incidence angle α if the structure is not symmetric the incidence angle plays an important role in the response of the system nemes et al 2012 reported an experiment investigation on the influence of incidence angle on the fiv of a square cylinder for the range of 10 α 25 they found a new mode they referred to this new mode as the higher branch for its oscillation amplitude larger than the upper branch zhao et al 2014 found that in fact this mode is actually a kind of subharmonic viv cui et al 2015 investigated the fiv of a rectangular cylinder and a square cylinder at three different incidence angles 0 22 5 45 by two dimensional numerical simulations the higher branch at 22 5 that was observed in experiments was predicted well by the numerical simulations banafsheh et al seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 studied experimentally the fiv of a triangular prism allowed to oscillated in the transverse direction the incidence angle is varying from 0 to 6 0 the higher branch was found at the incidence angles α 3 0 3 5 massai et al 2018a studied the effect of incidence angle on fiv of a rectangular cylinder which has a side ratio 1 5 three different response types of the incidence angle were identified based on the amplitude and frequency leontini and thompson 2013 presented a study of the effect of corner radius on fiv of a square cylinder at α 45 seven different response types were distinguished below a critical radius a period doubled mode was found the period doubled in fact is higher branch zhao et al 2013 presented a numerical study on two degree of freedom vibrations of a square cylinder with incidence angle α 0 22 5 45 at re 100 there was two lock in regimes of α 22 5 leontini et al 2018 studied numerically the fiv of an elliptical cross section which has an aspect ratio 1 5 at various incidence angles from 0 to 9 0 for angles between 3 0 α 5 5 the period doubled was found zhao et al 2018 experimentally studied the fiv of a semicircular placed at two incidence angles of α 0 and α 18 0 they found that the cylinder exhibits viv and galloping for the case of α 0 and the fiv was dominated by viv for α 18 0 besides the cylinder cross section the parameters are important in fiv of the system include mass ratio m structural damping ζ spring stiffness and reynolds number re the mass ratio shiels et al 2001 investigated a series of spring stiffness and mass ratio parameters of fiv of a circular cylinder with a viscous vortex method mass ratio and spring stiffness was combined to be a single parameter effective elasticity k e f f k 4 π 2 f 2 m where f is the primary frequency of cylinder response and k k is the nondimensional spring stiffness and the single parameter completely defined the fiv response garg et al 2018 have investigated the effect of mass ratio prandtl number and richardson number on viv of a circular cylinder in the presence of thermal buoyancy sen and mittal 2015 studied the effects of mass ratio on free vibrations of a square cylinder the parameters were re 50 200 and f n 14 39 re the mass ratio was set to 1 5 10 20 galloping is not observed until the mass ratio greeter than 5 sourav and sen 2019 found that the exact mass ratio was 3 4 soti et al 2018 studied the effect of damping on viv of a circular cylinder by water channel experiments increased damping was found to reduce the range of synchronization region zhang et al 2018 studied the effects of damping ratio and mass ratio on fim of a square cylinder galloping would disappear as damping ratio increased to 0 8 while most of previous work focus on the effect of system parameters on the fiv of a cylinder with no incidence angle limited attention has been given to a square cylinder placed with a incidence angle zhao et al 2019 investigated experimentally the effect of mass ratio on the fiv of a square cylinder placed at different incidence angles that work is based on zhao et al 2014 and the incidence angles they choose was α 0 20 45 for the α 20 case there exists a critical mass ratio above which the period doubled does not persist in this paper a spectral element method is used to investigate fiv of a square cylinder with an incidence angle at a reynolds number of 200 typical fiv experiments and numerical simulations are performed by varying the flow speed at a given mass and spring stiffness or focused on a single mass ratio of the square cylinder the current numerical simulations consider the effect of mass ratio and spring stiffness on fiv of a square with an incidence angle respectively a series of simulations are conducted over the range 0 5 k 10 and 2 m 10 in increments of 0 5 four incidence angles α 0 10 22 5 45 are selected compare with the experiments in zhao et al 2014 and zhao et al 2019 the incidence angle α 10 is contained in this simulation for its high asymmetry the response in α 10 is different from α 22 5 even though they all have higher branch for the α 22 5 case the higher branch will disappear with mass ratio increasing to 5 5 however higher branch exist in all mass ratio in α 10 different flow modes are distinguished on the k m map it is found that different flow regimes are related to the effective elasticity rather than the reduced velocity 2 method and validation 2 1 numerical method a schematic of the transverse fiv of a square cylinder with a variable incidence angle is given in fig 1 the governing equations are nondimensional incompressible navier stokes equations and the equation of body motion in a reference frame attached to the body leontini and thompson 2013 as 1 u τ u u p 1 re 2 u y 2 u 0 3 d 2 h 2 m y c y k y 1 2 c l here u u v is the nondimensional velocity field normalized by fluid velocity u τ t u h is the nondimensional time h sin α cos α d is the maximum distance of the cross section p p ρ u 2 is the nondimensional pressure re u h υ is the reynolds number y y h is the nondimensional displacement m m m d is the mass ratio m d ρ d 2 is the displaced mass of the fluid k k ρ u 2 is the nondimensional spring stiffness c 2 c ρ u h is the nondimensional structure damping and is set to zero in this simulation c l 2 f y ρ u 2 h is the lift coefficient the dimensional parameters are time

with the inlet and lateral boundaries placed 20d from the center of the body and the outlet is situated 30d away from the center of the body for the velocity a dirichlet condition u 1 v 0 is set at the inlet and lateral boundaries and a neumann condition u 0 v 0 at the outlet a no slip condition u 0 v 0 is set on the surface of the cylinder for the pressure a high order neumann condition karniadakis et al 1991 is set at all boundaries except outlet where a dirichlet condition p 0 is used a second order time splitting scheme karniadakis et al 1991 is used for time integration with a time step δ t u h 0 005 the simulations are conducted using a spectral element method cantwell et al 2015 the computational domain is split to 700 triangular macro elements as shown in fig 2 the spatial convergence is realized as the order of the polynomial shape functions n increases with the same macro elements table 1 shows values of displacement amplitude a y and root mean square rms lift coefficient c l for different polynomial orders the displacement amplitude a y is defined as a y y max y min 2 d with y max and y min being the maximum and the minimum transverse displacement respectively the relative difference δ is compared with the result of n 8 the table shows that the difference in these quantities are relatively small less than 1 as n 8 and this satisfies the convergence requirements therefore n 8 is used for the current study 2 2 validation in order to validate the numerical method flow past a stationary square cylinder at re 200 and a viv of square cylinder at incidence angle 22 5 are simulated and the results are compared with other numerical results published in previous literature table 2 shows the comparison of the numerical results with the published results for a stationary cylinder in literature the strouhal number is defined as s t f s h u where f s is the vortex shedding frequency the drag coefficient c d is defined as c d 2 f x ρ u 2 h with f x being the stream force for the body the predicted time averaged mean c d and strouhal number s t by the present model compare favorably with other numerical results fig 3 compares the present numerical results with those by zhao et al 2013 the variation of a y with the reduced velocity u from the present agrees well with zhao et al 2013 the difference between the two studies is less than 5 except at u 7 it may because of that the response is desynchronisation at this reduced velocity 3 results 3 1 flow regimes as a function of nondimensional spring stiffness and mass ratio at α 22 5 the fiv of the square cylinder is first investigated for the case of α 22 5 the flow response is similar to that of a circular cylinder except a period doubled mode six different regimes mode i v and desynchronisation have been identified based on the wake vortex shedding and displacement response images of vorticity time traces and normalized fast fourier transform fft results of displacement of each modes are shown in fig 4 fig 5 presents the simulation results for the case of α 22 5 the frequency ratio f r is defined as f r f s t with f f h u being nondimensional frequency the results show that flow regimes is affected by mass ratio and spring stiffness but the frequency of the cylinder response is almost not affected the primary frequency of the body mode i iii iv v is close to strouhal frequency rather than the natural frequency of the body the amplitude of lift force and displacement were used for the fact that the incidence angle of the body will generate non mean lift and displacement mode i and ii is similar to the initial branch of a circular cylinder khalak and williamson 1996 with small vibration amplitude mode ii consists of two frequencies the natural structural frequency f n and the vortex shedding frequency of the fixed cylinder as shown in fig 4 b the primary body vibration frequency in the range of mode ii is decrease to the strouhal vortex shedding frequency as mass ratio increasing in fig 5 a mode ii can be quasiperiodic influenced by the vortex in the wake as mode ii loss its stability the wake vorticity becomes more complicated and the mode becomes desynchronisation as shown in fig 6 the desynchronisation is related to mode competition between mode ii and mode iii leontini and thompson 2013 compared with mode ii the desynchronisation has a another small positive vortex due to the large displacement amplitude which is similar to mode iii mode iii shows a p s wake as shown in fig 4 c the positive vortex from the bottom side splits into a large and a small vortex and forms this mode the phase between body displacement and lift force can be 0 or 18 0 resulting large or small lift force as shown in fig 7 the amplitude of displacement is similar in the two case but the lift coefficient of fig 7 a is twice that of fig 7 b mode iv shows a type of subharmonic viv with a frequency close to half of the strouhal frequency as shown in fig 4 d this mode is first defined as higher branch by nemes nemes et al 2012 and period doubled by leontini leontini et al 2018 besides the sub harmonic f 2 harmonic of f 4 is present within the mode iv region at α 22 5 in fig 8 it was also found in a rectangular cylinder by massai massai et al 2018b experimentally the response of mode v is similar to mode i in vorticity and body motion but there is a difference in the phase between the body displacement and the lift force the lift force amplitude in the range of mode i and mode v is almost constant and close to the fixed body it seems because of the lower displacement amplitude in these two modes 3 2 the concept of effective elasticity the concept of effective elasticity was firstly brought by shiels et al 2001 in the research of viv of a circular cylinder if damping is zero and the cylinder is sinusoidal mass ratio m and nondimensional spring stiffness k can be combined into a single effective dimensionless parameter k e f f for the circular cylinder the parameter h equals to d if pure sinusoidal motion y a sin 2 π f τ equation 3 becomes 4 2 π 2 f 2 m k a sin 2 π f τ 1 2 c sin 2 π f τ or 5 k e f f a 1 2 c l where the effective elasticity k e f f is defined by 6 k e f f k 4 π 2 f 2 m for any k m which make k e f f the same the cylinder motion will be the same therefore the single parameter k e f f then completely defines the system at a given value of reynolds number and their results suggested that the damping coefficient smaller than 1 0 2 has little effect on the motion especially at low values of mass ratio for the fiv of a square cylinder at α 22 5 the response is similar with circular cylinder except a subharmonic mode which has a half primary frequency component so there are two effective elasticity in the square cylinder as in equation 7 7 k e f f 0 5 k π 2 d 2 h 2 m f 2 k e f f 1 k 4 π 2 d 2 h 2 m f 2 it can be seen from equation 7 that for any choices k m which keep k e f f i constant a single response is consistent with the governing equation of motion however there does not exist two groups of k m that can make k e f f 0 5 and k e f f 1 equal so for higher branch regime the spring stiffness is as important as the mass ratio there are two values worth noting when k e f f 1 0 the phase φ between the displacement and vortex shedding changes from 0 to 18 0 as the f in the periodic oscillations is very close to s t so when k e f f 1 0 the corresponding reduced velocity will be u 1 f 1 s t another notable effective stiffness value is k e f f 0 5 0 and the corresponding reduced velocity is u 2 s t it is the switch of φ from 18 0 to 90 as shown in zhao et al 2018 fig 9 presents contours of the effective elasticity k e f f 1 and k e f f 0 5 for the case of α 22 5 the range of different regimes except mode iv only relate to k e f f 1 mode i exists on the range of k e f f 1 5 5 mode ii exists on the range of 3 5 k e f f 1 5 5 mode iii consists in the range of 2 k e f f 1 2 for it needs large amplitudes mode v exist on the range of k e f f 1 2 it is remarkable that some of desynchronisation exists on the range of k e f f 1 2 because of the larger frequency of the response mode iv exists over the range 0 k e f f 0 5 2 2 k e f f 1 0 the dependence of this mode on k e f f 0 5 and k e f f 1 can be understood as described by zhao et al 2014 it was hypothesized that the period doubled mode is caused by vorticity produced at the rear surface of the body due to the motion it can explain that mode iv only exists in the range of k e f f 1 0 k e f f 0 5 0 the second negative vortex is related to the body motion this means the vortex shedding mode is sensitive to the effective elasticity once k e f f 0 5 exceeds a given value the subharmonic synchronization cannot be maintained fig 10 presents the relationship between the boundaries on the map of fig 5 d and effective elasticity parameters the primary frequency f is set to be a constant to make the different effective elasticity parameters being a straight line in the k m map the range of flow regime can be represented by the values of different effective elasticity if flow regime is related to the reduced velocity u the boundary lines will pass through the origin 3 3 the response for different incidence angles to discuss the impact of α on the viv response of a square cylinder another three different incidence angles α 0 1 0 45 were chosen fig 11 shows the contours of response as a function of mass ratio and spring stiffness for the case of α 0 compared with the fiv of a square cylinder with an incidence angle the fiv of a square at α 0 has a galloping branch the onset of galloping is marked with the mismatch of vortex shedding and body oscillation and high displacement amplitude the flow regimes are shown in fig 11 d and there has no mode i iii in α 0 there is a transition region between galloping and mode v which is desynchronisation with low displacement amplitude as shown in fig 14 fig 12 and fig 13 show the contours of the effective elasticity parameters and the relationship between the boundaries and the effective elasticity parameters for the case of α 0 the range of galloping is k e f f 0 5 k π 2 f 2 m 0 9 as m decreases k needs to be reduced to meets this condition resulting in galloping at a higher u this suggests that there exists a critical mass ratio which is 0 9 π 2 f 2 2 8 as k 0 below which galloping disappears u the mass ratio 2 8 is the minimum value for galloping and the onset of transition regime k e f f 0 5 0 is close to u 2 s t the experiments in zhao et al 2018 for a semicircular showed that the phase between flow force and the displacement jumps from 0 to 18 0 at u 5 6 and decreases after u 10 which is the onset of transition regime from the perspective of the effective stiffness u 5 6 represents k e f f 1 0 and u 10 for k e f f 0 5 0 this could explain the double relationship between the two reduced velocity fig 15 presents the results for the case of α 1 0 the primary frequency in mode iv changes to be half of the strouhal number for α 1 0 it does indeed share many features with α 22 5 however there still some difference between the two different incidence angles as can be seen in fig 15 d mode iv exists on all the m cases for α 1 0 while there exists a limiting mass ratio beyond which period doubled does not exist for α 22 5 for mode iv or period doubled is caused by the acceleration of the rear surface of the body the surface needs to be approximately aligned with the direction of the acceleration of the body for lower values of α e g α 1 0 it easier to implement and so there is no limited mass ratio for mode iv fig 16 and fig 17 show the contours of the effective elasticity and the relationship between the boundaries and effective elasticity for the case of α 1 0 meanwhile mode iii only exists on the range of k e f f 1 0 and the range becomes much smaller than α 22 5 it seems that some cases convert from mode iii to mode v as displacement amplitude decrease at α 1 0 fig 18 shows the result of α 4 5 the range of mode iv is worst in α 4 5 but it is opposite for mode iii fig 19 and fig 20 show the contours of the effective elasticity and the relationship between the boundaries and effective elasticity for the case of α 4 5 there are three striking features for α 4 5 firstly mode i is not been found perhaps it appears in higher k or lower u secondly for mode iii the small vortex can be generate from either side of the wake as shown in fig 21 thirdly the desynchronisation as shown in fig 22 is a quasi periodic p s mode and the region is related to mass ratio and disappeared at high mass ratio further investigation is required to completely understand this phenomenon the experiments in zhao 2019 zhao et al 2019 show that onset of desynchronisation varies with m for α 4 5 i e u 7 5 for m 2 64 u 7 for m 7 5 u 6 7 for m 10 u 6 4 for m 15 this phenomenon can be explained well by the effective elasticity in fig 23 after converting the u to corresponding k the k scales with m and the slope is close to 4 π 2 d 2 s t 2 h 2 the red line represents k e f f 1 1 3 and the primary frequency is set to f 0 17 4 conclusions the effect of spring stiffness and mass ratio on the flow induced vibration of a square cylinder placed at four different incidence angles α 0 1 0 22 5 45 has been investigated by using a spectral element method the cylinder oscillates only in the transverse direction with zero structural damping for the α 0 case the structural response exhibits viv transition and galloping for other cases the response is dominated by viv five different periodic flow modes including the period doubled mode which is a type of subharmonic viv have been identified based on vortex shedding and body motion the period doubled mode is found in all incidence angle except α 0 and its range becomes narrower as incidence angle α increases for α 22 5 45 there exists a critical mass ratio above which the period double disappears which was found in experiment before however all the m case exhibits the period doubled for the α 1 0 case due to its high asymmetry the parameter of effective elasticity k e f f 1 firstly used in the viv of a circular cylinder is introduced to describe the effect of mass ratio and spring stiffness on the fiv of a square cylinder compared with the circular cylinder another effective elasticity k e f f 0 5 related to half of the strouhal frequency is needed the results show that the range of different flow regimes is related to the value of effective elasticity for the same incidence angle one of the necessary conditions of the existence of period doubled is k e f f 1 0 k e f f 0 5 0 the scope of galloping follows k e f f 0 5 0 9 this means that there exists a critical mass ratio m c r i t 2 8 below which galloping disappears it is found that the incidence angle has significant effects on the existence of period doubled by varying the rear face of the body the flow mode is highly dependent on the effective elasticity and incidence angle future studies should also investigate the influence of the damping ratio and reynolds number on the fiv response of a square cylinder credit authorship contribution statement zhaolie tang conceptualization methodology software writing

22097,clustering analysis is commonly used for vessel traffic behaviour recognition the clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours which can assist authorities in transportation management however there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis first the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features such as speed and course second the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm a famous clustering analysis method is characterized by poor self adaption which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets these issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis to address these problems a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories the proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories furthermore the parzen window a non parametric estimation method and the multivariate gaussian distribution are employed to generate self adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the dbscan algorithm for a given sample set finally numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved dbscan algorithm the clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents keywords vessel behaviour recognition dbscan self adaption multi attribute trajectory characteristics 1 introduction global seaborne trade is doing well supported by the 2017 upswing in the world economy with an increase of 4 the fastest growth in five years global maritime trade has gathered momentum in the shipping industry after five years of decelerating growth a small improvement in world fleet expansion occurred in 2017 notably a total of 42 million gross tons were added to the global tonnage capacity in 2017 equivalent to a 3 3 growth rate increases in seaborne trade and world fleet capacity have resulted in rapid increases in port traffic volumes unctad 2018 this problem must be solved to balance the safety and capacity of the vessel traffic volume and ports hence it is necessary to take appropriate measures that guarantee safe and smooth traffic operations automatic identification system ais data and clustering analysis are often applied to achieve these goals because ais are mandatory on vessels engaged in international voyages with gross tonnages greater than 300 tons a clustering analysis can be utilized to group vessel traffic behaviour into clusters based on similar characteristics such as position speed and course of the vessel obtained from the ais the vessel traffic behaviour obtained from the cluster analysis results can be applied to monitor vessel movement and identify anomalies for instance regulators decide whether an observed behaviour is normal or worthy of further investigation by identifying the cluster to which a given vessel with a specific behaviour is attributed this approach also assists in maritime traffic control thus effective vessel traffic behaviour assessment can improve authority management efficiency and avoid accidents to some extent vessel traffic behaviour research was performed by fujii and tanaka 1971 however the analysis required considerable manpower and had high costs at the time vessel traffic data collected by vessel traffic services and ais represent high reliability vessel traffic information and the collection process involves less manpower and consumption requirements than previous methods meng et al 2014 therefore ais data are promising for obtaining and analysing vessel traffic behaviours many scholars have performed vessel traffic behaviour research kang et al 2018 proposed a fundamental vessel traffic diagram for the singapore strait and constructed vessel traffic speed density formulations the vessel traffic demand and spatiotemporal dynamics of vessel traffic in singapore port were analysed and several hotspots were identified by zhang et al 2019 pallotta et al 2013 and shelmerdine 2015 plotted ship trajectories on a map to examine the spatial and temporal variations in these trajectories the one way distance proposed by lin and su 2008 was applied by ma et al 2014 to measure trajectory similarities for spatial clustering and the vessel traffic patterns in the qiongzhou strait were investigated a dimensionality reduction based multistep clustering method was proposed by li et al 2017 in this approach dynamic time warping de vries and van someren 2012 was used to measure the distance between different trajectories and principal component analysis pca was utilized to decompose the distance matrix then the k medoids algorithm was applied to identify vessel traffic behaviour zhen et al 2017 applied the k medoids algorithm to cluster trajectories with a proposed improved hausdorff distance an unsupervised clustering analysis method based on track points was proposed by yan et al 2016 to identify the region of interest other researchers have focused on maritime anomaly detection ristic et al 2008 used kernel density estimation to construct motion anomaly detectors mascaro et al 2014 used a bayesian network to detect anomalous behaviour a supervised support vector machine was utilized by handayani et al 2014a 2014b to identify vessel anomaly behaviours rhodes et al 2007 2005 applied fuzzy artmap as a type of neural network classifier to recognize vessel anomaly behaviours furthermore some researchers have focused on improving clustering algorithms for instance a heuristic approach was adopted by yan et al 2016 to determine the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm parameters pan et al 2014 used entropy theory to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters zhao and shi 2019 applied maximum likelihood estimation to determine the radius eps value in the dbscan algorithm with a fixed minimum core objective quantity minpts the above studies can be grouped into three classes according to their focus vessel traffic characteristic analysis vessel traffic behaviour recognition and algorithm improvement vessel traffic characteristic analysis generally involves motion characteristics such as vessel speed vessel course and potential hotspots in contrast vessel traffic behaviour recognition based on clustering trajectories concentrates mostly on spatial features and ignores motion features in reality vessel traffic behaviour is related not only to the spatial features of trajectories but also to motion features however few currently available methods are able to identify vessel traffic behaviour by simultaneously considering the movement and spatial features of trajectories generally vessel traffic behaviour recognition can be divided into two parts classifying vessel traffic behaviour and anomaly detection although many artificial intelligence algorithms have been adopted to identify vessel traffic behaviour most of them have been supervised learning methods applied to detect anomalies based on the classification of vessel traffic behaviour considering that classifying vessel traffic behaviour is a type of unsupervised learning problem the dbscan algorithm is still the most effective method because unlike other unsupervised learning algorithms it does not need to preset the number of clusters and it can form clusters with any arbitrary shape furthermore the dbscan algorithm is also robust in terms of identifying noise however the performance of the dbscan algorithm is determined by parameters especially when the data involve a high number of dimensions hence many measures such as the heuristic method entropy theory and maximum likelihood estimation are used to resolve this issue these measures are usually costly in terms of computational time or exhibit poor self adaption therefore overall research gaps remain first most vessel traffic behaviour recognition studies focus only on spatial similarity and ignore motion similarity which results in vessel traffic characteristic analysis studies that are often independent of vessel traffic behaviour recognition studies thus measures must be developed to identify vessel traffic behaviours that consider both the movement features speed and course and the spatial features of vessel trajectories second the existing improved dbscan algorithm exhibits poor self adaption because the optimal parameters of the dbscan algorithm often cannot be obtained simultaneously according to the sample set which indicates that current studies often optimize a parameter first and then optimize the other parameters after fixing the first parameter however some evolutionary algorithms have been utilized to optimize two parameters simultaneously this process is usually at the cost of computational time hence it is imperative to design an effective and adaptive method to determine optimal parameters simultaneously in view of these shortcomings it is necessary to i study vessel traffic behaviours by simultaneously considering both the spatial features and movement features such as the speed and course of trajectories and ii adaptively determine the parameters of the dbscan algorithm according to a sample set to fill the above research gaps we develop a novel dbscan algorithm that can determine all parameters adaptively to recognize vessel traffic behaviour by simultaneously considering the spatial and movement features of trajectories the approach mainly includes two parts similarity measurements based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics and adaptive parameter optimization based on a sample set the similarity measurements based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics are used to assess the similarity among trajectories in terms of the spatial and movement features such as the speed and course of trajectories parameter optimization comprises the radius eps and minimum core objective quantity minpts adjustment strategies this process involves determining two optimal parameters in a single optimization step as described above the contributions of this study are three fold first to improve upon similarity assessments in vessel traffic behaviour recognition based only on spatial features we propose a new method of measuring the similarity between trajectories based on the spatial and movement features speed and course for vessel traffic behaviour recognition second adaptive adjustment strategies are designed to determine all optimal parameters in the dbscan algorithm simultaneously according to a sample set to overcome the situation in which all parameters cannot be optimized in a single operation third we apply the proposed method to identify vessel traffic behaviour in the chengshan jiao water area and specific monitoring strategies are provided based on analyses of recognized vessel behaviours to improve the supervision efficiency of maritime authorities 2 ais data preprocessing the main objective of this step is to make ais data available for vessel traffic behaviour recognition various measures should be taken to ensure that ais data are temporally correct because errors can occur during the collection transmission and receiving processes of ais data for example a vessel position obtained from the ais data can be located on land which is impossible because vessels cannot navigate on land the reason for this phenomenon is position signal drift hence the associated outliers must be eliminated moreover ais data interpolation is often necessary because these data are randomly sent at different times for instance ais data are transmitted at 2 10 s intervals when a vessel is moving however the interval is 3 min when a vessel is anchor to obtain reliable ais data ais data are interpolated to ensure that the data have equal intervals as described above eliminating and interpolating ais data are two data preprocessing steps the method of removing ais data noise based on the fundamental physical principals of vessel movement proposed by qu et al 2011 is employed in this paper ais data are interpolated to a predefined time interval to obtain snapshots of the status of a ship in this study we define the predefined interval as 1 min and a linear method designed by zhang et al 2019 is adopted to interpolate the ais data 3 improved dbscan algorithm in this section we introduce a self adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics this method is a type of improved dbscan algorithm there are two key components in the proposed approach similarity measurements that simultaneously consider the spatial and movement features of the trajectories and adaptive parameter optimization according to the sample set the details of the proposed approach are as follows 3 1 similarity measurement dynamic time warping dtw is a flexible algorithm for measuring the similarity between two trajectories that may vary in time distance travelled or point number it is an effective method for similarity measurements of clustered vessel trajectories de vries and van someren 2012 li et al 2017 zhao and shi 2019 this method which considers the overall trajectory can maintain the integral characteristics of each trajectory to a certain degree and determine whether two given trajectory sequences match based on warping in the time dimension to calculate the similarity the advantage of the dtw algorithm is that the distance differences between two trajectories and course variations are both considered however the speed variations of trajectories are not considered in addition to distance and course differences simultaneously considering the speed differences between two trajectories is another important factor for measuring similarity based on spatial and movement features however trajectories are two dimensional and do not reflect three dimensional features therefore the considered problems must be addressed in high dimensional space in this case mapping rules should be designed to map the spatial and movement features of trajectories into high dimensional space furthermore the mapping results must meet two requirements first the rules must describe the spatial and movement features of the trajectories second the rules must reflect the variations in the trajectory features a statistical approach can be utilized to generate mapping rules considering the mathematical meaning of the statistical parameter s for instance the arithmetic mean of a data set also called the mathematical expectation or average is a measure of the central value of a discrete set of numbers and the standard deviation is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values a low standard deviation indicates that the data point is close to the mean of the data set in consideration of this relation the following mapping rules are designed to measure the similarity between two trajectories 1 f ω s c μ 1 σ 1 μ 2 σ 2 μ 3 σ 3 μ 4 σ 4 in eq 1 ω is the set of positions in the given trajectory including latitude and longitude information s is the set of speed over ground sog values c is the set of course over ground cog values μ 1 is the mean value of latitudes in the set ω σ 1 is the standard deviation of latitudes in the set ω μ 2 is the mean value of longitudes in the set ω σ 2 is the standard deviation of longitudes in the set ω μ 3 is the mean value of set s σ 3 is the standard deviation of set s μ 4 is the mean value of set c σ 4 is the standard deviation of set c f represents the mapping rules in this case there are two rules as follows rule 1 ω μ 1 σ 1 μ 2 σ 2 2 μ 1 l a t i t u d e 1 l a t i t u d e 2 l a t i t u d e n n 3 μ 2 l o n g i t u d e 1 l o n g i t u d e 2 l o n g i t u d e n n 4 σ 1 l a t i t u d e 1 μ 1 2 l a t i t u d e 2 μ 1 2 l a t i t u d e n μ 1 2 n 5 σ 2 l o n g i t u d e 1 μ 2 2 l o n g i t u d e 2 μ 2 2 l o n g i t u d e n μ 2 2 n in eqs 2 5 l a t i t u d e i is the latitude of the ith position in the trajectory l o n g i t u d e i is the longitude of the ith position in the trajectory and n is the number of positions in the trajectory rule 1 is applied to map set ω rule 2 s c μ 3 σ 3 μ 4 σ 4 6 s n μ 3 σ 3 7 c n μ 4 σ 4 in rule 2 we assume that set s and set c both obey a gaussian distribution hence μ 3 σ 3 μ 4 and σ 4 are determined through parameter estimation the exploited approach can map a trajectory to a characteristic trajectory vector in eight dimensional space determining how to assess differences among vectors is another key problem in measuring similarity because the euclidean distance is the most effective measure of the distance difference between two vectors in multidimensional space it is employed to measure similarity in this paper additionally because the measurement units of latitude longitude speed and course are different it is necessary to normalize the vectors and eliminate the effects of the measurement units before assessing the differences between two vectors in this study the min max normalization method is adopted as described above there are three steps in measuring similarity first mapping rules are utilized to map all trajectories in the database to high dimensional characteristic vectors second the min max normalization method is adopted to normalize the vectors and eliminate the effects of the measurement units third the euclidean distance is employed to measure the similarity between two vectors 3 2 self adaption strategies for parameters the dbscan algorithm one of the most common clustering algorithms is a density based clustering algorithm that was proposed by ester et al 1996 there are two main advantages of this approach over other methods first specifying the number of clusters is not required second arbitrarily shaped clusters can be identified however the algorithm is highly dependent on parameters there are two parameters in the dbscan algorithm eps and minpts in the dbscan algorithm the points lines are divided into three types density connected points lines outliers and core points lines a point line is generally classified as a core point line if a minimum number of minpts points lines are included within a distance eps according to the parameters the points lines that are density connected with one another are regarded as the same cluster however the points that are not density connected are regarded as outliers therefore the values of the parameters can affect the clustering results if eps is small and minpts is large points that are similar to each other may be difficult to group into the same cluster in contrast if eps is large and minpts is small points with large differences may be grouped into the same cluster hence determining the corresponding optimal parameters for different sample sets is an important step in obtaining the best clustering results to address this problem the parzen window method is employed to determine the optimal parameters proposed by emanuel 1962 the parzen window method is a type of kernel density estimation that estimates the probability density function of a random variable and it has been used widely in many fields gao et al 2019 employed the parzen window to evaluate the quality of candidate individuals in soft computing the parzen window method was used by lázaro et al 2018 to estimate the conditional distributions necessary to compute the probabilities of error associated with the bayes risk in pattern recognition swetha et al 2016 used the parzen window in spectrum sensing in this study we exploit the bandwidth of the parzen window method to determine the parameter eps and utilize the gaussian kernel density function to obtain the parameter minpts the detailed procedure is as follows 3 2 1 optimal parameter eps in the parzen window method the kernel density estimator is defined as follows 8 f h x 1 n h j 1 n k x x j h where k is the kernel density function a non negative function h is the bandwidth n is the sample size x is a variable and x j is the jth sample value as shown in eq 8 h is a free parameter that has a strong influence on the function f if h is too small there will be too many wrong peaks in the density estimation in clustering analysis this issue takes the form of the same cluster being divided into two or more clusters in contrast if h is too large the probability density is scattered in the density estimation in clustering analysis this issue takes the form of two or more clusters incorrectly being merged into the same cluster this parameter is similar to eps in the dbscan algorithm in the dbscan algorithm if eps is too small with a fixed minpts a cluster will be classified into two or more clusters and if eps is too large with a fixed minpt two or more clusters will be grouped into a single cluster hence considering that its effect is similar to eps h can be used as eps generally the optimal bandwidth is obtained by minimizing the mean integrated squared error however the objective of this study is to identify subtle differences in characteristics thus the optimal bandwidth should also consider the differences in the characteristics of trajectories hence the mean integrated squared error and the subtle differences in characteristics are both considered in this paper we define the optimal h value and eps as eq 9 9 h min σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 σ 4 h b 2 e p s h in eq 9 σ 1 is the standard deviation of all σ 1 values in the ais database σ 2 is the standard deviation of all σ 2 values in the ais database σ 3 is the standard deviation of all σ 3 values in the ais database σ 4 is the standard deviation of all σ 4 values in the ais database and h b is the optimal bandwidth determined based on the rule of thumb for minimizing the mean integrated squared error 3 2 2 optimal parameter minpts ideally every cluster in the clustering results should be compact to achieve this goal the gaussian kernel density function aids in the selection of the optimal parameter minpts in terms of a multivariate gaussian distribution this parameter can be described as follows 10 k d i d k x i μ i h where h is determined by eq 9 x i is a variable in the ith dimension and μ i is the mean of all x i values in the sample set in this study μ 1 μ 4 is the mean of all μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 and μ 4 values in the trajectory sample set as shown in eq 10 the probability is high when x i is close to μ i and the values are more likely to be grouped into the same cluster hence we determined minpts based on the n best probabilities n should not be too large or too small if n is too large too few clusters may be obtained and many points will be regarded as noise if n is too small too many clusters will be obtained for these reasons n should meet two conditions first the sum of the n best probabilities should be no less than 5 second n should be minimal which ensures that minpts can be appropriately determined according to different sample sets 3 3 self adaption dbscan algorithm for vessel traffic behaviour recognition based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics in this section we present a detailed procedure for the proposed method which is given in table 1 fig 1 shows the framework of the self adaption dbscan algorithm for vessel traffic behaviour recognition based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics as shown in fig 1 the clustering analysis results can be used by monitoring authorities to formulate relevant strategies the detailed method will be presented in section 4 4 experimental results and analysis the chenshan jiao waters that must be navigated by vessels travelling from north to south are located to the east of the shandong peninsula and are also famous fisheries each year up to eight hundred thousand vessels move through the area and operate in the waters this quantity is equal to three hundred vessels per day thus this shipping area is busy however sea conditions in the waters off the chenshan jiao promontory are complicated high winds tempestuous seas and foggy weather conditions often occur resulting in accidents for example five serious accidents two major accidents three moderate accidents and eight minor accidents occurred from 2009 to 2013 in the waters off chenshan jiao to improve the monitoring efficiency a ship routing system was established in the waters off the chenshan jiao promontory in 2015 the details of the ship routing system are shown in fig 2 this system mainly includes an inner traffic separation scheme and an outer traffic separation scheme the traffic lane for southbound traffic in the inner traffic separation scheme is 2 nautical miles wide and the main traffic directions are 150 and 180 the traffic lane for northbound traffic in the inner traffic separation scheme is also 2 nautical miles wide and the main traffic directions are 000 and 330 in the outer separation scheme the main traffic direction for northwestbound traffic is 300 the main direction for southeastbound traffic is 120 and the main direction for northbound traffic is 000 furthermore the width of the traffic lanes in the outer separation scheme mentioned above are both 2 nautical miles to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method of vessel traffic behaviour recognition the partial ais data set for the waters near the chenshan jiao promontory from july to september 2014 is adopted for experiments the left border of waters is 122 17 695 e the right border of waters is 123 11 952 e the top border of waters is 37 42 184 n and the bottom border of waters is 37 06 009 n moreover the database includes five ship types and a total of 6799 ships however 8 6 of the total data cannot be utilized because of missing information detailed information about the database adopted in this paper is shown in table 2 in the experiment considering that the number of trajectories can impact the clustering results the ais data on cargo ship type and other ship types from high to low latitudes are utilized there are two benefits of choosing chenshan jiao waters as the target area first the area has a ship routing system this situation is beneficial for verifying the clustering results preliminarily for instance if a vessel sailing in the ship routing system and a vessel sailing outside the ship routing system are regarded as the same cluster the clustering results can be considered incorrect otherwise the cluster results can be considered basically correct however other methods should be employed to test the clustering results in this study we adopt the davies bouldin index dbi to evaluate the cluster results second the clustering analysis results obtained by the proposed method can be utilized by authorities to provide theoretical and technical support for monitoring strategies 4 1 vessel traffic behaviour recognition results according to the proposed method the normalized eps and minpts values are determined to be 0 055344 and 20 respectively for the cargo ship type for other ship types the values of eps and minpts are 0 041524 and 20 respectively to test the optimality of these parameters the results obtained with the proposed method are compared with those obtained with different parameters the results for the same eps and different minpts values are shown in figs 3 5 for cargo ships and in figs 7 9 for other ship types to assess the strategy for determining minpts in these figures c1 stands for cluster one c2 stands for cluster two etc μ 1 μ 4 is the mean value of the normalized μ 1 μ 4 values for each cluster centre as shown in figs 3 a 5 a figs 3 b 5 b show σ 1 σ 4 as the mean value of the normalized σ 1 σ 4 values for each cluster centre different types of vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with different parameters four vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 055344 and minpts 20 three vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 055344 and minpts 25 and six vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 055344 and minpts 15 for cargo ships thirteen vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 041524 and minpts 20 ten vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 041524 and minpts 15 and twenty five vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 041524 and minpts 25 as the results show the number of vessel traffic behaviours obtained with different minpts is markedly higher for the cargo ship type than for other ship types in fig 9 the number of vessel traffic behaviours obtained with eps 0 041524 and minpts 15 is too large in this case these values result in a low density of trajectories in the same cluster in other words the fluctuations in trajectory characteristics may be large as illustrated in fig 9 b therefore it is difficult to differentiate noise consequently abnormal manoeuvring behaviour may be treated as normal manoeuvring behaviour in contrast the number of vessel traffic behaviours achieved with eps 0 0041524 and minpts 25 is small with these values the density of trajectories in the same cluster is high therefore the requirements for grouping trajectories in the same cluster are rigid and the fluctuations in trajectory characteristics are small as shown in fig 8 b thus some normal manoeuvring behaviours may be considered abnormal behaviours resulting in fewer clusters furthermore different eps values are adopted to verify the strategy for determining eps while holding minpts constant the results for eps 0 041146 and minpts 20 with different ship types are shown in fig 6 and fig 10 as shown in figs 3 fig 6 figs 7 and 10 different eps show variations in terms of the number of clusters especially in figs 7 and 10 on the other hand although the trend of the data variation is similar the amplitude of variation is different this phenomenon is similar to the results obtained with a fixed eps and different minpts values the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition presented on the electronic chart display and information system ecdis are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 only anchored vessels are included in cluster thirteen therefore they are not shown in the ecdis to further test the proposed algorithm performance it is compared with the algorithm proposed by zhao and shi 2019 in the comparison algorithm the parameters are set to minpts 15 and eps 0 795 two clusters are obtained for the cargo ship type by the comparison algorithm as shown in fig 13 for other ship types twelve clusters are obtained by the comparison algorithm cluster nine and cluster seven in fig 12 are grouped into the same cluster by the comparison algorithm shown in fig 14 which is different from the results obtained by the proposed algorithm we renormalized the results shown in fig 11 a 11 c and the spatial and movement feature vectors can be obtained the spatial and movement feature vectors for clusters 1 2 and 3 are 37 422 0 157 122 655 0 149 10 038 kn 1 446 kn 145 452 32 440 37 430 0 175 122 687 0 117 10 367 kn 1 633 kn 154 594 24 647 and 37 410 0 172 122 730 0 061 9 993 kn 1 618 kn 166 357 15 145 respectively the spatial and movement feature vector for fig 13 a is 37 424 0 168 122 682 0 121 10 191 kn 1 562 kn 152 971 26 108 for other ship types the spatial and movement feature vectors are 37 235 0 081 122 778 0 013 10 278 kn 1 984 kn 180 284 4 307 and 37 307 0 118 122 768 0 019 9 836 kn 1 583 kn 172 950 14 642 for cluster 7 and cluster 9 respectively in fig 12 and 122 774 0 015 37 263 0 095 10 108 kn 1 831 kn 177 477 8 262 for fig 14 it is obvious that there are differences among the vectors for instance in fig 11 a the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of cluster one are 37 422 and 122 655 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 157 and 0 149 respectively in fig 11 b the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of cluster two are 37 430 and 122 687 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 175 and 0 117 respectively in fig 11 c the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of cluster three are 37 410 and 122 730 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 172 and 0 061 respectively in fig 13 a the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of the cluster are 37 424 and 122 682 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 168 and 0 121 respectively thus there are few differences in terms of spatial features however there are more sizeable differences in terms of movement features the main course of cluster three in fig 11 is 166 357 and the standard deviation of the course in the cluster is 15 145 most of the courses in cluster 3 are located in the range of 151 212 181 502 this range is apparently different from the range of 126 863 179 079 obtained by the comparison algorithm similar phenomena can be observed by comparing the clusters in fig 13 a with cluster one and cluster two in fig 11 and by comparing the movement feature vectors of clusters 7 and 9 in fig 12 with the movement feature vectors of the clusters in fig 13 by only considering spatial features the comparison algorithm groups cluster one cluster two and cluster three in fig 11 into the same cluster and groups cluster seven and cluster nine in fig 12 into the same cluster the differences in movement features among the clusters produced by the proposed algorithm are conspicuous as shown in table 3 and table 4 and are obtained by renormalizing the spatial and movement feature vectors these data reflect vessel behaviour to some extent for instance in table 4 the mean speed values in cluster two and cluster three are significantly higher than those in the other clusters and the standard deviations of the course in cluster one and cluster eight are also higher than those of the other clusters therefore the vessels in clusters two and three likely adopt high speeds and the vessels in clusters one and eight likely exhibit turning behaviour the analysis above suggests that the proposed algorithm can not only subdivide vessel traffic behaviours by considering spatial and movement features but can also determine appropriate parameters according to the sample set furthermore the cpu time required to run the critical code of the different algorithms is calculated and the dbi is utilized to evaluate cluster results the cpu time of the proposed algorithm and the comparison algorithm are 0 12 s and 54 s respectively and the dbi values achieved by standardizing the data are 0 75 and 0 81 respectively which imply that the proposed algorithm presents a better performance 4 2 the application of the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition the most important aspect of the proposed algorithm is its applications notably the method can be utilized by authorities to provide theoretical support for monitoring in this section we introduce how to develop monitoring strategies according to the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition the strategies for monitoring proposed in this section include three components the ship position velocity and course however determining the border of each cluster is difficult because the shape of each cluster is irregular hence to monitor the ship position the ecdis is necessary in positional monitoring whether a ship position is located in the areas presented in figs 11 and 12 must be determined to implement position monitoring in terms of the velocity and course strategies should be formulated according to the spatial and movement feature vectors of clusters according to different ship types as shown in tables 3 and 4 the ship velocity and course can be monitored by defining reasonable ranges for these values μ i σ i μ i σ i is adopted as a reasonable range for monitoring for example in cluster two in table 4 the mean velocity is 15 670 kn and most of the ship velocities in the cluster are located in the range of 14 422 kn 16 918 kn the mean course in the cluster is 267 802 and most ship courses are located in the range of 257 65 277 954 using the method described above we can obtain reasonable ranges for velocities and courses for each cluster the authorities can decide which traffic behaviours are best reflected by the spatial and movement features displayed by a monitored vessel and whether the velocity and course of the vessel are within the corresponding reasonable ranges if the velocity course or position is not within the reasonable range or area the vessel should be regarded as an abnormal vessel and the authorities should implement additional monitoring steps or other measures overall the proposed method provides a theoretical foundation for authorities to improve the efficiency of monitoring 5 conclusions this paper proposes a self adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics to address the poor self adaption issue in the dbscan algorithm and the lack of considering movement features in identifying vessel traffic behaviour three aspects of the algorithm are improved to design a new vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm first a new similarity measure is designed to reflect the similarity between two trajectories while simultaneously considering the corresponding spatial and movement features then the parzen window is adopted to generate the eps parameter and the optimal parameter can be obtained according to different sample sets finally a gaussian distribution is applied to determine the parameter minpts which is beneficial for selecting appropriate values of minpts and avoiding scenarios with too many or too few clusters based on the sample set the performance of the proposed method is verified using chengshan jiao ais data the experimental results show that the proposed method is an adaptive and robust approach that can recognize vessel traffic behaviour by considering the spatial and movement features of trajectories and determine the appropriate parameters according to the sample set additionally this approach is superior to methods that use dtw as the similarity measure furthermore the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition can provide a theoretical foundation for authorities to improve the monitoring efficiency and avoid maritime accidents however there are also shortcomings in this paper we assume that the speed and course distributions obey a gaussian distribution in reality this assumption is not always applicable for further studies we should use hypothesis testing and parameter estimation to determine the speed and course distributions according to different ship types ship parameters and time frames additionally the ship types are not divided in detail which is a limitation of the ais data employed in this paper in future research we will collect more detailed ais data for numerical experiments author contributions section zhaokun wei conceptualization

22097,clustering analysis is commonly used for vessel traffic behaviour recognition the clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours which can assist authorities in transportation management however there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis first the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features such as speed and course second the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm a famous clustering analysis method is characterized by poor self adaption which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets these issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis to address these problems a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories the proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories furthermore the parzen window a non parametric estimation method and the multivariate gaussian distribution are employed to generate self adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the dbscan algorithm for a given sample set finally numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved dbscan algorithm the clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents keywords vessel behaviour recognition dbscan self adaption multi attribute trajectory characteristics 1 introduction global seaborne trade is doing well supported by the 2017 upswing in the world economy with an increase of 4 the fastest growth in five years global maritime trade has gathered momentum in the shipping industry after five years of decelerating growth a small improvement in world fleet expansion occurred in 2017 notably a total of 42 million gross tons were added to the global tonnage capacity in 2017 equivalent to a 3 3 growth rate increases in seaborne trade and world fleet capacity have resulted in rapid increases in port traffic volumes unctad 2018 this problem must be solved to balance the safety and capacity of the vessel traffic volume and ports hence it is necessary to take appropriate measures that guarantee safe and smooth traffic operations automatic identification system ais data and clustering analysis are often applied to achieve these goals because ais are mandatory on vessels engaged in international voyages with gross tonnages greater than 300 tons a clustering analysis can be utilized to group vessel traffic behaviour into clusters based on similar characteristics such as position speed and course of the vessel obtained from the ais the vessel traffic behaviour obtained from the cluster analysis results can be applied to monitor vessel movement and identify anomalies for instance regulators decide whether an observed behaviour is normal or worthy of further investigation by identifying the cluster to which a given vessel with a specific behaviour is attributed this approach also assists in maritime traffic control thus effective vessel traffic behaviour assessment can improve authority management efficiency and avoid accidents to some extent vessel traffic behaviour research was performed by fujii and tanaka 1971 however the analysis required considerable manpower and had high costs at the time vessel traffic data collected by vessel traffic services and ais represent high reliability vessel traffic information and the collection process involves less manpower and consumption requirements than previous methods meng et al 2014 therefore ais data are promising for obtaining and analysing vessel traffic behaviours many scholars have performed vessel traffic behaviour research kang et al 2018 proposed a fundamental vessel traffic diagram for the singapore strait and constructed vessel traffic speed density formulations the vessel traffic demand and spatiotemporal dynamics of vessel traffic in singapore port were analysed and several hotspots were identified by zhang et al 2019 pallotta et al 2013 and shelmerdine 2015 plotted ship trajectories on a map to examine the spatial and temporal variations in these trajectories the one way distance proposed by lin and su 2008 was applied by ma et al 2014 to measure trajectory similarities for spatial clustering and the vessel traffic patterns in the qiongzhou strait were investigated a dimensionality reduction based multistep clustering method was proposed by li et al 2017 in this approach dynamic time warping de vries and van someren 2012 was used to measure the distance between different trajectories and principal component analysis pca was utilized to decompose the distance matrix then the k medoids algorithm was applied to identify vessel traffic behaviour zhen et al 2017 applied the k medoids algorithm to cluster trajectories with a proposed improved hausdorff distance an unsupervised clustering analysis method based on track points was proposed by yan et al 2016 to identify the region of interest other researchers have focused on maritime anomaly detection ristic et al 2008 used kernel density estimation to construct motion anomaly detectors mascaro et al 2014 used a bayesian network to detect anomalous behaviour a supervised support vector machine was utilized by handayani et al 2014a 2014b to identify vessel anomaly behaviours rhodes et al 2007 2005 applied fuzzy artmap as a type of neural network classifier to recognize vessel anomaly behaviours furthermore some researchers have focused on improving clustering algorithms for instance a heuristic approach was adopted by yan et al 2016 to determine the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm parameters pan et al 2014 used entropy theory to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters zhao and shi 2019 applied maximum likelihood estimation to determine the radius eps value in the dbscan algorithm with a fixed minimum core objective quantity minpts the above studies can be grouped into three classes according to their focus vessel traffic characteristic analysis vessel traffic behaviour recognition and algorithm improvement vessel traffic characteristic analysis generally involves motion characteristics such as vessel speed vessel course and potential hotspots in contrast vessel traffic behaviour recognition based on clustering trajectories concentrates mostly on spatial features and ignores motion features in reality vessel traffic behaviour is related not only to the spatial features of trajectories but also to motion features however few currently available methods are able to identify vessel traffic behaviour by simultaneously considering the movement and spatial features of trajectories generally vessel traffic behaviour recognition can be divided into two parts classifying vessel traffic behaviour and anomaly detection although many artificial intelligence algorithms have been adopted to identify vessel traffic behaviour most of them have been supervised learning methods applied to detect anomalies based on the classification of vessel traffic behaviour considering that classifying vessel traffic behaviour is a type of unsupervised learning problem the dbscan algorithm is still the most effective method because unlike other unsupervised learning algorithms it does not need to preset the number of clusters and it can form clusters with any arbitrary shape furthermore the dbscan algorithm is also robust in terms of identifying noise however the performance of the dbscan algorithm is determined by parameters especially when the data involve a high number of dimensions hence many measures such as the heuristic method entropy theory and maximum likelihood estimation are used to resolve this issue these measures are usually costly in terms of computational time or exhibit poor self adaption therefore overall research gaps remain first most vessel traffic behaviour recognition studies focus only on spatial similarity and ignore motion similarity which results in vessel traffic characteristic analysis studies that are often independent of vessel traffic behaviour recognition studies thus measures must be developed to identify vessel traffic behaviours that consider both the movement features speed and course and the spatial features of vessel trajectories second the existing improved dbscan algorithm exhibits poor self adaption because the optimal parameters of the dbscan algorithm often cannot be obtained simultaneously according to the sample set which indicates that current studies often optimize a parameter first and then optimize the other parameters after fixing the first parameter however some evolutionary algorithms have been utilized to optimize two parameters simultaneously this process is usually at the cost of computational time hence it is imperative to design an effective and adaptive method to determine optimal parameters simultaneously in view of these shortcomings it is necessary to i study vessel traffic behaviours by simultaneously considering both the spatial features and movement features such as the speed and course of trajectories and ii adaptively determine the parameters of the dbscan algorithm according to a sample set to fill the above research gaps we develop a novel dbscan algorithm that can determine all parameters adaptively to recognize vessel traffic behaviour by simultaneously considering the spatial and movement features of trajectories the approach mainly includes two parts similarity measurements based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics and adaptive parameter optimization based on a sample set the similarity measurements based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics are used to assess the similarity among trajectories in terms of the spatial and movement features such as the speed and course of trajectories parameter optimization comprises the radius eps and minimum core objective quantity minpts adjustment strategies this process involves determining two optimal parameters in a single optimization step as described above the contributions of this study are three fold first to improve upon similarity assessments in vessel traffic behaviour recognition based only on spatial features we propose a new method of measuring the similarity between trajectories based on the spatial and movement features speed and course for vessel traffic behaviour recognition second adaptive adjustment strategies are designed to determine all optimal parameters in the dbscan algorithm simultaneously according to a sample set to overcome the situation in which all parameters cannot be optimized in a single operation third we apply the proposed method to identify vessel traffic behaviour in the chengshan jiao water area and specific monitoring strategies are provided based on analyses of recognized vessel behaviours to improve the supervision efficiency of maritime authorities 2 ais data preprocessing the main objective of this step is to make ais data available for vessel traffic behaviour recognition various measures should be taken to ensure that ais data are temporally correct because errors can occur during the collection transmission and receiving processes of ais data for example a vessel position obtained from the ais data can be located on land which is impossible because vessels cannot navigate on land the reason for this phenomenon is position signal drift hence the associated outliers must be eliminated moreover ais data interpolation is often necessary because these data are randomly sent at different times for instance ais data are transmitted at 2 10 s intervals when a vessel is moving however the interval is 3 min when a vessel is anchor to obtain reliable ais data ais data are interpolated to ensure that the data have equal intervals as described above eliminating and interpolating ais data are two data preprocessing steps the method of removing ais data noise based on the fundamental physical principals of vessel movement proposed by qu et al 2011 is employed in this paper ais data are interpolated to a predefined time interval to obtain snapshots of the status of a ship in this study we define the predefined interval as 1 min and a linear method designed by zhang et al 2019 is adopted to interpolate the ais data 3 improved dbscan algorithm in this section we introduce a self adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics this method is a type of improved dbscan algorithm there are two key components in the proposed approach similarity measurements that simultaneously consider the spatial and movement features of the trajectories and adaptive parameter optimization according to the sample set the details of the proposed approach are as follows 3 1 similarity measurement dynamic time warping dtw is a flexible algorithm for measuring the similarity between two trajectories that may vary in time distance travelled or point number it is an effective method for similarity measurements of clustered vessel trajectories de vries and van someren 2012 li et al 2017 zhao and shi 2019 this method which considers the overall trajectory can maintain the integral characteristics of each trajectory to a certain degree and determine whether two given trajectory sequences match based on warping in the time dimension to calculate the similarity the advantage of the dtw algorithm is that the distance differences between two trajectories and course variations are both considered however the speed variations of trajectories are not considered in addition to distance and course differences simultaneously considering the speed differences between two trajectories is another important factor for measuring similarity based on spatial and movement features however trajectories are two dimensional and do not reflect three dimensional features therefore the considered problems must be addressed in high dimensional space in this case mapping rules should be designed to map the spatial and movement features of trajectories into high dimensional space furthermore the mapping results must meet two requirements first the rules must describe the spatial and movement features of the trajectories second the rules must reflect the variations in the trajectory features a statistical approach can be utilized to generate mapping rules considering the mathematical meaning of the statistical parameter s for instance the arithmetic mean of a data set also called the mathematical expectation or average is a measure of the central value of a discrete set of numbers and the standard deviation is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values a low standard deviation indicates that the data point is close to the mean of the data set in consideration of this relation the following mapping rules are designed to measure the similarity between two trajectories 1 f ω s c μ 1 σ 1 μ 2 σ 2 μ 3 σ 3 μ 4 σ 4 in eq 1 ω is the set of positions in the given trajectory including latitude and longitude information s is the set of speed over ground sog values c is the set of course over ground cog values μ 1 is the mean value of latitudes in the set ω σ 1 is the standard deviation of latitudes in the set ω μ 2 is the mean value of longitudes in the set ω σ 2 is the standard deviation of longitudes in the set ω μ 3 is the mean value of set s σ 3 is the standard deviation of set s μ 4 is the mean value of set c σ 4 is the standard deviation of set c f represents the mapping rules in this case there are two rules as follows rule 1 ω μ 1 σ 1 μ 2 σ 2 2 μ 1 l a t i t u d e 1 l a t i t u d e 2 l a t i t u d e n n 3 μ 2 l o n g i t u d e 1 l o n g i t u d e 2 l o n g i t u d e n n 4 σ 1 l a t i t u d e 1 μ 1 2 l a t i t u d e 2 μ 1 2 l a t i t u d e n μ 1 2 n 5 σ 2 l o n g i t u d e 1 μ 2 2 l o n g i t u d e 2 μ 2 2 l o n g i t u d e n μ 2 2 n in eqs 2 5 l a t i t u d e i is the latitude of the ith position in the trajectory l o n g i t u d e i is the longitude of the ith position in the trajectory and n is the number of positions in the trajectory rule 1 is applied to map set ω rule 2 s c μ 3 σ 3 μ 4 σ 4 6 s n μ 3 σ 3 7 c n μ 4 σ 4 in rule 2 we assume that set s and set c both obey a gaussian distribution hence μ 3 σ 3 μ 4 and σ 4 are determined through parameter estimation the exploited approach can map a trajectory to a characteristic trajectory vector in eight dimensional space determining how to assess differences among vectors is another key problem in measuring similarity because the euclidean distance is the most effective measure of the distance difference between two vectors in multidimensional space it is employed to measure similarity in this paper additionally because the measurement units of latitude longitude speed and course are different it is necessary to normalize the vectors and eliminate the effects of the measurement units before assessing the differences between two vectors in this study the min max normalization method is adopted as described above there are three steps in measuring similarity first mapping rules are utilized to map all trajectories in the database to high dimensional characteristic vectors second the min max normalization method is adopted to normalize the vectors and eliminate the effects of the measurement units third the euclidean distance is employed to measure the similarity between two vectors 3 2 self adaption strategies for parameters the dbscan algorithm one of the most common clustering algorithms is a density based clustering algorithm that was proposed by ester et al 1996 there are two main advantages of this approach over other methods first specifying the number of clusters is not required second arbitrarily shaped clusters can be identified however the algorithm is highly dependent on parameters there are two parameters in the dbscan algorithm eps and minpts in the dbscan algorithm the points lines are divided into three types density connected points lines outliers and core points lines a point line is generally classified as a core point line if a minimum number of minpts points lines are included within a distance eps according to the parameters the points lines that are density connected with one another are regarded as the same cluster however the points that are not density connected are regarded as outliers therefore the values of the parameters can affect the clustering results if eps is small and minpts is large points that are similar to each other may be difficult to group into the same cluster in contrast if eps is large and minpts is small points with large differences may be grouped into the same cluster hence determining the corresponding optimal parameters for different sample sets is an important step in obtaining the best clustering results to address this problem the parzen window method is employed to determine the optimal parameters proposed by emanuel 1962 the parzen window method is a type of kernel density estimation that estimates the probability density function of a random variable and it has been used widely in many fields gao et al 2019 employed the parzen window to evaluate the quality of candidate individuals in soft computing the parzen window method was used by lázaro et al 2018 to estimate the conditional distributions necessary to compute the probabilities of error associated with the bayes risk in pattern recognition swetha et al 2016 used the parzen window in spectrum sensing in this study we exploit the bandwidth of the parzen window method to determine the parameter eps and utilize the gaussian kernel density function to obtain the parameter minpts the detailed procedure is as follows 3 2 1 optimal parameter eps in the parzen window method the kernel density estimator is defined as follows 8 f h x 1 n h j 1 n k x x j h where k is the kernel density function a non negative function h is the bandwidth n is the sample size x is a variable and x j is the jth sample value as shown in eq 8 h is a free parameter that has a strong influence on the function f if h is too small there will be too many wrong peaks in the density estimation in clustering analysis this issue takes the form of the same cluster being divided into two or more clusters in contrast if h is too large the probability density is scattered in the density estimation in clustering analysis this issue takes the form of two or more clusters incorrectly being merged into the same cluster this parameter is similar to eps in the dbscan algorithm in the dbscan algorithm if eps is too small with a fixed minpts a cluster will be classified into two or more clusters and if eps is too large with a fixed minpt two or more clusters will be grouped into a single cluster hence considering that its effect is similar to eps h can be used as eps generally the optimal bandwidth is obtained by minimizing the mean integrated squared error however the objective of this study is to identify subtle differences in characteristics thus the optimal bandwidth should also consider the differences in the characteristics of trajectories hence the mean integrated squared error and the subtle differences in characteristics are both considered in this paper we define the optimal h value and eps as eq 9 9 h min σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 σ 4 h b 2 e p s h in eq 9 σ 1 is the standard deviation of all σ 1 values in the ais database σ 2 is the standard deviation of all σ 2 values in the ais database σ 3 is the standard deviation of all σ 3 values in the ais database σ 4 is the standard deviation of all σ 4 values in the ais database and h b is the optimal bandwidth determined based on the rule of thumb for minimizing the mean integrated squared error 3 2 2 optimal parameter minpts ideally every cluster in the clustering results should be compact to achieve this goal the gaussian kernel density function aids in the selection of the optimal parameter minpts in terms of a multivariate gaussian distribution this parameter can be described as follows 10 k d i d k x i μ i h where h is determined by eq 9 x i is a variable in the ith dimension and μ i is the mean of all x i values in the sample set in this study μ 1 μ 4 is the mean of all μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 and μ 4 values in the trajectory sample set as shown in eq 10 the probability is high when x i is close to μ i and the values are more likely to be grouped into the same cluster hence we determined minpts based on the n best probabilities n should not be too large or too small if n is too large too few clusters may be obtained and many points will be regarded as noise if n is too small too many clusters will be obtained for these reasons n should meet two conditions first the sum of the n best probabilities should be no less than 5 second n should be minimal which ensures that minpts can be appropriately determined according to different sample sets 3 3 self adaption dbscan algorithm for vessel traffic behaviour recognition based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics in this section we present a detailed procedure for the proposed method which is given in table 1 fig 1 shows the framework of the self adaption dbscan algorithm for vessel traffic behaviour recognition based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics as shown in fig 1 the clustering analysis results can be used by monitoring authorities to formulate relevant strategies the detailed method will be presented in section 4 4 experimental results and analysis the chenshan jiao waters that must be navigated by vessels travelling from north to south are located to the east of the shandong peninsula and are also famous fisheries each year up to eight hundred thousand vessels move through the area and operate in the waters this quantity is equal to three hundred vessels per day thus this shipping area is busy however sea conditions in the waters off the chenshan jiao promontory are complicated high winds tempestuous seas and foggy weather conditions often occur resulting in accidents for example five serious accidents two major accidents three moderate accidents and eight minor accidents occurred from 2009 to 2013 in the waters off chenshan jiao to improve the monitoring efficiency a ship routing system was established in the waters off the chenshan jiao promontory in 2015 the details of the ship routing system are shown in fig 2 this system mainly includes an inner traffic separation scheme and an outer traffic separation scheme the traffic lane for southbound traffic in the inner traffic separation scheme is 2 nautical miles wide and the main traffic directions are 150 and 180 the traffic lane for northbound traffic in the inner traffic separation scheme is also 2 nautical miles wide and the main traffic directions are 000 and 330 in the outer separation scheme the main traffic direction for northwestbound traffic is 300 the main direction for southeastbound traffic is 120 and the main direction for northbound traffic is 000 furthermore the width of the traffic lanes in the outer separation scheme mentioned above are both 2 nautical miles to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method of vessel traffic behaviour recognition the partial ais data set for the waters near the chenshan jiao promontory from july to september 2014 is adopted for experiments the left border of waters is 122 17 695 e the right border of waters is 123 11 952 e the top border of waters is 37 42 184 n and the bottom border of waters is 37 06 009 n moreover the database includes five ship types and a total of 6799 ships however 8 6 of the total data cannot be utilized because of missing information detailed information about the database adopted in this paper is shown in table 2 in the experiment considering that the number of trajectories can impact the clustering results the ais data on cargo ship type and other ship types from high to low latitudes are utilized there are two benefits of choosing chenshan jiao waters as the target area first the area has a ship routing system this situation is beneficial for verifying the clustering results preliminarily for instance if a vessel sailing in the ship routing system and a vessel sailing outside the ship routing system are regarded as the same cluster the clustering results can be considered incorrect otherwise the cluster results can be considered basically correct however other methods should be employed to test the clustering results in this study we adopt the davies bouldin index dbi to evaluate the cluster results second the clustering analysis results obtained by the proposed method can be utilized by authorities to provide theoretical and technical support for monitoring strategies 4 1 vessel traffic behaviour recognition results according to the proposed method the normalized eps and minpts values are determined to be 0 055344 and 20 respectively for the cargo ship type for other ship types the values of eps and minpts are 0 041524 and 20 respectively to test the optimality of these parameters the results obtained with the proposed method are compared with those obtained with different parameters the results for the same eps and different minpts values are shown in figs 3 5 for cargo ships and in figs 7 9 for other ship types to assess the strategy for determining minpts in these figures c1 stands for cluster one c2 stands for cluster two etc μ 1 μ 4 is the mean value of the normalized μ 1 μ 4 values for each cluster centre as shown in figs 3 a 5 a figs 3 b 5 b show σ 1 σ 4 as the mean value of the normalized σ 1 σ 4 values for each cluster centre different types of vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with different parameters four vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 055344 and minpts 20 three vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 055344 and minpts 25 and six vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 055344 and minpts 15 for cargo ships thirteen vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 041524 and minpts 20 ten vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 041524 and minpts 15 and twenty five vessel traffic behaviours are recognized with eps 0 041524 and minpts 25 as the results show the number of vessel traffic behaviours obtained with different minpts is markedly higher for the cargo ship type than for other ship types in fig 9 the number of vessel traffic behaviours obtained with eps 0 041524 and minpts 15 is too large in this case these values result in a low density of trajectories in the same cluster in other words the fluctuations in trajectory characteristics may be large as illustrated in fig 9 b therefore it is difficult to differentiate noise consequently abnormal manoeuvring behaviour may be treated as normal manoeuvring behaviour in contrast the number of vessel traffic behaviours achieved with eps 0 0041524 and minpts 25 is small with these values the density of trajectories in the same cluster is high therefore the requirements for grouping trajectories in the same cluster are rigid and the fluctuations in trajectory characteristics are small as shown in fig 8 b thus some normal manoeuvring behaviours may be considered abnormal behaviours resulting in fewer clusters furthermore different eps values are adopted to verify the strategy for determining eps while holding minpts constant the results for eps 0 041146 and minpts 20 with different ship types are shown in fig 6 and fig 10 as shown in figs 3 fig 6 figs 7 and 10 different eps show variations in terms of the number of clusters especially in figs 7 and 10 on the other hand although the trend of the data variation is similar the amplitude of variation is different this phenomenon is similar to the results obtained with a fixed eps and different minpts values the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition presented on the electronic chart display and information system ecdis are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 only anchored vessels are included in cluster thirteen therefore they are not shown in the ecdis to further test the proposed algorithm performance it is compared with the algorithm proposed by zhao and shi 2019 in the comparison algorithm the parameters are set to minpts 15 and eps 0 795 two clusters are obtained for the cargo ship type by the comparison algorithm as shown in fig 13 for other ship types twelve clusters are obtained by the comparison algorithm cluster nine and cluster seven in fig 12 are grouped into the same cluster by the comparison algorithm shown in fig 14 which is different from the results obtained by the proposed algorithm we renormalized the results shown in fig 11 a 11 c and the spatial and movement feature vectors can be obtained the spatial and movement feature vectors for clusters 1 2 and 3 are 37 422 0 157 122 655 0 149 10 038 kn 1 446 kn 145 452 32 440 37 430 0 175 122 687 0 117 10 367 kn 1 633 kn 154 594 24 647 and 37 410 0 172 122 730 0 061 9 993 kn 1 618 kn 166 357 15 145 respectively the spatial and movement feature vector for fig 13 a is 37 424 0 168 122 682 0 121 10 191 kn 1 562 kn 152 971 26 108 for other ship types the spatial and movement feature vectors are 37 235 0 081 122 778 0 013 10 278 kn 1 984 kn 180 284 4 307 and 37 307 0 118 122 768 0 019 9 836 kn 1 583 kn 172 950 14 642 for cluster 7 and cluster 9 respectively in fig 12 and 122 774 0 015 37 263 0 095 10 108 kn 1 831 kn 177 477 8 262 for fig 14 it is obvious that there are differences among the vectors for instance in fig 11 a the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of cluster one are 37 422 and 122 655 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 157 and 0 149 respectively in fig 11 b the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of cluster two are 37 430 and 122 687 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 175 and 0 117 respectively in fig 11 c the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of cluster three are 37 410 and 122 730 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 172 and 0 061 respectively in fig 13 a the centres of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates of the cluster are 37 424 and 122 682 and the standard deviations of the latitudinal and longitude coordinates in the cluster are 0 168 and 0 121 respectively thus there are few differences in terms of spatial features however there are more sizeable differences in terms of movement features the main course of cluster three in fig 11 is 166 357 and the standard deviation of the course in the cluster is 15 145 most of the courses in cluster 3 are located in the range of 151 212 181 502 this range is apparently different from the range of 126 863 179 079 obtained by the comparison algorithm similar phenomena can be observed by comparing the clusters in fig 13 a with cluster one and cluster two in fig 11 and by comparing the movement feature vectors of clusters 7 and 9 in fig 12 with the movement feature vectors of the clusters in fig 13 by only considering spatial features the comparison algorithm groups cluster one cluster two and cluster three in fig 11 into the same cluster and groups cluster seven and cluster nine in fig 12 into the same cluster the differences in movement features among the clusters produced by the proposed algorithm are conspicuous as shown in table 3 and table 4 and are obtained by renormalizing the spatial and movement feature vectors these data reflect vessel behaviour to some extent for instance in table 4 the mean speed values in cluster two and cluster three are significantly higher than those in the other clusters and the standard deviations of the course in cluster one and cluster eight are also higher than those of the other clusters therefore the vessels in clusters two and three likely adopt high speeds and the vessels in clusters one and eight likely exhibit turning behaviour the analysis above suggests that the proposed algorithm can not only subdivide vessel traffic behaviours by considering spatial and movement features but can also determine appropriate parameters according to the sample set furthermore the cpu time required to run the critical code of the different algorithms is calculated and the dbi is utilized to evaluate cluster results the cpu time of the proposed algorithm and the comparison algorithm are 0 12 s and 54 s respectively and the dbi values achieved by standardizing the data are 0 75 and 0 81 respectively which imply that the proposed algorithm presents a better performance 4 2 the application of the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition the most important aspect of the proposed algorithm is its applications notably the method can be utilized by authorities to provide theoretical support for monitoring in this section we introduce how to develop monitoring strategies according to the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition the strategies for monitoring proposed in this section include three components the ship position velocity and course however determining the border of each cluster is difficult because the shape of each cluster is irregular hence to monitor the ship position the ecdis is necessary in positional monitoring whether a ship position is located in the areas presented in figs 11 and 12 must be determined to implement position monitoring in terms of the velocity and course strategies should be formulated according to the spatial and movement feature vectors of clusters according to different ship types as shown in tables 3 and 4 the ship velocity and course can be monitored by defining reasonable ranges for these values μ i σ i μ i σ i is adopted as a reasonable range for monitoring for example in cluster two in table 4 the mean velocity is 15 670 kn and most of the ship velocities in the cluster are located in the range of 14 422 kn 16 918 kn the mean course in the cluster is 267 802 and most ship courses are located in the range of 257 65 277 954 using the method described above we can obtain reasonable ranges for velocities and courses for each cluster the authorities can decide which traffic behaviours are best reflected by the spatial and movement features displayed by a monitored vessel and whether the velocity and course of the vessel are within the corresponding reasonable ranges if the velocity course or position is not within the reasonable range or area the vessel should be regarded as an abnormal vessel and the authorities should implement additional monitoring steps or other measures overall the proposed method provides a theoretical foundation for authorities to improve the efficiency of monitoring 5 conclusions this paper proposes a self adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi attribute trajectory characteristics to address the poor self adaption issue in the dbscan algorithm and the lack of considering movement features in identifying vessel traffic behaviour three aspects of the algorithm are improved to design a new vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm first a new similarity measure is designed to reflect the similarity between two trajectories while simultaneously considering the corresponding spatial and movement features then the parzen window is adopted to generate the eps parameter and the optimal parameter can be obtained according to different sample sets finally a gaussian distribution is applied to determine the parameter minpts which is beneficial for selecting appropriate values of minpts and avoiding scenarios with too many or too few clusters based on the sample set the performance of the proposed method is verified using chengshan jiao ais data the experimental results show that the proposed method is an adaptive and robust approach that can recognize vessel traffic behaviour by considering the spatial and movement features of trajectories and determine the appropriate parameters according to the sample set additionally this approach is superior to methods that use dtw as the similarity measure furthermore the results of vessel traffic behaviour recognition can provide a theoretical foundation for authorities to improve the monitoring efficiency and avoid maritime accidents however there are also shortcomings in this paper we assume that the speed and course distributions obey a gaussian distribution in reality this assumption is not always applicable for further studies we should use hypothesis testing and parameter estimation to determine the speed and course distributions according to different ship types ship parameters and time frames additionally the ship types are not divided in detail which is a limitation of the ais data employed in this paper in future research we will collect more detailed ais data for numerical experiments author contributions section zhaokun wei conceptualization

22098,the effects of surface roughness of the vortex induced vibration viv responses of a circular cylinder near a stationary plane wall were studied using the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the shear stress transport k ω model coupling with a fourth order runge kutta method a smooth cylinder and rough cylinders with three different degrees of surface roughness were selected for the study the viv response amplitude structural vibration frequency lock in region vortex shedding flow pattern strouhal number and hydrodynamic coefficient for cylinders with different degrees of surface roughness were compared the numerical results show that for a smooth cylinder and a cylinder with small surface roughness the reduced velocity range can be separated into four parts based on the viv amplitude an initial branch an upper branch a lower branch and a desynchronization region however for cylinders with intermediate and large surface roughnesses the upper branch is absent leaving only three branches the lock in phenomenon can apparently be found for all surface roughnesses but the width of the lock in region is not very sensitive to the variation of the surface roughness as surface roughness increases the strouhal number has an increasing tendency however the mean drag coefficient has a decreasing tendency keywords vortex induced vibration surface roughness circular cylinder stationary plane wall flow pattern 1 introduction as onshore oil and gas resources continue to dwindle the need to develop technologies for accessing offshore resources is continuously increasing for example a subsea pipeline is necessary to transport the resources from an offshore wellhead to onshore processing facilities because the pipeline is usually laid on the seabed possible seabed scouring may cause free spanning along the structure the length of the span can be easily reached to 100 times the diameter of the pipeline and the gap between the seabed and the pipeline can range from zero to more than 2 3 times the structure diameter sumer and fredsøe 2006 when exposed to flows such as currents and waves the pipeline may be subjected to dynamic motions referred to as vortex induced vibrations viv blevins 2001 the viv can increase the dynamic stress on the structure and may cause a catastrophic fatigue failure therefore understanding of the viv of a free span pipeline is very important during the design process of the structure the problem of a free span along the pipeline can be simply modeled by the configuration in which a flow passes a flexibly mounted near wall cylinder with two degrees of freedom 2dof the studies of viv of a circular cylinder in the vicinity of a stationary plane wall can serve as a foundation to improve pipeline design guidelines most previous studies on viv were generally focused on an isolated circular cylinder without wall proximity effects based on these abundant studies many important mechanisms of the viv problem of an isolated cylinder can be found when the vortex shedding frequency f v is close to the natural frequency f n a lock in or synchronization phenomenon occurs and within the lock in region the viv amplitude will be significantly amplified which can be reached to the same order of the cylinder diameter feng 1968 khalak and williamson 1997 gao et al 2015 2016 jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that the viv response amplitude according to the magnitude of the mass damping ratio m ζ where m is defined as the ratio of cylinder mass m s to the displaced mass of the fluid m d and ζ is the damping ratio has different forms as follows for low m ζ the viv response is comprised of three distinct branches against the reduced velocity v r v f n d where v is the free stream velocity and d is the cylinder diameter denoted initial upper and lower branches however for high m ζ the upper branch is absent the distinct branches in the viv response amplitudes may be associated with different vortex shedding flow patterns in the wake region behind the cylinder for the initial branch two single vortices are formed per cycle called a 2s mode however for the upper and lower branches two pairs of vortices are formed per cycle known as a 2p mode it is worth notice that for sufficiently low m ζ in addition to initial upper and lower branches another branch namely super upper branch occurs corresponding with a 2t mode comprised of two triplet vortices in each cycle when the cylinder is located in the vicinity of a plane wall induced by wall proximity effects the flow behind the structure will become much more complex compared with that for an isolated cylinder this is because flow involves the development of three shear layers namely the two layers that separate from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder as well as flow along the wall boundary layer depending on the boundary condition of the cylinder the viv studies of a circular cylinder near a plane wall can be mainly divided into two groups the studies on a stationary cylinder near a plane boundary in which the structure is completely fixed bearman and zdravkovich 1978 zdravkovich 1985 taniguchi and miyakoshi 1990 lei et al 1999 wang and tan 2008 lin et al 2009 and the studies on an oscillating cylinder near a plane boundary in which the structure is elastically mounted fredsøe et al 1987 gao et al 2006 yang et al 2008 wang et al 2013 zhao and cheng 2010 hsieh et al 2016 li et al 2016 2017 jin and dong 2016 munir et al 2018 de oliveira barbosa et al 2017 the studies of a stationary cylinder are directed mainly toward the flow force excitation characteristics such as vortex shedding frequency vortex shedding flow pattern drag force lift force etc however the studies of an oscillating cylinder contain both fluid force excitation characteristics and structural vibration response characteristics vibration amplitude vibration frequency lock in region etc in fact the flow excitation and the structural response are coupled with each other during the viv process therefore the viv problem is a typical fluid solid coupling problem in which the structural vibration is induced by vortex shedding while the vibrating structure conversely influences the flow field and resulting in the variation of the fluid forces acting on the structure however the surface roughness of the structures is one of the important parameters that significantly affect the flow past the cylinder as with pipelines having a cylindrical cross section marine organisms will grow on the surface of the structure over a period of time making the surface roughness of the structure increase the viv studies of a circular cylinder near a plane wall are mainly focused on smooth cylinders relevant studies on rough cylinders are very limited making the study of viv characteristics of a rough cylinder near a plane wall essential therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of surface roughness on the viv responses of a circular cylinder close to a plane wall the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a brief description of the problem is given in section 3 the governing equations and the numerical method are presented in section 4 the effects of the surface roughness on the viv characteristics of a circular cylinder near a plane wall are evaluated finally in section 5 conclusions based on the results of this study are drawn 2 problem description fig 1 shows the detailed information of the rectangular computational domain and its boundary conditions a circular cylinder with diameter d 0 2 m is located close to a plane wall the center of the cylinder is at a distance of 12d to the inflow boundary and of 36d to the outflow boundary whether the downstream length of 36d is sufficient for capturing the dynamic characteristics of the vortex shedding in the downstream wake region or not will be discussed in detail in section 4 5 the width of the computational domain is 22d therefore the blocking ratio based on the cylinder diameter and the lateral dimension of the domain is about 0 045 previous studies found that the effect of the domain width on the structure response can be negligible when the blocking ratio is less than 0 05 zhao et al 2012 navrose 2013 thus the blocking ratio of 0 045 used here is satisfactory to make the current numerical study smoothly conducted at a wide parametric space and an affordable consumed time the boundary conditions of the domain are also provided in fig 1 the inflow boundary condition is set as u v and v 0 to represent the free stream and a traction free condition with u x 0 v x 0 and p 0 is applied at the outflow boundary to ensure that the flow is fully developed the top boundary is imposed by a free slip symmetry condition with u y 0 and v 0 furthermore for the bottom wall and cylinder surface a no slip boundary condition with u 0 and v 0 is used the distance between the cylinder lower surface and the bottom wall is determined by the gap ratio defined as e d where e is the initial gap distance therefore the center of the cylinder is placed at 0 5d e relative to the bottom boundary as shown in the dashed circle in fig 1 the vibration system in this study can be oscillated in the in line il and cross flow cf directions simultaneously the reynolds number is defined as re vd ν whereν is the kinematic viscosity of flow in our analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 the reynolds number was fixed as a constant value of 5000 meaning that the inflow velocity v remained constant the reduced velocity v r was changed via the natural frequency of the oscillating system this method of changing v r was also used in many previous numerical studies bourguet and jacono 2014 zhao et al 2016 gao et al 2018 the study was conducted on a smooth cylinder k s d 0 where k s is the diameter of a hypothetical grain of sand and it will be introduced in detail in section 3 2 and on cylinders with three other roughness values i e k s d 5 10 3 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 for each surface roughness 22 different reduced velocities ranged from 1 to 14 were selected for the study therefore there were 88 simulation cases in total for all simulation cases in the analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 the initial gap ratio the mass ratio and the damping ratio remained constants of 2 2 6 and 0 0036 respectively for convenience of data processing the tiny amount of surface roughness was neglected and all the reduced velocities were calculated using the diameter of the smooth cylinder 3 governing equations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations the flow past a cylinder is a two dimensional incompressible and unsteady flow which can be governed by the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the equations for mass and momentum conservation are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i u i u j x j in which 3 u i

stress transport sst k ω turbulence model is used to solve the urans equations previous studies showed that the sst k ω model can provide a good prediction of the adverse pressure gradient flows prasanth and mittal 2009 gao et al 2018 the vibration system can be regarded as a 2dof mass spring damper system fig 1 the 2dof dynamic motions of the cylinder in the il and cf directions are described by zhu et al 2017 gao et al 2018 4 d 2 x t d t 2 2 ζ ω 0 d x t d t ω 0 2 x t f d t m d 2 y t d t 2 2 ζ ω 0 d y t d t ω 0 2 y t f l t m where x t dx t dt d 2 x t dt 2 represent the displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder in the il direction respectively while y t dy t dt and d 2 y t dt 2 denote the corresponding quantities in the cf direction respectively f d t

a that is to say m m s m a m c a m d in which m and m d are the parameters introduced in section 1 c a is the added mass coefficient ω 0 and ζ are the natural circular frequency and the damping ratio of the system respectively which can be expressed as follows 5 ω 0 k m ζ c 2 k m where c and k are the damping and stiffness of the system per unit length respectively the values of the parameters c k m and c a in analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 are all selected based on the experimental study by jauvtis and williamson 2004 boundary conditions on the cylinder surface are imposed by 6 u t d x t d t v t d y t d t the initial conditions are that the displacements and velocities in both x and y directions are zero expressed as follows 7 x 0 d x 0 d t 0 y 0 d y 0 d t 0 3 2 numerical method the cylinder is regarded as a particle displaying rigid motion in the x y plane therefore based on the nonlinear vibration of the single degree of freedom partial system the dynamic equation can be solved independently here the cylinder motion in the cf direction is selected as an example it can be expressed as the second part of eq 4 and rewritten as gao et al 2018 8 d y t d t v t d v t d t f l t m ω

step and subscript n is the number of time steps if the values of the displacement y t n and velocity v t n at time t n are determined their values at the next time step t n 1 t n δt can be easily obtained based on eq 8 10 in order to calculate the instantaneous velocity u v and instantaneous displacement x y in this study the urans equations eq 1 and 2 and the motion equations eq 4 with the initial conditions eq 7 should be solved simultaneously the dynamic motion of the vibration system is enforced using user defined functions all the above equations are solved by the commercial computational fluid dynamic software package fluent 15 0 the dynamic mesh method is employed to perform mesh deformation and any needed mesh adaption during this study as shown in fig 2 the total computational domain of interest is separated into two blocks block 1 corresponding with a deformation zone which is meshed using triangular elements and block 2 corresponding with an accompanying moving zone which is meshed using structural quadrilateral elements the mesh in block 2 changed synchronously with the cylinder motion however the mesh in block 1 was adjusted and updated instantaneously based on the translation of the structure as shown in fig 2 c in order to increase the accuracy in resolving the boundary layer flow we used 39 quadrilateral element layers with the growth factor of 1 08 in block 2 as shown in fig 2 c the thickness δy of the first layer next to the structural surface is selected as 0 002d meeting with the requirement that y y 0 172δyre 0 9 d is less than 1 pope 2000 among the many models available to simulate the surface roughness of the cylinder one is the equivalent sand model this model simulates roughness by representing a surface covered with sand of different particle diameters the roughness model has been used in many experimental and numerical studies gao et al 2015 2018 here a numerical model of equivalent sand surface roughness was used to simulate the surface roughness of the cylinder as shown in fig 2 c k s is the diameter of a hypothetical grain of sand therefore k s d is the relative value of the surface roughness where d is the diameter of a smooth cylinder 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical method validation before proceeding to use the numerical method to study the related viv problems the mesh independency study and the numerical model validation must be conducted to verify the accuracy and usefulness of our numerical method all parameters chosen during this validation section were re 200 m 10 ζ 0 k s d 0 and e 0 9d li et al 2016 it is notable that only the case with v r 6 0 was selected for the mesh independency study four different grids were employed during the grid refinement test and the calculated ratios a x d a y d and f s f n are given in table 1 here the ratios a x d and a y d are the non dimensional viv amplitudes in the il and cf directions respectively f s is the structure vibration frequency in the cf direction f n is the natural frequency of the system related to ω 0 see section 3 1 and f n ω 0 2π data in table 1 illustrate that when the mesh resolution was refined from m1 to m2 by increasing the number of elements the magnitudes of the variation for a x d a y d and f s f n were increased by 4 33 3 47 and 2 66 respectively when the mesh resolution was further refined from m2 to m3 the variations for a x d a y d and f s f n were smaller 2 64 2 13 and 1 34 respectively than the changes resulting from the refinement of mesh resolution from m1 to m2 as the mesh was further refined from m3 to m4 the variations for a x d a y d and f s f n were significantly smaller 0 74 0 59 and 0 38 respectively than those resulting from the previous mesh refinements thus the values of a x d a y d and f s f n calculated using m4 were very near to those resulting from m3 the simulations were executed in the intel core i5 4590 platform transient simulations typically consumed about 10 h and 13 h for the m3 and m4 grids respectively therefore the m3 grid system provided a good compromise between precision and required time and was sufficient for the numerical simulations in the study after the mesh independency study the model validation procedure was subsequently conducted with 13 different reduced velocities ranging from 3 to 9 fig 3 shows the simulated maximum non dimensional viv displacements a y d and a x d as well as the frequency ratio f s f n against reduced velocity as compared with the numerical results from li et al 2016 the lock in phenomenon can be easily observed in fig 3 as the reduced velocity entered the lock in region there existed an abrupt increase in the viv amplitude as the reduced velocity further increased and departed from the lock in region an abrupt decrease in the viv amplitude occurred it can be clearly seen that the viv amplitudes in both cf and il directions within the lock in region were obviously larger than those within unlocked regions within the lock in region the vibration frequencies departed from the strouhal frequencies and approached natural frequencies generally the viv amplitudes in both cf and il directions and the viv frequencies from the present numerical model agreed very well with the results from li et al 2016 confirming the validity of our numerical method so far we have successfully proved that our numerical method can simulate the viv problems of a near wall cylinder usefully and accurately in the following analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 this method will be employed to study the viv problems of a near wall cylinder with different parameters the differences between the main dimensionless parameters in this validation section section 4 1 and the corresponding ones in the following analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 are listed in table 2 notably the numerical method used in the analysis sections is identical to the method used in this validation section thus no additional validation was performed 4 2 response amplitude and frequency fig 4 7 show the maximum non dimensional displacements in the cf and il directions structural vibration frequencies in the cf direction and lock in regions for a smooth cylinder and for rough cylinders having three different degrees of surface roughness it is worth noting that the structural vibration frequency in the cf direction is usually defined as the dominant frequency of the viv displacement in the cf direction and it can be acquired by applying a fast fourier transform to the time series of the viv displacement response the lock in region was determined using the following criterion the viv amplitudes within the lock in region must be larger than half of the maximum amplitude experience within the whole reduced velocity range this method of determining the lock in region was also used in a previous study facchinetti et al 2004 table 3 summarizes the response regimes for the cylinders with different surface roughnesses from fig 4 5 and table 3 for a smooth cylinder k s d 0 and a cylinder with small surface roughness k s d 5 10 3 there existed four regimes defined as regimes i ii iii and iv which corresponded with the initial branch upper branch lower branch and desynchronization region respectively however as shown in fig 6 7 and table 3 for cylinders with intermediate and large roughnesses k s d 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 the viv responses only exhibited three regimes regimes i iii and iv regime ii corresponding with the upper branch was absent as shown in table 3 regimes i and iv both remained relatively stable with increased surface roughness when the roughness increased from 1 10 2 to 2 10 2 the end point of regime i and the start point of regime iv were reduced by 1 0 and 0 5 respectively the width of the entire lock in region which contains regimes ii and iii also remained relatively stable when the roughness increased the width of the lock in region was increased by 0 5 as the roughness increased from 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 in general for a smooth cylinder k s d 0 and for cylinders with small and intermediate roughnesses k s d 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 the width of the lock in region remained stable however as the roughness was further increased to a large value k s d 2 10 2 the lock in width became a little larger as shown in fig 4 6 for a smooth cylinder and for cylinders with small and intermediate surface roughnesses k s d 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 when the reduced velocity was very small such as v r 2 0 the viv amplitude in the il direction was comparable with the viv amplitude in the cf direction which was caused by the pure lock in phenomenon in the il direction within the pure lock in region the vibration frequency occurred near the strouhal frequency evaluated from f st st v d and the viv trajectory of the cylinder showed a regular figure eight shape as the reduced velocity increased the viv response departed from the pure lock in region and the viv trajectory displayed chaotic when the reduced velocity was further increased the viv response reached into the lock in region within this region compared with the viv amplitude in the il direction the viv amplitude in the cf direction was apparently larger such that the shapes of the viv trajectories showed slight shape characteristics the slight shapes mainly contained two types a slight figure eight shape and a slight raindrop shape within this region the vibration frequency deviated from the strouhal frequency but approached the natural frequency as the reduced velocity was increased even further the viv response transferred from the lock in region to the desynchronization region and the viv trajectories within this region became chaotic again within the desynchronization region as the reduced velocity increased the vibration frequency departed from the natural frequency and coincided with the strouhal frequency again fig 7 illustrates that for a cylinder with large surface roughness k s d 2 10 2 the viv responses displayed the same characteristics as the responses of cylinders with the other three roughnesses k s d 0 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 except that the pure lock in phenomenon that occurred for the other three roughnesses was absent when k s d 2 10 2 the disappearance of the pure lock in phenomenon led to a crescent shaped curve at v r 2 4 3 vortex shedding flow pattern the vortex shedding flow patterns in the wake region behind the cylinder are presented as vorticity contours fig 8 11 the non dimensional vorticity is calculated by ω v x u y v d four typical reduced velocities v r 2 0 5 0 9 0 and 12 0 were selected to study vortex shedding flow patterns for different branches for convenience in obtaining the detailed information of the shed vortexes the instantaneous vorticity contours at five typical vibration points t t 0 t 0 0 25t t 0 0 5t t 0 0 75t and t 0 t were selected for the study where t is the vibration period of the cylinder fig 8 11 provide the vorticity contours behind cylinders with different degrees of surface roughness in each figure the flow fields at the left of the black dashed lines at t t 0 were instantaneously tracked at t t 0 0 25t t 0 0 5t t 0 0 75t and t 0 t comparison of the flow field at the left of the blacked dashed line at t t 0 with the field at t t 0 t can easily yield detailed information of shed vortexes for each vibration period from fig 8 for the smooth cylinder k s d 0 when the reduced velocity was in the initial branch v r 2 0 and the upper branch v r 5 0 the vortex shedding flow pattern behind the cylinder displayed a 2s mode only one vortex shed from each side of the cylinder each period when the reduced velocity entered the lower branch v r 9 0 the vortex shedding flow pattern showed a p s mode two vortexes shed from the upper side while one vortex shed from the lower side each period among the two vortexes shed from the upper side at v r 9 0 one vortex was apparently much weaker than the other and the weaker vortex vanished quickly in the wake region as the reduced velocity further reached the desynchronization region v r 12 0 the vortex shedding flow pattern reverted to a 2s mode again figs 9 and 10 show that for cylinders with small and intermediate surface roughnesses k s d 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 the vortex shedding flow pattern remained in a stable 2s mode as the reduced velocity increased however the width of the distributed vortexes in the wake region displayed different characteristics for example compared with the widths of the distributed vortexes in the initial branch and desynchronization region the widths of vortexes in the upper branch and lower branch were larger fig 11 for a cylinder with large surface roughness k s d 2 10 2 shows that the vortex shedding flow patterns behind the structure began to show different characteristics as the reduced velocity varied when the reduced velocity was in the initial branch the vortex shedding flow pattern displayed a 2s mode however as the reduced velocity reached 5 the vortex shedding flow pattern changed to a 2p mode two vortexes shed from each side of the cylinder at each period and as the reduced velocity was further increased to 9 the flow pattern transferred from a 2p mode to a p s mode as the reduced velocity entered into the desynchronization region the flow pattern reverted to a 2s mode 4 4 strouhal number and drag coefficient fig 12 shows the strouhal number of a smooth cylinder and cylinder having three different surface roughnesses it can be seen that for a smooth cylinder k s d 0 and a cylinder with small surface roughness k s d 5 10 3 the whole reduced velocity region can be approximately separated into four regimes according to how the strouhal number varied the strouhal number showed a general decreasing trend within regime i however as v r increased the strouhal number first increased from regime i to regime ii but then displayed a decreasing trend within regime ii as v r changed from regime ii to regime iii the strouhal number sharply increased and then continued a downward trend within regime iii the strouhal numbers reached the minimum values of about 0 11 and 0 12 at v r 10 and 9 5 for the smooth cylinder and a cylinder with small roughness respectively when v r changed further from regime iii to regime iv the strouhal number increased abruptly however within regime iv the strouhal number remained as a stable value of about 0 21 for the cylinders with intermediate and large surface roughnesses k s d 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 the reduced velocity region can be mainly divided into three regimes regimes i iii and iv based on how the strouhal number varied as shown in fig 12 regime ii corresponding with the upper branch was absent and only regime iii corresponding with the lower branch remained within regime i the strouhal number had a decreasing tendency for both roughnesses k s d 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 as the reduced velocity increased the transition form from regime i to regime iii for k s d 1 10 2 showed different characteristics from the form for k s d 2 10 2 for intermediate roughness k s d 1 10 2 there existed an abrupt increase of the strouhal number but there existed no abrupt increase for large roughness k s d 2 10 2 within regime iii as the reduced velocity increased the strouhal number decreased and reached the minimum values of 0 125 at v r 9 and at v r 8 for intermediate roughness and large roughness respectively as v r transferred from the combined regime to regime iv the strouhal number increased abruptly but within regime iv the strouhal number remained stable values of 0 23 and 0 26 for intermediate roughness and large roughness respectively fig 13 shows the mean drag coefficients of the smooth cylinder and rough cylinders having three different degrees of surface roughness for the smooth cylinder k s d 0 and rough cylinders with k s d 5 0 10 3 1 0 10 2 and 2 0 10 2 the mean drag coefficients reached maximum values at v r 5 0 5 0 4 5 and 3 5 respectively in the vicinity where the mean drag coefficients reached their maximum values v r advanced gradually and the mean drag coefficients had a decreasing trend when surface roughness increased this observation has also been found for a circular cylinder without wall proximity in the past experimental and numerical studies kiu et al 2011 gao et al 2018 for the smooth cylinder the maximum value of the mean drag coefficient reached 2 7 in contrast the maximum value of the mean drag coefficient reached 2 0 for the cylinder with maximum surface roughness k s d 2 0 10 2 after the mean drag coefficients reached the maximum values as the reduced velocity increased the mean drag coefficients displayed a downward trend within regime iii as v r transferred to regime iv the mean drag coefficients remained relatively stable with increased v r the values of the mean drag coefficients gradually became stable at about1 05 for the smooth cylinder and a cylinder with small roughness k s d 5 0 10 3 and at 0 95 and 0 70 for cylinders with intermediate and large roughnesses k s d 1 0 10 2 and 2 0 10 2 respectively 4 5 general discussion from the validation in section 4 1 it can be found that the downstream length of 36d is sufficient enough for re 200 whether this downstream length is also sufficient for re 5000 or not is discussed in detail here as shown in fig 14 three typical values 24d 36d and 48d of the downstream length were selected to conduct the independency study on a smooth cylinder k s d 0 the values of other parameters were chosen from the analysis sections viz m 2 6 ζ 0 0036 and e 2d notably here only the case with v r 6 was selected for the independency study the calculated ratios a x d a y d and f s f n based on the three different downstream lengths have been listed in table 4 it can be obviously seen that the downstream length of 36d can provide a good promise between precision and consumed computational cost demonstrating that this value is also sufficient enough for re 5000 from section 4 1 it can also be seen that even for two dimensional 2d numerical studies it needs about 10 h of processing time on a personal computer for one simulation case however the consumed time is about one week per case if three dimensional 3d numerical studies are conducted as introduced in section 2 there exist 88 simulation cases in total during our study in this work thus the computational cost for conducting the 3d numerical studies for all these cases is so high that it is very hard to be affordable at present considering this aspect the 2d simulations are employed in this paper to obtain some insights on the related viv problems while keeping the computational cost acceptable the 2d numerical results are useful to reveal some physical mechanisms which can provide some reference values for the further 3d study notably the 2d numerical results obtained in this work cannot be directly extrapolated to 3d results as the 3d effect is neglected therefore further extensive 3d studies are required in our future work we also would like to conduct 3d numerical studies using computer stations so that the effects of the surface roughness on the viv responses of a near wall cylinder are uncovered more realistically considering the 3d effects 5 conclusions the effects of surface roughness on the viv response performances of a circular cylinder near a stationary plane wall were studied numerically the mass ratio damping ratio reynolds number and initial gap ratio for the near wall cylinder were fixed as constant values of 2 6 0 0036 5000 and 2 0 respectively the 2 d urans approach and a sst k ω turbulence model coupled with a fourth order runge kutta method were employed to solve the fluid flow equations and describe the dynamic motion of the oscillatory system as reduced velocity ranged from 1 to 14 the research focused on a smooth cylinder and rough cylinders with three different degrees of surface roughness the viv response parameters including structural vibration displacement structural vibration frequency lock in region vortex shedding flow pattern strouhal number and mean drag coefficient were determined and systematically analyzed based upon these results the following conclusions are justified 1 for a smooth cylinder and cylinder with small roughness k s d 0 and 5 0 10 3 respectively depending on the response amplitudes the entire reduced velocity region can be separated into four regimes regime i regime ii regime iii and regime iv which correspond to an initial branch an upper branch a lower branch and a desynchronization region respectively however for cylinders with intermediate and large roughnesses k s d 1 0 10 2 and 2 0 10 2 the regime ii corresponding to the upper branch is absent and only three regimes regime i regime iii and regime iv remain the width of the lock in region is not sensitive to the surface roughness during regime i there exists an obvious pure lock in phenomenon for a smooth cylinder and the cylinders with small and intermediate roughnesses but this pure lock in phenomenon disappears for large roughness 2 among the simulated cases most of the vortex shedding flow patterns show 2s modes except for three special cases as follows for the smooth cylinder and the cylinder with large roughness in the lower branches the vortex shedding flow patterns display p s modes for the cylinder with large roughness in the upper branch the vortex shedding flow pattern shows a 2p mode the motion trajectories of the viv response have many shapes normal figure eight slight figure eight crescent curve raindrop and a straight line 3 similar to the separation method of the reduced velocity range by the viv response amplitude based on the variation trend of the strouhal number the entire reduced velocity region also can be divided into several regimes four regimes exist for a smooth cylinder and cylinder with small roughness cylinders however three regimes exist for cylinder with intermediate and large roughnesses as the reduced velocity increased the mean drag coefficient shows an increasing trend then a slight decreasing trend and at last becomes stable acknowledgements this research was supported by the national science foundation of china grant nos

22098,the effects of surface roughness of the vortex induced vibration viv responses of a circular cylinder near a stationary plane wall were studied using the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the shear stress transport k ω model coupling with a fourth order runge kutta method a smooth cylinder and rough cylinders with three different degrees of surface roughness were selected for the study the viv response amplitude structural vibration frequency lock in region vortex shedding flow pattern strouhal number and hydrodynamic coefficient for cylinders with different degrees of surface roughness were compared the numerical results show that for a smooth cylinder and a cylinder with small surface roughness the reduced velocity range can be separated into four parts based on the viv amplitude an initial branch an upper branch a lower branch and a desynchronization region however for cylinders with intermediate and large surface roughnesses the upper branch is absent leaving only three branches the lock in phenomenon can apparently be found for all surface roughnesses but the width of the lock in region is not very sensitive to the variation of the surface roughness as surface roughness increases the strouhal number has an increasing tendency however the mean drag coefficient has a decreasing tendency keywords vortex induced vibration surface roughness circular cylinder stationary plane wall flow pattern 1 introduction as onshore oil and gas resources continue to dwindle the need to develop technologies for accessing offshore resources is continuously increasing for example a subsea pipeline is necessary to transport the resources from an offshore wellhead to onshore processing facilities because the pipeline is usually laid on the seabed possible seabed scouring may cause free spanning along the structure the length of the span can be easily reached to 100 times the diameter of the pipeline and the gap between the seabed and the pipeline can range from zero to more than 2 3 times the structure diameter sumer and fredsøe 2006 when exposed to flows such as currents and waves the pipeline may be subjected to dynamic motions referred to as vortex induced vibrations viv blevins 2001 the viv can increase the dynamic stress on the structure and may cause a catastrophic fatigue failure therefore understanding of the viv of a free span pipeline is very important during the design process of the structure the problem of a free span along the pipeline can be simply modeled by the configuration in which a flow passes a flexibly mounted near wall cylinder with two degrees of freedom 2dof the studies of viv of a circular cylinder in the vicinity of a stationary plane wall can serve as a foundation to improve pipeline design guidelines most previous studies on viv were generally focused on an isolated circular cylinder without wall proximity effects based on these abundant studies many important mechanisms of the viv problem of an isolated cylinder can be found when the vortex shedding frequency f v is close to the natural frequency f n a lock in or synchronization phenomenon occurs and within the lock in region the viv amplitude will be significantly amplified which can be reached to the same order of the cylinder diameter feng 1968 khalak and williamson 1997 gao et al 2015 2016 jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that the viv response amplitude according to the magnitude of the mass damping ratio m ζ where m is defined as the ratio of cylinder mass m s to the displaced mass of the fluid m d and ζ is the damping ratio has different forms as follows for low m ζ the viv response is comprised of three distinct branches against the reduced velocity v r v f n d where v is the free stream velocity and d is the cylinder diameter denoted initial upper and lower branches however for high m ζ the upper branch is absent the distinct branches in the viv response amplitudes may be associated with different vortex shedding flow patterns in the wake region behind the cylinder for the initial branch two single vortices are formed per cycle called a 2s mode however for the upper and lower branches two pairs of vortices are formed per cycle known as a 2p mode it is worth notice that for sufficiently low m ζ in addition to initial upper and lower branches another branch namely super upper branch occurs corresponding with a 2t mode comprised of two triplet vortices in each cycle when the cylinder is located in the vicinity of a plane wall induced by wall proximity effects the flow behind the structure will become much more complex compared with that for an isolated cylinder this is because flow involves the development of three shear layers namely the two layers that separate from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder as well as flow along the wall boundary layer depending on the boundary condition of the cylinder the viv studies of a circular cylinder near a plane wall can be mainly divided into two groups the studies on a stationary cylinder near a plane boundary in which the structure is completely fixed bearman and zdravkovich 1978 zdravkovich 1985 taniguchi and miyakoshi 1990 lei et al 1999 wang and tan 2008 lin et al 2009 and the studies on an oscillating cylinder near a plane boundary in which the structure is elastically mounted fredsøe et al 1987 gao et al 2006 yang et al 2008 wang et al 2013 zhao and cheng 2010 hsieh et al 2016 li et al 2016 2017 jin and dong 2016 munir et al 2018 de oliveira barbosa et al 2017 the studies of a stationary cylinder are directed mainly toward the flow force excitation characteristics such as vortex shedding frequency vortex shedding flow pattern drag force lift force etc however the studies of an oscillating cylinder contain both fluid force excitation characteristics and structural vibration response characteristics vibration amplitude vibration frequency lock in region etc in fact the flow excitation and the structural response are coupled with each other during the viv process therefore the viv problem is a typical fluid solid coupling problem in which the structural vibration is induced by vortex shedding while the vibrating structure conversely influences the flow field and resulting in the variation of the fluid forces acting on the structure however the surface roughness of the structures is one of the important parameters that significantly affect the flow past the cylinder as with pipelines having a cylindrical cross section marine organisms will grow on the surface of the structure over a period of time making the surface roughness of the structure increase the viv studies of a circular cylinder near a plane wall are mainly focused on smooth cylinders relevant studies on rough cylinders are very limited making the study of viv characteristics of a rough cylinder near a plane wall essential therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of surface roughness on the viv responses of a circular cylinder close to a plane wall the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a brief description of the problem is given in section 3 the governing equations and the numerical method are presented in section 4 the effects of the surface roughness on the viv characteristics of a circular cylinder near a plane wall are evaluated finally in section 5 conclusions based on the results of this study are drawn 2 problem description fig 1 shows the detailed information of the rectangular computational domain and its boundary conditions a circular cylinder with diameter d 0 2 m is located close to a plane wall the center of the cylinder is at a distance of 12d to the inflow boundary and of 36d to the outflow boundary whether the downstream length of 36d is sufficient for capturing the dynamic characteristics of the vortex shedding in the downstream wake region or not will be discussed in detail in section 4 5 the width of the computational domain is 22d therefore the blocking ratio based on the cylinder diameter and the lateral dimension of the domain is about 0 045 previous studies found that the effect of the domain width on the structure response can be negligible when the blocking ratio is less than 0 05 zhao et al 2012 navrose 2013 thus the blocking ratio of 0 045 used here is satisfactory to make the current numerical study smoothly conducted at a wide parametric space and an affordable consumed time the boundary conditions of the domain are also provided in fig 1 the inflow boundary condition is set as u v and v 0 to represent the free stream and a traction free condition with u x 0 v x 0 and p 0 is applied at the outflow boundary to ensure that the flow is fully developed the top boundary is imposed by a free slip symmetry condition with u y 0 and v 0 furthermore for the bottom wall and cylinder surface a no slip boundary condition with u 0 and v 0 is used the distance between the cylinder lower surface and the bottom wall is determined by the gap ratio defined as e d where e is the initial gap distance therefore the center of the cylinder is placed at 0 5d e relative to the bottom boundary as shown in the dashed circle in fig 1 the vibration system in this study can be oscillated in the in line il and cross flow cf directions simultaneously the reynolds number is defined as re vd ν whereν is the kinematic viscosity of flow in our analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 the reynolds number was fixed as a constant value of 5000 meaning that the inflow velocity v remained constant the reduced velocity v r was changed via the natural frequency of the oscillating system this method of changing v r was also used in many previous numerical studies bourguet and jacono 2014 zhao et al 2016 gao et al 2018 the study was conducted on a smooth cylinder k s d 0 where k s is the diameter of a hypothetical grain of sand and it will be introduced in detail in section 3 2 and on cylinders with three other roughness values i e k s d 5 10 3 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 for each surface roughness 22 different reduced velocities ranged from 1 to 14 were selected for the study therefore there were 88 simulation cases in total for all simulation cases in the analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 the initial gap ratio the mass ratio and the damping ratio remained constants of 2 2 6 and 0 0036 respectively for convenience of data processing the tiny amount of surface roughness was neglected and all the reduced velocities were calculated using the diameter of the smooth cylinder 3 governing equations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations the flow past a cylinder is a two dimensional incompressible and unsteady flow which can be governed by the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the equations for mass and momentum conservation are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i u i u j x j in which 3 u i

prasanth and mittal 2009 gao et al 2018 the vibration system can be regarded as a 2dof mass spring damper system fig 1 the 2dof dynamic motions of the cylinder in the il and cf directions are described by zhu et al 2017 gao et al 2018 4 d 2 x t d t 2 2 ζ ω 0 d x t d t ω 0 2 x t f d t m d 2 y t d t 2 2 ζ ω 0 d y t d t ω 0 2 y t f l t m where x t dx t dt d 2 x t dt 2 represent the displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder in the il direction respectively while y t dy t dt and d 2 y t dt 2 denote the corresponding quantities in the cf direction respectively f d t

a that is to say m m s m a m c a m d in which m and m d are the parameters introduced in section 1 c a is the added mass coefficient ω 0 and ζ are the natural circular frequency and the damping ratio of the system respectively which can be expressed as follows 5 ω 0 k m ζ c 2 k m where c and k are the damping and stiffness of the system per unit length respectively the values of the parameters c k m and c a in analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 are all selected based on the experimental study by jauvtis and williamson 2004 boundary conditions on the cylinder surface are imposed by 6 u t d x t d t v t d y t d t the initial conditions are that the displacements and velocities in both x and y directions are zero expressed as follows 7 x 0 d x 0 d t 0 y 0 d y 0 d t 0 3 2 numerical method the cylinder is regarded as a particle displaying rigid motion in the x y plane therefore based on the nonlinear vibration of the single degree of freedom partial system the dynamic equation can be solved independently here the cylinder motion in the cf direction is selected as an example it can be expressed as the second part of eq 4 and rewritten as gao et al 2018 8 d y t d t v t d v t d t f l t m ω

step and subscript n is the number of time steps if the values of the displacement y t n and velocity v t n at time t n are determined their values at the next time step t n 1 t n δt can be easily obtained based on eq 8 10 in order to calculate the instantaneous velocity u v and instantaneous displacement x y in this study the urans equations eq 1 and 2 and the motion equations eq 4 with the initial conditions eq 7 should be solved simultaneously the dynamic motion of the vibration system is enforced using user defined functions all the above equations are solved by the commercial computational fluid dynamic software package fluent 15 0 the dynamic mesh method is employed to perform mesh deformation and any needed mesh adaption during this study as shown in fig 2 the total computational domain of interest is separated into two blocks block 1 corresponding with a deformation zone which is meshed using triangular elements and block 2 corresponding with an accompanying moving zone which is meshed using structural quadrilateral elements the mesh in block 2 changed synchronously with the cylinder motion however the mesh in block 1 was adjusted and updated instantaneously based on the translation of the structure as shown in fig 2 c in order to increase the accuracy in resolving the boundary layer flow we used 39 quadrilateral element layers with the growth factor of 1 08 in block 2 as shown in fig 2 c the thickness δy of the first layer next to the structural surface is selected as 0 002d meeting with the requirement that y y 0 172δyre 0 9 d is less than 1 pope 2000 among the many models available to simulate the surface roughness of the cylinder one is the equivalent sand model this model simulates roughness by representing a surface covered with sand of different particle diameters the roughness model has been used in many experimental and numerical studies gao et al 2015 2018 here a numerical model of equivalent sand surface roughness was used to simulate the surface roughness of the cylinder as shown in fig 2 c k s is the diameter of a hypothetical grain of sand therefore k s d is the relative value of the surface roughness where d is the diameter of a smooth cylinder 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical method validation before proceeding to use the numerical method to study the related viv problems the mesh independency study and the numerical model validation must be conducted to verify the accuracy and usefulness of our numerical method all parameters chosen during this validation section were re 200 m 10 ζ 0 k s d 0 and e 0 9d li et al 2016 it is notable that only the case with v r 6 0 was selected for the mesh independency study four different grids were employed during the grid refinement test and the calculated ratios a x d a y d and f s f n are given in table 1 here the ratios a x d and a y d are the non dimensional viv amplitudes in the il and cf directions respectively f s is the structure vibration frequency in the cf direction f n is the natural frequency of the system related to ω 0 see section 3 1 and f n ω 0 2π data in table 1 illustrate that when the mesh resolution was refined from m1 to m2 by increasing the number of elements the magnitudes of the variation for a x d a y d and f s f n were increased by 4 33 3 47 and 2 66 respectively when the mesh resolution was further refined from m2 to m3 the variations for a x d a y d and f s f n were smaller 2 64 2 13 and 1 34 respectively than the changes resulting from the refinement of mesh resolution from m1 to m2 as the mesh was further refined from m3 to m4 the variations for a x d a y d and f s f n were significantly smaller 0 74 0 59 and 0 38 respectively than those resulting from the previous mesh refinements thus the values of a x d a y d and f s f n calculated using m4 were very near to those resulting from m3 the simulations were executed in the intel core i5 4590 platform transient simulations typically consumed about 10 h and 13 h for the m3 and m4 grids respectively therefore the m3 grid system provided a good compromise between precision and required time and was sufficient for the numerical simulations in the study after the mesh independency study the model validation procedure was subsequently conducted with 13 different reduced velocities ranging from 3 to 9 fig 3 shows the simulated maximum non dimensional viv displacements a y d and a x d as well as the frequency ratio f s f n against reduced velocity as compared with the numerical results from li et al 2016 the lock in phenomenon can be easily observed in fig 3 as the reduced velocity entered the lock in region there existed an abrupt increase in the viv amplitude as the reduced velocity further increased and departed from the lock in region an abrupt decrease in the viv amplitude occurred it can be clearly seen that the viv amplitudes in both cf and il directions within the lock in region were obviously larger than those within unlocked regions within the lock in region the vibration frequencies departed from the strouhal frequencies and approached natural frequencies generally the viv amplitudes in both cf and il directions and the viv frequencies from the present numerical model agreed very well with the results from li et al 2016 confirming the validity of our numerical method so far we have successfully proved that our numerical method can simulate the viv problems of a near wall cylinder usefully and accurately in the following analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 this method will be employed to study the viv problems of a near wall cylinder with different parameters the differences between the main dimensionless parameters in this validation section section 4 1 and the corresponding ones in the following analysis sections sections 4 2 4 4 are listed in table 2 notably the numerical method used in the analysis sections is identical to the method used in this validation section thus no additional validation was performed 4 2 response amplitude and frequency fig 4 7 show the maximum non dimensional displacements in the cf and il directions structural vibration frequencies in the cf direction and lock in regions for a smooth cylinder and for rough cylinders having three different degrees of surface roughness it is worth noting that the structural vibration frequency in the cf direction is usually defined as the dominant frequency of the viv displacement in the cf direction and it can be acquired by applying a fast fourier transform to the time series of the viv displacement response the lock in region was determined using the following criterion the viv amplitudes within the lock in region must be larger than half of the maximum amplitude experience within the whole reduced velocity range this method of determining the lock in region was also used in a previous study facchinetti et al 2004 table 3 summarizes the response regimes for the cylinders with different surface roughnesses from fig 4 5 and table 3 for a smooth cylinder k s d 0 and a cylinder with small surface roughness k s d 5 10 3 there existed four regimes defined as regimes i ii iii and iv which corresponded with the initial branch upper branch lower branch and desynchronization region respectively however as shown in fig 6 7 and table 3 for cylinders with intermediate and large roughnesses k s d 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 the viv responses only exhibited three regimes regimes i iii and iv regime ii corresponding with the upper branch was absent as shown in table 3 regimes i and iv both remained relatively stable with increased surface roughness when the roughness increased from 1 10 2 to 2 10 2 the end point of regime i and the start point of regime iv were reduced by 1 0 and 0 5 respectively the width of the entire lock in region which contains regimes ii and iii also remained relatively stable when the roughness increased the width of the lock in region was increased by 0 5 as the roughness increased from 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 in general for a smooth cylinder k s d 0 and for cylinders with small and intermediate roughnesses k s d 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 the width of the lock in region remained stable however as the roughness was further increased to a large value k s d 2 10 2 the lock in width became a little larger as shown in fig 4 6 for a smooth cylinder and for cylinders with small and intermediate surface roughnesses k s d 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 when the reduced velocity was very small such as v r 2 0 the viv amplitude in the il direction was comparable with the viv amplitude in the cf direction which was caused by the pure lock in phenomenon in the il direction within the pure lock in region the vibration frequency occurred near the strouhal frequency evaluated from f st st v d and the viv trajectory of the cylinder showed a regular figure eight shape as the reduced velocity increased the viv response departed from the pure lock in region and the viv trajectory displayed chaotic when the reduced velocity was further increased the viv response reached into the lock in region within this region compared with the viv amplitude in the il direction the viv amplitude in the cf direction was apparently larger such that the shapes of the viv trajectories showed slight shape characteristics the slight shapes mainly contained two types a slight figure eight shape and a slight raindrop shape within this region the vibration frequency deviated from the strouhal frequency but approached the natural frequency as the reduced velocity was increased even further the viv response transferred from the lock in region to the desynchronization region and the viv trajectories within this region became chaotic again within the desynchronization region as the reduced velocity increased the vibration frequency departed from the natural frequency and coincided with the strouhal frequency again fig 7 illustrates that for a cylinder with large surface roughness k s d 2 10 2 the viv responses displayed the same characteristics as the responses of cylinders with the other three roughnesses k s d 0 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 except that the pure lock in phenomenon that occurred for the other three roughnesses was absent when k s d 2 10 2 the disappearance of the pure lock in phenomenon led to a crescent shaped curve at v r 2 4 3 vortex shedding flow pattern the vortex shedding flow patterns in the wake region behind the cylinder are presented as vorticity contours fig 8 11 the non dimensional vorticity is calculated by ω v x u y v d four typical reduced velocities v r 2 0 5 0 9 0 and 12 0 were selected to study vortex shedding flow patterns for different branches for convenience in obtaining the detailed information of the shed vortexes the instantaneous vorticity contours at five typical vibration points t t 0 t 0 0 25t t 0 0 5t t 0 0 75t and t 0 t were selected for the study where t is the vibration period of the cylinder fig 8 11 provide the vorticity contours behind cylinders with different degrees of surface roughness in each figure the flow fields at the left of the black dashed lines at t t 0 were instantaneously tracked at t t 0 0 25t t 0 0 5t t 0 0 75t and t 0 t comparison of the flow field at the left of the blacked dashed line at t t 0 with the field at t t 0 t can easily yield detailed information of shed vortexes for each vibration period from fig 8 for the smooth cylinder k s d 0 when the reduced velocity was in the initial branch v r 2 0 and the upper branch v r 5 0 the vortex shedding flow pattern behind the cylinder displayed a 2s mode only one vortex shed from each side of the cylinder each period when the reduced velocity entered the lower branch v r 9 0 the vortex shedding flow pattern showed a p s mode two vortexes shed from the upper side while one vortex shed from the lower side each period among the two vortexes shed from the upper side at v r 9 0 one vortex was apparently much weaker than the other and the weaker vortex vanished quickly in the wake region as the reduced velocity further reached the desynchronization region v r 12 0 the vortex shedding flow pattern reverted to a 2s mode again figs 9 and 10 show that for cylinders with small and intermediate surface roughnesses k s d 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 the vortex shedding flow pattern remained in a stable 2s mode as the reduced velocity increased however the width of the distributed vortexes in the wake region displayed different characteristics for example compared with the widths of the distributed vortexes in the initial branch and desynchronization region the widths of vortexes in the upper branch and lower branch were larger fig 11 for a cylinder with large surface roughness k s d 2 10 2 shows that the vortex shedding flow patterns behind the structure began to show different characteristics as the reduced velocity varied when the reduced velocity was in the initial branch the vortex shedding flow pattern displayed a 2s mode however as the reduced velocity reached 5 the vortex shedding flow pattern changed to a 2p mode two vortexes shed from each side of the cylinder at each period and as the reduced velocity was further increased to 9 the flow pattern transferred from a 2p mode to a p s mode as the reduced velocity entered into the desynchronization region the flow pattern reverted to a 2s mode 4 4 strouhal number and drag coefficient fig 12 shows the strouhal number of a smooth cylinder and cylinder having three different surface roughnesses it can be seen that for a smooth cylinder k s d 0 and a cylinder with small surface roughness k s d 5 10 3 the whole reduced velocity region can be approximately separated into four regimes according to how the strouhal number varied the strouhal number showed a general decreasing trend within regime i however as v r increased the strouhal number first increased from regime i to regime ii but then displayed a decreasing trend within regime ii as v r changed from regime ii to regime iii the strouhal number sharply increased and then continued a downward trend within regime iii the strouhal numbers reached the minimum values of about 0 11 and 0 12 at v r 10 and 9 5 for the smooth cylinder and a cylinder with small roughness respectively when v r changed further from regime iii to regime iv the strouhal number increased abruptly however within regime iv the strouhal number remained as a stable value of about 0 21 for the cylinders with intermediate and large surface roughnesses k s d 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 the reduced velocity region can be mainly divided into three regimes regimes i iii and iv based on how the strouhal number varied as shown in fig 12 regime ii corresponding with the upper branch was absent and only regime iii corresponding with the lower branch remained within regime i the strouhal number had a decreasing tendency for both roughnesses k s d 1 10 2 and 2 10 2 as the reduced velocity increased the transition form from regime i to regime iii for k s d 1 10 2 showed different characteristics from the form for k s d 2 10 2 for intermediate roughness k s d 1 10 2 there existed an abrupt increase of the strouhal number but there existed no abrupt increase for large roughness k s d 2 10 2 within regime iii as the reduced velocity increased the strouhal number decreased and reached the minimum values of 0 125 at v r 9 and at v r 8 for intermediate roughness and large roughness respectively as v r transferred from the combined regime to regime iv the strouhal number increased abruptly but within regime iv the strouhal number remained stable values of 0 23 and 0 26 for intermediate roughness and large roughness respectively fig 13 shows the mean drag coefficients of the smooth cylinder and rough cylinders having three different degrees of surface roughness for the smooth cylinder k s d 0 and rough cylinders with k s d 5 0 10 3 1 0 10 2 and 2 0 10 2 the mean drag coefficients reached maximum values at v r 5 0 5 0 4 5 and 3 5 respectively in the vicinity where the mean drag coefficients reached their maximum values v r advanced gradually and the mean drag coefficients had a decreasing trend when surface roughness increased this observation has also been found for a circular cylinder without wall proximity in the past experimental and numerical studies kiu et al 2011 gao et al 2018 for the smooth cylinder the maximum value of the mean drag coefficient reached 2 7 in contrast the maximum value of the mean drag coefficient reached 2 0 for the cylinder with maximum surface roughness k s d 2 0 10 2 after the mean drag coefficients reached the maximum values as the reduced velocity increased the mean drag coefficients displayed a downward trend within regime iii as v r transferred to regime iv the mean drag coefficients remained relatively stable with increased v r the values of the mean drag coefficients gradually became stable at about1 05 for the smooth cylinder and a cylinder with small roughness k s d 5 0 10 3 and at 0 95 and 0 70 for cylinders with intermediate and large roughnesses k s d 1 0 10 2 and 2 0 10 2 respectively 4 5 general discussion from the validation in section 4 1 it can be found that the downstream length of 36d is sufficient enough for re 200 whether this downstream length is also sufficient for re 5000 or not is discussed in detail here as shown in fig 14 three typical values 24d 36d and 48d of the downstream length were selected to conduct the independency study on a smooth cylinder k s d 0 the values of other parameters were chosen from the analysis sections viz m 2 6 ζ 0 0036 and e 2d notably here only the case with v r 6 was selected for the independency study the calculated ratios a x d a y d and f s f n based on the three different downstream lengths have been listed in table 4 it can be obviously seen that the downstream length of 36d can provide a good promise between precision and consumed computational cost demonstrating that this value is also sufficient enough for re 5000 from section 4 1 it can also be seen that even for two dimensional 2d numerical studies it needs about 10 h of processing time on a personal computer for one simulation case however the consumed time is about one week per case if three dimensional 3d numerical studies are conducted as introduced in section 2 there exist 88 simulation cases in total during our study in this work thus the computational cost for conducting the 3d numerical studies for all these cases is so high that it is very hard to be affordable at present considering this aspect the 2d simulations are employed in this paper to obtain some insights on the related viv problems while keeping the computational cost acceptable the 2d numerical results are useful to reveal some physical mechanisms which can provide some reference values for the further 3d study notably the 2d numerical results obtained in this work cannot be directly extrapolated to 3d results as the 3d effect is neglected therefore further extensive 3d studies are required in our future work we also would like to conduct 3d numerical studies using computer stations so that the effects of the surface roughness on the viv responses of a near wall cylinder are uncovered more realistically considering the 3d effects 5 conclusions the effects of surface roughness on the viv response performances of a circular cylinder near a stationary plane wall were studied numerically the mass ratio damping ratio reynolds number and initial gap ratio for the near wall cylinder were fixed as constant values of 2 6 0 0036 5000 and 2 0 respectively the 2 d urans approach and a sst k ω turbulence model coupled with a fourth order runge kutta method were employed to solve the fluid flow equations and describe the dynamic motion of the oscillatory system as reduced velocity ranged from 1 to 14 the research focused on a smooth cylinder and rough cylinders with three different degrees of surface roughness the viv response parameters including structural vibration displacement structural vibration frequency lock in region vortex shedding flow pattern strouhal number and mean drag coefficient were determined and systematically analyzed based upon these results the following conclusions are justified 1 for a smooth cylinder and cylinder with small roughness k s d 0 and 5 0 10 3 respectively depending on the response amplitudes the entire reduced velocity region can be separated into four regimes regime i regime ii regime iii and regime iv which correspond to an initial branch an upper branch a lower branch and a desynchronization region respectively however for cylinders with intermediate and large roughnesses k s d 1 0 10 2 and 2 0 10 2 the regime ii corresponding to the upper branch is absent and only three regimes regime i regime iii and regime iv remain the width of the lock in region is not sensitive to the surface roughness during regime i there exists an obvious pure lock in phenomenon for a smooth cylinder and the cylinders with small and intermediate roughnesses but this pure lock in phenomenon disappears for large roughness 2 among the simulated cases most of the vortex shedding flow patterns show 2s modes except for three special cases as follows for the smooth cylinder and the cylinder with large roughness in the lower branches the vortex shedding flow patterns display p s modes for the cylinder with large roughness in the upper branch the vortex shedding flow pattern shows a 2p mode the motion trajectories of the viv response have many shapes normal figure eight slight figure eight crescent curve raindrop and a straight line 3 similar to the separation method of the reduced velocity range by the viv response amplitude based on the variation trend of the strouhal number the entire reduced velocity region also can be divided into several regimes four regimes exist for a smooth cylinder and cylinder with small roughness cylinders however three regimes exist for cylinder with intermediate and large roughnesses as the reduced velocity increased the mean drag coefficient shows an increasing trend then a slight decreasing trend and at last becomes stable acknowledgements this research was supported by the national science foundation of china grant nos

22099,hydrodynamic effects have a significant impact on the seismic performance of deep water bridges in reservoir currently three dimensional numerical fluid structure interaction models are widely used for seismic analysis of such bridges with huge computational time in this paper endurance time analysis eta was used as an alternative approach to reduce the simulation effect the effectiveness and accuracy of this approach were studied by comparing with incremental dynamic analysis ida firstly an iterative method based on spectral modification techniques of ground motions was proposed in order to reduce the computational time in developing the endurance time acceleration functions etafs then the generated etafs compatible with chinese seismic code were validated with ida curves using a coupled water pier numerical system based on potential based fluid elements finally a typical deep water bridge in a reservoir was selected as a case study and was modeled by a three dimensional solid element model to investigate the seismic responses of bridges at different water depths the accuracy of added mass method with fiber based beam column element models was also evaluated it can be concluded that the proposed method for generating the etafs is an efficient alternative method and the endurance time method can provide sufficiently accurate estimation of hydrodynamic effects keywords hydrodynamic deep water bridge endurance time method ground motion modification incremental dynamic analysis potential based fluid element 1 introduction in the past decades a large number of deep water highway bridges have been constructed in reservoirs in order to facilitate the people and diminish the impact of the reservoirs on traffic li and yang 2013 zhang et al 2019 many of these bridges are located in seismic active zones of western china when strong earthquakes take place the fluid structure interaction fsi between the piers and surrounding water under seismic loadings may not only alter the dynamic properties of structures but also affect the seismic structural responses significantly which may be harmful to the seismic safety of bridges wei et al 2013 pang et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 a famous example is the severely damaged miaoziping highway bridge in a reservoir guan et al 2017 during the 2008 wenchuan earthquake mw 8 0 therefore it is extremely important to evaluate the hydrodynamic effect on the seismic performance of deep water highway bridges in order to study the hydrodynamic effect of deep water bridges many appropriate methods has been developed to model the fsi to date there are two main methods in the existing literatures namely full scale two or three dimensional 3d finite element models using the potential based fluid elements pbfes and analytical added mass models based on these two models various previous papers have been proposed to investigate the seismic performance of bridge piers and even the bridge systems for instance yang and li 2013 developed an expanded morison equation morison et al 1950 for calculating the added mass of both inner and outer water in order to study the hydrodynamic pressure of hollow piers wei et al 2013 conducted an experimental program to study the effects of fsi on dynamic responses of pile foundations the results from the tests were then applied to validate the three dimensional finite element model using the pbfes in software adina it was found that the pbfes are accuracy to reflect the complex dynamically induced fsi effect on the responses of pile foundations pang et al 2015 employed the fragility functions to study the effect of dynamic fsi on the seismic responses of a multi span deep water bridge with pile group foundations using a three dimensional pbfe based water foundation system to calculate the added mass jiang et al 2017 conducted the seismic fragility analysis of a deep water continuous rigid frame bridge using the added mass model it was concluded that the hydrodynamic pressure can enlarge the nonlinear deformation and increase the damage probability of the case piers wang et al 2018 and wang et al 2019 used the elliptical coordinates williams 1986 bhatta 2005 to drive the analytical solution and simplified formula on both hydrodynamic force and added mass of both hollow and elliptical cylinders zhang et al 2019 a carried out the numerical investigation into hydrodynamic effects on the seismic responses of a typical reservoir bridge under the effect of surface gravity waves considering both inner water and surrounding water based on the pbfes zhang et al 2019 b developed an efficient pbfes based numerical model to determine the hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section under earthquakes from these pervious results of the fsi analyses of piers and bridges in the existing literatures it can be found that a common regulation is hard to obtain to consider the effect of dynamic fsi although the added mass model has been widely used in the practices and researches to account for hydrodynamic effect due to its efficiency and simplicity the verification of added mass models is still limited in the linear seismic behavior of piers the validation of added mass model for the nonlinear seismic behavior of bridge piers with different section dimensions still needs plenty of works to be addressed compared with added mass models the pbfes are regarded as a better model to simulate the fsi effect on the nonlinear seismic behavior of piers wei et al 2013 pang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 a which have been successfully used in various seismic induced fsi problems bouaanani and lu 2009 wei et al 2013 deng et al 2017 thus it is essential to conduct the numerical simulations based on the pbfe models to investigate the effect of fsi on inelastic behavior and seismic performance of bridge piers however few studies have been found to deal with this problem due to huge computational burden nowadays the comprehensive assessment of seismic performance requires the estimation of both seismic response and structural capacity under the framework of the performance based earthquake engineering pbee the inter relationship between the seismic demand and capacity can be obtained by the incremental dynamic analysis ida luco and cornell 1998 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 however the ida requires a large number of nonlinear time history analyses which needs a huge computational effect especially when a complex 3d model based on the pbfes is implemented to estimate the hydrodynamic effect thus it needs an efficient method to reach a compromise between acceptable accuracy and computational efficiency the endurance time analysis eta is a newly developed method for seismic performance evaluation of structures estekanchi et al 2004 2007 riahi and estekanchi 2010 maleki amin and estekanchi 2018 mashayekhi et al 2019 commonly the eta only needs a few nonlinear time history analyses in order to estimate the seismic responses the computational time associated with this method is very attractive and thus can be applied as an efficient method for seismic evaluation of structures the eta has been successfully applied in different areas of seismic engineering such as the seismic assessment of steel frames estekanchi et al 2011 mashayekhi et al 2018 seismic fragility analysis of steel concentrically braced frames hariri ardebili et al 2014 quantification of the failure modes of dams hariri ardebili and saouma 2015 seismic pounding force estimation of bridges guo et al 2017 and seismic performance evaluation of soil structure system bai et al 2019 thus in this paper the eta was applied to improve the efficiency of seismic assessment of hydrodynamic effect in order to reduce the large computational effort furthermore due to the reason that the unconstrained optimization strategy for generating the eta acceleration functions is very time consuming an alternative method based on spectral modification techniques was proposed to reduce the computational effort based on the above considerations the present paper aims to address the questions with respect to the hydrodynamic effects and eta as following 1 eta acceleration functions were generated by using the ground motion modification techniques to compatible with chinese seismic design code 2 the effectiveness and accuracy of the eta for predicting hydrodynamic effects with generated eta acceleration functions were validated by comparing with ida method 3 the dynamic hydrodynamic effects on a multi span continuous girder highway bridge were analyzed using the eta and 4 the added mass model was validated by the eta at different intensity levels of ground motions 2 the endurance time analysis 2 1 the basic concept of eta the endurance time analysis eta is a dynamic pushover method which can estimate the seismic performance of structures through pre defined artificial accelerograms with increasing intensities riahi and estekanchi 2010 the main advantage of the eta over the regular nonlinear time history analyses and ida method is that it only needs small number of eta records to evaluate the seismic performance of structures the computational time of eta is extremely small when comparing to the computational burden of the ida method the eta accelerograms are artificially developed using the following scheme that both acceleration and displacement spectra are increasing with the time t as following 1 s a t t t t t arg e t s a t t 2 s d t t t t t arg e t s d t t t 2 4 π 2 where s a t t and s d t t are the acceleration and displacement spectra of eta records at time t respectively s at t t and s dt t t are target design spectra of acceleration and displacement t target is the target time for scaling the acceleration functions and t is the fundamental period of the structure considered in order to meet the requirements of above two equations unconstrained optimization procedures are usually formulated estekanchi et al 2007 2011 guo et al 2017 as follows 3 min f g t 0 t max 0 t max s a t t s a t t t 2 α s u t t s u t t t 2 d t d t in which f is the optimization target function g t is eta records α is a weight parameter in this paper only the acceleration response spectrum was used as the optimization target so that α was set to 0 however such optimization method for generating the eta accelerograms is very time consuming in order to reduce the computational time in developing the eta records the current paper proposed a simply alternative method based on the ground motion modification or spectral matching technique 2 2 developing of eta records in this paper the spectral matching technique was used to facilitate the generation of eta acceleration functions the spectral matching is an algorithm that modifies the spectral response of a ground motion time history a t to match a target spectrum for various pairs of period and damping in the time domain the original program was developed by lilhanand and tseng 1988 and improved by abrahamson 1992 to better maintain the non stationarity properties of the seed records hancock 2006 released an updated version of the program rspmatch2005 which can improve the convergence and reduce the displacement drift in the modified time histories the proposed simple procedures is given as following based on the spectral matching developed by hancock 2006 for generating the eta waves 1 generate a stationary random acceleration function g t using dt 0 01 s and n 3000 steps with a total duration of 30 s 2 convert the acceleration function to have non stationary property and filter the frequency content of random acceleration function in order to resemble real ground motions using the fourier transformation and filter functions 3 adjust the acceleration function to form the initial eta record by using a linear profile function l t t 10 in order to make the acceleration intensity at various time intervals 4 compute the response spectrum r i t of initial eta record with different durations and define the target spectrum qi t over the period range from 0 to 4 s at 5 damping level in this study i 1 2 and 3 meaning that three different durations considered 5 scale the initial eta waves to compatible with target spectrum by the calculated scaling factor sf which is estimated by minimize the difference between the response spectra and target spectra in the step 4 using the following equation 4 s f j w t j ln q i t j r i t j j w t j where w is a weight function for different period points j is the number of the period points used 6 modify the initial eta wave with different durations independently by adding the corrected tapered cosine wavelets abrahamson 1992 in the specific time domain to match the corresponding target spectra in the present paper this step was implemented using the program rspmatch2005 through a proposed iteration methodology as shown in fig 1 in this iterative method the modified acceleration functions at specified duration ranges from last step are combined to form an eta wave for the next step of modification as shown in fig 2 note that it only need 3 or 4 iteration to obtain reasonable results to form the final eta wave in the current paper the design target spectrum in the seismic design code of highway bridges in china jtg t b02 01 2008 was applied for the developing the eta record as following 5 s a t t s max 5 5 t 0 45 t 0 1 s s max 0 01 s t t g s max t g t t t g where t g is the characteristic period of the site s max is the peak acceleration in order to generate the eta records three seismic hazard levels namely 10 50yr 5 50yr and 2 50yr were adopted according to different time domains or durations namely 0 10s 0 20s or 0 30s of eta wave separately the initial eta wave was scaled and then implemented for iterative spectral matching until a good quality of eta wave was reached an example of generated eta record is shown in fig 3 from fig 3 it can be seen that the response spectra with three durations were well compatible with three target spectra indicating that the proposed method is able to generate the eta acceleration functions moreover it only took only 15 min for modifying one ground motion to match the target spectrum the total time using 4 iterations of the proposed method took 3 h for generating one eta record which is very efficiency compared to about one week by original optimization procedures noted that it should be paid attention to the spectrum inconsistency at some periods of eta records caused by the proposed method in some cases which may have an impact on the accuracy of eta method 3 validation of the eta method for hydrodynamic effects in this study incremental dynamic analysis ida was used as a basis to validate the efficiency and accuracy of generated eta records by the proposed method for predicting the hydrodynamic effects on the seismic performance of a 3d coupled water pier system in order to achieve this objective a case pier submerged in a reservoir was selected and modeled using the pbfes to simulate the deep water then ida was conducted for this finite element model with a suite of ground motions the results from ida and eta were compared to indicate the feasibility of eta application for seismically induced fsi problem 3 1 the case pier water system a main pier of a multi span continuous girder bridge in a reservoir in the active seismic zone near wenchuan earthquake area was selected as the case structure this pier has a height of 35 0 m and normal water depth is 21 0 m the pier is made of reinforced concrete with a rectangular section with a dimension of 5 3 m the thickness of concrete cover for all pier sections is 0 2 m the ratio of longitudinal reinforcements is 1 5 transverse stirrups ratio 1 0 and axial load ratio 15 the effect of soil structure interaction was neglected due to the rock foundation of the bridge the 3d finite element model of the case bridge pier with surrounding water was established in software adina the 3d 8 node solid elements were applied for modeling the pier while the 3d 8 node pbfes were used for simulate the water as shown in fig 4 the meshes for both pier and water produced a total of 81 900 elements the pbfes were based on the ψ u theory in which u is the structural displacement and ψ is the fluid velocity potential of fluid olson and bathe 1985 wei et al 2013 under the assumption that the fluid is inviscid compressible and irrotational the velocity potential ψ meets the following wave equations 6 2 ψ 1 c 2 2 ψ t 2 in which c is velocity of compression waves in water and t equals time in this study the water was simulated as compressible fluid with a mass density of 1000 kg m3 and compression waves of 1440 m s in this coupled water pier system the interface between pier and water was achieved by balancing the velocity and pressure at the interface between water and pier which can be shown in the following olson and bathe 1985 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 7 m s 0 0 m w u ψ c s c s w c w s 0 u ψ k s 0 0 k w u ψ m s u g t c w s u g t where m s and m w are mass matrices for pier and water respectively k s and k w are stiffness matrices for pier and water respectively c s is the rayleigh damping matrix for pier c sw and c ws are water pier interaction matrix ü g t is the time history acceleration of selected ground motion in order to avoid the effect of water boundary on the seismic responses of pier two ways were applied in the finite element model a the water domain was set to be large enough namely 100 100 in this study and b the lateral boundary was set to be infinite for the simplicity the shape of the reservoir was not included in finite element model so that the rigid wall boundary was used at the bottom of the water if the reservoir bed is sand or clay then the soil flexibility should be considered in the finite element model by using either 3d solid elements with various geotechnical models yohchia and krauthammer 1989 or 1d elastic soil springs wei et al 2015 in adina in the pier modeling the concrete model of bathe et al 1989 were adopted in the 3d solid elements to simulate the nonlinear behavior of core concrete the parameters in concrete model peak strength peak strain ultimate strength and ultimate strain were calculated using the commonly used mander model mander et al 1988 as 40 mpa 0 033 32 mpa and 0 008 both the longitudinal and transverse reinforcements were modeled by the truss elements embedded in the solid elements in which the bilinear elastic plastic material model with strain hardening was used the yield stress of 435 mpa and 335 mpa were assigned respectively for longitudinal reinforced steel and transverse stirrups the elastic modulus of 200 gpa and strain hardening ratio of 0 01 were adopted for all reinforcements fig 5 shows the material models with the fully nonlinear stress strain relationship considered in the present paper in order to validate this nonlinear structural finite element model the nonlinear beam column elements with the fiber sections were implemented in the software opensees fig 6 illustrates the comparison of seismic responses between two nonlinear finite element models from this figure it can be obvious that the 3d solid elements with embedded truss elements can be capable of capturing the nonlinear dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete pier 3 2 ground motion records and ida in order to conduct the ida a suite of 40 un scaled ground motions were selected from the peer nga strong ground motion database which was developed by baker et al 2011 for rock site of california with mw 7 and rrup 10 km the target design spectrum was defined by eq 5 using only 5 50yr seismic hazard level the selected 40 ground motions were scaled to match the target spectrum over the period range from 0 2t 1 to 1 5t 1 t 1 is the fundamental period of pier the individual spectral acceleration of scaled ground motions and the corresponding mean spectrum were given in fig 7 it was found from this figure that the mean spectrum of the 40 selected ground motions matches the target spectrum well the ida requires a series of nonlinear time history analyses to express the relationship between the engineering demand parameters edps and intensity measure im of the ground motions in the present paper the s a t 1 5 was selected as the im since it was found to be well correlated with edps of bridges guo et al 2017 and the etafs were developed based on the spectral acceleration moreover it was found by hariri ardebili et al 2014 that the s a t 1 5 provides a better im for eta curves than the pga note that if another im e g hysteretic energy other than the spectral acceleration is considered in the eta method then a new simulation procedure should be proposed to include the compatibility of this im in the eta record mashayekhi et al 2018 in order to conduct the ida the top displacement and acceleration of the pier were chosen as edps seismic excitations for all 40 ground motions were applied for the water pier system at y axes direction as shown in fig 4 in the ida analysis s a t 1 5 was adjusted from 0 1 g to 0 81 g with an increment 0 05 g in order to cover a large range elastic and inelastic of seismic behavior of pier the cubic spline interpolation was also applied to obtain the complete ida curves 3 3 comparison between ida and eta methods the eta and ida methods are two different types of methods for structural dynamic analysis thus it is important to establish a comparable criterion to compare these two methods in this criterion the ida curve can be transferred to a form similar as the eta results the following equation was used in the present paper to transfer the sa t1 to the equivalent endurance time 8 t e q α m s a i t t t arg e t s a t t in which t eq is the equivalent endurance time of the ida α m and s ai t are scale factor and the spectral acceleration of ida curve respectively t target is the target time in the eta records which was adopted as 20 s due to the reason that the response spectrum of eta wave matches the target spectrum at 20 s after the transfer of ida curves the median ida curve under 40 ground motions were employed for comparison with average eta results which were obtained using three eta records for the sake of studying the effectiveness of eta method for estimating the hydrodynamic effect seismic responses in terms of displacement and acceleration of top pier from both ida and eta methods were compared for no water condition and different water depths 21 m and 35 m as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be depicted that the eta curves have jagged lines in which the seismic responses are constant over a specific time duration this is because the maximum seismic responses of eta records remain the same over a specific time interval during the nonlinear time history analysis due to the intensifying property of both eta and ida methods the continuous increasing tendency can be found in both median curve of eta and ida curves moreover it can be observed from fig 8 that the average eta curve coincides well with the median ida curve for both acceleration and displacement indicating that the eta method with the proposed iterative method to develop the eta records is an appropriate method to accurately estimate the hydrodynamic effect for different water depths in addition it should be noted that although the eta is generally efficiency for predict the hydrodynamic effect of piers small difference can be observed between eta and ida especially at high intensity levels when the endurance time exceeds 20s for both top displacement and acceleration of the pier this phenomenon may be attributed to the large inelastic behavior caused by eta wave when the endurance time is large even so the small difference can be still acceptable for eta method due to the complexity of the seismically induced hydrodynamic problem in order to better illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method the seismic fragility analysis was also conducted in this paper based on both eta and ida analysis four damage states namely slight moderate extensive and complete were adopted the limit state values of these four damage states were defined in terms of the maximum drift ratio of the pier according to the previous studies kowalsky 2000 hwang et al 2001 billah and alam 2014 as shown in table 1 the reference fragility curves were developed based on the discrete ida points using the simplified fitting method proposed by baker 2015 the procedure of developing the fragility curves using the eta method was based on the previous studies rahimi and estekanchi 2015 due to the reason that the eta underestimates the record to record variability an approximate recommended fragility dispersion 0 4 was used for the generation of fragility curves according the existing literature basim and estekanchi 2015 fig 9 shows the comparison of fragility between bridge piers with 21 water depth between proposed eta and ida methods at four damage states it can be seen from this figure that the proposed eta method can accurately estimate the fragility curves of bridge piers under hydrodynamic effect 4 bridge structure and finite element model 4 1 bridge information after validating the eta method a typical highway bridge in reservoir was selected for investigating the hydrodynamic effect this selected bridge is located in west sichuan province in china which represents a typical deep water highway bridge constructed in reservoir it is a four span continuous concrete box girder highway bridge with seat type abutment and supported by single column piers with a height of 35 m the middle spans of this four span bridge are 80 m long and 15 5 m wide while the end spans are 50 m long the three piers have 5 3 m rectangular solid section reinforced with 36 mm diameter longitudinal bars and 16 diameter transverse stirrups at a space 300 mm the piers are supported on pile shaft foundation while the abutments are supported on the pile foundation the elastomeric bearings are placed on the pier and abutments using masonry plates with anchor bolts the designed water level is 21 m 4 2 finite element model a 3d nonlinear finite element model for the selected bridge configuration as shown in fig 10 was built in the finite element software adina in order to reach a compromise between the accuracy and computational time for bridge piers 3d solid finite elements were adopted in order to consider the effect of sectional geometry on the hydrodynamic responses accurately the truss elements were embedded in the solid elements to simulate the longitudinal reinforcements and transverse stirrups the material models for both concrete and steel were the same as described in section 3 1 for the superstructure modeling since damage is not expected in the seismic loadings the bridge girder and deck were simulated by the linear elastic beam elements the elastic modulus of the superstructure was set to 2 78 104 mpa for modeling of the abutment different models were applied at both longitudinal and transverse directions the active action of abutment including the resistance of abutment piles was considered at both directions by using the multilinear plastic models the passive soil pressure was only considered at longitudinal direction by using the beam elements with axial rigidity the model properties of the abutments are provided in table 2 for the bearing modeling a truss element with bilinear elastic plastic material was adopted to simulate the mechanical behavior of elastomeric bearings the modeling parameters and formulas of elastomeric bearings are summarized in table 3 the constraint equations were used to link the truss elements to the girder and pier nodes the detailed information of bearing modeling can be found in fig 10 moreover nonlinear elastic springs were adopted to model the impact between the girder and the abutment a small value was set in the first stiffness of nonlinear elastic material to model the gap of the expansion joint the second stiffness was set to simulate the impact stiffness which is determined by the axial stiffness of bridge decks as 8 38 109 n m after the modeling of the whole bridge a modal analysis was conducted and the first five periods of the case bridge were 2 05s 1 57s 1 34s 0 92s and 0 72s respectively 5 results and discussion to date the seismic design for the highway bridges in reservoir does not include hydrodynamic effect or simply uses convenient added mass model to include the effect of deep water thus it is important to investigate the hydrodynamic effect on the seismic responses of piers and other bridge components and also evaluate the efficiency of added mass model in predicting the hydrodynamic effect usually it can be solved by 3d solid finite element models based on pbfes which requires huge computational time thus in the following sections the results from eta method are presented to demonstrate the hydrodynamic effect in an efficient way 5 1 hydrodynamic effect on bridge piers in this section the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect of bridge piers is considered through the eta method four edps were selected and monitored during eta analysis namely displacement curvature shear and moment along the height of piers these four edps have been considered by previous researches padgett et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 pang et al 2019 as important edps to characterize the seismic performance of bridge piers fig 11 illustrates the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect on seismic responses of bridge piers at various water depths namely 0 m 7 m 14 m 21 m 28 m and 35 m a displacement b curvature c shear force and d bending moment in fig 11 the seismic responses were obtained at an endurance time of 20 s at which time the sa t1 was 0 33 g it can be observed from this figure that all seismic responses considered increased with the water depths generally while the top displacement and base curvature were increased by approximately 10 at a water depth of 21 m and by around 15 at a water depth of 35 m the shear force and bending moment were increased by about 20 at a water depth of 21 m and by nearly 30 at a water depth of 35 m this finding is conformed to the previous studies pang et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 indicating that the eta is reasonable for predicting the hydrodynamic effect on bridge piers 5 2 hydrodynamic effect on bridge components although many previous paper studied the hydrodynamic effect on bridge piers few previous studies have been proposed to investigate the hydrodynamic effect of different bridge components thus in this section four bridge components were selected namely bridge pier bearings abutment and its embankment soil in both active and passive actions in order to investigate the hydrodynamic effect on different bridge components these four components were widely used in seismic fragility analysis and performance evaluation of bridges nielson and desroches 2007 padgett et al 2008 pang et al 2014 to represent the influence of deep water on the seismic responses of bridges using the eta method nonlinear time history analyses of the case bridge with and without water were conducted using three generated eta records for the sake of simplicity the hydrodynamic effect is calculated by using a dimensionless dispersion parameter in terms of different edps which is defined as 9 β d e d p i w a t e r e d p i n o w a t e r e d p i n o w a t e r in which β d is the dispersion parameter edp i water and edp i nowater are the ith selected engineering demand parameters with and without water moreover as seen in the above section the original eta curves of bridge piers are usually jagged lines thus in this paper gaussian process regression model rasmussen and williams 2006 was adopted to reduce the serrated shapes and get smooth eta curves and corresponding β d curves fig 12 depicts the dispersions β d of seismic responses of four components a pier b bearing c abutment active action and d abutment in passive action from fig 12 it can be found that the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect had different impacts on four considered components due to its complexity compared to other components the bridge pier was found to be more sensitive to hydrodynamic effects this finding explains the reason why various previous studies were focused at the hydrodynamic effect of bridge piers it can be also seen from the figure that hydrodynamic effects at different water depths were highly correlate with the endurance times or seismic intensities for example the top displacement of bridge pier with water depth of 14 m increased 4 7 at endurance time of 10 s and increased 8 6 at 21 s while the bearing displacement increased by 7 1 at 15 s for 21 m water and increased by 4 2 at 25 s this phenomenon was caused by the different amplitude and spectral characteristic of eta record at different endurance times note that the positive value of β d means the increasing of seismic response while the negative value of β d implies the reduction of seismic response the positive β d values of pier bearing and the abutment in active action in fig 12 indicate that seismic responses of these three components increased while the negative β d values are observed in the time range 19 s 26 s implying that seismic responses of abutment in passive action reduced in this time range the maximum influence over the full range of endurance time can also be observed for different bridge components about 20 for pier 10 for both bearing and abutment in active action and 7 for abutment in passive action these observations are extremely useful for the engineers to design deep water bridge in engineering practice when dealing with the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect furthermore the application of eta method is effective to find the sensitive component to hydrodynamic effect as shown in fig 10 the seismic capacity of which should be improved during the period of seismic design for instance when the designed endurance time is smaller than 20 s and the designed water depth is 21 m then the components of both bridge pier and abutment in active action should be enhanced 5 3 evaluation of existing added mass model in practical engineering the added mass model is widely used for assessing the hydrodynamic effect due to its simplicity and convenience in this section the added mass model was evaluated using the eta method in order to achieve this goal a nonlinear fiber based beam column model of the example bridge was built in the open source software opensees mckenna et al 2008 as shown in fig 13 then the added mass was lumped at the nodes below the water level which was calculated using the following equations li and yang 2013 10 m a c m π ρ b 2 4 1 5 b h w 2 1 exp 10 z j h w b h w 1 3 11 c m 1 51 b l 0 17 in which m a is the added mass per unit length b and l are width and length of the rectangular section respectively c m is the shape factor and z j is the vertical coordinate of node j fig 14 shows the comparison of both the added mass and pbfe models for estimation of seismic responses of bridge piers in this comparison five different water depths of 7 14 21 28 and 35 m and six different endurance time of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 were adopted it is clear from the comparison of pbfes and added mass model in fig 14 that the added mass model is reasonable for predicting the displacement and curvature demands of pier but fails to estimate the shear forces and bending moments thus it can be concluded that although small difference can be observed the added mass model can be still implemented as an alternative and simply approach for displacement based fast seismic performance assessment of bridge piers note that this conclusion is consistent with the recent study by zhang et al 2019 which indicates that the eta method can be implemented for validating the added mass model 6 conclusions this paper presents a study of the potential and effectiveness of the eta method for estimating the seismic induced hydrodynamic effect of highway bridges in reservoir firstly an iterative method based on the spectral modifications of ground motion was proposed to generate the endurance time acceleration functions etafs in order to reduce the computational time then the generated etafs were validated with the results of ida using a 3d finite element model of water pier system based on potential based fluid elements finally a typical deep water highway bridge in a reservoir was selected to study the hydrodynamic effect of bridges at different water depths the following conclusions were summarized 1 the proposed method for generating eta records is simple and efficiency compared to the original optimization procedures this method facilitates the generation of eta records for different target spectrum 2 although small difference can be found between eta and ida methods especially at high intensity levels or large endurance time the eta method is found to be effectiveness and accuracy in some extent for predicting the hydrodynamic effect 3 the eta method can be applied for estimating the hydrodynamic effect of deep water bridges and sensitive components which is extremely helpful for engineers and researchers to rapid assessment of seismic performance of deep water bridges 4 the fiber beam column element based finite element models with added mass model are validated with the pbfe model using the eta method which can be used instead of the pbfe models for displacement based seismic assessment of bridges although the application of the proposed eta method significantly reduces the computational effort of hydrodynamic problems it does involve some challenges and future works as following 1 testing the efficiency of the use of different ims for the eta method in predicting the seismic performance of structures 2 improving the current methodology

target spectra e g uniform hazard spectrum and conditional mean spectrum on eta method and the bias between the multiple strip analysis and eta method acknowledgements the financial support by natural science foundation of china 51708527 is greatly appreciated by the authors 
22099,hydrodynamic effects have a significant impact on the seismic performance of deep water bridges in reservoir currently three dimensional numerical fluid structure interaction models are widely used for seismic analysis of such bridges with huge computational time in this paper endurance time analysis eta was used as an alternative approach to reduce the simulation effect the effectiveness and accuracy of this approach were studied by comparing with incremental dynamic analysis ida firstly an iterative method based on spectral modification techniques of ground motions was proposed in order to reduce the computational time in developing the endurance time acceleration functions etafs then the generated etafs compatible with chinese seismic code were validated with ida curves using a coupled water pier numerical system based on potential based fluid elements finally a typical deep water bridge in a reservoir was selected as a case study and was modeled by a three dimensional solid element model to investigate the seismic responses of bridges at different water depths the accuracy of added mass method with fiber based beam column element models was also evaluated it can be concluded that the proposed method for generating the etafs is an efficient alternative method and the endurance time method can provide sufficiently accurate estimation of hydrodynamic effects keywords hydrodynamic deep water bridge endurance time method ground motion modification incremental dynamic analysis potential based fluid element 1 introduction in the past decades a large number of deep water highway bridges have been constructed in reservoirs in order to facilitate the people and diminish the impact of the reservoirs on traffic li and yang 2013 zhang et al 2019 many of these bridges are located in seismic active zones of western china when strong earthquakes take place the fluid structure interaction fsi between the piers and surrounding water under seismic loadings may not only alter the dynamic properties of structures but also affect the seismic structural responses significantly which may be harmful to the seismic safety of bridges wei et al 2013 pang et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 a famous example is the severely damaged miaoziping highway bridge in a reservoir guan et al 2017 during the 2008 wenchuan earthquake mw 8 0 therefore it is extremely important to evaluate the hydrodynamic effect on the seismic performance of deep water highway bridges in order to study the hydrodynamic effect of deep water bridges many appropriate methods has been developed to model the fsi to date there are two main methods in the existing literatures namely full scale two or three dimensional 3d finite element models using the potential based fluid elements pbfes and analytical added mass models based on these two models various previous papers have been proposed to investigate the seismic performance of bridge piers and even the bridge systems for instance yang and li 2013 developed an expanded morison equation morison et al 1950 for calculating the added mass of both inner and outer water in order to study the hydrodynamic pressure of hollow piers wei et al 2013 conducted an experimental program to study the effects of fsi on dynamic responses of pile foundations the results from the tests were then applied to validate the three dimensional finite element model using the pbfes in software adina it was found that the pbfes are accuracy to reflect the complex dynamically induced fsi effect on the responses of pile foundations pang et al 2015 employed the fragility functions to study the effect of dynamic fsi on the seismic responses of a multi span deep water bridge with pile group foundations using a three dimensional pbfe based water foundation system to calculate the added mass jiang et al 2017 conducted the seismic fragility analysis of a deep water continuous rigid frame bridge using the added mass model it was concluded that the hydrodynamic pressure can enlarge the nonlinear deformation and increase the damage probability of the case piers wang et al 2018 and wang et al 2019 used the elliptical coordinates williams 1986 bhatta 2005 to drive the analytical solution and simplified formula on both hydrodynamic force and added mass of both hollow and elliptical cylinders zhang et al 2019 a carried out the numerical investigation into hydrodynamic effects on the seismic responses of a typical reservoir bridge under the effect of surface gravity waves considering both inner water and surrounding water based on the pbfes zhang et al 2019 b developed an efficient pbfes based numerical model to determine the hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section under earthquakes from these pervious results of the fsi analyses of piers and bridges in the existing literatures it can be found that a common regulation is hard to obtain to consider the effect of dynamic fsi although the added mass model has been widely used in the practices and researches to account for hydrodynamic effect due to its efficiency and simplicity the verification of added mass models is still limited in the linear seismic behavior of piers the validation of added mass model for the nonlinear seismic behavior of bridge piers with different section dimensions still needs plenty of works to be addressed compared with added mass models the pbfes are regarded as a better model to simulate the fsi effect on the nonlinear seismic behavior of piers wei et al 2013 pang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 a which have been successfully used in various seismic induced fsi problems bouaanani and lu 2009 wei et al 2013 deng et al 2017 thus it is essential to conduct the numerical simulations based on the pbfe models to investigate the effect of fsi on inelastic behavior and seismic performance of bridge piers however few studies have been found to deal with this problem due to huge computational burden nowadays the comprehensive assessment of seismic performance requires the estimation of both seismic response and structural capacity under the framework of the performance based earthquake engineering pbee the inter relationship between the seismic demand and capacity can be obtained by the incremental dynamic analysis ida luco and cornell 1998 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 however the ida requires a large number of nonlinear time history analyses which needs a huge computational effect especially when a complex 3d model based on the pbfes is implemented to estimate the hydrodynamic effect thus it needs an efficient method to reach a compromise between acceptable accuracy and computational efficiency the endurance time analysis eta is a newly developed method for seismic performance evaluation of structures estekanchi et al 2004 2007 riahi and estekanchi 2010 maleki amin and estekanchi 2018 mashayekhi et al 2019 commonly the eta only needs a few nonlinear time history analyses in order to estimate the seismic responses the computational time associated with this method is very attractive and thus can be applied as an efficient method for seismic evaluation of structures the eta has been successfully applied in different areas of seismic engineering such as the seismic assessment of steel frames estekanchi et al 2011 mashayekhi et al 2018 seismic fragility analysis of steel concentrically braced frames hariri ardebili et al 2014 quantification of the failure modes of dams hariri ardebili and saouma 2015 seismic pounding force estimation of bridges guo et al 2017 and seismic performance evaluation of soil structure system bai et al 2019 thus in this paper the eta was applied to improve the efficiency of seismic assessment of hydrodynamic effect in order to reduce the large computational effort furthermore due to the reason that the unconstrained optimization strategy for generating the eta acceleration functions is very time consuming an alternative method based on spectral modification techniques was proposed to reduce the computational effort based on the above considerations the present paper aims to address the questions with respect to the hydrodynamic effects and eta as following 1 eta acceleration functions were generated by using the ground motion modification techniques to compatible with chinese seismic design code 2 the effectiveness and accuracy of the eta for predicting hydrodynamic effects with generated eta acceleration functions were validated by comparing with ida method 3 the dynamic hydrodynamic effects on a multi span continuous girder highway bridge were analyzed using the eta and 4 the added mass model was validated by the eta at different intensity levels of ground motions 2 the endurance time analysis 2 1 the basic concept of eta the endurance time analysis eta is a dynamic pushover method which can estimate the seismic performance of structures through pre defined artificial accelerograms with increasing intensities riahi and estekanchi 2010 the main advantage of the eta over the regular nonlinear time history analyses and ida method is that it only needs small number of eta records to evaluate the seismic performance of structures the computational time of eta is extremely small when comparing to the computational burden of the ida method the eta accelerograms are artificially developed using the following scheme that both acceleration and displacement spectra are increasing with the time t as following 1 s a t t t t t arg e t s a t t 2 s d t t t t t arg e t s d t t t 2 4 π 2 where s a t t and s d t t are the acceleration and displacement spectra of eta records at time t respectively s at t t and s dt t t are target design spectra of acceleration and displacement t target is the target time for scaling the acceleration functions and t is the fundamental period of the structure considered in order to meet the requirements of above two equations unconstrained optimization procedures are usually formulated estekanchi et al 2007 2011 guo et al 2017 as follows 3 min f g t 0 t max 0 t max s a t t s a t t t 2 α s u t t s u t t t 2 d t d t in which f is the optimization target function g t is eta records α is a weight parameter in this paper only the acceleration response spectrum was used as the optimization target so that α was set to 0 however such optimization method for generating the eta accelerograms is very time consuming in order to reduce the computational time in developing the eta records the current paper proposed a simply alternative method based on the ground motion modification or spectral matching technique 2 2 developing of eta records in this paper the spectral matching technique was used to facilitate the generation of eta acceleration functions the spectral matching is an algorithm that modifies the spectral response of a ground motion time history a t to match a target spectrum for various pairs of period and damping in the time domain the original program was developed by lilhanand and tseng 1988 and improved by abrahamson 1992 to better maintain the non stationarity properties of the seed records hancock 2006 released an updated version of the program rspmatch2005 which can improve the convergence and reduce the displacement drift in the modified time histories the proposed simple procedures is given as following based on the spectral matching developed by hancock 2006 for generating the eta waves 1 generate a stationary random acceleration function g t using dt 0 01 s and n 3000 steps with a total duration of 30 s 2 convert the acceleration function to have non stationary property and filter the frequency content of random acceleration function in order to resemble real ground motions using the fourier transformation and filter functions 3 adjust the acceleration function to form the initial eta record by using a linear profile function l t t 10 in order to make the acceleration intensity at various time intervals 4 compute the response spectrum r i t of initial eta record with different durations and define the target spectrum qi t over the period range from 0 to 4 s at 5 damping level in this study i 1 2 and 3 meaning that three different durations considered 5 scale the initial eta waves to compatible with target spectrum by the calculated scaling factor sf which is estimated by minimize the difference between the response spectra and target spectra in the step 4 using the following equation 4 s f j w t j ln q i t j r i t j j w t j where w is a weight function for different period points j is the number of the period points used 6 modify the initial eta wave with different durations independently by adding the corrected tapered cosine wavelets abrahamson 1992 in the specific time domain to match the corresponding target spectra in the present paper this step was implemented using the program rspmatch2005 through a proposed iteration methodology as shown in fig 1 in this iterative method the modified acceleration functions at specified duration ranges from last step are combined to form an eta wave for the next step of modification as shown in fig 2 note that it only need 3 or 4 iteration to obtain reasonable results to form the final eta wave in the current paper the design target spectrum in the seismic design code of highway bridges in china jtg t b02 01 2008 was applied for the developing the eta record as following 5 s a t t s max 5 5 t 0 45 t 0 1 s s max 0 01 s t t g s max t g t t t g where t g is the characteristic period of the site s max is the peak acceleration in order to generate the eta records three seismic hazard levels namely 10 50yr 5 50yr and 2 50yr were adopted according to different time domains or durations namely 0 10s 0 20s or 0 30s of eta wave separately the initial eta wave was scaled and then implemented for iterative spectral matching until a good quality of eta wave was reached an example of generated eta record is shown in fig 3 from fig 3 it can be seen that the response spectra with three durations were well compatible with three target spectra indicating that the proposed method is able to generate the eta acceleration functions moreover it only took only 15 min for modifying one ground motion to match the target spectrum the total time using 4 iterations of the proposed method took 3 h for generating one eta record which is very efficiency compared to about one week by original optimization procedures noted that it should be paid attention to the spectrum inconsistency at some periods of eta records caused by the proposed method in some cases which may have an impact on the accuracy of eta method 3 validation of the eta method for hydrodynamic effects in this study incremental dynamic analysis ida was used as a basis to validate the efficiency and accuracy of generated eta records by the proposed method for predicting the hydrodynamic effects on the seismic performance of a 3d coupled water pier system in order to achieve this objective a case pier submerged in a reservoir was selected and modeled using the pbfes to simulate the deep water then ida was conducted for this finite element model with a suite of ground motions the results from ida and eta were compared to indicate the feasibility of eta application for seismically induced fsi problem 3 1 the case pier water system a main pier of a multi span continuous girder bridge in a reservoir in the active seismic zone near wenchuan earthquake area was selected as the case structure this pier has a height of 35 0 m and normal water depth is 21 0 m the pier is made of reinforced concrete with a rectangular section with a dimension of 5 3 m the thickness of concrete cover for all pier sections is 0 2 m the ratio of longitudinal reinforcements is 1 5 transverse stirrups ratio 1 0 and axial load ratio 15 the effect of soil structure interaction was neglected due to the rock foundation of the bridge the 3d finite element model of the case bridge pier with surrounding water was established in software adina the 3d 8 node solid elements were applied for modeling the pier while the 3d 8 node pbfes were used for simulate the water as shown in fig 4 the meshes for both pier and water produced a total of 81 900 elements the pbfes were based on the ψ u theory in which u is the structural displacement and ψ is the fluid velocity potential of fluid olson and bathe 1985 wei et al 2013 under the assumption that the fluid is inviscid compressible and irrotational the velocity potential ψ meets the following wave equations 6 2 ψ 1 c 2 2 ψ t 2 in which c is velocity of compression waves in water and t equals time in this study the water was simulated as compressible fluid with a mass density of 1000 kg m3 and compression waves of 1440 m s in this coupled water pier system the interface between pier and water was achieved by balancing the velocity and pressure at the interface between water and pier which can be shown in the following olson and bathe 1985 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 7 m s 0 0 m w u ψ c s c s w c w s 0 u ψ k s 0 0 k w u ψ m s u g t c w s u g t where m s and m w are mass matrices for pier and water respectively k s and k w are stiffness matrices for pier and water respectively c s is the rayleigh damping matrix for pier c sw and c ws are water pier interaction matrix ü g t is the time history acceleration of selected ground motion in order to avoid the effect of water boundary on the seismic responses of pier two ways were applied in the finite element model a the water domain was set to be large enough namely 100 100 in this study and b the lateral boundary was set to be infinite for the simplicity the shape of the reservoir was not included in finite element model so that the rigid wall boundary was used at the bottom of the water if the reservoir bed is sand or clay then the soil flexibility should be considered in the finite element model by using either 3d solid elements with various geotechnical models yohchia and krauthammer 1989 or 1d elastic soil springs wei et al 2015 in adina in the pier modeling the concrete model of bathe et al 1989 were adopted in the 3d solid elements to simulate the nonlinear behavior of core concrete the parameters in concrete model peak strength peak strain ultimate strength and ultimate strain were calculated using the commonly used mander model mander et al 1988 as 40 mpa 0 033 32 mpa and 0 008 both the longitudinal and transverse reinforcements were modeled by the truss elements embedded in the solid elements in which the bilinear elastic plastic material model with strain hardening was used the yield stress of 435 mpa and 335 mpa were assigned respectively for longitudinal reinforced steel and transverse stirrups the elastic modulus of 200 gpa and strain hardening ratio of 0 01 were adopted for all reinforcements fig 5 shows the material models with the fully nonlinear stress strain relationship considered in the present paper in order to validate this nonlinear structural finite element model the nonlinear beam column elements with the fiber sections were implemented in the software opensees fig 6 illustrates the comparison of seismic responses between two nonlinear finite element models from this figure it can be obvious that the 3d solid elements with embedded truss elements can be capable of capturing the nonlinear dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete pier 3 2 ground motion records and ida in order to conduct the ida a suite of 40 un scaled ground motions were selected from the peer nga strong ground motion database which was developed by baker et al 2011 for rock site of california with mw 7 and rrup 10 km the target design spectrum was defined by eq 5 using only 5 50yr seismic hazard level the selected 40 ground motions were scaled to match the target spectrum over the period range from 0 2t 1 to 1 5t 1 t 1 is the fundamental period of pier the individual spectral acceleration of scaled ground motions and the corresponding mean spectrum were given in fig 7 it was found from this figure that the mean spectrum of the 40 selected ground motions matches the target spectrum well the ida requires a series of nonlinear time history analyses to express the relationship between the engineering demand parameters edps and intensity measure im of the ground motions in the present paper the s a t 1 5 was selected as the im since it was found to be well correlated with edps of bridges guo et al 2017 and the etafs were developed based on the spectral acceleration moreover it was found by hariri ardebili et al 2014 that the s a t 1 5 provides a better im for eta curves than the pga note that if another im e g hysteretic energy other than the spectral acceleration is considered in the eta method then a new simulation procedure should be proposed to include the compatibility of this im in the eta record mashayekhi et al 2018 in order to conduct the ida the top displacement and acceleration of the pier were chosen as edps seismic excitations for all 40 ground motions were applied for the water pier system at y axes direction as shown in fig 4 in the ida analysis s a t 1 5 was adjusted from 0 1 g to 0 81 g with an increment 0 05 g in order to cover a large range elastic and inelastic of seismic behavior of pier the cubic spline interpolation was also applied to obtain the complete ida curves 3 3 comparison between ida and eta methods the eta and ida methods are two different types of methods for structural dynamic analysis thus it is important to establish a comparable criterion to compare these two methods in this criterion the ida curve can be transferred to a form similar as the eta results the following equation was used in the present paper to transfer the sa t1 to the equivalent endurance time 8 t e q α m s a i t t t arg e t s a t t in which t eq is the equivalent endurance time of the ida α m and s ai t are scale factor and the spectral acceleration of ida curve respectively t target is the target time in the eta records which was adopted as 20 s due to the reason that the response spectrum of eta wave matches the target spectrum at 20 s after the transfer of ida curves the median ida curve under 40 ground motions were employed for comparison with average eta results which were obtained using three eta records for the sake of studying the effectiveness of eta method for estimating the hydrodynamic effect seismic responses in terms of displacement and acceleration of top pier from both ida and eta methods were compared for no water condition and different water depths 21 m and 35 m as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be depicted that the eta curves have jagged lines in which the seismic responses are constant over a specific time duration this is because the maximum seismic responses of eta records remain the same over a specific time interval during the nonlinear time history analysis due to the intensifying property of both eta and ida methods the continuous increasing tendency can be found in both median curve of eta and ida curves moreover it can be observed from fig 8 that the average eta curve coincides well with the median ida curve for both acceleration and displacement indicating that the eta method with the proposed iterative method to develop the eta records is an appropriate method to accurately estimate the hydrodynamic effect for different water depths in addition it should be noted that although the eta is generally efficiency for predict the hydrodynamic effect of piers small difference can be observed between eta and ida especially at high intensity levels when the endurance time exceeds 20s for both top displacement and acceleration of the pier this phenomenon may be attributed to the large inelastic behavior caused by eta wave when the endurance time is large even so the small difference can be still acceptable for eta method due to the complexity of the seismically induced hydrodynamic problem in order to better illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method the seismic fragility analysis was also conducted in this paper based on both eta and ida analysis four damage states namely slight moderate extensive and complete were adopted the limit state values of these four damage states were defined in terms of the maximum drift ratio of the pier according to the previous studies kowalsky 2000 hwang et al 2001 billah and alam 2014 as shown in table 1 the reference fragility curves were developed based on the discrete ida points using the simplified fitting method proposed by baker 2015 the procedure of developing the fragility curves using the eta method was based on the previous studies rahimi and estekanchi 2015 due to the reason that the eta underestimates the record to record variability an approximate recommended fragility dispersion 0 4 was used for the generation of fragility curves according the existing literature basim and estekanchi 2015 fig 9 shows the comparison of fragility between bridge piers with 21 water depth between proposed eta and ida methods at four damage states it can be seen from this figure that the proposed eta method can accurately estimate the fragility curves of bridge piers under hydrodynamic effect 4 bridge structure and finite element model 4 1 bridge information after validating the eta method a typical highway bridge in reservoir was selected for investigating the hydrodynamic effect this selected bridge is located in west sichuan province in china which represents a typical deep water highway bridge constructed in reservoir it is a four span continuous concrete box girder highway bridge with seat type abutment and supported by single column piers with a height of 35 m the middle spans of this four span bridge are 80 m long and 15 5 m wide while the end spans are 50 m long the three piers have 5 3 m rectangular solid section reinforced with 36 mm diameter longitudinal bars and 16 diameter transverse stirrups at a space 300 mm the piers are supported on pile shaft foundation while the abutments are supported on the pile foundation the elastomeric bearings are placed on the pier and abutments using masonry plates with anchor bolts the designed water level is 21 m 4 2 finite element model a 3d nonlinear finite element model for the selected bridge configuration as shown in fig 10 was built in the finite element software adina in order to reach a compromise between the accuracy and computational time for bridge piers 3d solid finite elements were adopted in order to consider the effect of sectional geometry on the hydrodynamic responses accurately the truss elements were embedded in the solid elements to simulate the longitudinal reinforcements and transverse stirrups the material models for both concrete and steel were the same as described in section 3 1 for the superstructure modeling since damage is not expected in the seismic loadings the bridge girder and deck were simulated by the linear elastic beam elements the elastic modulus of the superstructure was set to 2 78 104 mpa for modeling of the abutment different models were applied at both longitudinal and transverse directions the active action of abutment including the resistance of abutment piles was considered at both directions by using the multilinear plastic models the passive soil pressure was only considered at longitudinal direction by using the beam elements with axial rigidity the model properties of the abutments are provided in table 2 for the bearing modeling a truss element with bilinear elastic plastic material was adopted to simulate the mechanical behavior of elastomeric bearings the modeling parameters and formulas of elastomeric bearings are summarized in table 3 the constraint equations were used to link the truss elements to the girder and pier nodes the detailed information of bearing modeling can be found in fig 10 moreover nonlinear elastic springs were adopted to model the impact between the girder and the abutment a small value was set in the first stiffness of nonlinear elastic material to model the gap of the expansion joint the second stiffness was set to simulate the impact stiffness which is determined by the axial stiffness of bridge decks as 8 38 109 n m after the modeling of the whole bridge a modal analysis was conducted and the first five periods of the case bridge were 2 05s 1 57s 1 34s 0 92s and 0 72s respectively 5 results and discussion to date the seismic design for the highway bridges in reservoir does not include hydrodynamic effect or simply uses convenient added mass model to include the effect of deep water thus it is important to investigate the hydrodynamic effect on the seismic responses of piers and other bridge components and also evaluate the efficiency of added mass model in predicting the hydrodynamic effect usually it can be solved by 3d solid finite element models based on pbfes which requires huge computational time thus in the following sections the results from eta method are presented to demonstrate the hydrodynamic effect in an efficient way 5 1 hydrodynamic effect on bridge piers in this section the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect of bridge piers is considered through the eta method four edps were selected and monitored during eta analysis namely displacement curvature shear and moment along the height of piers these four edps have been considered by previous researches padgett et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 pang et al 2019 as important edps to characterize the seismic performance of bridge piers fig 11 illustrates the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect on seismic responses of bridge piers at various water depths namely 0 m 7 m 14 m 21 m 28 m and 35 m a displacement b curvature c shear force and d bending moment in fig 11 the seismic responses were obtained at an endurance time of 20 s at which time the sa t1 was 0 33 g it can be observed from this figure that all seismic responses considered increased with the water depths generally while the top displacement and base curvature were increased by approximately 10 at a water depth of 21 m and by around 15 at a water depth of 35 m the shear force and bending moment were increased by about 20 at a water depth of 21 m and by nearly 30 at a water depth of 35 m this finding is conformed to the previous studies pang et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 indicating that the eta is reasonable for predicting the hydrodynamic effect on bridge piers 5 2 hydrodynamic effect on bridge components although many previous paper studied the hydrodynamic effect on bridge piers few previous studies have been proposed to investigate the hydrodynamic effect of different bridge components thus in this section four bridge components were selected namely bridge pier bearings abutment and its embankment soil in both active and passive actions in order to investigate the hydrodynamic effect on different bridge components these four components were widely used in seismic fragility analysis and performance evaluation of bridges nielson and desroches 2007 padgett et al 2008 pang et al 2014 to represent the influence of deep water on the seismic responses of bridges using the eta method nonlinear time history analyses of the case bridge with and without water were conducted using three generated eta records for the sake of simplicity the hydrodynamic effect is calculated by using a dimensionless dispersion parameter in terms of different edps which is defined as 9 β d e d p i w a t e r e d p i n o w a t e r e d p i n o w a t e r in which β d is the dispersion parameter edp i water and edp i nowater are the ith selected engineering demand parameters with and without water moreover as seen in the above section the original eta curves of bridge piers are usually jagged lines thus in this paper gaussian process regression model rasmussen and williams 2006 was adopted to reduce the serrated shapes and get smooth eta curves and corresponding β d curves fig 12 depicts the dispersions β d of seismic responses of four components a pier b bearing c abutment active action and d abutment in passive action from fig 12 it can be found that the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect had different impacts on four considered components due to its complexity compared to other components the bridge pier was found to be more sensitive to hydrodynamic effects this finding explains the reason why various previous studies were focused at the hydrodynamic effect of bridge piers it can be also seen from the figure that hydrodynamic effects at different water depths were highly correlate with the endurance times or seismic intensities for example the top displacement of bridge pier with water depth of 14 m increased 4 7 at endurance time of 10 s and increased 8 6 at 21 s while the bearing displacement increased by 7 1 at 15 s for 21 m water and increased by 4 2 at 25 s this phenomenon was caused by the different amplitude and spectral characteristic of eta record at different endurance times note that the positive value of β d means the increasing of seismic response while the negative value of β d implies the reduction of seismic response the positive β d values of pier bearing and the abutment in active action in fig 12 indicate that seismic responses of these three components increased while the negative β d values are observed in the time range 19 s 26 s implying that seismic responses of abutment in passive action reduced in this time range the maximum influence over the full range of endurance time can also be observed for different bridge components about 20 for pier 10 for both bearing and abutment in active action and 7 for abutment in passive action these observations are extremely useful for the engineers to design deep water bridge in engineering practice when dealing with the seismically induced hydrodynamic effect furthermore the application of eta method is effective to find the sensitive component to hydrodynamic effect as shown in fig 10 the seismic capacity of which should be improved during the period of seismic design for instance when the designed endurance time is smaller than 20 s and the designed water depth is 21 m then the components of both bridge pier and abutment in active action should be enhanced 5 3 evaluation of existing added mass model in practical engineering the added mass model is widely used for assessing the hydrodynamic effect due to its simplicity and convenience in this section the added mass model was evaluated using the eta method in order to achieve this goal a nonlinear fiber based beam column model of the example bridge was built in the open source software opensees mckenna et al 2008 as shown in fig 13 then the added mass was lumped at the nodes below the water level which was calculated using the following equations li and yang 2013 10 m a c m π ρ b 2 4 1 5 b h w 2 1 exp 10 z j h w b h w 1 3 11 c m 1 51 b l 0 17 in which m a is the added mass per unit length b and l are width and length of the rectangular section respectively c m is the shape factor and z j is the vertical coordinate of node j fig 14 shows the comparison of both the added mass and pbfe models for estimation of seismic responses of bridge piers in this comparison five different water depths of 7 14 21 28 and 35 m and six different endurance time of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 were adopted it is clear from the comparison of pbfes and added mass model in fig 14 that the added mass model is reasonable for predicting the displacement and curvature demands of pier but fails to estimate the shear forces and bending moments thus it can be concluded that although small difference can be observed the added mass model can be still implemented as an alternative and simply approach for displacement based fast seismic performance assessment of bridge piers note that this conclusion is consistent with the recent study by zhang et al 2019 which indicates that the eta method can be implemented for validating the added mass model 6 conclusions this paper presents a study of the potential and effectiveness of the eta method for estimating the seismic induced hydrodynamic effect of highway bridges in reservoir firstly an iterative method based on the spectral modifications of ground motion was proposed to generate the endurance time acceleration functions etafs in order to reduce the computational time then the generated etafs were validated with the results of ida using a 3d finite element model of water pier system based on potential based fluid elements finally a typical deep water highway bridge in a reservoir was selected to study the hydrodynamic effect of bridges at different water depths the following conclusions were summarized 1 the proposed method for generating eta records is simple and efficiency compared to the original optimization procedures this method facilitates the generation of eta records for different target spectrum 2 although small difference can be found between eta and ida methods especially at high intensity levels or large endurance time the eta method is found to be effectiveness and accuracy in some extent for predicting the hydrodynamic effect 3 the eta method can be applied for estimating the hydrodynamic effect of deep water bridges and sensitive components which is extremely helpful for engineers and researchers to rapid assessment of seismic performance of deep water bridges 4 the fiber beam column element based finite element models with added mass model are validated with the pbfe model using the eta method which can be used instead of the pbfe models for displacement based seismic assessment of bridges although the application of the proposed eta method significantly reduces the computational effort of hydrodynamic problems it does involve some challenges and future works as following 1 testing the efficiency of the use of different ims for the eta method in predicting the seismic performance of structures 2 improving the current methodology for the generation of etafs to simulate the characteristics of different types of earthquakes such as the near fault ground motions with pulse like shapes 3 investigating the effect of different target spectra e g uniform hazard spectrum and conditional mean spectrum on eta method and the bias between the multiple strip analysis and eta method acknowledgements the financial support by natural
