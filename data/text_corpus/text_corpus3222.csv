16110,this study examined the significance of propionate to acetate hpr hac ratios on microbial syntrophy and competition in microbial electrolysis cell assisted anaerobic digestion mec ad in addition to molecular biology and phylogenetic analysis a numerical mec ad model was developed by modifying anaerobic digestion model no 1 to predict the effects of different hpr hac ratios 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 5 the hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 maintained efficient syntrophy among electroactive bacteria hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens leading to higher methane yields in contrast higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 were detrimental to methanogenesis both microbial community analysis and numerical modeling results suggested that higher propionate levels could promote the enrichment of h2 utilizing acetogens thereby triggering their competition with hydrogenotrophic methanogens moreover protein fraction in extracellular polymeric substances and the relative expression of genes associated with extracellular electron transfer in both anode and cathode biofilms were markedly decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios indicating partial inhibition of microbial electroactivity overall these results illuminate deep insight into anaerobic syntrophy contributing to the process kinetics and methane yields in mec ad systems furthermore from a practical viewpoint the results can also be helpful in effective control of mec ad operation without propionate accumulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomethane electro assisted anaerobic digestion propionate to acetate ratio microbial syntrophy 1 introduction integrating microbial electrolysis cells mecs with anaerobic digestion ad is a promising approach to establish a kinetically efficient microbiome to improve biomethane recovery from organic wastes huang et al 2020 zakaria and dhar 2021a 2019 such electro assisted process configurations are called microbial electrolysis cell assisted anaerobic digestion mec ad in mec ad systems simple organics like acetate can be efficiently oxidized by anodic electroactive bacteria eab such as geobacter shewanella etc hari et al 2017 yang et al 2015 the released electrons are transferred to the anode via extracellular electron transfer eet on the cathode methanogens can utilize electrons or electrochemically produced h2 for methanogenesis when mec ad systems are fed with complex organics fermentation becomes essential for converting them to simple organic acids for utilization by anodic eab lin et al 2019 yang et al 2015 various volatile fatty acids vfas such as acetate butyrate and propionate are major fermentation products hari et al 2017 lin et al 2019 previous studies frequently reported the following vfas utilization sequence in mecs acetate butyrate propionate lin et al 2019 yang et al 2015 eab cannot directly oxidize propionate or butyrate hari et al 2017 2016a lin et al 2019 yang et al 2015 however propionate represents up to 35 of the carbon flow to methane in conventional digesters dyksma and gallert 2019 furthermore propionate accumulation was frequently associated with process disturbance or digester failure franke whittle et al 2014 gallert and winter 2008 several studies reported low current density from mecs fed with propionate torres et al 2007 yang et al 2015 propionate oxidation in mecs requires syntrophic interactions between fermenters and eab hari et al 2016b yang et al 2015 theoretically the gibbs free energy δg of the syntrophic propionate conversion to acetate h2 is endergonic 76 1 kj mol propionate hari et al 2017 therefore the accumulation of fermentation products acetate h2 would increase δg further making the reaction thermodynamically more unfavorable thus syntrophy among fermenters eab and hydrogenotrophic methanogens is required to maintain h2 partial pressure and acetate at low levels to allow propionate fermentation yasri et al 2019 despite many reports on conventional ad inhibition by propionate accumulation previous studies reported a wide range of inhibitory propionate concentrations franke whittle et al 2014 gallert and winter 2008 wang et al 2009 wang et al 2009 observed methanogenic inhibition at 900 mg l of propionate gallert and winter 2008 found propionate concentrations 20 mm 1480 mg l were detrimental to ad conversely another study suggested stable microbial communities for propionate concentration as high as 8741 mg l franke whittle et al 2014 in ad propionate is fermented to acetate h2 while shifting hpr hac ratios during the process franke whittle et al 2014 wagner et al 2014 high acetate levels resulting from propionate fermentation can retard the process via product inhibition gorris et al 1989 mawson et al 1991 wagner et al 2014 hpr hac ratios in feedstock also influence propionate degradation profiles and subsequent methanogenesis wagner et al 2014 therefore several studies highlighted the significance of hpr hac ratios in ad hill et al 1987 kor bicakci et al 2020 wagner et al 2014 for instance hill et al 1987 suggested that hpr hac ratios 1 4 would indicate impending digester failure wagner et al 2014 suggested that an hpr hac ratio of 0 5 would be critical for effective methanogenesis in ad these studies investigated hpr hac ratios of 0 25 4 in the feedstock however the detrimental hpr hac ratios in feedstock and their impact on microbial syntrophy have not been examined yet for mec ad the overall goal of this study was to attain detailed fundamental insights into the roles of hpr hac ratios on microbial syntrophy and competition in mec ad first the effects of different hpr hac ratios on the methane yields and vfas profiles were assessed second we performed a detailed characterization of microbial communities eet gene expression patterns and composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps to reveal the fundamentals behind the changes in methanogenesis performance finally we developed a numerical mec ad model by modifying anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 to simulate the effects of hpr hac ratios on methane yields and vfas degradation 2 methodology 2 1 mec ad configuration the experiment was conducted with a mec ad reactor manufactured from plexiglass the working volume and headspace volumes were 360 ml and 40 ml respectively carbon fibers 2293 a 24a fibre glast development corp usa with specific surface area 3609 m2 m3 considering every single filament in a bundle or 41 m2 m3 considering all filaments as a single fiber integrated with a stainless steel current collector and a stainless steel mesh 4 2 m2 m3 was used as anode and cathode electrodes respectively the specific surface areas were calculated as described elsewhere zakaria

anode electrode the anode potential was set at 0 4 v vs ag agcl using a potentiostat squidstat prime admiral instruments usa current and voltage were recorded every 4 8 min using the software associated with the potentiostat the reactor was operated at room temperature 21 1 c under continuous mixing 130 5 rpm 2 2 start up and operation the reactor was inoculated with ad sludge collected from the gold bar wastewater treatment plant edmonton ab canada and effluent from a mother mec operated with 25 mm sodium acetate during start up the reactor was operated under semi continuous mode with glucose medium 2235 31 mg cod l supplemented with 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 05 and trace minerals the trace minerals were added according to dhar et al 2013 after reaching the steady state current indicated by maximum peak current of 14 ma in multiple operating cycles the operation was switched to a fed batch mode for experiments under various hpr hac ratios at the beginning of each fed batch cycle the reactor was fed with a fresh substrate medium containing a mix of acetate hac propionate hpr and butyrate hbu as a carbon source however total vfas concentration was fixed at 2000 mg cod l the buffer and trace minerals remained the same as the glucose medium the major vfas produced during ad are mainly acetate propionate and butyrate franke whittle et al 2014 wagner et al 2014 therefore the substrate medium was prepared with these three vfas depending on the experimental conditions hpr hac ratios were varied while hbu concentration was fixed table 1 the fed batch cycle was continued until the current declined 2 ma then the substrate medium was replaced with a fresh medium for each hpr hac ratio several consecutive fed batch cycles were performed for 40 50 days before feeding the medium was flushed with nitrogen 99 99 for 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition 2 3 eps characterization various biofilm eps components carbohydrates proteins heme binding proteins uronic acid and edna were analyzed the detailed protocol of sample preparation eps extraction and characterization can be found elsewhere zakaria and dhar 2021a two eps extraction methods cation exchange resin and heating were used these two methods were highly efficient for eps extraction tan et al 2019 zakaria and dhar 2021a and could provide similar extraction efficiencies zakaria and dhar 2021a eps levels were presented as the mass of eps per unit electrode surface area mg cm2 2 4 molecular biology analysis 2 4 1 dna extraction and sequencing several portions of biofilms were collected using an aseptic scissor for each condition 5 6 fed batch cycles for each condition were operated before collecting biofilm samples for the microbial analyses according to the manufacturer s instructions

assessed by analyzing several alpha and beta diversity metrics using qiime 2 from the rarified asv table with normalizing to the lowest sequence read 9716 sequences table s1 alpha diversity was calculated by different indices of richness and evenness including chao1 shannon otus and pielou s evenness beta diversity was analyzed using a weighted unifrac distance matrix computed from qiime 2 platform to show the community dissimilarities in the phylogenetic relationships and then visualized as principal components analysis pca plots using r software rstudio v 1 4 1103 with the vegan package in r oksanen et al 2010 pairwise permanova was implemented using r software rstudio v 1 4 1103 to analyze the variations between the microbial communities under various hpr hac ratios the phylogenetic diversity was constructed as a rooted phylogenetic tree using mafft program the qiime 2 artifact was used to filter the alignment to remove the highly variable positions then the pipeline used fasttree to generate the phylogenetic tree and it was constructed using the online tool interactive tree of life itol v 6 1 1 letunic and bork 2021 https itol embl de chord diagram was created

eet gene expression the expressions of eet associated genes pila omcb omcc omce omcz and omcs were assessed for different conditions the primer design approach was described elsewhere zakaria and dhar 2021a reca housekeeping gene was used as a reference gene the total rnas of both biofilms were extracted for each test condition the list of primers and methodology are provided in the supplementary information 2 5 analytical methods the chemical oxygen demand cod was measured with the hach method using uv spectrophotometer dr3900 hach germany the vfas were measured with an ion chromatograph dionex ics 2100 thermo scientific usa zakaria and dhar 2021a the biogas was collected using a 500 ml gas bag and methane content was examined by a gas chromatograph 7890b agilent technologies ca usa 2 6 numerical mec ad model and sensitivity analysis a non steady state mec ad model was built by modifying adm1 batstone et al 2002 to simulate the methane production and vfas degradation profiles the model includes 12 reactions fig s1 and 11 model components table s3 to explain the anodic and cathodic reactions in mecs eqs 1 and 2 were implemented in the model for acetate removal and h2 production respectively asztalos and kim 2015 1 anodic reaction ch 3 coo 4 h 2 o 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e 2 cathodic reaction 2 h 2 e h 2 the efficacy of the anodic reaction was described with the columbic efficiency ce table s3 it should be noted that the fermenters i e acetogens xh2 ac near the cathode can utilize h2 to produce acetate izadi et al 2020 nevin et al 2011 zaybak et al 2013 this acetate production from h2 was also expressed in the model using eq 3 3 acetogenesis 4 h 2 2 co 2 ch 3 coo h 2 h 2 o the numerical model was built using visual basic application vba for each of the 11 included components a non steady state mass balance equation was developed based on the kinetic rate expressions table s3 and discretized using the implicit finite difference method in time with δt of 1 min the system of the discretized equations was then solved using the fixed point iteration the initial conditions for the model simulations were summarized in table s4 for the 4 different experiments the current density was obtained by averaging the experimental measurements of every 12 h the kinetic parameters and model constants were collected from adm1 batstone et al 2002 and adjusted to 21 c table s5 a sensitivity study was conducted to determine the most critical model parameter influencing methane production and cod removal we used the relative sensitivity analysis method as previously demonstrated mozumder et al 2014 smith et al 2008 4 a v e r a g e r e l a t i v e s e n s i t i v i t y 0 t y t θ θ y t n 5 y k θ y t θ δ θ y t θ δ θ 2 δ θ y was the simulation results either methane production or residual soluble cod at a time instant t θ was the kinetic constant examined for its effects on the simulated results and δ θ was set to be 1 of θ in the sensitivity analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 methane generation fig 1 shows methane production under various hpr hac ratios the total cumulative methane production 426 434 l ch4 m3 and yields 71 73 remained almost the same after increasing hpr hac ratio from 0 5 to 1 5 p 0 8 when hpr hac ratios further increased to 2 5 and 5 the total cumulative methane production markedly decreased to 348 11 9 l ch4 m3 after 8 days and 332 8 7 l ch4 m3 after 9 5 days p 0 008 respectively moreover methane yields decreased to 56 3 1 5 and 42 7 1 7 respectively p 0 009 based on previous reports hpr hac ratios 1 4 could deteriorate methanogenesis in conventional ad franke whittle et al 2014 hill et al 1987 kor bicakci et al 2020 nonetheless there have been no reports regarding detrimental hpr hac ratios in mec ad this study demonstrated that higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 5 would adversely impact methanogenesis in mec ad several studies reported slow propionate degradation in mecs as anodic eab could not directly utilize propionate dhar et al 2013 hari et al 2016a instead eab would require syntrophic partners e g fermenters for propionate utilization in this study the slow propionate degradation at higher hpr hac ratios caused relatively low current densities with a longer time course fig s2 the time course of current production and methane generation at hpr hac ratio of 2 5 5 was 8 9 5 days while shortened to 6 days for hpr hac ratio of 0 5 moreover ce values were markedly higher at lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 92 110 than higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 64 70 fig s3 indicating efficient current generation from vfas at lower hpr hac ratios in contrast lower ces at higher hpr hac ratios may be caused by the enrichment of other microorganisms i e biomass synthesis the ce values in this study were higher than previous mec ad studies 30 baek et al 2021 vu et al 2020 which could be attributed to the differences in the substrate e g sewage sludge glucose and operating conditions stimulating the growth of competitive microorganisms the numerical mec ad model successfully predicted experimental methane production fig 1a in mec ad systems the role of acetoclastic methanogens was partially replaced by the anodic eab while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be boosted by the increased cathodic h2 production asztalos and kim 2015 for the hpr hac ratio of 0 5 it took 1 2 days to enrich hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig s4a therefore the methane production rate was similar at the early stage of the mec ad operation regardless of the hpr hac ratios fig 1a however propionate degradation resulted in the accumulation of h2 which contributed to the enhanced acetogenesis in biocathode the competition between acetogens i e xh2 ac and hydrogenotrophic methanogens xh2 led to lower methane production for hpr hac ratio from 1 5 to 5 fig s4a and s4b similarly the rapid growth of propionate fermenters at higher hpr hac ratios resulted in reduced methane production due to the competition between propionate fermenters and hydrogenotrophic methanogens figs 1a and s4 these simulation results indicate that a high propionate level can enhance the growth of h2 consuming fermenters and propionate fermenters resulting in reduced activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens as discussed later microbial community analysis also showed selective enrichment of some known acetogens e g sporomusa acetobacterium species on biocathode at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 in a biofilm environment acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens can co exist and compete for h2 zaybak et al 2013 thus our results suggest that high hpr hac ratios can proliferate the growth of acetogens in biocathode hindering h2 electrons availability to methanogens i e low methane yields moreover direct interspecies electron transfer diet could also contribute to methane production in mec ad systems as discussed later the higher enrichment of eab geobacter sp and known electrotrophic methanogen methanobacterium under lower hpr hac ratios in the anode can be considered an indication of diet based methanogenesis flores rodriguez and min 2020 zheng et al 2020 3 2 cod and vfas profiles fig 2 a shows temporal changes in cod and vfas under different conditions the final cod and vfas concentrations were comparable under all hpr hac ratios p 0 5 while their degradation profiles differed fig 2a notably propionate and acetate degradation profiles were distinct under different hpr hac ratios affecting the cod degradation profiles however butyrate degradation profiles were comparable for different conditions although overall cod removal efficiencies were comparable for all conditions fig 2a methane yields varied considerably fig 1b the methane yields gradually decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios indicating that a significant portion of removed cod was presumably utilized through processes other than methanogenesis as discussed later various fermenters clostridia and synergistia species were enriched at higher hpr hac ratios thus such low methane yields i e cod loss might be attributed to a higher yield of fermenters shigematsu et al 2006 according to the model simulation results the total vfa profiles were governed mainly by propionate degradation acetogenesis and bioanode reaction fig 2a for the hpr hac ratio of 0 5 acetate was rapidly utilized by the bioanode to ultimately produce h2 however the propionate degradation rate was limited by the low concentration of propionate fermenters figs 2a and s4c thus significant total vfa removal was observed at the early stage of the simulation while the removal rate decreased due to the slow propionate degradation after 120 h as discussed in section 3 1 h2 production from propionate degradation enhanced the acetogenesis consequently the increase in the acetate concentration for the hpr hac ratio of 5 can be explained by the significantly increased acetate production from acetogenesis i e fast degradation of propionate in contrast the butyrate concentration was lower than the acetate and propionate concentration indicating its efficient removal regardless of different hpr hac ratios the sensitivity analysis results suggested that the maximum specific hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rate kh2 was the most sensitive parameter governing the mec ad performance table 2 thus hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the decisive factor for high methane yield and cod removal the simulation results were also sensitive to changes in the maximum specific acetogenesis rate kac h2 therefore the cathode reaction is limiting for methane production and cod removal when the mec electrode reactions are incorporated in ad fig 2b shows the temporal changes in hpr hac ratios during mec ad operation for the initial hpr hac of 0 5 hpr hac ratio started to increase slowly from 0 5 to 1 0 for initial hpr hac of ratio 1 5 hpr hac ratio reached 5 1 after 108 h and then decreased sharply to 1 3 at the end of the batch cycle however for an initial hpr hac ratio of 2 5 and 5 hpr hac ratios fluctuated during the batch cycles for the initial hpr hac ratio of 2 5 the hpr hac ratio reached a maximum of 8 1 and gradually decreased to 1 7 at the end of the batch cycle for the initial hpr hac ratio of 5 hpr hac ratio sharply reached as high as 23 7 and then fluctuated until reaching 2 2 at the end of the cycle for these two conditions higher hpr hac ratios were sustained for a prolonged period than lower initial hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 nonetheless the sharp increase in the hpr hac ratios for these conditions i e initial hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 indicated that the acetate was consumed first followed by the slow fermentation of propionate fig 2a previous studies also suggested that propionate fermentation would be sensitive to acetate concentrations gorris et al 1989 mawson et al 1991 theoretically δg of propionate fermentation to acetate h2 is endergonic 76 1 kj mol propionate hari et al 2017 thus the accumulation of fermentation products h2 acetate would increase δg shifting the process more thermodynamically unfavorable 3 3 eps composition fig 3 showed the eps composition for different conditions the eps composition under lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 was similar in anode and cathode biofilms p 0 7 the changes in eps composition were comparable with a decreasing trend in overall eps levels under higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 in both biofilms p 0 02 the carbohydrate fraction increased in anode biofilms at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 50 4 0 7 mg cm2 and 5 57 8 0 4 mg cm2 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 26 6 1 3 mg cm2 and 1 5 34 7 0 3 mg cm2 in contrast protein fraction considerably decreased at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 100 4 1 1 mg cm2 and 5 75 4 0 5 mg cm2 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 136 5 2 0 mg cm2 and 1 5 133 3 0 6 mg cm2 similar trends were observed for heme uronic acids and edna edna levels were much lower than other eps fractions 1 mg cm2 the carbohydrate to protein ratios increased from 0 2 to 0 3 at lower hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 to 0 5 0 8 at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 the changes in eps composition for the cathode biofilms showed similar patterns in addition to biofilms maturation cells attachments and protection eps can also influence eet tan et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 several reports suggested lower eet efficiency at low eps protein levels in bioanode tan et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 a recent study reported hindered eet in anode biofilms at higher carbohydrate levels yang et al 2019b another study reported deterioration of current generation at high carbohydrate to protein ratios in anode biofilms yang et al 2019a as mentioned earlier current density also decreased at higher hpr hac ratios see fig s2 in addition to aiding eet eps could immobilize redox cofactors in biofilms that facilitate eet tan et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 however the significance of eps in methanogenic biocathode has rarely been investigated a few recent reports suggested that eps might protect cells in methanogenic biocathode under harsh metabolic conditions e g recalcitrant compounds like phenol high ph mostafa et al 2020 zakaria and dhar 2021a consequently eps could ease cathodic electron transport enhancing the electro methanogenesis process higher hpr hac ratios in this study clearly altered eps composition influencing the current density and methanogenesis performance thus it can be hypothesized that a decrease in eps protein levels might hinder potential electron exchange between cell to electrode and cell to cell and thereby affect mec ad performance 3 4 expression of eet associated genes fig 4 shows expressions of eet associated genes the gene expressions remained unchanged at low hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 p 0 8 however their relative expression dramatically decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios to 2 5 and 5 p 0 01 multi heme c type cytochromes and electrically conductive e pili can facilitate eet lovley and walker 2019 in addition to eet by eab e g geobacter sp some specific methanogens can also directly accept electrons from their syntrophic partners electrode or conductive materials known as direct interspecies electron transfer diet lovley 2017 notably diet by known hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanospirillum methanobacterium species have also been reported recently walker et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 as discussed later geobacter and methanobacterium species were abundant under lower hpr hac ratios while their abundance decreased under higher hpr hac ratios thus decreased eet associated gene expression under high hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 indicates the partial inhibition of biofilm electroactivity these results were consistent with reduced eps protein levels at higher hpr hac ratios and corroborated with the low current generation and inferior methanogenesis 3 5 microbial analysis 3 5 1 microbial diversity the microbial diversity and richness considerably varied under various hpr hac ratios fig s5 the alpha diversity metrics of the anodic bacterial community increased with increasing hpr hac ratios fig s5a the microbial richness of chao1 index and observed species otus also increased from 100 to 176 and 120 to 211 respectively similar patterns were observed for the microbial diversity of the shannon index and community evenness pielou s the alpha diversity metrics of the biocathode bacterial community also increased however at a smaller degree than the anode biofilms fig s5a for the archaeal community the alpha diversity metrics decreased richness and evenness in terms of chao1 index otus and pielou s evenness fig s5b however biocathode archaeal diversity was significantly increased under higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 with no significant change in the shannon diversity index in the anode biofilms fig s5b beta diversity was also calculated to evaluate the dissimilarities in the bacterial and archaeal communities by assessing the weighted unifrac distance fig s6 the anodic bacterial and archaeal communities showed similarity at lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 which became significantly distinct at hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 p 0 002 fig s6a on the biocathode the microbial community at hpr hac 0 5 was significantly distinct from hpr hac ratios of 1 5 to 5 p 0 004 fig s6b these results imply that higher hpr hac ratios induced a higher microbial richness evenness and diversity for the anodic bacterial communities with less observed differences in the cathode biofilms some previous studies also reported a more apparent impact of process parameters including vfas on bacterial communities than archaeal communities in both conventional ad and mec ad franke whittle et al 2014 huang et al 2021 siegert et al 2015 conversely higher hpr hac ratios decreased the alpha diversity metrics on both electrodes for the archaeal community except for an increase in the shannon index diversity for biocathode 3 5 2 quantitative analysis with qpcr fig 5 shows the quantitative assessment of microbial communities for the universal primers the total microbial cell counts in anode biofilms significantly increased at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 6 1012 copies cm2 and 5 4 1012 copies cm2 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 9 1010 copies cm2 and 1 5 3 1011 copies cm2 p 0 005 on the contrary the microbial cell counts on the cathode biofilms were higher at lower hpr hac 0 5 4 109 copies cm2 and 1 5 2 109 copies cm2 than the higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 4 108 copies cm2 and 5 4 108 copies cm2 for the archaeal primers the total archaeal cell counts at lower hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 were quite similar in both electrodes while showing a significant decrease at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 3 7 106 copies cm2 vs 7 8 105 copies cm2 these results showed higher propionate levels led to higher bacterial biomass possibly caused by syntrophic interactions between fermenters and eab furthermore mcra gene copies were quantified fig 5 which is considered a biomarker for the phylogenetic characterization of methanogens morris et al 2014 zakaria and dhar 2021a previous studies also demonstrated a positive correlation between methanogenesis rates and mcra gene copies morris et al 2014 zakaria and dhar 2021a increasing hpr hac ratios decreased mcra gene copies in both biofilms while a greater reduction was observed in the biocathode thus these results are consistent with the inferior methanogenesis observed under higher hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 3 5 3 microbial abundance fig 6 shows the microbial community composition under hpr hac ratios at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 61 and 1 5 67 their abundance significantly decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios to 2 5 16 and 5 18 fig 6a alternatively synergistetes phylum significantly increased and became the most abundant at higher hpr hac ratio of 2 5 46 and 5 50 lower abundances at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 14 and 1 5 11 also the abundance of firmicutes increased with increasing hpr hac ratios 0 5 1 1 5 3 2 5 18 and 5 19 the abundance of bacteroidetes remained almost unchanged 12 16 for increasing hpr hac ratios until 2 5 however it dramatically decreased to 6 at a higher hpr hac ratio of 5 at the genus level geobacter belonging to proteobacteria was the most abundant on the anode biofilm at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 54 and 1 5 53 fig 6b however at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 the abundance of geobacter sp substantially decreased 10 11 geobacter species are known as kinetically efficient eab dhar et al 2017 torres et al 2010 thus a decrease in their abundance at higher hpr hac ratios corroborated with reduced current densities fig s2 alternatively vadinca02 a member of synergistia became the most abundant genus at hpr hac ratios of 2 5 47 and 5 51 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 14 and 1 5 11 also the relative abundance of acetobacterium belonging to clostridia increased at hpr hac ratios of 2 5 13 and 5 14 compared to lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 1 abundance bacteroides had the second highest abundance at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 15 1 5 11 and 2 5 11 however their abundance decreased to 3 at hpr hac ratio of 5 moreover higher enrichment of christensenellaceae and sporomusa members of clostridia was observed at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 2 and 3 and 5 2 and 4 respectively in contrast their abundances were 1 at low hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 other genera petrimonas xanthobacter belonging to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were enriched at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 1 3 and 5 2 4 their abundances decreased 1 at low hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 various known fermenters and acetogens e g christensenellaceae vadinca02 acetobacterium sporomusa belong to clostridia and synergistia were considerably increased the requirement of a syntrophic partnership between fermenters and eab for effective propionate degradation might lead to higher enrichment of fermenters hari et al 2017 a previous study also showed the enrichment of diverse phylotypes of clostridia and synergistia in mec fed with propionate hari et al 2017 moreover enrichment of acetogens can be associated with the utilization of h2 produced from propionate fermentation notably acetogens can convert h2 co2 to acetate and other multi carbon compounds izadi et al 2020 nevin et al 2011 zaybak et al 2013 the cathode biofilm also showed a shift in microbial communities fig 6 bacteroides 12 vs 20 vs 27 vs 23 was the most abundant bacterial genus in biocathode showing increased abundance with increasing hpr hac ratios acetobacterium known as h2 scavenging homoacetogens was the second most dominant genus at hpr hac ratio of 0 5 8 while their abundance decreased to 1 for other hpr hac ratios 1 5 5 acetobacterium can utilize h2 co2 to produce acetate which can be utilized by anodic eab fu et al 2015 previous studies also reported enhanced methanogenesis in mec ad systems accompanied by the enrichment of homoacetogens liu et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2021a alternatively the abundance of sporomusa 3 vs 4 vs 16 vs 19 and vadinca02 3 vs 2 vs 7 vs 8 increased at higher hpr hac ratios sporomusa species can utilize electrons h2 and co2 to produce acetate and other multi carbon compounds izadi et al 2020 nevin et al 2011 zaybak et al 2013 thus the availability of h2 and or electrons for hydrogenotrophic methanogens in biocathode would be hindered zakaria and dhar 2021b hence the enrichment of sporomusa in biocathode at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 might result in significant losses of electrons h2 from being utilized by methanogens methanobacterium was the most abundant archaeal genera in both electrodes under different conditions previous studies also reported known hydrogenotrophic methanogens particularly methanobacterium as key methanogen enriched in mec ad systems regardless of a substrate dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 zakaria and dhar 2021a the high abundance of known hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium suggested that eab primarily utilized acetate rather than acetoclastic methanogens liu et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 notably no existence of known acetoclastic methanogens in biocathode under different hpr hac ratios fig 6 was consistent with previous reports suggested that eab could kinetically outcompete acetoclastic methanogens in mec ad liu et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 the abundance of methanobacterium was negatively affected with increasing hpr hac ratios from 0 5 to 5 anode 8 to 5 cathode 58 to 26 nonetheless 16s rrna gene sequencing could not detect the low abundant archaeal genera based on the phylogenetic tree analysis using sequencing results of a specific archaeal primer more diverse methanogenic archaea existed at higher hpr hac ratios see supplementary information at a low hpr hac ratio of 0 5 only three archaeal species methanobacterium methanosarcina and methanobrevibacter were detected however at higher hpr hac ratios 4 5 other archaeal genera were observed fig s8 s10 for hpr hac ratio of 5 methanobacterium methanobrevibacter methanosarcina methanoculleus and methanolinea were existed fig s7 nonetheless methanogenic activity was negatively affected by higher hpr hac ratios indicating that the quantitative abundance of archaeal genera might be the most critical factor influencing methanogenesis performance thus the higher abundance of the archaeal population might have contributed to the superior mec ad performance under low hpr hac ratios 3 5 4 correlation analysis fig 7 shows a pca loading plot for the abundances of the microbial communities under different conditions pca analysis shows the clustering of methanobacterium geobacter and rhodocyclaceae under hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 however these genera have been negatively affected by higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 several fermenters vadinca02 sporomusa etc were dominated and closely located at the same quadrants of higher hpr hac ratios furthermore the scatterplot matrix and correlation coefficients indicated a positive correlation between methanobacterium r 1 0 geobacter r 0 9 and rhodocyclaceae r 0 8 at lower hpr hac ratios fig 8 and table s6 these genera showed a negative correlation 1 0 0 9 and 0 8 respectively at higher hpr hac ratios these results further indicate that higher hpr hac ratios significantly shifted the microbial communities particularly methanobacterium and geobacter 3 5 5 chord diagram chord diagram shows the relationship between the abundances of microbial genera on the anode and cathode biofilms fig 9 in bioanode geobacter was closely associated with methanobacterium a recent study confirmed diet based syntrophy between geobacter and methanobacterium zheng et al 2020 acetogenic genera vadinca02 sporomusa bosea and petrimonas were closely associated for biocathode methanobacterium showed a close association with acetobacterium as discussed earlier the enrichment of acetobacterium was accompanied by enhanced methanogenesis however geobacter and various acetogenic genera i e sporomusa and vadinca02 in biocathode were not linked to methanobacterium these results further revealed that enrichment of acetogens in biocathode affected the growth of methanogens at higher hpr hac ratios 3 6 multivariate analysis the multivariate principal components analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between various process variables and hpr hac ratios for anode biofilms most of the process variables cod removal eet gene expression eps archaeal cells mcra copies methane etc are located close to hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 fig 10 on the other hand bacterial cell numbers represented by 16s rrna gene copies are in a different quadrant closely linked to the higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 for cathode biofilms all the process variables are located in the same quadrants of hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 moreover correlation coefficients and scatterplot matrix were tested to examine the correlation of process variables to different hpr hac ratios fig s11 and table s7 the process variables showed a relatively high positive correlation to hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 conversely a relatively negative correlation was observed at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 for instance eet gene expression showed a relatively positive correlation on the anode and cathode biofilms r 0 8 and 0 9 respectively at hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 however a noticeable negative correlation was observed at anode and cathode biofilms r 0 8 and 0 9 respectively at hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 also other process variables such as eps methane archaeal cells etc showed similar trends the only exception is the high positive correlation of bacteria cells r 0 8 enriched on the anode at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 thus these analyses further emphasized that superior mec ad performance was associated with lower hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 most variables were negatively correlated at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 corroborating inferior mec ad performance 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that hpr hac ratios could considerably influence microbial syntrophy and competition in mec ad systems based on the results hpr hac ratios 1 5 would be critical to establishing a well balanced syntrophy between eab fermenters and methanogens notably hpr hac ratios 2 5 triggered microbial competition between h2 consuming acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens moreover a higher yield of propionate fermenters was also identified as a potential factor that resulted in lower methane yields under hpr hac ratios of 2 5 5 the numerical mec ad modeling results coincided with the experimental methane production and vfas degradation profiles although hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis seemed to be the key mechanism throughout hpr hac ratios of 2 5 5 could decrease the expression of eet associated genes and alter the eps composition by reducing protein content thus the significance of electro methanogenesis via direct electron transport cannot be overlooked the numerical mec ad model also considered hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in biocathode as a critical pathway therefore slight variations between experimental and modeled methane production profiles at lower hpr hac ratios could be attributed to the methanogenesis via direct electron transport which warrants further

16110,this study examined the significance of propionate to acetate hpr hac ratios on microbial syntrophy and competition in microbial electrolysis cell assisted anaerobic digestion mec ad in addition to molecular biology and phylogenetic analysis a numerical mec ad model was developed by modifying anaerobic digestion model no 1 to predict the effects of different hpr hac ratios 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 5 the hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 maintained efficient syntrophy among electroactive bacteria hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens leading to higher methane yields in contrast higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 were detrimental to methanogenesis both microbial community analysis and numerical modeling results suggested that higher propionate levels could promote the enrichment of h2 utilizing acetogens thereby triggering their competition with hydrogenotrophic methanogens moreover protein fraction in extracellular polymeric substances and the relative expression of genes associated with extracellular electron transfer in both anode and cathode biofilms were markedly decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios indicating partial inhibition of microbial electroactivity overall these results illuminate deep insight into anaerobic syntrophy contributing to the process kinetics and methane yields in mec ad systems furthermore from a practical viewpoint the results can also be helpful in effective control of mec ad operation without propionate accumulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomethane electro assisted anaerobic digestion propionate to acetate ratio microbial syntrophy 1 introduction integrating microbial electrolysis cells mecs with anaerobic digestion ad is a promising approach to establish a kinetically efficient microbiome to improve biomethane recovery from organic wastes huang et al 2020 zakaria and dhar 2021a 2019 such electro assisted process configurations are called microbial electrolysis cell assisted anaerobic digestion mec ad in mec ad systems simple organics like acetate can be efficiently oxidized by anodic electroactive bacteria eab such as geobacter shewanella etc hari et al 2017 yang et al 2015 the released electrons are transferred to the anode via extracellular electron transfer eet on the cathode methanogens can utilize electrons or electrochemically produced h2 for methanogenesis when mec ad systems are fed with complex organics fermentation becomes essential for converting them to simple organic acids for utilization by anodic eab lin et al 2019 yang et al 2015 various volatile fatty acids vfas such as acetate butyrate and propionate are major fermentation products hari et al 2017 lin et al 2019 previous studies frequently reported the following vfas utilization sequence in mecs acetate butyrate propionate lin et al 2019 yang et al 2015 eab cannot directly oxidize propionate or butyrate hari et al 2017 2016a lin et al 2019 yang et al 2015 however propionate represents up to 35 of the carbon flow to methane in conventional digesters dyksma and gallert 2019 furthermore propionate accumulation was frequently associated with process disturbance or digester failure franke whittle et al 2014 gallert and winter 2008 several studies reported low current density from mecs fed with propionate torres et al 2007 yang et al 2015 propionate oxidation in mecs requires syntrophic interactions between fermenters and eab hari et al 2016b yang et al 2015 theoretically the gibbs free energy δg of the syntrophic propionate conversion to acetate h2 is endergonic 76 1 kj mol propionate hari et al 2017 therefore the accumulation of fermentation products acetate h2 would increase δg further making the reaction thermodynamically more unfavorable thus syntrophy among fermenters eab and hydrogenotrophic methanogens is required to maintain h2 partial pressure and acetate at low levels to allow propionate fermentation yasri et al 2019 despite many reports on conventional ad inhibition by propionate accumulation previous studies reported a wide range of inhibitory propionate concentrations franke whittle et al 2014 gallert and winter 2008 wang et al 2009 wang et al 2009 observed methanogenic inhibition at 900 mg l of propionate gallert and winter 2008 found propionate concentrations 20 mm 1480 mg l were detrimental to ad conversely another study suggested stable microbial communities for propionate concentration as high as 8741 mg l franke whittle et al 2014 in ad propionate is fermented to acetate h2 while shifting hpr hac ratios during the process franke whittle et al 2014 wagner et al 2014 high acetate levels resulting from propionate fermentation can retard the process via product inhibition gorris et al 1989 mawson et al 1991 wagner et al 2014 hpr hac ratios in feedstock also influence propionate degradation profiles and subsequent methanogenesis wagner et al 2014 therefore several studies highlighted the significance of hpr hac ratios in ad hill et al 1987 kor bicakci et al 2020 wagner et al 2014 for instance hill et al 1987 suggested that hpr hac ratios 1 4 would indicate impending digester failure wagner et al 2014 suggested that an hpr hac ratio of 0 5 would be critical for effective methanogenesis in ad these studies investigated hpr hac ratios of 0 25 4 in the feedstock however the detrimental hpr hac ratios in feedstock and their impact on microbial syntrophy have not been examined yet for mec ad the overall goal of this study was to attain detailed fundamental insights into the roles of hpr hac ratios on microbial syntrophy and competition in mec ad first the effects of different hpr hac ratios on the methane yields and vfas profiles were assessed second we performed a detailed characterization of microbial communities eet gene expression patterns and composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps to reveal the fundamentals behind the changes in methanogenesis performance finally we developed a numerical mec ad model by modifying anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 to simulate the effects of hpr hac ratios on methane yields and vfas degradation 2 methodology 2 1 mec ad configuration the experiment was conducted with a mec ad reactor manufactured from plexiglass the working volume and headspace volumes were 360 ml and 40 ml respectively carbon fibers 2293 a

associated with the potentiostat the reactor was operated at room temperature 21 1 c under continuous mixing 130 5 rpm 2 2 start up and operation the reactor was inoculated with ad sludge collected from the gold bar wastewater treatment plant edmonton ab canada and effluent from a mother mec operated with 25 mm sodium acetate during start up the reactor was operated under semi continuous mode with glucose medium 2235 31 mg cod l supplemented with 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 05 and trace minerals the trace minerals were added according to dhar et al 2013 after reaching the steady state current indicated by maximum peak current of 14 ma in multiple operating cycles the operation was switched to a fed batch mode for experiments under various hpr hac ratios at the beginning of each fed batch cycle the reactor was fed with a fresh substrate medium containing a mix of acetate hac propionate hpr and butyrate hbu as a carbon source however total vfas concentration was fixed at 2000 mg cod l the buffer and trace minerals remained the same as the glucose medium the major vfas produced during ad are mainly acetate propionate and butyrate franke whittle et al 2014 wagner et al 2014 therefore the substrate medium was prepared with these three vfas depending on the experimental conditions hpr hac ratios were varied while hbu concentration was fixed table 1 the fed batch cycle was continued until the current declined 2 ma then the substrate medium was replaced with a fresh medium for each hpr hac ratio several consecutive fed batch cycles were performed for 40 50 days before feeding the medium was flushed with nitrogen 99 99 for 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition 2 3 eps characterization various biofilm eps components carbohydrates proteins heme binding proteins uronic

package in r oksanen et al 2010 pairwise permanova was implemented using r software rstudio v 1 4 1103 to analyze the variations between the microbial communities under various hpr hac ratios the phylogenetic diversity was constructed as a rooted phylogenetic tree using mafft program the qiime 2 artifact was used to filter the alignment to remove the highly variable positions then the pipeline

dionex ics 2100 thermo scientific usa zakaria and dhar 2021a the biogas was collected using a 500 ml gas bag and methane content was examined by a gas chromatograph 7890b agilent technologies ca usa 2 6 numerical mec ad model and sensitivity analysis a non steady state mec ad model was built by modifying adm1 batstone et al 2002 to simulate the methane production and vfas degradation profiles the model includes 12 reactions fig s1 and 11 model components table s3 to explain the anodic and cathodic reactions in mecs eqs 1 and 2 were implemented in the model for acetate removal and h2 production respectively asztalos and kim 2015 1 anodic reaction ch 3 coo 4 h 2 o 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e 2 cathodic reaction 2 h 2 e h 2 the efficacy of the anodic reaction was described with the columbic efficiency ce table s3 it should be noted that the fermenters i e acetogens xh2 ac near the cathode can utilize h2 to produce acetate izadi et al 2020 nevin et al 2011 zaybak et al 2013 this acetate production from h2 was also expressed in the model using eq 3 3 acetogenesis 4 h 2 2 co 2 ch 3 coo h 2 h 2 o the numerical model was built using visual basic application vba for each of the 11 included components a non steady state mass balance equation was developed based on the kinetic rate expressions table s3 and discretized using the implicit finite difference method in time with δt of 1 min the system of the discretized equations was then solved using the fixed point iteration the initial conditions for the model simulations were summarized in table s4 for the 4 different experiments the current density was obtained by averaging the experimental measurements of every 12 h the kinetic parameters and model constants were collected from adm1 batstone et al 2002 and adjusted to 21 c table s5 a sensitivity study was conducted to determine the most critical model parameter influencing methane production and cod removal we used the relative sensitivity analysis method as previously demonstrated mozumder et al 2014 smith et al 2008 4 a v e r a g e r e l a t i v e s e n s i t i v i t y 0 t y t θ θ y t n 5 y k θ y t θ δ θ y t θ δ θ 2 δ θ y was the simulation results either methane

and discussion 3 1 methane generation fig 1 shows methane production under various hpr hac ratios the total cumulative methane production 426 434 l ch4 m3 and yields 71 73 remained almost the same after increasing hpr hac ratio from 0 5 to 1 5 p 0 8 when hpr hac ratios further increased to 2 5 and 5 the total cumulative methane production markedly decreased to 348 11 9 l ch4 m3 after 8 days and 332 8 7 l ch4 m3 after 9 5 days p 0 008 respectively moreover methane yields decreased to 56 3 1 5 and 42 7 1 7 respectively p 0 009 based on previous reports hpr hac ratios 1 4 could deteriorate methanogenesis in conventional ad franke whittle et al 2014 hill et al 1987 kor bicakci et al 2020 nonetheless there have been no reports regarding detrimental hpr hac ratios in mec ad this study demonstrated that higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 5 would adversely impact methanogenesis in mec ad several studies reported slow propionate degradation in mecs as anodic eab could not directly utilize propionate dhar et al 2013 hari et al 2016a instead eab would require syntrophic partners e g fermenters for propionate utilization in this study the slow propionate degradation at higher hpr hac ratios caused relatively low current densities with a longer time course fig s2 the time course of current production and methane generation at hpr hac ratio of 2 5 5 was 8 9 5 days while shortened to 6 days for hpr hac ratio of 0 5 moreover ce values were markedly higher at lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 92 110 than higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 64 70 fig s3 indicating efficient current generation from vfas at lower hpr hac ratios in contrast lower ces at higher hpr hac ratios may be caused by the enrichment of other microorganisms i e biomass synthesis the ce values in this study were higher than previous mec ad studies 30 baek et al 2021 vu et al 2020 which could be attributed to the differences in the substrate e g sewage sludge glucose and operating conditions stimulating the growth of competitive microorganisms the numerical mec ad model successfully predicted experimental methane production fig 1a in mec ad systems the role of acetoclastic methanogens was partially replaced by the anodic eab while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be boosted by the increased cathodic h2 production asztalos and kim 2015 for the hpr hac ratio of 0 5 it took 1 2 days to enrich hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig s4a therefore the methane production rate was similar at the early stage of the mec ad operation regardless of the hpr hac ratios fig 1a however propionate degradation resulted in the accumulation of h2 which contributed to the enhanced acetogenesis in biocathode the competition between acetogens i e xh2 ac and hydrogenotrophic methanogens xh2 led to lower methane production for hpr hac ratio from 1 5 to 5 fig s4a and s4b similarly the rapid growth of propionate fermenters at higher hpr hac ratios resulted in reduced methane production due to the competition between propionate fermenters and hydrogenotrophic methanogens figs 1a and s4 these simulation results indicate that a high propionate level can enhance the growth of h2 consuming fermenters and propionate fermenters resulting in reduced activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens as discussed later microbial community analysis also showed selective enrichment of some known acetogens e g sporomusa acetobacterium species on biocathode at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 in a biofilm environment acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens can co exist and compete for h2 zaybak et al 2013 thus our results suggest that high hpr hac ratios can proliferate the growth of acetogens in biocathode hindering h2 electrons availability to methanogens i e low methane yields moreover direct interspecies electron transfer diet could also contribute to methane production in mec ad systems as discussed later the higher enrichment of eab geobacter sp and known electrotrophic methanogen methanobacterium under lower hpr hac ratios in the anode can be considered an indication of diet based methanogenesis flores rodriguez and min 2020 zheng et al 2020 3 2 cod and vfas profiles fig 2 a shows temporal changes in cod and vfas under different conditions the final cod and vfas concentrations were comparable under all hpr hac ratios p 0 5 while their degradation profiles differed fig 2a notably propionate and acetate degradation profiles were distinct under different hpr hac ratios affecting the cod degradation profiles however butyrate degradation profiles were comparable for different conditions although overall cod removal efficiencies were comparable for all conditions fig 2a methane yields varied considerably fig 1b the methane yields gradually decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios indicating that a significant portion of removed cod was presumably utilized through processes other than methanogenesis as discussed later various fermenters clostridia and synergistia species were enriched at higher hpr hac ratios thus such low methane yields i e cod loss might be attributed to a higher yield of fermenters shigematsu et al 2006 according to the model simulation results the total vfa profiles were governed mainly by propionate degradation acetogenesis and bioanode reaction fig 2a for the hpr hac ratio of 0 5 acetate was rapidly utilized by the bioanode to ultimately produce h2 however the propionate degradation rate was limited by the low concentration of propionate fermenters figs 2a and s4c thus significant total vfa removal was observed at the early stage of the simulation while the removal rate decreased due to the slow propionate degradation after 120 h as discussed in section 3 1 h2 production from propionate degradation enhanced the acetogenesis consequently the increase in the acetate concentration for the hpr hac ratio of 5 can be explained by the significantly increased acetate production from acetogenesis i e fast degradation of propionate in contrast the butyrate concentration was lower than the acetate and propionate concentration indicating its efficient removal regardless of different hpr hac ratios the sensitivity analysis results suggested that the maximum specific hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rate kh2 was the most sensitive parameter governing the mec ad performance table 2 thus hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the decisive factor for high methane yield and cod removal the simulation results were also sensitive to changes in the maximum specific acetogenesis rate kac h2 therefore the cathode reaction is limiting for methane production and cod removal when the mec electrode reactions are incorporated in ad fig 2b shows the temporal changes in hpr hac ratios during mec ad operation for the initial hpr hac of 0 5 hpr hac ratio started to increase slowly from 0 5 to 1 0 for initial hpr hac of ratio 1 5 hpr hac ratio reached 5 1 after 108 h and then decreased sharply to 1 3 at the end of the batch cycle however for an initial hpr hac ratio of 2 5 and 5 hpr hac ratios fluctuated during the batch cycles for the initial hpr hac ratio of 2 5 the hpr hac ratio reached a maximum of 8 1 and gradually decreased to 1 7 at the end of the batch cycle for the initial hpr hac ratio of 5 hpr hac ratio sharply reached as high as 23 7 and then fluctuated until reaching 2 2 at the end of the cycle for these two conditions higher hpr hac ratios were sustained for a prolonged period than lower initial hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 nonetheless the sharp increase in the hpr hac ratios for these conditions i e initial hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 indicated that the acetate was consumed first followed by the slow fermentation of propionate fig 2a previous studies also suggested that propionate fermentation would be sensitive to acetate concentrations gorris et al 1989 mawson et al 1991 theoretically δg of propionate fermentation to acetate h2 is endergonic 76 1 kj mol propionate hari et al 2017 thus the accumulation of fermentation products h2 acetate would increase δg shifting the process more thermodynamically unfavorable 3 3 eps composition fig 3 showed the eps composition for different conditions the eps composition under lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 was similar in anode and cathode biofilms p 0 7 the changes in eps composition were comparable with a decreasing trend in overall eps levels under higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 in both biofilms p 0 02 the carbohydrate fraction increased in anode biofilms at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 50 4 0 7 mg cm2 and 5 57 8 0 4 mg cm2 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 26 6 1 3 mg cm2 and 1 5 34 7 0 3 mg cm2 in contrast protein fraction considerably decreased at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 100 4 1 1 mg cm2 and 5 75 4 0 5 mg cm2 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 136 5 2 0 mg cm2 and 1 5 133 3 0 6 mg cm2 similar trends were observed for heme uronic acids and edna edna levels were much lower than other eps fractions 1 mg cm2 the carbohydrate to protein ratios increased from 0 2 to 0 3 at lower hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 to 0 5 0 8 at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 the changes in eps composition for the cathode biofilms showed similar patterns in addition to biofilms maturation cells attachments and protection eps can also influence eet tan et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 several reports suggested lower eet efficiency at low eps protein levels in bioanode tan et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 a recent study reported hindered eet in anode biofilms at higher carbohydrate levels yang et al 2019b another study reported deterioration of current generation at high carbohydrate to protein ratios in anode biofilms yang et al 2019a as mentioned earlier current density also decreased at higher hpr hac ratios see fig s2 in addition to aiding eet eps could immobilize redox cofactors in biofilms that facilitate eet tan et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 however the significance of eps in methanogenic biocathode has rarely been investigated a few recent reports suggested that eps might protect cells in methanogenic biocathode under harsh metabolic conditions e g recalcitrant compounds like phenol high ph mostafa et al 2020 zakaria and dhar 2021a consequently eps could ease cathodic electron transport enhancing the electro methanogenesis process higher hpr hac ratios in this study clearly altered eps composition influencing the current density and methanogenesis performance thus it can be hypothesized that a decrease in eps protein levels might hinder potential electron exchange between cell to electrode and cell to cell and thereby affect mec ad performance 3 4 expression of eet associated genes fig 4 shows expressions of eet associated genes the gene expressions remained unchanged at low hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 p 0 8 however their relative expression dramatically decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios to 2 5 and 5 p 0 01 multi heme c type cytochromes and electrically conductive e pili can facilitate eet lovley and walker 2019 in addition to eet by eab e g geobacter sp some specific methanogens can also directly accept electrons from their syntrophic partners electrode or conductive materials known as direct interspecies electron transfer diet lovley 2017 notably diet by known hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanospirillum methanobacterium species have also been reported recently walker et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 as discussed later geobacter and methanobacterium species were abundant under lower hpr hac ratios while their abundance decreased under higher hpr hac ratios thus decreased eet associated gene expression under high hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 indicates the partial inhibition of biofilm electroactivity these results were consistent with reduced eps protein levels at higher hpr hac ratios and corroborated with the low current generation and inferior methanogenesis 3 5 microbial analysis 3 5 1 microbial diversity the microbial diversity and richness considerably varied under various hpr hac ratios fig s5 the alpha diversity metrics of the anodic bacterial community increased with increasing hpr hac ratios fig s5a the microbial richness of chao1 index and observed species otus also increased from 100 to 176 and 120 to 211 respectively similar patterns were observed for the microbial diversity of the shannon index and community evenness pielou s the alpha diversity metrics of the biocathode bacterial community also increased however at a smaller degree than the anode biofilms fig s5a for the archaeal community the alpha diversity metrics decreased richness and evenness in terms of chao1 index otus and pielou s evenness fig s5b however biocathode archaeal diversity was significantly increased under higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 with no significant change in the shannon diversity index in the anode biofilms fig s5b beta diversity was also calculated to evaluate the dissimilarities in the bacterial and archaeal communities by assessing the weighted unifrac distance fig s6 the anodic bacterial and archaeal communities showed similarity at lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 which became significantly distinct at hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 p 0 002 fig s6a on the biocathode the microbial community at hpr hac 0 5 was significantly distinct from hpr hac ratios of 1 5 to 5 p 0 004 fig s6b these results imply that higher hpr hac ratios induced a higher microbial richness evenness and diversity for the anodic bacterial communities with less observed differences in the cathode biofilms some previous studies also reported a more apparent impact of process parameters including vfas on bacterial communities than archaeal communities in both conventional ad and mec ad franke whittle et al 2014 huang et al 2021 siegert et al 2015 conversely higher hpr hac ratios decreased the alpha diversity metrics on both electrodes for the archaeal community except for an increase in the shannon index diversity for biocathode 3 5 2 quantitative analysis with qpcr fig 5 shows the quantitative assessment of microbial communities for the universal primers the total microbial cell counts in anode biofilms significantly increased at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 6 1012 copies cm2 and 5 4 1012 copies cm2 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 9 1010 copies cm2 and 1 5 3 1011 copies cm2 p 0 005 on the contrary the microbial cell counts on the cathode biofilms were higher at lower hpr hac 0 5 4 109 copies cm2 and 1 5 2 109 copies cm2 than the higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 4 108 copies cm2 and 5 4 108 copies cm2 for the archaeal primers the total archaeal cell counts at lower hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 were quite similar in both electrodes while showing a significant decrease at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 3 7 106 copies cm2 vs 7 8 105 copies cm2 these results showed higher propionate levels led to higher bacterial biomass possibly caused by syntrophic interactions between fermenters and eab furthermore mcra gene copies were quantified fig 5 which is considered a biomarker for the phylogenetic characterization of methanogens morris et al 2014 zakaria and dhar 2021a previous studies also demonstrated a positive correlation between methanogenesis rates and mcra gene copies morris et al 2014 zakaria and dhar 2021a increasing hpr hac ratios decreased mcra gene copies in both biofilms while a greater reduction was observed in the biocathode thus these results are consistent with the inferior methanogenesis observed under higher hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 3 5 3 microbial abundance fig 6 shows the microbial community composition under hpr hac ratios at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 61 and 1 5 67 their abundance significantly decreased with increasing hpr hac ratios to 2 5 16 and 5 18 fig 6a alternatively synergistetes phylum significantly increased and became the most abundant at higher hpr hac ratio of 2 5 46 and 5 50 lower abundances at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 14 and 1 5 11 also the abundance of firmicutes increased with increasing hpr hac ratios 0 5 1 1 5 3 2 5 18 and 5 19 the abundance of bacteroidetes remained almost unchanged 12 16 for increasing hpr hac ratios until 2 5 however it dramatically decreased to 6 at a higher hpr hac ratio of 5 at the genus level geobacter belonging to proteobacteria was the most abundant on the anode biofilm at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 54 and 1 5 53 fig 6b however at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 the abundance of geobacter sp substantially decreased 10 11 geobacter species are known as kinetically efficient eab dhar et al 2017 torres et al 2010 thus a decrease in their abundance at higher hpr hac ratios corroborated with reduced current densities fig s2 alternatively vadinca02 a member of synergistia became the most abundant genus at hpr hac ratios of 2 5 47 and 5 51 than lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 14 and 1 5 11 also the relative abundance of acetobacterium belonging to clostridia increased at hpr hac ratios of 2 5 13 and 5 14 compared to lower hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 1 abundance bacteroides had the second highest abundance at hpr hac ratios of 0 5 15 1 5 11 and 2 5 11 however their abundance decreased to 3 at hpr hac ratio of 5 moreover higher enrichment of christensenellaceae and sporomusa members of clostridia was observed at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 2 and 3 and 5 2 and 4 respectively in contrast their abundances were 1 at low hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 other genera petrimonas xanthobacter belonging to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were enriched at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 1 3 and 5 2 4 their abundances decreased 1 at low hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 various known fermenters and acetogens e g christensenellaceae vadinca02 acetobacterium sporomusa belong to clostridia and synergistia were considerably increased the requirement of a syntrophic partnership between fermenters and eab for effective propionate degradation might lead to higher enrichment of fermenters hari et al 2017 a previous study also showed the enrichment of diverse phylotypes of clostridia and synergistia in mec fed with propionate hari et al 2017 moreover enrichment of acetogens can be associated with the utilization of h2 produced from propionate fermentation notably acetogens can convert h2 co2 to acetate and other multi carbon compounds izadi et al 2020 nevin et al 2011 zaybak et al 2013 the cathode biofilm also showed a shift in microbial communities fig 6 bacteroides 12 vs 20 vs 27 vs 23 was the most abundant bacterial genus in biocathode showing increased abundance with increasing hpr hac ratios acetobacterium known as h2 scavenging homoacetogens was the second most dominant genus at hpr hac ratio of 0 5 8 while their abundance decreased to 1 for other hpr hac ratios 1 5 5 acetobacterium can utilize h2 co2 to produce acetate which can be utilized by anodic eab fu et al 2015 previous studies also reported enhanced methanogenesis in mec ad systems accompanied by the enrichment of homoacetogens liu et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2021a alternatively the abundance of sporomusa 3 vs 4 vs 16 vs 19 and vadinca02 3 vs 2 vs 7 vs 8 increased at higher hpr hac ratios sporomusa species can utilize electrons h2 and co2 to produce acetate and other multi carbon compounds izadi et al 2020 nevin et al 2011 zaybak et al 2013 thus the availability of h2 and or electrons for hydrogenotrophic methanogens in biocathode would be hindered zakaria and dhar 2021b hence the enrichment of sporomusa in biocathode at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 might result in significant losses of electrons h2 from being utilized by methanogens methanobacterium was the most abundant archaeal genera in both electrodes under different conditions previous studies also reported known hydrogenotrophic methanogens particularly methanobacterium as key methanogen enriched in mec ad systems regardless of a substrate dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 zakaria and dhar 2021a the high abundance of known hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium suggested that eab primarily utilized acetate rather than acetoclastic methanogens liu et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 notably no existence of known acetoclastic methanogens in biocathode under different hpr hac ratios fig 6 was consistent with previous reports suggested that eab could kinetically outcompete acetoclastic methanogens in mec ad liu et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 the abundance of methanobacterium was negatively affected with increasing hpr hac ratios from 0 5 to 5 anode 8 to 5 cathode 58 to 26 nonetheless 16s rrna gene sequencing could not detect the low abundant archaeal genera based on the phylogenetic tree analysis using sequencing results of a specific archaeal primer more diverse methanogenic archaea existed at higher hpr hac ratios see supplementary information at a low hpr hac ratio of 0 5 only three archaeal species methanobacterium methanosarcina and methanobrevibacter were detected however at higher hpr hac ratios 4 5 other archaeal genera were observed fig s8 s10 for hpr hac ratio of 5 methanobacterium methanobrevibacter methanosarcina methanoculleus and methanolinea were existed fig s7 nonetheless methanogenic activity was negatively affected by higher hpr hac ratios indicating that the quantitative abundance of archaeal genera might be the most critical factor influencing methanogenesis performance thus the higher abundance of the archaeal population might have contributed to the superior mec ad performance under low hpr hac ratios 3 5 4 correlation analysis fig 7 shows a pca loading plot for the abundances of the microbial communities under different conditions pca analysis shows the clustering of methanobacterium geobacter and rhodocyclaceae under hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 however these genera have been negatively affected by higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 several fermenters vadinca02 sporomusa etc were dominated and closely located at the same quadrants of higher hpr hac ratios furthermore the scatterplot matrix and correlation coefficients indicated a positive correlation between methanobacterium r 1 0 geobacter r 0 9 and rhodocyclaceae r 0 8 at lower hpr hac ratios fig 8 and table s6 these genera showed a negative correlation 1 0 0 9 and 0 8 respectively at higher hpr hac ratios these results further indicate that higher hpr hac ratios significantly shifted the microbial communities particularly methanobacterium and geobacter 3 5 5 chord diagram chord diagram shows the relationship between the abundances of microbial genera on the anode and cathode biofilms fig 9 in bioanode geobacter was closely associated with methanobacterium a recent study confirmed diet based syntrophy between geobacter and methanobacterium zheng et al 2020 acetogenic genera vadinca02 sporomusa bosea and petrimonas were closely associated for biocathode methanobacterium showed a close association with acetobacterium as discussed earlier the enrichment of acetobacterium was accompanied by enhanced methanogenesis however geobacter and various acetogenic genera i e sporomusa and vadinca02 in biocathode were not linked to methanobacterium these results further revealed that enrichment of acetogens in biocathode affected the growth of methanogens at higher hpr hac ratios 3 6 multivariate analysis the multivariate principal components analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between various process variables and hpr hac ratios for anode biofilms most of the process variables cod removal eet gene expression eps archaeal cells mcra copies methane etc are located close to hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 fig 10 on the other hand bacterial cell numbers represented by 16s rrna gene copies are in a different quadrant closely linked to the higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 for cathode biofilms all the process variables are located in the same quadrants of hpr hac ratios of 0 5 and 1 5 moreover correlation coefficients and scatterplot matrix were tested to examine the correlation of process variables to different hpr hac ratios fig s11 and table s7 the process variables showed a relatively high positive correlation to hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 conversely a relatively negative correlation was observed at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 for instance eet gene expression showed a relatively positive correlation on the anode and cathode biofilms r 0 8 and 0 9 respectively at hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 however a noticeable negative correlation was observed at anode and cathode biofilms r 0 8 and 0 9 respectively at hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 also other process variables such as eps methane archaeal cells etc showed similar trends the only exception is the high positive correlation of bacteria cells r 0 8 enriched on the anode at higher hpr hac ratios of 2 5 and 5 thus these analyses further emphasized that superior mec ad performance was associated with lower hpr hac ratios 0 5 and 1 5 most variables were negatively correlated at higher hpr hac ratios 2 5 and 5 corroborating inferior mec ad performance 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that hpr hac ratios could considerably influence microbial syntrophy and competition in mec ad systems based on the results hpr hac ratios 1 5 would be critical to establishing a well balanced syntrophy between eab fermenters and methanogens notably hpr hac ratios 2 5 triggered microbial competition between h2 consuming acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens moreover a higher yield of propionate fermenters was also identified as a potential factor that resulted in lower methane yields under hpr hac ratios of 2 5 5 the numerical mec ad modeling results coincided with the experimental methane production and vfas degradation profiles although hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis seemed to be the key mechanism throughout hpr hac ratios of 2 5 5 could decrease the expression of eet associated genes and alter the eps composition by reducing protein content thus the significance of electro methanogenesis via direct electron transport cannot be overlooked the numerical mec ad model also considered hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in biocathode as a critical pathway therefore slight variations between experimental and modeled methane production profiles at lower hpr hac ratios could be attributed to the methanogenesis via direct electron transport which warrants further investigation moreover further research is required to elaborate on the significance of hpr hac ratios for real organic waste declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16111,the burrowing feeding and foraging activities of terrestrial and benthic organisms induce displacements of soil and sediment materials leading to a profound mixing of these media such particle movements called sediment reworking in aquatic environments and bioturbation in soils have been thoroughly studied and modeled in sediments where they affect organic matter mineralization and contaminant fluxes in comparison studies characterizing the translocation by soil burrowers of mineral particles organic matter and adsorbed contaminants are paradoxically fewer nevertheless models borrowed from aquatic ecology are used to predict the impact of bioturbation on organic matter turnover and contaminant transport in the soil however these models are based on hypotheses that have not been tested with adequate observations in soils and may not necessarily reflect the actual impact of soil burrowers on particle translocation this paper aims to i highlight the possible shortcomings linked to the current use of sediment reworking models for soils ii identify how recent progresses in aquatic ecology could help to circumvent these limitations and iii propose key steps to ensure that soil bioturbation models are built on solid foundations more accurate models of organic matter turnover soil evolution and contaminant transport in the soil are at stake graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioturbation sediment reworking particle tracking biodiffusive model random walks fractional brownian motion 1 bioturbation definition and significance the earliest study reporting on bioturbation the transport of soil particles carried out by the soil fauna essentially invertebrates including earthworms enchytraeids ants termites and millipedes dates back to 1837 that year in an address to the royal geological society charles darwin highlighted the role of earthworms on topsoil formation and concluded his lecture stating that every particle of the topsoil has passed through the intestines of worms darwin 1840 since that time bioturbation has received a considerable attention both experimentally and by modeling mostly in aquatic sediments where the word bioturbation refers to both the translocation of sediment particles by living organisms termed sediment reworking or bio mixing and to bio irrigation the transport of solute induced by these organisms kristensen et al 2012 van de velde and meysman 2016 in these media bioturbation affects organic matter mineralization and contaminant fluxes maire et al 2008 bioturbation also affects the vertical transfer of contaminants in the soil compared to aquatic environments the transport processes of organic or mineral soil particles as well as adsorbed contaminants during the burrowing foraging or feeding activities of soil organisms have received much less attention a search on the clarivate web of science indicates that soils have never accounted for more than twenty percent of the total number of studies published annually on bioturbation however particle translocation models borrowed from aquatic ecology have been used for more than 25 years to analyze the vertical transfer in soils of radionuclides and persistent contaminants organic matter turnover and soil evolution elzein and balesdent 1995 cousins et al 1999 jagercikova et al 2017 in 2006 meysman et al noted that aquatic and terrestrial bioturbations are studied by separate scientific communities which communicate their results in targeted disciplinary journals resulting in a rather slow transfer of ideas between the different research fields with the objective to foster this transfer the present perspective highlights salient features of bio mixing modeling in aquatic sediments next it discusses the shortcomings of applying these models in terrestrial environments before identifying critical steps to implement soil bioturbation models on firm foundations 2 bio mixing in aquatic environments aquatic ecologists have developed tracing and visualization techniques often involving radioisotopes or particulate fluorescent tracers to characterize sediment reworking by recording 1d profiles or 2d distributions of tracer concentrations over time maire et al 2008 they permitted to characterize the mixing behavior of different aquatic organisms and to propose a typology of bio mixing kristensen et al 2012 models generally one dimensional have been developed to relate bio mixing types to their impact at the macroscopic decimeter scale and at the sediment particle scale 2 1 biodiffusion and other related models some aquatic animals have been classified as biodiffusors because their behavior leads to a local mixing of sediment particles that can be well described by a diffusive process characterized by a unique parameter the biodiffusion coefficient d b m2 year 1 goldberg and koide 1962 the rationale is that after many translocation events at the microscopic scale the apparent movement of individual sediment particles appears to be random while at the macroscopic scale particle fluxes satisfy fick s law meysman et al 2008 metzler and klafter 2000 when organisms move the sediment particles in a non isotropic way an advection term characterized by a constant velocity w b m s 1 has been added to the diffusion equation to account for the resulting downward or upward movement of the particles it leads to the advection dispersion equation 1 c t z d b z c z w b z c where c t z represents the concentration of a transported substance or tracer t and z represent the time and depth respectively d b and w b are allowed to vary with depth the sediment porosity is assumed to be constant other organisms classified as upward conveyors behave in a different way they ingest particles at depth and release them as casts at the sediment water interface resulting in the slow burial of the sediment profile particle ingestion is accounted for by a sink term in the advection diffusion equation and particle egestion at the sediment water interface is included in the upper boundary condition a downward advection velocity w b that depends on the particle ingestion rate in the feeding zone completes the particle mass balance of this conveyor belt model robbins et al 1986 delmotte et al 2007 2 2 the stochastic approach in sediment reworking at the sediment particle scale the seemingly random movements of the particles have been mimicked by random walks that accumulate independent jumps separated by periods of immobility meysman et al 2008 2010 in the framework of continuous time random walks ctrws the length of each jump and the duration of each immobility period are stochastic variables they are drawn from independent jump length and waiting time distributions characterized by their variance σ² and mean τ respectively if σ and τ are finite it can be shown that a large number of translocation events achieves the continuous limit of the ctrw that coincides with the diffusive model brownian motion the ratio σ² 2τ is the biodiffusion coefficient if moreover the mean μ of the jump length distribution is non zero w b μ τ metzler and klafter 2000 meysman et al 2010 called the jump length and waiting time distributions the bioturbation fingerprint of the aquatic infauna bernard et al 2012 made a first step to determine this fingerprint experimentally by following the individual trajectories of fluorescent 35 µm tracer particles resulting from the activity of a bivalve in 2d aquaria for this the authors used high resolution cameras and an advanced particle tracking algorithm maire et al 2007 compared the capacity of the ctrw and of the advective diffusive model to describe tracer concentration profiles resulting from the activity of another bivalve they showed that when the experimental duration was short compared to τ a ctrw provided a better description of their data than and should be preferred over the advective diffusive model as expected from theory at longer time both the diffusive and stochastic models coincided this coincidence occurs provided a set of conditions are met including i finite values of σ² and τ and ii independence of successive translocation events meysman et al 2010 these authors proposed to classify the bio mixing types and associated models in two categories according to their asymptotic limit normal mixing for organism behaviors that lead to a diffusive mixing and anomalous mixing for behaviors that deviate from the asymptotic diffusive model 2 3 anomalous mixing anomalous mixing can be accounted for by at least three conceptually different classes of models that generalize the biodiffusive normal mixing model the first class assumes that the jump length distribution of the sediment particles may have an infinite variance σ² such distributions may result from infauna moving ingested particles over extremely long distances instead of just pushing them aside during foraging activities lévy flights with infinite variance are the paradigm of random walks making rare but very large displacements this formalism was used once to model the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments although the experimental data did not permit a compelling test of the validity of this approach reible and mohanty 2002 the second class is composed of ctrws combining jumps of finite variance with waiting time distributions having an infinite mean in this case a displacement observed between times t 1 and t 2 depends not only on t 2 t 1 but also on t 1 displacements are not stationary this leads to slower mixing dynamics than the biodiffusive model metzler and klafter 2000 such waiting time distributions may stem from particles immobile for long times such as particles in casts lining the walls of worm burrows that are likely to remain immobile for the lifespan of the tubes this possibility proposed by meysman et al 2008 has not been used in a model although the data reported by bernard et al 2012 strongly suggest considering it finally fractional brownian motions fbms mandelbrot 1982 are characterized by stationary particle displacements and strong correlations between displacements and between particle positions for these reasons they differ fundamentally from the abovementioned ctrws fbms can induce subdiffusive behavior as ctrws do but they also include superdiffusion superlinearly evolving mean squared displacement to date fbms have never been considered in sediment reworking studies however their success in describing mass transport in a variety of natural environments ganti et al 2009 barkai et al 2012 suggests considering them at least to challenge existing models most of these stochastic processes have probability density functions evolved by equations that have the same structure as eq 1 with w b 0 but present significant changes in the right hand side the diffusion coefficient may include a non local in time operator or a factor t a or the second order derivative may be replaced by a derivative of non integer order examples of sample paths for three of the stochastic processes mentioned above are shown fig 1 b left panel 3 bioturbation in soils 3 1 observations two particular forms of bioturbation have been extensively studied both under field and laboratory conditions i the formation of burrows by the soil macrofauna and their impact on water and soluble contaminant fluxes and ii the characterization of earthworm casts on the soil surface the repartition of casts inside the soil has received comparatively less attention e g capowiez et al 2011 the translocation of soil particles mineral or organic and of particulate or adsorbed contaminants during the digging activities of the soil burrowers or by ingestion transport and release have been even much less documented early field scale studies have documented the role of the soil macrofauna on the transport of radionuclides from nuclear fallouts mccabe et al 1991 müller lemans and van dorp 1996 tyler et al 2001 in controlled conditions at the mesocosm scale the few published studies highlighted considerable downward movements of micro and macro plastics huerta lwanga et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 nanoparticles baccaro et al 2019 wood ash and fluorescent tracer particles mctavish et al 2020 upward or downward movements of arsenic covey et al 2010 and upward movements of mercury from a lower contaminated soil layer ferber et al 2019 bioturbation by organisms of the soil mesofauna such as enchytraeids has been overlooked in spite of their large abundance and activity in the topsoil the few studies that addressed enchytraeids bioturbation concluded that they may influence porosity and aggregation and be the main organisms responsible for cesium redistribution in the topsoil didden 1990 van vliet et al 1993 tyler et al 2001 3 2 bioturbation an essential process in models of soil functioning the transport of particles by soil burrowers cannot be ignored in models of soil functioning such as carbon nutrients and water cycling accordingly models of organic matter turnover phosphorous cycle soil formation and transport of strongly adsorbing and persistent contaminants usually include a bioturbation process elzein and balesdent 1995 cousins et al 1999 finke and hutson 2008 li et al 2019 gray et al 2020 in these models bioturbation is essentially described at the macroscopic scale on the basis of the advective diffusive model directly borrowed from aquatic sediments ecology without further justification of its relevance there are two exceptions radionuclide transport was modeled i at the microscopic particle scale with a continuous space random walk model bunzl 2002 and ii at the macroscopic scale using the conveyor belt model in the same form as in aquatic sediments matisoff et al 2011 or adapted to account for anecic earthworms that release a fraction of the ingested soil particles in the soil profile and the remaining on the soil surface jarvis et al 2010 3 3 shortcomings in terrestrial bioturbation modeling in a few instances models of soil functioning were confronted with extensive datasets allowing the comparison of several models differing in the processes they incorporated for example jarvis et al 2010 and matisoff et al 2011 showed that radionuclide transport in the upper soil could not be described by a solute transport model that did not include bioturbation jarvis et al 2010 further showed that a simple biodiffusion model was inadequate to model these data and that among the three tested models the conveyor belt model was the best candidate but in most cases the models of soil functioning i accounted for several other mechanisms beside bioturbation e g water and solute transfer geochemistry tillage soil volume changes ii their outputs have been compared to data collected in experimental situations that were not specifically designed to study bioturbation mechanisms and often lacked a characterization of the species abundance biomass and habits of soil burrowers iii the parameters d b and w b of the advective diffusive model have mainly been determined by adjusting them to fit the often sparse experimental data overall this probably i limited the capacity of these studies to test the adequacy of the bioturbation model hypotheses and ii yielded values of d b and w b that cannot be used to predict bioturbation in different experimental situations indeed in general different structures of complex models and or different sets of parameters often reproduce equally well observed experimental data beven and freer 2001 a spatially uniform value of d b was often found insufficient to describe experimental data an exponential decrease in d b with depth presumably supported by a decrease of the number of soil burrowers with depth allowed a better fit of the model covey et al 2010 keyvanshokouhi et al 2019 furthermore to represent the bioturbation pattern arising from epigeic and endogeic earthworms that are active close to the soil surface and in the first 20 cm of soil respectively tonneijck et al 2016 used a biodiffusion coefficient that varied with depth according to the sum of two gaussians this multiplicity of strategies to reproduce experimental data suggests that the advective diffusive model borrowed from aquatic sediments although it is conceptually simple and easy to implement which probably explains its success may not be the most appropriate concept to model bioturbation in soils to parameterize the more elaborate models proposed by jarvis et al 2010 or matisoff et al 2011 it is necessary to know a priori the distributions with depth of particle ingestion and egestion rates data that are not available in the literature so far in the absence of such data both authors hypothesized uniform ingestion rates with depth their models were able to fit reasonably well the profiles of radionuclide concentrations however the model by matisoff et al 2011 overestimated radionuclide concentration next to the surface the model by jarvis et al 2010 led to fitted ingestion rate and fraction of egestion at the soil surface that were respectively six fold higher and twice smaller than estimated a priori from biological observations these mixed results suggest that detailed observations of soil invertebrate behavior are required to parameterize these models and to test their underlying assumptions finally to be valid the advective diffusive model requires finite values for σ and τ however just as in aquatic sediments it is not unlikely that soil particles released as casts lining the walls of earthworm burrows will remain immobile for long periods of time typically the lifespan of the galleries up to seven years potvin and lilleskov 2017 this suggests considering ctrw models with possibly infinite average waiting times moreover models based on lévy flights should not be disregarded since lévy flights were found to optimize the success of random food searches for a number of living organisms viswanathan et al 1999 whether this occurs during the foraging activities of soil invertebrates and affects particle translocation remains an open question lastly the independence of successive bioturbation events a prerequisite for normal biodiffusion has never been examined in soils because the possibilities of particle immobilization long distance movement and correlations of bioturbation events have not been ruled out in soils the current use of the biodiffusive model does not rest on solid foundations 4 toward bioturbation models based on solid ground 4 1 characterize bioturbation and soil invertebrate behavior there is a considerable dearth of experimental studies characterizing and quantifying the transport of soil particles by the soil fauna at the macroscopic scale soil ecologists should address this issue by adapting experimental situations used to characterize bio mixing in aquatic sediments these may include recording fluorescent tracer profiles resulting from bioturbation by various soil burrowers alone and combined using 2d or 3d terraria as recently proposed by mctavish et al 2020 and illustrated fig 1a right panel in three dimensions x ray tomography a technique used to characterize invertebrate burrows could also help to quantify bioturbation nondestructively at several time points during the particle translocation process this may be achieved by using particulate contrast agents and ad hoc image processing methods as proposed by schlüter and vogel 2016 and grayling et al 2018 similar efforts should also target small organisms such as enchytraeids taking advantage on the increasingly easier access to laboratory micro tomography setups these techniques would provide richer space and time resolved data compared to the sparse profiles of tracer concentration collected by destructive methods and would help to discriminate among different models based on different process descriptions or structures during comparative model testing exercises these experiments should be contemplated over sufficiently long time scales if they aim at testing the capability of the diffusive model to describe the data it is also critical to quantify across different soil classes and climates specific organism behaviors that are needed to parameterize and test further existing models these include particle ingestion and egestion rates as a function of depth ingestion selectivity for a contaminant the impact of food abundance type and location on bioturbation 4 2 test the validity of the diffusive bioturbation model at the particle scale the current limit to test the validity of the advective diffusive bioturbation model in soils and more generally to choose which model could be used successfully is the absence of data quantifying the individual trajectories of tracer particles in a first step the pioneering experimental situation proposed by bernard et al 2012 should be adapted to determine these trajectories in 2d terraria fig 1a left panel tracking tracer particles in large 3d soil cores remains a challenge particle tracking by positron emission tomography may be a suitable tool to address this once adapted to cope with the long monitoring periods required in bioturbation studies parker et al 1997 the next step will be to determine the most suitable class of models to describe these trajectories even before attempting to determine hypothetical jump length and waiting time distributions that are only meaningful if the trajectories actually correspond to ctrws this task will be facilitated by recent theoretical efforts that led to powerful diagnostic tools to analyze experimental trajectories of individual particles barkai et al 2012 one of them the p variation is an easily computed functional of the individual particle trajectories it is highly sensitive to whether these trajectories correspond to ctrws including the advective diffusive model or to fractional brownian motions magdziarz et al 2009 2010 if the particle trajectories correspond to ctrws the p variation will contain information on the waiting time distribution it will also indicate whether lévy flights based models are worth being considered finally it is insensitive to confinement constraints a situation that is likely to occur in the finite terraria or soil cores used to determine the experimental particle trajectories in view of these properties this tool represents an appealing opportunity to test previously proposed bioturbation models both in terrestrial and aquatic environment being able to determine the most appropriate model would represent a significant progress as the stochastic transport models mentioned above have significantly different distributions for various quantities one example is the first passage time which could help to assess the risk of a contaminant reaching a specific depth before being degraded finally other functionals of particle trajectories metzler et al 2014 krapf et al 2019 and the large deviation approach thapa et al 2021 will help to estimate the parameters of the models highlighted by the p variation 5 conclusions bio mixing models borrowed from the aquatic sediment community and the biodiffusive model in particular are used to represent bioturbation in soils despite a substantial lack of biological observations to test the relevance of their hypotheses in this substrate and to determine parameter values for soil organisms to tackle this issue soil ecologists must address the long overlooked topic of soil particle transport by the soil fauna advances in aquatic ecology will contribute to this goal first experimental situations successfully used in sediments should help characterizing bioturbation by different soil burrowers at the decimeter and particle scales as for sediments this will allow the development of a typology of bioturbation and associated models in soils second in sediments a recent body of literature has discussed the limitations of the biodiffusive model and suggested alternative models to simulate bio mixing the conclusions of these publications are generic and are worth considering when modeling soil bioturbation choosing the best model for a particular dataset parameterizing this model and comparing its outputs with comprehensive data are concerns shared by the soil and sediment scientific communities accordingly the advances in mathematics and non destructive imaging highlighted in this perspective are relevant in both aquatic and terrestrial environments meeting these experimental and modeling objectives will require a strong cooperation

16111,the burrowing feeding and foraging activities of terrestrial and benthic organisms induce displacements of soil and sediment materials leading to a profound mixing of these media such particle movements called sediment reworking in aquatic environments and bioturbation in soils have been thoroughly studied and modeled in sediments where they affect organic matter mineralization and contaminant fluxes in comparison studies characterizing the translocation by soil burrowers of mineral particles organic matter and adsorbed contaminants are paradoxically fewer nevertheless models borrowed from aquatic ecology are used to predict the impact of bioturbation on organic matter turnover and contaminant transport in the soil however these models are based on hypotheses that have not been tested with adequate observations in soils and may not necessarily reflect the actual impact of soil burrowers on particle translocation this paper aims to i highlight the possible shortcomings linked to the current use of sediment reworking models for soils ii identify how recent progresses in aquatic ecology could help to circumvent these limitations and iii propose key steps to ensure that soil bioturbation models are built on solid foundations more accurate models of organic matter turnover soil evolution and contaminant transport in the soil are at stake graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioturbation sediment reworking particle tracking biodiffusive model random walks fractional brownian motion 1 bioturbation definition and significance the earliest study reporting on bioturbation the transport of soil particles carried out by the soil fauna essentially invertebrates including earthworms enchytraeids ants termites and millipedes dates back to 1837 that year in an address to the royal geological society charles darwin highlighted the role of earthworms on topsoil formation and concluded his lecture stating that every particle of the topsoil has passed through the intestines of worms darwin 1840 since that time bioturbation has received a considerable attention both experimentally and by modeling mostly in aquatic sediments where the word bioturbation refers to both the translocation of sediment particles by living organisms termed sediment reworking or bio mixing and to bio irrigation the transport of solute induced by these organisms kristensen et al 2012 van de velde and meysman 2016 in these media bioturbation affects organic matter mineralization and contaminant fluxes maire et al 2008 bioturbation also affects the vertical transfer of contaminants in the soil compared to aquatic environments the transport processes of organic or mineral soil particles as well as adsorbed contaminants during the burrowing foraging or feeding activities of soil organisms have received much less attention a search on the clarivate web of science indicates that soils have never accounted for more than twenty percent of the total number of studies published annually on bioturbation however particle translocation models borrowed from aquatic ecology have been used for more than 25 years to analyze the vertical transfer in soils of radionuclides and persistent contaminants organic matter turnover and soil evolution elzein and balesdent 1995 cousins et al 1999 jagercikova et al 2017 in 2006 meysman et al noted that aquatic and terrestrial bioturbations are studied by separate scientific communities which communicate their results in targeted disciplinary journals resulting in a rather slow transfer of ideas between the different research fields with the objective to foster this transfer the present perspective highlights salient features of bio mixing modeling in aquatic sediments next it discusses the shortcomings of applying these models in terrestrial environments before identifying critical steps to implement soil bioturbation models on firm foundations 2 bio mixing in aquatic environments aquatic ecologists have developed tracing and visualization techniques often involving radioisotopes or particulate fluorescent tracers to characterize sediment reworking by recording 1d profiles or 2d distributions of tracer concentrations over time maire et al 2008 they permitted to characterize the mixing behavior of different aquatic organisms and to propose a typology of bio mixing kristensen et al 2012 models generally one dimensional have been developed to relate bio mixing types to their impact at the macroscopic decimeter scale and at the sediment particle scale 2 1 biodiffusion and other related models some aquatic animals have been classified as biodiffusors because their behavior leads to a local mixing of sediment particles that can be well described by a diffusive process characterized by a unique parameter the biodiffusion coefficient d b m2 year 1 goldberg and koide 1962 the rationale is that after many translocation events at the microscopic scale the apparent movement of individual sediment particles appears to be random while at the macroscopic scale particle fluxes satisfy fick s law meysman et al 2008 metzler and klafter 2000 when organisms move the sediment particles in a non isotropic way an advection term characterized by a constant velocity w b m s 1 has been added to the diffusion equation to account for the resulting downward or upward movement of the particles it leads to the advection dispersion equation 1 c t z d b z c z w b z c where c t z represents the concentration of a transported substance or tracer t and z represent the time and depth respectively d b and w b are allowed to vary with depth the sediment porosity is assumed to be constant other organisms classified as upward conveyors behave in a different way they ingest particles at depth and release them as casts at the sediment water interface resulting in the slow burial of the sediment profile particle ingestion is accounted for by a sink term in the advection diffusion equation and particle egestion at the sediment water interface is included in the upper boundary condition a downward advection velocity w b that depends on the particle ingestion rate in the feeding zone completes the particle mass balance of this conveyor belt model robbins et al 1986 delmotte et al 2007 2 2 the stochastic approach in sediment reworking at the sediment particle scale the seemingly random movements of the particles have been mimicked by random walks that accumulate independent jumps separated by periods of immobility meysman et al 2008 2010 in the framework of continuous time random walks ctrws the length of each jump and the duration of each immobility period are stochastic variables they are drawn from independent jump length and waiting time distributions characterized by their variance σ² and mean τ respectively if σ and τ are finite it can be shown that a large number of translocation events achieves the continuous limit of the ctrw that coincides with the diffusive model brownian motion the ratio σ² 2τ is the biodiffusion coefficient if moreover the mean μ of the jump length distribution is non zero w b μ τ metzler and klafter 2000 meysman et al 2010 called the jump length and waiting time distributions the bioturbation fingerprint of the aquatic infauna bernard et al 2012 made a first step to determine this fingerprint experimentally by following the individual trajectories of fluorescent 35 µm tracer particles resulting from the activity of a bivalve in 2d aquaria for this the authors used high resolution cameras and an advanced particle tracking algorithm maire et al 2007 compared the capacity of the ctrw and of the advective diffusive model to describe tracer concentration profiles resulting from the activity of another bivalve they showed that when the experimental duration was short compared to τ a ctrw provided a better description of their data than and should be preferred over the advective diffusive model as expected from theory at longer time both the diffusive and stochastic models coincided this coincidence occurs provided a set of conditions are met including i finite values of σ² and τ and ii independence of successive translocation events meysman et al 2010 these authors proposed to classify the bio mixing types and associated models in two categories according to their asymptotic limit normal mixing for organism behaviors that lead to a diffusive mixing and anomalous mixing for behaviors that deviate from the asymptotic diffusive model 2 3 anomalous mixing anomalous mixing can be accounted for by at least three conceptually different classes of models that generalize the biodiffusive normal mixing model the first class assumes that the jump length distribution of the sediment particles may have an infinite variance σ² such distributions may result from infauna moving ingested particles over extremely long distances instead of just pushing them aside during foraging activities lévy flights with infinite variance are the paradigm of random walks making rare but very large displacements this formalism was used once to model the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments although the experimental data did not permit a compelling test of the validity of this approach reible and mohanty 2002 the second class is composed of ctrws combining jumps of finite variance with waiting time distributions having an infinite mean in this case a displacement observed between times t 1 and t 2 depends not only on t 2 t 1 but also on t 1 displacements are not stationary this leads to slower mixing dynamics than the biodiffusive model metzler and klafter 2000 such waiting time distributions may stem from particles immobile for long times such as particles in casts lining the walls of worm burrows that are likely to remain immobile for the lifespan of the tubes this possibility proposed by meysman et al 2008 has not been used in a model although the data reported by bernard et al 2012 strongly suggest considering it finally fractional brownian motions fbms mandelbrot 1982 are characterized by stationary particle displacements and strong correlations between displacements and between particle positions for these reasons they differ fundamentally from the abovementioned ctrws fbms can induce subdiffusive behavior as ctrws do but they also include superdiffusion superlinearly evolving mean squared displacement to date fbms have never been considered in sediment reworking studies however their success in describing mass transport in a variety of natural environments ganti et al 2009 barkai et al 2012 suggests considering them at least to challenge existing models most of these stochastic processes have probability density functions evolved by equations that have the same structure as eq 1 with w b 0 but present significant changes in the right hand side the diffusion coefficient may include a non local in time operator or a factor t a or the second order derivative may be replaced by a derivative of non integer order examples of sample paths for three of the stochastic processes mentioned above are shown fig 1 b left panel 3 bioturbation in soils 3 1 observations two particular forms of bioturbation have been extensively studied both under field and laboratory conditions i the formation of burrows by the soil macrofauna and their impact on water and soluble contaminant fluxes and ii the characterization of earthworm casts on the soil surface the repartition of casts inside the soil has received comparatively less attention e g capowiez et al 2011 the translocation of soil particles mineral or organic and of particulate or adsorbed contaminants during the digging activities of the soil burrowers or by ingestion transport and release have been even much less documented early field scale studies have documented the role of the soil macrofauna on the transport of radionuclides from nuclear fallouts mccabe et al 1991 müller lemans and van dorp 1996 tyler et al 2001 in controlled conditions at the mesocosm scale the few published studies highlighted considerable downward movements of micro and macro plastics huerta lwanga et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 nanoparticles baccaro et al 2019 wood ash and fluorescent tracer particles mctavish et al 2020 upward or downward movements of arsenic covey et al 2010 and upward movements of mercury from a lower contaminated soil layer ferber et al 2019 bioturbation by organisms of the soil mesofauna such as enchytraeids has been overlooked in spite of their large abundance and activity in the topsoil the few studies that addressed enchytraeids bioturbation concluded that they may influence porosity and aggregation and be the main organisms responsible for cesium redistribution in the topsoil didden 1990 van vliet et al 1993 tyler et al 2001 3 2 bioturbation an essential process in models of soil functioning the transport of particles by soil burrowers cannot be ignored in models of soil functioning such as carbon nutrients and water cycling accordingly models of organic matter turnover phosphorous cycle soil formation and transport of strongly adsorbing and persistent contaminants usually include a bioturbation process elzein and balesdent 1995 cousins et al 1999 finke and hutson 2008 li et al 2019 gray et al 2020 in these models bioturbation is essentially described at the macroscopic scale on the basis of the advective diffusive model directly borrowed from aquatic sediments ecology without further justification of its relevance there are two exceptions radionuclide transport was modeled i at the microscopic particle scale with a continuous space random walk model bunzl 2002 and ii at the macroscopic scale using the conveyor belt model in the same form as in aquatic sediments matisoff et al 2011 or adapted to account for anecic earthworms that release a fraction of the ingested soil particles in the soil profile and the remaining on the soil surface jarvis et al 2010 3 3 shortcomings in terrestrial bioturbation modeling in a few instances models of soil functioning were confronted with extensive datasets allowing the comparison of several models differing in the processes they incorporated for example jarvis et al 2010 and matisoff et al 2011 showed that radionuclide transport in the upper soil could not be described by a solute transport model that did not include bioturbation jarvis et al 2010 further showed that a simple biodiffusion model was inadequate to model these data and that among the three tested models the conveyor belt model was the best candidate but in most cases the models of soil functioning i accounted for several other mechanisms beside bioturbation e g water and solute transfer geochemistry tillage soil volume changes ii their outputs have been compared to data collected in experimental situations that were not specifically designed to study bioturbation mechanisms and often lacked a characterization of the species abundance biomass and habits of soil burrowers iii the parameters d b and w b of the advective diffusive model have mainly been determined by adjusting them to fit the often sparse experimental data overall this probably i limited the capacity of these studies to test the adequacy of the bioturbation model hypotheses and ii yielded values of d b and w b that cannot be used to predict bioturbation in different experimental situations indeed in general different structures of complex models and or different sets of parameters often reproduce equally well observed experimental data beven and freer 2001 a spatially uniform value of d b was often found insufficient to describe experimental data an exponential decrease in d b with depth presumably supported by a decrease of the number of soil burrowers with depth allowed a better fit of the model covey et al 2010 keyvanshokouhi et al 2019 furthermore to represent the bioturbation pattern arising from epigeic and endogeic earthworms that are active close to the soil surface and in the first 20 cm of soil respectively tonneijck et al 2016 used a biodiffusion coefficient that varied with depth according to the sum of two gaussians this multiplicity of strategies to reproduce experimental data suggests that the advective diffusive model borrowed from aquatic sediments although it is conceptually simple and easy to implement which probably explains its success may not be the most appropriate concept to model bioturbation in soils to parameterize the more elaborate models proposed by jarvis et al 2010 or matisoff et al 2011 it is necessary to know a priori the distributions with depth of particle ingestion and egestion rates data that are not available in the literature so far in the absence of such data both authors hypothesized uniform ingestion rates with depth their models were able to fit reasonably well the profiles of radionuclide concentrations however the model by matisoff et al 2011 overestimated radionuclide concentration next to the surface the model by jarvis et al 2010 led to fitted ingestion rate and fraction of egestion at the soil surface that were respectively six fold higher and twice smaller than estimated a priori from biological observations these mixed results suggest that detailed observations of soil invertebrate behavior are required to parameterize these models and to test their underlying assumptions finally to be valid the advective diffusive model requires finite values for σ and τ however just as in aquatic sediments it is not unlikely that soil particles released as casts lining the walls of earthworm burrows will remain immobile for long periods of time typically the lifespan of the galleries up to seven years potvin and lilleskov 2017 this suggests considering ctrw models with possibly infinite average waiting times moreover models based on lévy flights should not be disregarded since lévy flights were found to optimize the success of random food searches for a number of living organisms viswanathan et al 1999 whether this occurs during the foraging activities of soil invertebrates and affects particle translocation remains an open question lastly the independence of successive bioturbation events a prerequisite for normal biodiffusion has never been examined in soils because the possibilities of particle immobilization long distance movement and correlations of bioturbation events have not been ruled out in soils the current use of the biodiffusive model does not rest on solid foundations 4 toward bioturbation models based on solid ground 4 1 characterize bioturbation and soil invertebrate behavior there is a considerable dearth of experimental studies characterizing and quantifying the transport of soil particles by the soil fauna at the macroscopic scale soil ecologists should address this issue by adapting experimental situations used to characterize bio mixing in aquatic sediments these may include recording fluorescent tracer profiles resulting from bioturbation by various soil burrowers alone and combined using 2d or 3d terraria as recently proposed by mctavish et al 2020 and illustrated fig 1a right panel in three dimensions x ray tomography a technique used to characterize invertebrate burrows could also help to quantify bioturbation nondestructively at several time points during the particle translocation process this may be achieved by using particulate contrast agents and ad hoc image processing methods as proposed by schlüter and vogel 2016 and grayling et al 2018 similar efforts should also target small organisms such as enchytraeids taking advantage on the increasingly easier access to laboratory micro tomography setups these techniques would provide richer space and time resolved data compared to the sparse profiles of tracer concentration collected by destructive methods and would help to discriminate among different models based on different process descriptions or structures during comparative model testing exercises these experiments should be contemplated over sufficiently long time scales if they aim at testing the capability of the diffusive model to describe the data it is also critical to quantify across different soil classes and climates specific organism behaviors that are needed to parameterize and test further existing models these include particle ingestion and egestion rates as a function of depth ingestion selectivity for a contaminant the impact of food abundance type and location on bioturbation 4 2 test the validity of the diffusive bioturbation model at the particle scale the current limit to test the validity of the advective diffusive

16112,recently bisulfite activated permanganate mno4 mn vii process has attracted considerable attention as a novel class of advanced oxidation technology for destruction of organic contaminants in water however disputes over the underlying activation mechanism as well as reactive species generated in the mn vii bisulfite system remain for a long period due to the fairly complex chemistry involved in this system this article aims to present a critical review on scientific development of the mn vii bisulfite system with particular focus on the generation and contribution of various reactive intermediates both reactive manganese species rmns i e soluble mn iii mn v and mn vi and radical species primarily so4 are identified as the oxidizing components responsible for enhanced degradation of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system bisulfite plays a dual role of being an activating agent for reactive intermediates generation and acting as a complexing agent to stabilize rmns solution chemistry e g the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph the type of contaminants ligands and water matrix components greatly impacts the generation and consumption of rmns and radicals thus influencing the degradation kinetics and pathways of organics particularly dissolved oxygen do is a vital factor for driving the oxidation of organics since the absence of do can block the generation of so4 and meantime causes the consumption of rmns by excess so3 as a strong reductant interestingly ferrate feo4 2 fe vi and hexavalent chromium cro4 2 hcro4 cr vi that are high valent metal oxyanions analogous to mn vii can be activated by bisulfite via a similar pathway i e both high valent metal oxo intermediates and reactive radicals are involved furthermore key knowledge gaps are identified and future research needs are proposed to address the potential challenges encountered in practical application of the mn vii bisulfite oxidation technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate bisulfite reactive manganese species radicals dissolved oxygen 1 introduction permanganate mno4 mn vii as a green and versatile industrial oxidant has been widely used by water utilities for in situ remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater and for control of soluble iron ii and manganese ii taste and odor compounds as well as biological growth hu et al 2010 2011 singh and lee 2001 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 compared with other oxidants mn vii is attractive due to its comparative stability effectiveness over a wide ph range ease of handling relatively low cost and no formation of chlorinated or brominated byproducts moreover the reduction product of mn vii i e manganese iii iv solid is environmentally benign and can act as coagulants to improve the performance of coagulation filtration processes or as adsorbents oxidants to promote the removal of the constituents of concern jiang et al 2009 stone 1987 zhang and huang 2003 although mn vii possesses a high reduction potential eh 0 1 68v hu et al 2009 it is recognized as a selective oxidizing agent and the kinetic reactivity of mn vii with contaminants is highly variable depending upon the structure of target organics it is known that mn vii is prone to react with contaminants containing electron rich moieties e g phenols anilines olefins and thiols whereas it shows a rather limited reactivity toward some refractory pollutants e g caffeine caf chlorinated methanes and ethanes and simple aromatics jiang et al 2009 2012 ladbury and cullis 1958 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 zhang et al 2014 this leads to longer reaction time or higher oxidant dosage for water decontamination which in some degree restrains the application of mn vii in actual engineering processes given the unpleasant color if it is overdosed thus recent efforts have been focused on developing green and effective technologies to activate mn vii for achieving efficient removal of organic contaminants reactive manganese species rmns including soluble trivalent manganese mn iii hypomanganate mn v and manganate mn vi are vital mn intermediates generated in situ during mn vii reaction which have attracted much attention in recent studies and have initiated a new category of mn vii based advanced oxidation processes gao et al 2019 guo et al 2018 sun et al 2015 2016 von gunten 2018 zhu et al 2019a these intermediates are documented to be highly reactive towards a variety of contaminants and thus can participate in transformation of contaminants by mn vii with a reduction potential close to that of molecular oxygen eh 0 mn iii mn ii 1 51 v kostka et al 1995 zhu et al 2019a soluble mn iii is recognized as a powerful oxidant and plays an important role in bio geochemical process and water treatment duckworth et al 2009 kostka et al 1995 madison et al 2013 schippers et al 2005 zheng et al 2006 nevertheless soluble free mn iii is unstable and undergoes spontaneous disproportionation to soluble mn ii mn2 and solid mn iv eq 1 causing it to be very short lived in solution klewicki and morgan 1998 kostka et al 1995 1 2 mn iii mn ii mn iv thus the oxidation of contaminants by mn iii occurs only in the presence of stabilizing agents or under extremely acidic conditions where relatively long lived mn iii species are involved davies 1969 gao et al 2019 klewicki and morgan 1998 studies have demonstrated that the long lived mn iii can trigger fast oxidation of many organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds e g 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp and bisphenol a bpa pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin paracetamol and carbamazepine cbz and organophosphorus pesticides e g methyl parathion and dichlorvos wang et al 2019a sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019b

earlier studies which is clearly confirmed by using the stopped flow detection as well as spectrophotometric techniques in these cases mn v and mn vi exist as either the intermediate complexes of organic molecules or relatively stable products due to strong alkaline conditions and do not play an oxidizing role howbeit mn v species exhibit a high reactivity toward organic compounds e g organic

compounds such as phenolate ion alkenes thioanisoles some alcohols and aldehydes lee and sebastián 1981 záhonyi budó and simándi 1995 1996 based on the above activating mn vii to produce the potent rmns seems to be a promising method for expanding the availability of mn vii in water treatment nowadays activation of mn vii by sulfur reducing agents especially bisulfite hso3 so3 2 for in situ generation of rmns has drawn increasing attention chen et al 2020 gao et al 2017 2019 sun et al 2015 2016 bisulfite with a redox potential of 0 93 v is a widely used reducing agent which is industrially available relatively cheaper and low toxic and thus can be applied in water treatment and environmental engineering processes chen et al 2012 guo et al 2013 wu et al 2021 large amounts of studies have confirmed that bisulfite can activate mn vii to rapidly oxidize various organic contaminants even some mn vii resistant contaminants e g benzene nitrobenzene nb 4 nitrophenol 4 np and caf chen et al 2020 sun et al 2015 2016 gao et al 2017 2019 shi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 chow and leung 2019 however disputes over the underlying activation mechanism and reactive species generated in the mn vii bisulfite system remain for a long period since various manganese species and oxysulfur radicals e g so3 so4 and so5 may be produced according to the chemistry of manganese and sulfur moreover the generation of these reactive intermediates as well as their reactivity and stability are highly dependent on solution chemistry which further complicates the reaction process therefore it is necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment on potential mechanism of bisulfite activating mn vii under various conditions to unite the theoretical cognition and to give better guidance for future research and engineering application of this novel oxidation technology to the best of our knowledge no review article focusing on bisulfite activated mn vii oxidation for enhanced removal of organic pollutants in water has been published despite a great quantity of researches and discussion so in this review we aim to summarize the theoretical development of the mn vii bisulfite system with an emphasis on various reactive intermediates i e rmns and radical species generated during the reaction disputes over the formation of these reactive species and their roles in organics oxidation are elaborated and influences of some critical factors e g dissolved oxygen do the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph contaminant types ligands and water matrix components are discussed particularly since ferrate feo4 2 fe vi and hexavalent chromium cro4 2 hcro4 cr vi are high valent metal oxyanions analogous to mn vii their reaction with bisulfite may undergo a similar pathway to the mn vii bisulfite system so primary reactive species generated during activation of fe vi cr vi by bisulfite under different conditions are also discussed for comparison to mn vii furthermore key knowledge gaps are identified and future research needs are proposed 2 mechanism of mn vii activation by bisulfite 2 1 role of soluble mn iii sun et al 2015 2016 first employed bisulfite to activate mn vii for degradation of organic pollutants in water and they suggested the mn vii bisulfite system as a novel advanced oxidation technology for water and wastewater treatment the mn vii bisulfite system oxidized many organics i e phenol ciprofloxacin and methyl blue at initial ph 5 0 with high pseudo first order rate constants kobs 60 150 s 1 which were 5 6 orders of magnitude higher than those measured for mn vii alone and 5 to 7 orders of magnitude higher than those obtained by conventional advanced oxidation processes such as uv uv h2o2 and photo fenton for water treatment it could also degrade some contaminants such nb and caf that were hardly removed by mn vii alone attracted by the remarkable oxidation ability of the mn vii bisulfite system researchers have done a great deal of work in recent few years to determine the removal efficiency of various contaminants as well as to probe into the reactive intermediates responsible for the strengthened oxidation in this system table 1 summarizes the reported degradation performance of various organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system under various conditions as well as the proposed reactive species in earlier studies it was reported that soluble aquo and or hydroxo mn iii i e noncomplexed with ligands other than h2o and oh was in situ formed from reduction of mn vii by bisulfite under acidic and neutral ph conditions eq 2 serving as a strong oxidant for significantly enhanced degradation of organic contaminants sun et al 2015 2016 2018a b guo et al 2017 2 mn vii 2 hso 3 mn iii 2 so 4 2 sun et al 2015 employed the stopped flow spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance at 258 nm that corresponded to the absorbance peak of mn iii and the result confirmed the generation of mn iii in the mn vii bisulfite system meanwhile they found that the presence of pyrophosphate pp a nonredox active ligand greatly inhibited the degradation of phenol where the occurrence of mn iii pp complex was observed by uv visible spectrophotometer according to the loss of absorbance arising from mn iii pp complex in the presence of phenol the authors proposed that aquo and or hydroxo mn iii reacted with organics more rapidly than its complexation with pp to produce the mn iii pp complex however the formation rate kf of mn iii complexes with ligands is reported to be at near diffusion controlled rates based on jahn teller distortion of mn iii and its water exchange rate luther et al 2015 oldham et al 2015 gao et al 2017 mn h2o 6 3 has a t2g 3 eg 1 electron configuration exhibiting jahn teller distortion from octahedral geometry and thus has a diffusion controlled water exchange rate of 109 s 1 similar to the case of cr h2o 6 2 luther et al 2015 helm and merbach 2005 metal cations react with ligands usually at rate constants similar to the values of water exchange rates margerum et al 1978 by adopting the kf value of 109 m 1 s 1 the calculated stability constants for mn iii complex are comparable to those for fe iii ligand complex indicating that the estimate for kf 109 m 1 s 1 is reasonable luther et al 2015 moreover their results are quite contrary to the acknowledged fact that the spontaneous disproportionation of aquo and hydroxo mn iii results in its impossible contribution to the oxidation of organic contaminants unless under certain conditions e g at extremely acidic ph or in the presence of complexing ligands davies 1969 klewicki and morgan 1998 alternatively gao et al 2017 proposed that bisulfite could act as a complexing agent to stabilize mn iii eq 3 other than as a reductant for mn iii production from mn vii eq 2 and the resulting mn iii sulfito complexes were responsible for enhanced oxidation of contaminants 3 mn iii hso 3 mn iii sulfito this was in good accordance with the documented fact that bisulfite had appreciable complexing ability for metal ions e g fe iii cd ii ce iii and ag i conklin and hoffmann 1988a b livingstone 1965 in their study several lines of evidence was provided to support the role of bisulfite as a complexing agent including that i both rate and extent of the organic substrate bisphenol s bps loss in the mn vii bisulfite system maximized at the mn vii bisulfite ratio of 1 5 1 10 appreciably higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 1 2 eq 2 ii other sulfur reducing agents such as hydrosulfite and thiosulfate also exhibited activating effects for mn vii where the loss of bps showed the dependency on the mn vii hydrosulfite or mn vii thiosulfate ratio similar to the case of bisulfite and iii arsenite as iii that had no stabilizing effect for mn iii but could react with mn vii to produce mn iii as an intermediate eq 4 lee et al 2011 showed negligible activating effect while the addition of bisulfite significantly enhanced the degradation of bps in the mn vii as iii system even though as iii outcompeted bisulfite for mn vii similarly duan et al 2022 also suggested that other reductants e g mn ii could not effectively enhance the oxidation of organic compounds by mn vii like sulfur reducing agents 4 mn vii 2 as iii mn iii as v in addition to sulfur reducing agents mn iii can also be stabilized in solution as mn iii complexes by other ligands referred as mn iii l hereafter such as pp oxalate nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and humic acid ha which results in the increase of organics particularly phenolic compounds oxidation rates by mn vii jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 gao et al 2018 investigated the transformation of triclosan tcs one of the most widely used antimicrobials by mn iii l that was freshly prepared by stoichiometric reaction of mn vii with mn ii in excess ligands e g pp or nta and adjusted to desired ph it was found that mn iii l showed appreciable reactivity toward tcs and the reaction resulted in formation of dimers hydroxylated as well as quinone like products this transformation pathway was markedly different from that involved in mn vii alone oxidation where dcp was identified as the major product of tcs one interesting finding was that the addition of various ligands i e pp nta ha and bisulfite only slightly influenced the yield of dcp although they greatly accelerated the degradation of tcs by mn vii in other words mn iii l did not play a role as the major oxidant to transform tcs in mn vii ligand systems otherwise dimers hydroxylated and quinone like products should be formed instead of dcp the failure of the mn iii l dominating oxidation mechanism in explaining tcs degradation by mn vii in the presence of ligands indicated that other valent mn intermediates other than mn iii might be involved in reaction of tcs with mn vii ligand systems and were responsible for the obtained high yield of dcp coincidentally shi et al 2019 reported that the degradation of arsanilic acid asa by ex situ prepared mn iii l was negligible whereas fast decomposition of asa was achieved by the mn vii bisulfite system this result also revealed the involvement of other reactive intermediates in reaction of asa with the mn vii bisulfite system 2 2 role of other valent manganese intermediates in a previous study by song et al 2017 the reaction kinetics of mn vii with various inorganic compounds were examined and a linear free energy relationship lfer between the obtained rate constants and the reduction potentials for inorganic species was established to further understanding the electron transfer process in mn vii oxidation their result revealed that the reaction of mn vii with bisulfite was via a two electron transfer pathway indicating that mn v was quite likely formed as an intermediate and then transformed into mn iii moreover it is known that the oxidation of bisulfite can initiate the generation of so4 as well as hydroxyl radical oh through chain propagation reactions see below for the detail which may act as the co oxidant contributing to the degradation of contaminants in the mn vii bisulfite system chen et al 2012 guo et al 2013 shi et al 2019 wu et al 2021 to clarify these issues gao et al 2019 and chen et al 2020 employed methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a mechanistic probe to reinvestigate the complicated chemistry involved in the mn vii bisulfite system it was reported that pmso could be oxidized by high valent metal oxo e g mn oxo and fe oxo species to produce the corresponding sulfones i e methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer pathway chellamani et al 1999 ka et al 2016 pang et al 2011 pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2018 markedly differing from the radical dominating oxidation process where polymeric and or hydroxylated products were generated from pmso transformation wang et al 2018 therefore the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 mole of pmso2 produced per mole of pmso oxidized could be used to differentiate the contribution of high valent mn intermediates versus reactive radicals experimental results in both studies showed that the mn vii bisulfite system led to remarkable transformation of pmso under different ph conditions chen et al 2020 gao et al 2019 which however could not be attributed to the contribution of mn iii sulfito complexes because the combination of mno2 with bisulfite a well documented system for mn iii sulfito complexes generation sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019a caused negligible pmso abatement under similar conditions meanwhile rapid production of pmso2 along with the degradation of pmso in the mn vii bisulfite system was observed suggesting the involvement of high valent mn intermediates mn x 3 x 7 gao et al 2019 proposed that mn v was the major mn oxidation states according to the finding that pmso was rapidly transformed into pmso2 with a extremely high yield of 90 100 by ex situ prepared mn v i e mn vii reduction by as iii at strong acidic ph 1 simándi and záhonyi budó 1998 but neither pmso degradation nor pmso2 formation were obtained by ex situ prepared mn vi i e dissolving k2mno4 crystals in 1 0 m naoh formation of mn v and mn iii via successive two electron transfer from bisulfite to mn vii were described as eqs 5 and 6 and then mn iii reacted with bisulfite to produce mn ii and so3 eq 7 similar to the case of mn iii mn v also underwent the spontaneous disproportionation eq 8 resulting in its impossible contribution to organics reaction unless stabilized 5 mn vii so 3 2 hso 3 mn v so 4 2 6 mn v so 3 2 hso 3 mn iii so 4 2 7 mn iii so 3 2 hso 3 mn ii so 3 h 8 3 mn v mn vii 2 mn iv so bisulfite might act as a complexing ligand for mn v stabilization other than a reductant for mn v production and the resulting mn v complexes accounted for the transformation of pmso to pmso2 in the mn vii bisulfite system alternatively chen et al 2020 suggested that mn vii reduction by bisulfite was initiated via the one electron transfer step eqs 9 and 10 so both mn vi and mn v species were generated devoting to the degradation of pmso in the mn vii bisulfite system 9 mn vii so 3 2 hso 3 mn vi so 3 10 mn vi so 3 2 hso 3 mn v so 3 they examined the η pmso2 values at various ph levels in acidified mn vi and mn vii as iii processes which were used to indicate the reactivity of mn vi and mn v respectively it was found that pmso was degradable by mn vi and mn v at ph 3 0 11 0 with η pmso2 value close to 100 the observed different reactivity of mn vi species toward pmso between the two studies might be attributed to the different preparation method of mn vi solution in chen s study mn vi stock solution was prepared following the procedure that mn vii was added to a highly alkaline solution 5 10 m koh at room temperature and stirred for 24 h differing from the method by gao et al 2019 as mentioned above notably mn vi was stable only in highly alkaline solutions and it disproportionated rapidly during acidification to produce mn v eq 11 záhonyi budó and simándi 1995 1996 11 2 mn vi mn v mn vii as thus mn v might play a major role in pmso transformation by acidified mn vi as mentioned in chen s study chen et al 2020 2 3 role of reactive radicals furthermore both studies reported that the η pmso2 value obtained in pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system fluctuated in the range of 20 100 strongly dependent on the solution chemistry e g the molar ratio of mn vii bisulfite solution ph as well as the type of contaminants which will be elaborated below chen et al 2020 gao et al 2019 the yield of pmso2 less than 100 indicated the contribution of radical species such as so4 and oh gao et al 2019 verified the occurrence of so4 by electron spin resonance esr detection at a relatively low concentration of dmpo used as a spin trapping agent since excess dmpo could trap so3 to terminate the formation of so4 chen et al 2020 performed quenching experiments using methanol meoh and tertbutyl alcohol tba as the scavenger for so4 oh and oh respectively it was found that the degradation of pmso dropped gradually and the η pmso2 value in mn vii bisulfite system increased from 67 to 100 and 91 respectively with the increase of meoh and tba concentrations degradation of other selected contaminants was also significantly inhibited by meoh and tba with the former showing a stronger inhibitory effect moreover nb and benzoic acid ba that were the probe compound for oh and so4 oh were effectively decomposed by the mn vii bisulfite system and the decomposition efficiency of ba was much higher than nb according to the above results it could be believed that both so4 and oh were produced during reaction of mn vii with bisulfite and the former played a more important role the main reactions involving in reactive radicals generation could be described by eqs 12 17 briefly the oxidation of bisulfite by mn vii resulted in the generation of various rmns and so3 eqs 5 9 10 6 and 7 simandi et al 1985 which rapidly reacted with oxygen o2 to form so5 with a second order rate constant as high as 1 0 2 5 109 m 1 s 1 eq 12 wu et al 2021 so5 then reacted with bisulfite via an oxygen atom transfer step to form so4 eq 13 meantime so4 could be transformed to oh through reaction with h2o oh eqs 14 and 15 guo et al 2013 neta et al 1988 both so4 and oh might react with bisulfite leading to the regeneration of so3 eqs 16 and 17 hayon et al 1972 huie et al 1989 klewicki and morgan 1998 siskos et al 1984 12 so 3 o 2 so 5 13 so 5 so 3 2 hso 3 so 4 so 4 2 h 14 so 4 h 2 o hso 4 oh 15 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh 16 so 4 so 3 2 hso 3 so 3 so 4 2 h 17 oh so 3 2 hso 3 so 3 o h h 2 o table s1 supplementary material presents the rate constants for reactions involved in the mn vii bisulfite system reactions relating to reactive radicals formation and transformation have been well documented in previous literature while the rates for some elemental steps associated with rmns e g eqs 5 and 6 are not available given the considerably high reactivity of these intermediates it could be speculated that the rate limiting step of the whole reaction may be the one two electron transfer pathway between mn vii and bisulfite i e eqs 5 or 9 since both rmns and so4 are generated in the mn vii bisulfite system the reaction between mn vii and bisulfite is actually a mutual catalytic process namely mn vii is reduced to different valent manganese intermediates and simultaneously bisulfite is oxidized to form so4 in recent studies bisulfite has been proposed as an efficient source of so4 which is a promising alternative to persulfates due to the low cost nontoxicity convenient operation and high efficiency wu et al 2021 zhou et a 2018 xie et al 2017 various methods have been developed for producing so4 by activation of bisulfite such as photo radiation application of homogeneous and heterogeneous metal activators bisulfite induced so4 oxidation processes have been well reviewed in literature wu et al 2021 zhou et a 2018 notably xu et al 2019 supposed that so5 together with so4 were the main contributors to accelerated degradation of carbendazim cbd in the mn vii bisulfite system based on the result of quenching experiments therein 1 hexanol was selected as the scavenger for reactive oxysulfur radicals including so4 and so5 and it exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on cbd oxidation than ethanol etoh however this result might be due to the higher reaction rate of so4 with 1 hexanol 1 6 108 m 1 s 1 scholes and willson 1967 compared to that with etoh 3 5 107 m 1 s 1 hayon et al 1972 previous literature reports that so5 is inert toward alcohols with reaction rates less than 103 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 in addition considering the fast reaction of so5 with bisulfite 3 6 103 3 0 105 m 1 s 1 eq 13 wu et al 2021 as well as its rapid self terminating effects via eq 18 9 6 0 3 109 m 1 s 1 siskos et al 1984 or 19 2 1 108 m 1 s 1 das 2001 table s1 the contribution of so5 to organics degradation in the mn vii bisulfite system could be ruled out 18 so 5 so 5 s 2 o 8 2 o 2 19 so 5 so 5 2 so 4 o 2 similar to bisulfite the combination of thiosulfate with mn vii also led to a rapid degradation of pmso as well as concomitant formation of pmso2 gao et al 2019 the η pmso2 value was quantified to be up to 90 100 independent of the experimental conditions such as the mn vii thiosulfate molar ratio and solution ph this result suggested that the main reactive oxidants responsible for pmso transformation in the mn vii thiosulfate system were rmns i e mn v and or mn vi without the contribution of so4 or oh the non formation of reactive radicals in the case of thiosulfate indicated that the first radicals i e monomeric s2o3 and the dimeric s4o6 generated from thiosulfate oxidation could not be further transformed into so4 das et al 1999 dogliotti and hayon 1968 horváth and nagypál 1998 2 4 role of dissolved oxygen do do as one ubiquitous constituent in surface water and wastewater plays a critical role in formation of reactive intermediates as well as transformation of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system researchers have widely reported the suppressed degradation of contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system under anoxic condition dong et al 2020a gao et al 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018a zhong and zhang 2019 for instance dong et al 2020a found that decreasing do concentration from 2 4 to 0 1 mg l 1 resulted in a significant decline of iopamidol ipm abatement from 56 to 4 by mn vii 50 μm in the presence of bisulfite 250 μm at ph 6 5 similar inhibitory effect induced by the absence of do was also observed in oxidation of phenol and metribuzin under the identical condition the authors proposed that the main formation pathway for mn iii was via the reaction of so5 and mn ii that was in situ generated from mn vii reduction eq 20 rather than the direct reduction of mn vii to mn iii eqs 5 9 10 and 6 20 so 5 mn ii h mn iii hso 5 also so5 was a key intermediate for generation of so4 and oh eqs 13 15 in the mn vii bisulfite system as thus the pathway for so5 generation as well as the following formation of reactive species would be cut off in the absence of do resulting in little degradation of contaminants in other words do governed the reaction by promoting the generation of so5 which played a key role in the formation of not only reactive radicals but also mn iii however this statement may be questionable given that the generation of mn vi and or mn v is not related to so5 eqs 5 9 and 10 so the contribution of mn vi and or mn v to organics degradation should not be influenced by do contradicting the finding of almost complete termination of reaction in the absence of do sun et al 2018a also reported that the abatement of phenol by the mn vii bisulfite system dropped progressively with the decrease of do concentration interestingly they observed that so4 2 and hso5 were the final oxidation products from bisulfite oxidation by mn vii in the presence of do while so4 2 was detected as the unique oxidation product in the absence of do the oxygen isotope labeling experiments demonstrated that hso5 was derived from so3 oxidation by o2 to so5 and the subsequent reduction of so5 by bisulfite eqs 12 and 21 the generated hso5 could be reduced to sulfate by excess bisulfite eq 22 21 so 5 hso 3 so 3 hso 5 22 hso 5 hso 3 2 so 4 2 2 h if o2 was absent so3 generated in mn vii bisulfite system could not be converted to so5 and thus no formation of hso5 was observed differing from dong s viewpoint sun et al 2018a proposed that in the absence of do the generated so3 would mainly serve as an effective reductant to competitively consume the reactive oxidants resulting in extremely low availability of oxidants for reacting with target contaminants gao et al 2019 reported that the absence of do caused negligible degradation of pmso in the mn vii bisulfite system under various conditions and meanwhile do hardly impacted the reactivity of mn v species toward pmso so they attributed the influence of do on pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system to the consumption of reactive mn v species by so3 as a strong reductant in accordance with sun s point sun et al 2018a actually it is documented that the so4 2 so3 couple exhibits a much lower redox potential 2 47 v vs nhe compared to that of the so3 hso3 couple 0 84 v vs nhe neta and huie 1985 in sum understanding the role of do in oxidation of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system is of considerable importance for gaining insights into reaction mechanism as well as providing valuable information on the potential application of this technology comprehensive reaction mechanism for the mn vii bisulfite system is illustrated in fig 1 noticeably each rmns shown in this figure represents the overall form of these manganese intermediates i e mn x sulfito complexes 3 x 7 and probably soluble aquo and or hydroxo mn x species since the speciation dependent stability constant for each aqueous mn x complex is unknown it is difficult to give their specific form at present in addition the cognitive development of reaction mechanism for the mn vii bisulfite system over time is depicted in fig 2 3 influencing factors as mentioned above the chemistry involved in contaminants oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system is highly complex and the variation of solution parameters can make a great impact on both reaction kinetics and mechanism so a large amount of work has been done to evaluate the influences of various factors on the mn vii bisulfite system including the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph contaminant types ligands and water matrix components e g ha and inorganic ions 3 1 mn vii bisulfite molar ratio it was reported that the degradation of various organic contaminants such as phenol bps tcs ipm asa cbd by the mn vii bisulfite system showed a similar dependence on the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio dong et al 2020a gao et al 2017 2018 rao et al 2021 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018a xu et al 2019 zhong and zhang 2019 generally the optimal mn vii bisulfite molar ratio was obtained in the range of 1 5 1 10 under acid and neutral ph conditions except the case of pmso oxidation where the removal of pmso maximized around the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio of 1 2 1 5 table 1 the over stoichiometric bisulfite loss could be attributed to the stabilizing effect of bisulfite for rmns i e mn iii mn v and mn vi as discussed above further increasing the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio resulted in a decline of contaminants decomposition probably due to the fast consumption of reactive oxidants by excess bisulfite as described by eqs 6 7 16 and 17 in addition to the impact on oxidation kinetics of contaminants a mechanistic changeover from rmns to radicals was revealed with the increase of the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio chen et al 2020 reported that rmns contributed to 90 of phenol degradation at a low mn vii bisulfite molar ratio of 1 0 5 at ph 3 while the contribution of reactive radicals increased to over 50 when the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio was increased to 1 10 this result was in agreement with the observation by gao et al 2019 where the η pmso2 value during pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system gradually decreased from 98 to 64 with the increase of mn vii bisulfite molar ratio from 1 0 5 to 1 10 according to reactions involved in the mn vii bisulfite system elevating the concentration of bisulfite could quench the generated rmns and meanwhile enhanced the generation of so3 eqs 6 7 9 and 10 the reaction of so4 with bisulfite eq 16 also led to the generation of so3 which would be again converted into so4 eqs 12 and 13 hence the production of so4 was less impacted by the concentration of bisulfite compared to rmns resulting in the enhancement of radicals contribution to contaminants degradation at higher mn vii bisulfite molar ratios 3 2 solution ph solution ph exhibited a significant effect on reaction of organics with the mn vii bisulfite system in general acid ph condition e g 3 0 6 0 was beneficial to contaminants transformation and their removal was less but still effective at neutral and slightly alkaline conditions e g ph 7 0 9 0 chow and leung 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2016 2018b xu et al 2019 the decrease of contaminants removal efficiency by the mn vii bisulfite system at higher ph might be associated with the shift of hso3 species to so3 2 pka 7 2 which led to lower reaction rates between mn vii and bisulfite as well as the decreased formation of reactive species chow and leung 2019 sun et al 2015 tartar and garretson 1941 it is documented that the rate constant for mn vii with bisulfite is 3 0 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 0 and it decreased to 1 28 0 08 105 at ph 9 0 13 0 table s1 simandi et al 1985 also varying solution ph might influence the transformation of radicals eqs 15 17 as well as the reactivity and stability of rmns jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 wang et al 2014 for instance it was reported that mn iii species was more stable in acidic medium due to its lower disproportionation rate at lower ph chow and leung 2019 sun et al 2015 a similar ph dependency that organics degradation enhanced with decreasing ph was obtained in the mn vii hydrosulfite and mn vii thiosulfate systems gao et al 2017 further chen et al 2020 examined the effect of ph on relative contributions of multiple oxidants in the mn vii bisulfite system using phenol as a model compound it was found that with initial ph increasing from 3 0 to 5 0 both contributions of so4 and oh to phenol degradation increased from 27 to 71 and from 3 to 12 respectively meanwhile the contribution of rmns dropped significantly from 70 to 17 presumably due to the decrease in their reactivity with increasing ph this phenomenon was also consistent with the drop in η pmso2 value from 91 to 49 during pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system with ph increasing from 4 0 to 8 0 implying a gradually rising contribution of radicals with ph gao et al 2019 3 3 contaminant types it is known that so4 and oh are relatively non selective strong oxidants and they react with most organic pollutants at nearly diffusion controlled rates matzek and carter 2016 neta et al 1977 oh et al 2016 sillanpää et al 2018 by contrast rmns are more selective and exhibit higher reactivity to organics with electron rich moieties such as phenolic olefinic and sulfoxide moieties chen et al 2020 chow and leung 2019 so it can be speculated that the degradation kinetics of organics by the mn vii bisulfite system as well as the relative contributions of various reactive species are closely related to contaminant types chow and leung 2019 reported that acesulfame ace and cbz two typical compounds containing olefinic moieties were effectively oxidized by the mn vii bisulfite system at ph 5 0 while sucralose suc without aromatic and olefinic moieties was only slightly degraded chen et al 2020 investigated the transformation of nine pollutants with different structures in the mn vii bisulfite system at ph 3 and explored the relative contributions of various reactive oxidants their results showed that rmns devoted 77 69 30 and 42 of pmso phenol acetaminophen atap and 4 np degradation respectively while they negligibly contributed to the oxidation of contaminants containing electron deficient moieties such as caf benzotriazole btz and para chlorobenzoic acid pcba so so4 was the predominant species for the degradation of contaminants in the latter cases 3 4 ligands the presence of ligands in solution as the competing complexing agents versus bisulfite for rmns can result in formation of different ligand stabilized mn iii mn x complexes in addition to the mn iii mn x sulfito complexes since the reactivity and stability of rmns are greatly affected by the nature of ligands jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 wang et al 2014 different effects on organic contaminants degradation by the mn vii bisulfite system are found in the presence of different types and concentrations of ligands for instance gao et al 2017 reported that the presence of several model ligands including pp edta and citrate considerably inhibited the degradation of bps in the mn vii bisulfite system at the model ligands bisulfite molar ratio of 1 1 their inhibitory effect was attributed to the lower reactivity of these ligand stabilized mn iii mn x complexes as compared to the mn iii mn x sulfito complexes similar inhibitory effects were also observed in phenol oxidation in the presence of pp sun et al 2015 as well as in asa oxidation in the presence of edta shi et al 2019 it was noted that in addition to being a competing complexing agent for rmns edta as an organic ligand could also consume a portion of reactive oxidants generated in the mn vii bisulfite system which also caused a negative effect on target contaminants oxidation in contrast shi et al 2019 found that the degradation of both asa and nb was hardly impacted by the presence of pp at the pp bisulfite molar ratio of 0 2 1 4 1 while pp in the same concentration range showed an enhancing effect on bpa oxidation these results could be explained by the reason that the selective rmns did not participate in degradation of asa or nb i e radicals were the main oxidants for their reaction so the pp induced change of rmns complexes had no impact on the transformation of asa or nb xu et al 2019 also found a very limited influence of pp on cbd degradation by the mn vii bisulfite system probably attributed to the low reactivity of cbd toward rmns however rmns were very reactive toward bpa and their stabilization were increased by pp at relatively low concentrations thus leading to the enhanced transformation of bpa jiang et al 2010 further increasing pp concentration would reduce the reactivity of rmns due to their over high stability and thus this enhancing effect on bpa oxidation became insignificant 3 5 water matrix components natural organic matter nom and inorganic ions are ubiquitous in various water matrices which have important effects on removal of organic contaminants in water treatment in the mn vii bisulfite system the presence of ha one of the main constituents of nom generally inhibited the degradation of target compounds and the inhibitory effect gradually increased with the increase of ha concentration chow and leung 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018b xu et al 2019 on the one hand ha acts as a complexing ligand to compete with bisulfite for rmns as discussed in the above section which thus influences the reactivity of rmns toward organics on the other hand ha is also a reductant and can competitively consume the reactive oxidants including both rmns and radical species to depress the removal of target contaminants the rate constants for nom reaction with so4 have been widely determined in previous literature dependent on the nature of nom guan et al 2020 lutze et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2017 howbeit information on reactions of nom with rmns remains unavailable which deserves further investigation chow and leung 2019 examined the influences of various inorganic anions and cations on transformation of ace and cbz by the mn vii bisulfite system at ph 5 their results showed that no3 so4 2 h2po4 and hco3 at 5 mm hardly impacted the degradation of ace and cbz while the presence of no2 or cl at the same concentration significantly suppressed their oxidation the negative effect of no2 could be attributed to the fact that no2 reacted with bisulfite to yield hydroxylamine disulfonic acid when ph 4 with a reaction rate constant of 3 99 103 m 2 s 1 which restricted the reaction of bisulfite with mn vii to produce reactive oxidants for organics degradation petrissans and zoulalian 2001 the inhibitory effect of cl was also observed in reaction of ciprofloxacin and asa with the mn vii bisulfite system shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018b the reason mainly involved that i rmns such as mn iii could react with cl to yield the stable mncl2 complex with a rate constant of 13 5 m 1 in acidic solution davies 1969 and ii cl could scavenge so4 and oh to form less reactive chlorine radicals e g cl and cl2 luo et al 2016 yuan et al 2012 both aspects decreased the concentration of reactive oxidants in the mn vii bisulfite system thus resulting in less removal of organic pollutants other halide ions including f br and i also exhibited inhibitory effects on the mn vii bisulfite system presumably due to similar reasons shi et al 2019 as for hco3 sun et al 2018b and duan et al 2020 observed the negative influence of hco3 on organics e g metalaxyl and ciprofloxacin oxidation probably because of its buffering capacity and scavenging effect for radicals by contrast most cations e g na k mg2 ca2 fe3 cu2 had no significant influence on organics transformation by the mn vii bisulfite system gao et al 2017 shi et al 2019 exceptionally mg2 and ca2 5 mm suppressed ciprofloxacin removal and this effect was stronger at higher ph i e ph 6 5 ph 5 sun et al 2018b this might be associated with the complexation of mg2 and ca2 with ciprofloxacin which became stronger at higher ph al mustafa and taha 2011 urbaniak and kokot 2009 it was reported that the complexation of mg2 and ca2 with ciprofloxacin changed the molecular orbitals and atomic charge distribution of ciprofloxacin and thus had a stabilizing effect on ciprofloxacin wei et al 2015 however this phenomenon did not occur in transformation of other contaminants e g asa ace and cbz by the mn vii bisulfite system furthermore the degradation performance of organic pollutants by the mn vii bisulfite system was evaluated in various real waters e g tap water fresh water and wastewater chow and leung 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018b even though the removal efficiency of organics in real waters was relatively lower as compared to that in ultrapure water the abatement of significant amounts of pollutants was still achieved by the mn vii bisulfite system verifying the feasibility of this oxidation technology for application in practical water treatment 4 advantages and application potential owing to the involvement of both selective rmns and non selective radicals the mn vii bisulfite system is advantageous in treating complicated waters containing diverse pollutants e g organics containing electron rich moieties and some refractory compounds the combined application of mn vii and bisulfite effectively avoids the undesirable color induced by excess mn vii moreover the reduction products of mn vii in mn vii bisulfite system including mno2 and mn ii may not be a concerned problem because i mn ii fast converts into mno2 by direct air oxidation or aeration assist so the mn ii residual can remain below 0 1 mg l the upper limit of mn ii threshold in drinking water in china after treatment and ii mno2 can be easily removed by filtration or coagulation sedimentation chen et al 2021 sun et al 2018b in addition to achieve efficient trace organic contaminants abatement the mn vii bisulfite system as a pre oxidation method can improve the algae removal efficiency by post coagulation and meanwhile control some disinfection byproducts dbps chen et al 2021 zhu et al 2019b 2020 for instance a previous study demonstrates that the mn vii bisulfite system is insensitive toward br and thus shows a low potential for brominated dbps br dbps formation sun et al 2018b in addition the mn vii bisulfite system also shows a good potential as a conditioning method to enhance the activated sludge dewatering performance guo et al 2017 in summary the mn vii bisulfite system can be used as an effective oxidation technology for pretreatment of algae and trace organic contaminants in drinking water production as well as for advanced treatment of wastewater especially slightly acid industrial sewage 5 expanding to other high valent metal oxyanions since cr vi and fe vi are analogous to mn vii with several high valent reactive intermediates investigation on activation of cr vi fe vi by bisulfite to enhance the removal of organic contaminants has also been carried out in recent years similar to the case of mn vii reactive species generated in the cr vi bisulfite and fe vi bisulfite systems have been disputed for a period due to the complexity of these systems so in the following section the theoretical development on reaction mechanism of cr vi fe vi with bisulfite is summarized as compared to mn vii 5 1 cr vi activation by bisulfite 5 1 1 mechanism cr vi is widely used in industrial processes such as metal plating mining and leather tanning and thus is released into water environments through various waste streams kotaś and stasicka 2000 owlad et al 2009 cr vi contamination has drawn worldwide attention due to its high toxicity and carcinogenicity which has been listed as one priority pollutant by u s environmental protection agency barrera díaz et al 2012 nowadays the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is the principal strategy for remediating cr vi contaminated waters since cr iii is less toxic and can be readily separated from water in the form of cr oh 3 s barrera díaz et al 2012 bokare and choi 2010 dong et al 2020b jiang et al 2015a schlautman and han 2001 in previous studies bisulfite has been used to reductively treat cr vi in acidic wastewater which is seen as an excellent example of the waste control by waste strategy given that bisulfite is not only a commercial chemical reductant but also a common industrial waste barrera díaz et al 2012 beukes et al 1999 gao et al 2020a jiang et al 2015a pan et al 2014 pettine et al 2006 the reaction between cr vi and bisulfite has been well documented as described by eq 23 cr vi is mainly in the form of hcro4 at ph 6 0 and the hso3 species dominates at ph 2 0 7 0 bokare and choi 2010 dong et al 2018 23 2 hcro 4 3 hso 3 5 h 2 c r 3 3 so 4 2 5 h 2 o interestingly several studies report that the reduction of cr vi by bisulfite can induce the simultaneous oxidation of inorganic e g as iii jiang et al 2015a and organic e g phenolic amino and dye compounds co contaminants under acidic conditions e g ph 3 0 5 0 dong et al 2018 2020b duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a yuan et al 2016 however different mechanisms have been given to explain these phenomena table s2 summarizes the reported oxidation performance of co contaminants by the cr vi bisulfite system under various conditions as well as the proposed reactive species initially jiang et al 2015a suggested that both so4 and oh were primary oxidants for as iii oxidation by the cr vi bisulfite system based on the results of esr detection fluorescence spectroscopy and quenching experiments with etoh and tba yuan et al 2016 reported that oxysulfur radicals including so4 and so5 made a major contribution to fast degradation of the azo dye acid orange 7 ao7 while oh just played a minor role in the cr vi bisulfite system due to the observation that tba had a slight effect on ao7 decolorization while aniline used as the quencher for oxysulfur radicals almost completely inhibited ao7 oxidation dong et al 2018 proposed that quenching experiments with alcohols and other organics might cause misleading conclusions because these quenchers could suppress the oxidation of co contaminants by both inhibiting the production of radicals and competing with target compounds for reactive species formed in the cr vi bisulfite system they ruled out the contribution of so5 oh and identified so4 as the main reactive species in the cr vi bisulfite system responsible for co contaminants degradation according to the observations of i almost complete inhibition of meoh on organics oxidation ii insignificant inhibitory effect of tba and iii no degradation of nb a probe compound for oh according to the chromium chemistry the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is via several sequential one or two electron transfer steps during which transient cr intermediates including cr v and cr iv can be formed as depicted by eqs 24 28 dong et al 2020b gao et al 2020a jiang et al 1995 24 cr vi hso 3 cr v so 3 h 25 cr v hso 3 cr iv so 3 h 26 cr v so 3 cr iv so 4 2 27 cr iv hso 3 cr iii so 3 h 28 cr iv so 3 cr iii so 4 2 these cr intermediates have higher reduction potentials compared to cr vi under acidic conditions bokare and choi 2010 rahman and rocek 1971 westheimer 1949 and their strong oxidation ability has been widely corroborated by previous literature lay and levina 1998 premsingh et al 2004 stearns and wetterhahn 1994 to clarify their roles the underlying reaction mechanism of cr vi with bisulfite was further explored and possible generation of reactive cr intermediates was examined as expected dong et al 2020b observed the occurrence of cr v and cr iv in the cr vi bisulfite system at ph 4 0 by using esr and uv visible spectra with 2 ethyl 2 hydroxy butyric acid ehba as the complexing agent of cr v and cr iv cr v ehba and cr iv ehba complexes had characteristic absorbance peaks at 510 nm they suggested that cr v predominated in oxygenated solutions while cr iv was the primary intermediate in deoxygenated solutions similar to rmns cr v oxidized pmso via an oxygen atom transfer pathway to produce pmso2 this was in contrast to the case of so4 where hydroxylated and or polymeric products would be formed instead so with pmso as a probe compound the important role of cr v in the cr vi bisulfite system was confirmed moreover gao et al 2020a conducted the 18o labeling experiments revealing that the incorporation of 18o from solvent water h2 18o into pmso2 might be due to the competitive oxygen exchange of cr oxo species with h2 18o they supposed that bisulfite acted as a stabilizing agent for cr v and the cr v sulfite complex as an oxygen transfer donor transformed pmso into pmso2 it was noteworthy that do also played a critical role in substrates oxidation by the cr vi bisulfite system dong et al 2018 duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a jiang et al 2015a yuan et al 2016 the absence of do resulted in remarkable inhibition of co contaminants degradation by the cr vi bisulfite system consistent with the case of mn vii bisulfite system this could be explained by the reasons that i o2 was essential for the production of so4 according to eqs 12 and 13 and ii so3 as a strong reductant could competitively consume reactive cr intermediates in the absence of do eqs 26 and 28 comprehensive reaction mechanism for the cr vi bisulfite system is illustrated in fig 3 5 1 2 influencing factors the degradation kinetics of co contaminants by the cr vi bisulfite system was greatly dependent on the cr vi bisulfite molar ratio similar to the mn vii bisulfite system for instance gao et al 2020a reported that the removal efficiency of pmso at ph 3 increased from 72 to 94 with increasing the cr vi bisulfite molar ratio from 1 1 to 1 5 while further raising the ratio to 1 10 caused the decrease of pmso removal efficiency to 82 yuan et al 2016 suggested that at a fixed cr vi dosage 0 1 mm and ph 3 0 the efficiency of ao7 decolorization at bisulfite dosage of 0 55 mm 57 7 was much higher than that at bisulfite dosage of 0 1 mm 26 5 and 1 mm 50 6 namely the optimal cr vi bisulfite molar ratio for ao7 oxidation was achieved at 1 5 5 according to the observation by jiang et al 2015a the maximum of as iii transformation into as v was obtained at the cr vi bisulfite molar ratio of 1 8 and further increasing bisulfite concentration retarded the reaction in summary the optimal cr vi bisulfite molar ratio was higher than the stoichiometric reaction of cr vi with bisulfite 2 3 eq 23 probably ascribed to the dual role of bisulfite as an activating agent for the generation of reactive intermediates and as a reductant for their competitive consumption generally acidic ph conditions facilitated the reduction of cr vi by bisulfite as well as degradation of co contaminants duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a jiang et al 2015a yuan et al 2016 this might be attributed to the reasons that i increasing ph altered the species distribution of cr vi from hcro4 to cro4 2 and the latter had lower standard redox potential e0 cro4 2 cr oh 4 0 13 v than the former e0 hcro4 cr3 1 20 v dean 1990 and ii ph affected the reactivity of high valent cr intermediates and radical species dong et al 2020b gao et al 2020a the presence of some water matrices such as ha cl no3 and hco3 showed inhibitory effects on target organics degradation by the cr vi bisulfite system dong et al 2018 duan et al 2020 the inorganic anions cl no3 and hco3 could scavenge so4 to form secondary radicals i e cl cl2 no3 and co3 which had lower reactivity with most organics compared to so4 and thus resulted in the depressed oxidation of target organics the negative effect of ha could be attributed to its competitive consumption for reactive intermediates in addition to the kinetics aspect the relative contribution of reactive cr intermediates versus so4 to co contaminants oxidation in the cr vi bisulfite system also showed high dependence on solution chemistry similar to the mn vii bisulfite system for instance gao et al 2020a differentiated the relative contribution of these reactive species by monitoring the yield of pmso2 from pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system under different conditions their results revealed that the increase of cr vi bisulfite molar ratio i e higher bisulfite concentrations facilitated the formation of so4 in the cr vi bisulfite system resulting in the decrease of yield of pmso2 but interestingly the relative contributions of reactive cr intermediates versus so4 were independent of solution ph at each investigated cr vi bisulfite molar ratio dong et al 2020b performed competitive oxidation kinetics experiments to identify the relative contribution of each reactive species to various organic contaminants oxidation at a fixed cr vi bisulfite molar ratio of 1 10 and ph 4 0 it was found that the contribution of so4 to the degradation of ba pcba and cbz in the cr vi bisulfite system was up to 100 probably due to their resistance to reactive cr intermediates the contribution of reactive cr intermediates to pmso degradation was 100 both reactive cr intermediates and so4 contributed to the decomposition of organics containing aromatic rings with electron rich functional groups e g phenol 4 chlorophenol 4 cp bpa atap amoxicillin 17 estradiol aniline sulfamethoxazole smx and ibuprofen and the contribution of the former was larger than the latter 5 2 fe vi activation by bisulfite 5 2 1 mechanism in the past decades fe vi has attracted great attention as an effective and green oxidant which is capable of treating a wide range of organic pollutants with electron rich moieties but has sluggish reactivity toward some refractory micro pollutants such as the antibiotics trimethoprim tmp and flumequine flu feng and sharma 2018 hu et al 2009 lee et al 2005 2009 sharma et al 2006 2016 recent studies have reported that the combination of bisulfite with fe vi can markedly improve its oxidation capacity for organic pollutants in water feng et al 2018 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b shao et al 2019 sun et al 2018c zhang et al 2017 however the reaction mechanism and reactive species generated in the fe vi bisulfite system are controversial table s3 summarizes the reported oxidation performance of various organic contaminants by the fe vi bisulfite system under various conditions as well as the proposed reactive species in earlier studies zhang et al 2017 attributed the extraordinarily fast degradation of organic pollutants in the fe vi bisulfite system to the generation of so4 and oh according to the observation that both meoh and tba greatly inhibited the oxidation of smx however sun et al 2018c did not observed the inhibitory effect of tba during n n diethyl 3 toluamide deet degradation by the fe vi bisulfite system but the presence of etoh decreased the removal efficiency of deet thus they proposed that so4 was the sole reactive species generated in the fe vi bisulfite system feng and sharma 2018 reported that in addition to radical species high valent iron species such as perferryl fe v or ferryl fe iv were also produced via sequential one electron transfer reaction between fe vi and bisulfite reactions relevant to the variation of iron oxidation states in this process were described by eqs 29 32 feng et al 2018 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b johnson and bernard 1992 sharma 2011 29 hf e vi o 4 f e vi o 4 2 so 3 2 hf e v o 4 2 f e v o 4 3 so 3 30 hf e vi o 4 f e vi o 4 2 so 3 hf e v o 4 2 f e v o 4 3 s o 3 31 hf e v o 4 2 f e v o 4 3 so 3 hf e iv o 4 3 f e iv o 4 4 s o 3 32 2 hf e v o 4 2 2 so 3 2 4 h 2 o 2 fe oh 3 2 so 4 2 4 o h since fe v and fe iv are documented to have several orders of magnitude higher reactivity than fe vi feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b rush et al 1995 shao et al 2019 sharma 2011 they are very likely to act as the co oxidants participating in organics transformation by the fe vi bisulfite system gao et al 2020b and shao et al 2019 used pmso as the mechanistic probe to verify the generation of high valent iron intermediates as well as to distinguish their relative contribution from so4 to the fe vi bisulfite system because high valent iron species similar to high valent mn cr intermediates oxidized pmso via the oxygen transfer pathway resulting in pmso2 formation kundu et al 2011 pang et al 2011 pestovsky and bakac 2006 pestovsky et al 2005 in contrast to so4 as mentioned above wang et al 2018 gao et al 2020b found that the yield of pmso2 varied in the range of 30 95 with the solution chemistry indicating the changeover of reactive intermediates between high valent iron species and radicals generally lower ph values and lower initial concentrations of bisulfite led to higher pmso2 yields indicating higher contribution of high valent iron species to contaminants degradation in these cases shao et al 2019 employed the sparingly soluble caso3 as a slow releasing source of so3 2 for fe vi activation which was equivalent to an always very low so3 2 concentration in their study almost all of the oxidized pmso was transformed into pmso2 i e η pmso2 95 indicating that fe iv and fe v were the predominant reactive species responsible for the enhanced oxidation without the contribution of radicals besides the above formation pathway eqs 29 32 shao et al 2019 proposed that fe iv fe v species could also be indirectly generated from the self decay of fe vi and fe vi reaction with h2o2 in situ formed which were catalyzed by uncomplexed fe iii jiang et al 2015b 2016 lee et al 2014 shao et al 2019 the relevant reactions were described by eqs 33 39 lee et al 2014 shin et al 2018 33 2 hf e vi o 4 4 h 2 o 2 h 3 f e iv o 4 2 h 2 o 2 34 hf e vi o 4 h 2 o 2 h 3 f e iv o 4 o 2 35 h 3 f e iv o 4 h 2 o 2 h f e ii oh 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 36 hf e vi o 4 f e ii oh 2 h 2 o h 2 f e v o 4 f e iii oh 3 37 2 h 2 f e v o 4 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 f e iii

decreased the extent of pmso loss in the fe vi bisulfite system significantly but also led to the decline of η pmso2 indicating the scavenging effect of alcohols toward high valent iron intermediates other than radicals gao et al 2020b from this respect quenching experiments with alcohols might not be a reliable method for distinguishing high valent iron species versus so4 in the complex fe vi bisulfite system furthermore the critical influence of do on the fe vi bisulfite system was confirmed in these studies feng et al 2018 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b shao et al 2019 sun et al 2018c zhang et al 2017 similar to the cases of mn vii cr vi the degradation of organics was significantly suppressed in deoxygenated condition this was primarily associated with the fast oxidation of so3 by o2 eq 12 which otherwise competed with target compounds for high valent iron intermediates due to its strong reducibility comprehensive reaction mechanism for the fe vi bisulfite system is illustrated in fig 3 feng et al 2018 investigated the activation of fe vi with various one electron e g bisulfite and two electron transfer reductants e g thiosulfate hydroxylamine arsenite selenite phosphite nitrite and iodide interestingly they found that the combination of fe vi with thiosulfate at a low mn vii thiosulfate molar ratio e g 1 0 125 led to the extraordinarily oxidation of a wide range of organic contaminants e g tmp diclofenac dcf and propranolol ppn the enhancing effect of thiosulfate was noticeably higher than other two electron transfer reductants but was comparable to the one electron transfer reductant bisulfite thus the authors attributed the superiority of thiosulfate to the reason that so3 2 was in situ produced from the reaction of thiosulfate with fe vi which exerted an additional activating effect on fe vi for enhanced oxidation of contaminants to clarify this the oxidation of pmso and formation of pmso2 in the fe vi thiosulfate system under various conditions were examined and compared to the fe vi bisulfite system by gao et al 2020b results revealed that η pmso2 obtained in the fe vi thiosulfate system remained as high as 90 100 independent of the solution conditions e g ph the mn vii thiosulfate molar ratio and alcohol scavengers in contrast to the observation obtained in the fe vi bisulfite system where η pmso2 was highly variable depending on solution conditions moreover both pmso oxidation and pmso2 formation by the fe vi thiosulfate system were hardly impacted by do distinctly differing from the fe vi bisulfite system these discrepancies suggested that different reactive species were involved in the two systems different from the initial one electron transfer from bisulfite toward fe vi to produce fe v and so3 eq 29 thiosulfate as a two electron reductant reacted with fe vi to produce fe iv as described by eq 40 40 hf e vi o 4 f e vi o 4 2 s 2 o 3 2 hf e iv o 3 f e iv o 3 2 s 2 o 4 2 therefore it was plausible that reactive fe iv species was the sole oxidant accounting for the rapid degradation of pmso in the fe vi thiosulfate system resulting in 100 transformation into pmso2 moreover sharma et al 2022 used the density functional theory dft calculation to help explain the first favorable step of the reaction between fe vi and thiosulfate they suggested that if one electron transfer from fe vi to produce fe v occurred thiosulfate had the positive gibbs free energy δg 34 66 kj mol comparatively in the case of two electron oxygen atom transfer from fe vi to produce fe iv thiosulfate had a negative value δg 50 67 kj mol based on the δg values spontaneity of the two electron transfer reaction between fe vi and thiosulfate i e eq 40 could be suggested 5 2 2 influencing factors the enhanced removal of organic substrates by the fe vi bisulfite system was dependent on the fe vi bisulfite molar ratio and the optimal ratio was influenced by solution ph for instance feng and sharma 2018 suggested that the maximum removal efficiency of tmp at ph 9 0 was achieved at fe vi bisulfite molar ratio range of 1 1 5 1 4 while for ph 7 0 and 11 0 the removal efficiency of tmp maximized at the molar ratio range of 1 0 5 1 4 and around 1 2 respectively according to the data by sun et al 2018c gao et al 2020b and feng et al 2018 the optimal fe vi bisulfite molar ratios for deet degradation at ph 8 0 pmso degradation at ph 9 0 and tmp degradation at ph 8 0 were obtained at 1 4 1 1 1 5 and 1 0 25 1 5 respectively around the range observed by feng and sharma 2018 further increasing the molar ratio led to a negligible increase or a certain decrease of organics removal mainly because bisulfite as a powerful reductant competitively consumed the reactive intermediates compared with mn vii bisulfite and cr vi bisulfite systems which were less effective under alkaline conditions the fe vi bisulfite system exhibited a high reactivity toward organic pollutants over a wide ph range especially higher at ph 7 0 9 0 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 so it has been seen as a good alternative under neutral and alkaline conditions studies revealed that water matrices showed different impacts on organic substrates oxidation by the fe vi bisulfite system sun et al 2018c and gao et al 2020b observed the inhibitory effect of ha cl and hco3 on organics degradation under the condition of fe vi 100 m bisulfite 400 μm and ph 8 0 as well as fe vi 50 μm μm and sulfite 250 μm ph 9 0 respectively feng and sharma 2018 reported that the abatement of tmp was hardly influenced by water constituents under the condition of fe vi 100 m bisulfite 100 μm and ph 9 0 this discrepancy could be attributed to the different experimental conditions used in their studies especially the fe vi bisulfite molar ratio because it strongly influenced the contribution of various reactive species i e high valent iron species versus radicals shao et al 2019 found that inorganic anions including cl br and hco3 had no impact on smx oxidation by the fe vi caso3 system but they exhibited negative effects on the fe vi na2so3 system under a similar condition of fe vi 50 m bisulfite 150 μm and ph 8 0 as mentioned above in the former case caso3 as a slow releasing source of so3 2 led to an always very low so3 2 concentration so the main reactive species were fe iv and fe v without the contribution of radicals these inorganic anions were not reactive toward fe iv and fe v and thus their presence did not interfere the oxidation of smx for the latter case the fe vi bisulfite molar ratio of 1 3 meant a slightly excessive concentration of bisulfite which was conducive to the formation of radicals the inorganic anions had a strong scavenging effect toward radicals thus resulting in the suppressed degradation of smx therefore the effect of water matrices on removal of organic pollutants by the fe vi bisulfite system is closely related to the operational condition which should be carefully optimized for better application in real water treatment furthermore by comparing the reaction parameters and contaminants removal efficiency by mn vii bisulfite fe vi bisulfite and cr vi bisulfite systems tables 1 s2 and s3 it can be concluded that i the mn vii bisulfite system rapidly destructs contaminants under acidic and neutral conditions the cr vi bisulfite system is only effective under acidic conditions and the degradation rate of contaminants is relatively slower compared to that of the mn vii bisulfite system the fe vi bisulfite system can be a good alternative for fast removal of contaminants under neutral and alkaline conditions and ii the optimal metal oxyanion bisulfite molar ratio is dependent on solution parameters e g ph and contaminants structure so the dosage of reagents should be carefully determined in combination with the specific situation of actual waters 6 conclusions and future research needs herein we provide a critical review on current development of bisulfite activated mn vii oxidation technology with particular emphasis on the formation mechanism of various reactive intermediates for the sake of solving academic disputes for years in summary both rmns i e mn iii mn v and possible mn vi species and radicals mainly so4 are generated and devote to the rapid degradation of contaminants in the mn vii bisulfite system in addition to being a reductant for reactive species generation bisulfite also plays an important role as a complexing agent to stabilize rmns the relative contributions of rmns versus radicals highly depend on solution chemistry e g the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph and the type of contaminants do plays a key role in organics degradation because it greatly affects the evolution of reactive oxysulfur radicals as well as their subsequent reaction with rmns key influencing factors on degradation kinetics of contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system are discussed and reasonable explanations are given analogous to mn vii the high valent metal oxyanions fe vi and cr vi can also be activated by bisulfite for enhancing the removal of contaminants and a similar mechanism involving both high valent metal oxo intermediates and reactive radicals is confirmed in summary the mn vii bisulfite system can be a promising strategy for pretreatment of algae and organic contaminants in drinking water production as well as for advanced treatment of wastewater especially slightly acid industrial sewage nevertheless further efforts are needed to fill in the knowledge gaps and to overcome the challenges probably encountered in practical application of this technology based on our review several key points are proposed as follow 1 research on the properties of rmns is rather limited especially when they are involved in water decontamination so the nature and properties of rmns e g the ph dependent speciation reactivity and stability warrant further investigations 2 direct evidence for identification of rmns in the mn vii bisulfite system is largely missing currently characterizing the freeze quenched solid sample of the mn vii bisulfite system with mossbauer and xanes spectroscopies may be a feasible approach since it has been successfully applied in detection of aqueous iron iv oxo complex in the feaq 2 o3 system pestovsky et al 2005 so future investigations are needed 3 dft calculations which have been applied in fe vi creatinine system to elucidate the role of either fe v or fe iv as the main species to enhance the oxidation of pharmaceuticals luo et al 2021 may be a useful method to distinguish the role of mn v and mn vi in the mn vii bisulfite system so theoretical calculation for the mn vii bisulfite system should be supplemented in future 4 most current studies focus on the degradation kinetics of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system but their toxicity variation during degradation has been overlooked toxicity assessment of organics transformation products is very important because the potential application of the mn vii bisulfite system will be limited if always more toxic products than the parent compound are formed 5 the formation of br dbps in the mn vii bisulfite system may not be a concern however the formation potential of iodinated dbps i dbps should be assessed carefully considering that iodide i is more easily oxidized as compared to cl and br and i dbps show much higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues guan et al 2017 liu and zhang 2014 richardson et al 2007 6 since most current studies are based on the lab scale experiment pilot and field scale tests should be carried out to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this technology in

16112,recently bisulfite activated permanganate mno4 mn vii process has attracted considerable attention as a novel class of advanced oxidation technology for destruction of organic contaminants in water however disputes over the underlying activation mechanism as well as reactive species generated in the mn vii bisulfite system remain for a long period due to the fairly complex chemistry involved in this system this article aims to present a critical review on scientific development of the mn vii bisulfite system with particular focus on the generation and contribution of various reactive intermediates both reactive manganese species rmns i e soluble mn iii mn v and mn vi and radical species primarily so4 are identified as the oxidizing components responsible for enhanced degradation of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system bisulfite plays a dual role of being an activating agent for reactive intermediates generation and acting as a complexing agent to stabilize rmns solution chemistry e g the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph the type of contaminants ligands and water matrix components greatly impacts the generation and consumption of rmns and radicals thus influencing the degradation kinetics and pathways of organics particularly dissolved oxygen do is a vital factor for driving the oxidation of organics since the absence of do can block the generation of so4 and meantime causes the consumption of rmns by excess so3 as a strong reductant interestingly ferrate feo4 2 fe vi and hexavalent chromium cro4 2 hcro4 cr vi that are high valent metal oxyanions analogous to mn vii can be activated by bisulfite via a similar pathway i e both high valent metal oxo intermediates and reactive radicals are involved furthermore key knowledge gaps are identified and future research needs are proposed to address the potential challenges encountered in practical application of the mn vii bisulfite oxidation technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate bisulfite reactive manganese species radicals dissolved oxygen 1 introduction permanganate mno4 mn vii as a green and versatile industrial oxidant has been widely used by water utilities for in situ remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater and for control of soluble iron ii and manganese ii taste and odor compounds as well as biological growth hu et al 2010 2011 singh and lee 2001 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 compared with other oxidants mn vii is attractive due to its comparative stability effectiveness over a wide ph range ease of handling relatively low cost and no formation of chlorinated or brominated byproducts moreover the reduction product of mn vii i e manganese iii iv solid is environmentally benign and can act as coagulants to improve the performance of coagulation filtration processes or as adsorbents oxidants to promote the removal of the constituents of concern jiang et al 2009 stone 1987 zhang and huang 2003 although mn vii possesses a high reduction potential eh 0 1 68v hu et al 2009 it is recognized as a selective oxidizing agent and the kinetic reactivity of mn vii with contaminants is highly variable depending upon the structure of target organics it is known that mn vii is prone to react with contaminants containing electron rich moieties e g phenols anilines olefins and thiols whereas it shows a rather limited reactivity toward some refractory pollutants e g caffeine caf chlorinated methanes and ethanes and simple aromatics jiang et al 2009 2012 ladbury and cullis 1958 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 zhang et al 2014 this leads to longer reaction time or higher oxidant dosage for water decontamination which in some degree restrains the application of mn vii in actual engineering processes given the unpleasant color if it is overdosed thus recent efforts have been focused on developing green and effective technologies to activate mn vii for achieving efficient removal of organic contaminants reactive manganese species rmns including soluble trivalent manganese mn iii hypomanganate mn v and manganate mn vi are vital mn intermediates generated in situ during mn vii reaction which have attracted much attention in recent studies and have initiated a new category of mn vii based advanced oxidation processes gao et al 2019 guo et al 2018 sun et al 2015 2016 von gunten 2018 zhu et al 2019a these intermediates are documented to be highly reactive towards a variety of contaminants and thus can participate in transformation of contaminants by mn vii with a reduction potential close to that of molecular oxygen eh 0 mn iii mn ii 1 51 v kostka et al 1995 zhu et al 2019a soluble mn iii is recognized as a powerful oxidant and plays an important role in bio geochemical process and water treatment duckworth et al 2009 kostka et al 1995 madison et al 2013 schippers et al 2005 zheng et al 2006 nevertheless soluble free mn iii is unstable and undergoes spontaneous disproportionation to soluble mn ii mn2 and solid mn iv eq 1 causing it to be very short lived in solution klewicki and morgan 1998 kostka et al 1995 1 2 mn iii mn ii mn iv thus the oxidation of contaminants by mn iii occurs only in the presence of stabilizing agents or under extremely acidic conditions where relatively long lived mn iii species are involved davies 1969 gao et al 2019 klewicki and morgan 1998 studies have demonstrated that the long lived mn iii can trigger fast oxidation of many organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds e g 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp and bisphenol a bpa pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin paracetamol and carbamazepine cbz and organophosphorus pesticides e g methyl parathion and dichlorvos wang et al 2019a sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019b moreover the formation of mn v and mn vi as key mn intermediates during transformation of organic e g low molecular weight organic acids and macromolecule polysaccharides ahmed et al 2007 jáky et al 1991 shaker 2001 shaker et al 2009 simandi and jaky 1976 zaafarany et al 2010 or inorganic substrates e g sulfite simandi et al 1984 1985 by alkaline mn vii usually ph 12 has been widely reported in earlier studies which is clearly confirmed by using the stopped flow detection as well as spectrophotometric techniques in these cases mn v and mn vi exist as either the intermediate complexes of organic molecules or relatively stable products due to strong alkaline conditions and do not play an oxidizing role howbeit mn v species exhibit a high reactivity toward organic compounds e g organic sulfides and sulfoxides benzaldehydes substituted benzylamines and primary secondary alcohols in acidic solution or using the schiff base complexes of mn v e g porphyrin and salen manganese v oxo species chellamani et al 1999 dubey et al 2003 ka et al 2016 simándi and záhonyi budó 1998 záhonyi budó and simándi 1996 zhang et al 2005 also acidified mn vi species are very reactive toward organic compounds such as phenolate ion alkenes thioanisoles some alcohols and aldehydes lee and sebastián 1981 záhonyi budó and simándi 1995 1996 based on the above activating mn vii to produce the potent rmns seems to be a promising method for expanding the availability of mn vii in water treatment nowadays activation of mn vii by sulfur reducing agents especially bisulfite hso3 so3 2 for in situ generation of rmns has drawn increasing attention chen et al 2020 gao et al 2017 2019 sun et al 2015 2016 bisulfite with a redox potential of 0 93 v is a widely used reducing agent which is industrially available relatively cheaper and low toxic and thus can be applied in water treatment and environmental engineering processes chen et al 2012 guo et al 2013 wu et al 2021 large amounts of studies have confirmed that bisulfite can activate mn vii to rapidly oxidize various organic contaminants even some mn vii resistant contaminants e g benzene nitrobenzene nb 4 nitrophenol 4 np and caf chen et al 2020 sun et al 2015 2016 gao et al 2017 2019 shi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 chow and leung 2019 however disputes over the underlying activation mechanism and reactive species generated in the mn vii bisulfite system remain for a long period since various manganese species and oxysulfur radicals e g so3 so4 and so5 may be produced according to the chemistry of manganese and sulfur moreover the generation of these reactive intermediates as well as their reactivity and stability are highly dependent on solution chemistry which further complicates the reaction process therefore it is necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment on potential mechanism of bisulfite activating mn vii under various conditions to unite the theoretical cognition and to give better guidance for future research and engineering application of this novel oxidation technology to the best of our knowledge no review article focusing on bisulfite activated mn vii oxidation for enhanced removal of organic pollutants in water has been published despite a great quantity of researches and discussion so in this review we aim to summarize the theoretical development of the mn vii bisulfite system with an emphasis on various reactive intermediates i e rmns and radical species generated during the reaction disputes over the formation of these reactive species and their roles in organics oxidation are elaborated and influences of some critical factors e g dissolved oxygen do the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph contaminant types ligands and water matrix components are discussed particularly since ferrate feo4 2 fe vi and hexavalent chromium cro4 2 hcro4 cr vi are high valent metal oxyanions analogous to mn vii their reaction with bisulfite may undergo a similar pathway to the mn vii bisulfite system so primary reactive species generated during activation of fe vi cr vi by bisulfite under different conditions are also discussed for comparison to mn vii furthermore key knowledge gaps are identified and future research needs are proposed 2 mechanism of mn vii activation by bisulfite 2 1 role of soluble mn iii sun et al 2015 2016 first employed bisulfite to activate mn vii for degradation of organic pollutants in water and they suggested the mn vii bisulfite system as a novel advanced oxidation technology for water and wastewater treatment the mn vii bisulfite system oxidized many organics i e phenol ciprofloxacin and methyl blue at initial ph 5 0 with high pseudo first order rate constants kobs 60 150 s 1 which were 5 6 orders of magnitude higher than those measured for mn vii alone and 5 to 7 orders of magnitude higher than those obtained by conventional advanced oxidation processes such as uv uv h2o2 and photo fenton for water treatment it could also degrade some contaminants such nb and caf that were hardly removed by mn vii alone attracted by the remarkable oxidation ability of the mn vii bisulfite system researchers have done a great deal of work in recent few years to determine the removal efficiency of various contaminants as well as to probe into the reactive intermediates responsible for the strengthened oxidation in this system table 1 summarizes the reported degradation performance of various organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system under various conditions as well as the proposed reactive species in earlier studies it was reported that soluble aquo and or hydroxo mn iii i e noncomplexed with ligands other than h2o and oh was in situ formed from reduction of mn vii by bisulfite under acidic and neutral ph conditions eq 2 serving as a strong oxidant for significantly enhanced degradation of organic contaminants sun et al 2015 2016 2018a b guo et al 2017 2 mn vii 2 hso 3 mn iii 2 so 4 2 sun et al 2015 employed the stopped flow spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance at 258 nm that corresponded to the absorbance peak of mn iii and the result confirmed the generation of mn iii in the mn vii bisulfite system meanwhile they found that the presence of pyrophosphate pp a nonredox active ligand greatly inhibited the degradation of phenol where the occurrence of mn iii pp complex was observed by uv visible spectrophotometer according to the loss of absorbance arising from mn iii pp complex in the presence of phenol the authors proposed that aquo and or hydroxo mn iii reacted with organics more rapidly than its complexation with pp to produce the mn iii pp complex however the formation rate kf of mn iii complexes with ligands is reported to be at near diffusion controlled rates based on jahn teller distortion of mn iii and its water exchange rate luther et al 2015 oldham et al 2015 gao et al 2017 mn h2o 6 3 has a t2g 3 eg 1 electron configuration exhibiting jahn teller distortion from octahedral geometry and thus has a diffusion controlled water exchange rate of 109 s 1 similar to the case of cr h2o 6 2 luther et al 2015 helm and merbach 2005 metal cations react with ligands usually at rate constants similar to the values of water exchange rates margerum et al 1978 by adopting the kf value of 109 m 1 s 1 the calculated stability constants for mn iii complex are comparable to those for fe iii ligand complex indicating that the estimate for kf 109 m 1 s 1 is reasonable luther et al 2015 moreover their results are quite contrary to the acknowledged fact that the spontaneous disproportionation of aquo and hydroxo mn iii results in its impossible contribution to the oxidation of organic contaminants unless under certain conditions e g at extremely acidic ph or in the presence of complexing ligands davies 1969 klewicki and morgan 1998 alternatively gao et al 2017 proposed that bisulfite could act as a complexing agent to stabilize mn iii eq 3 other than as a reductant for mn iii production from mn vii eq 2 and the resulting mn iii sulfito complexes were responsible for enhanced oxidation of contaminants 3 mn iii hso 3 mn iii sulfito this was in good accordance with the documented fact that bisulfite had appreciable complexing ability for metal ions e g fe iii cd ii ce iii and ag i conklin and hoffmann 1988a b livingstone 1965 in their study several lines of evidence was provided to support the role of bisulfite as a complexing agent including that i both rate and extent of the organic substrate bisphenol s bps loss in the mn vii bisulfite system maximized at the mn vii bisulfite ratio of 1 5 1 10 appreciably higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 1 2 eq 2 ii other sulfur reducing agents such as hydrosulfite and thiosulfate also exhibited activating effects for mn vii where the loss of bps showed the dependency on the mn vii hydrosulfite or mn vii thiosulfate ratio similar to the case of bisulfite and iii arsenite as iii that had no stabilizing effect for mn iii but could react with mn vii to produce mn iii as an intermediate eq 4 lee et al 2011 showed negligible activating effect while the addition of bisulfite significantly enhanced the degradation of bps in the mn vii as iii system even though as iii outcompeted bisulfite for mn vii similarly duan et al 2022 also suggested that other reductants e g mn ii could not effectively enhance the oxidation of organic compounds by mn vii like sulfur reducing agents 4 mn vii 2 as iii mn iii as v in addition to sulfur reducing agents mn iii can also be stabilized in solution as mn iii complexes by other ligands referred as mn iii l hereafter such as pp oxalate nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and humic acid ha which results in the increase of organics particularly phenolic compounds oxidation rates by mn vii jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 gao et al 2018 investigated the transformation of triclosan tcs one of the most widely used antimicrobials by mn iii l that was freshly prepared by stoichiometric reaction of mn vii with mn ii in excess ligands e g pp or nta and adjusted to desired ph it was found that mn iii l showed appreciable reactivity toward tcs and the reaction resulted in formation of dimers hydroxylated as well as quinone like products this transformation pathway was markedly different from that involved in mn vii alone oxidation where dcp was identified as the major product of tcs one interesting finding was that the addition of various ligands i e pp nta ha and bisulfite only slightly influenced the yield of dcp although they greatly accelerated the degradation of tcs by mn vii in other words mn iii l did not play a role as the major oxidant to transform tcs in mn vii ligand systems otherwise dimers hydroxylated and quinone like products should be formed instead of dcp the failure of the mn iii l dominating oxidation mechanism in explaining tcs degradation by mn vii in the presence of ligands indicated that other valent mn intermediates other than mn iii might be involved in reaction of tcs with mn vii ligand systems and were responsible for the obtained high yield of dcp coincidentally shi et al 2019 reported that the degradation of arsanilic acid asa by ex situ prepared mn iii l was negligible whereas fast decomposition of asa was achieved by the mn vii bisulfite system this result also revealed the involvement of other reactive intermediates in reaction of asa with the mn vii bisulfite system 2 2 role of other valent manganese intermediates in a previous study by song et al 2017 the reaction kinetics of mn vii with various inorganic compounds were examined and a linear free energy relationship lfer between the obtained rate constants and the reduction potentials for inorganic species was established to further understanding the electron transfer process in mn vii oxidation their result revealed that the reaction of mn vii with bisulfite was via a two electron transfer pathway indicating that mn v was quite likely formed as an intermediate and then transformed into mn iii moreover it is known that the oxidation of bisulfite can initiate the generation of so4 as well as hydroxyl radical oh through chain propagation reactions see below for the detail which may act as the co oxidant contributing to the degradation of contaminants in the mn vii bisulfite system chen et al 2012 guo et al 2013 shi et al 2019 wu et al 2021 to clarify these issues gao et al 2019 and chen et al 2020 employed methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a mechanistic probe to reinvestigate the complicated chemistry involved in the mn vii bisulfite system it was reported that pmso could be oxidized by high valent metal oxo e g mn oxo and fe oxo species to produce the corresponding sulfones i e methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer pathway chellamani et al 1999 ka et al 2016 pang et al 2011 pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2018 markedly differing from the radical dominating oxidation process where polymeric and or hydroxylated products were generated from pmso transformation wang et al 2018 therefore the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 mole of pmso2 produced per mole of pmso oxidized could be used to differentiate the contribution of high valent mn intermediates versus reactive radicals experimental results in both studies showed that the mn vii bisulfite system led to remarkable transformation of pmso under different ph conditions chen et al 2020 gao et al 2019 which however could not be attributed to the contribution of mn iii sulfito complexes because the combination of mno2 with bisulfite a well documented system for mn iii sulfito complexes generation sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019a caused negligible pmso abatement under similar conditions meanwhile rapid production of pmso2 along with the degradation of pmso in the mn vii bisulfite system was observed suggesting the involvement of high valent mn intermediates mn x 3 x 7 gao et al 2019 proposed that mn v was the major mn oxidation states according to the finding that pmso was rapidly transformed into pmso2 with a extremely high yield of 90 100 by ex situ prepared mn v i e mn vii reduction by as iii at strong acidic ph 1 simándi and záhonyi budó 1998 but neither pmso degradation nor pmso2 formation were obtained by ex situ prepared mn vi i e dissolving k2mno4 crystals in 1 0 m naoh formation of mn v and mn iii via successive two electron transfer from bisulfite to mn vii were described as eqs 5 and 6 and then mn iii reacted with bisulfite to produce mn ii and so3 eq 7 similar to the case of mn iii mn v also underwent the spontaneous disproportionation eq 8 resulting in its impossible contribution to organics reaction unless stabilized 5 mn vii so 3 2 hso 3 mn v so 4 2 6 mn v so 3 2 hso 3 mn iii so 4 2 7 mn iii so 3 2 hso 3 mn ii so 3 h 8 3 mn v mn vii 2 mn iv so bisulfite might act as a complexing ligand for mn v stabilization other than a reductant for mn v production and the resulting mn v complexes accounted for the transformation of pmso to pmso2 in the mn vii bisulfite system alternatively chen et al 2020 suggested that mn vii reduction by bisulfite was initiated via the one electron transfer step eqs 9 and 10 so both mn vi and mn v species were generated devoting to the degradation of pmso in the mn vii bisulfite system 9 mn vii so 3 2 hso 3 mn vi so 3 10 mn vi so 3 2 hso 3 mn v so 3 they examined the η pmso2 values at various ph levels in acidified mn vi and mn vii as iii processes which were used to indicate the reactivity of mn vi and mn v respectively it was found that pmso was degradable by mn vi and mn v at ph 3 0 11 0 with η pmso2 value close to 100 the observed different reactivity of mn vi species toward pmso between the two studies might be attributed to the different preparation method of mn vi solution in chen s study mn vi stock solution was prepared following the procedure that mn vii was added to a highly alkaline solution 5 10 m koh at room temperature and stirred for 24 h differing from the method by gao et al 2019 as mentioned above notably mn vi was stable only in highly alkaline solutions and it disproportionated rapidly during acidification to produce mn v eq 11 záhonyi budó and simándi 1995 1996 11 2 mn vi mn v mn vii as thus mn v might play a major role in pmso transformation by acidified mn vi as mentioned in chen s study chen et al 2020 2 3 role of reactive radicals furthermore both studies reported that the η pmso2 value obtained in pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system fluctuated in the range of 20 100 strongly dependent on the solution chemistry e g the molar ratio of mn vii bisulfite solution ph as well as the type of contaminants which will be elaborated below chen et al 2020 gao et al 2019 the yield of pmso2 less than 100 indicated the contribution of radical species such as so4 and oh gao et al 2019 verified the occurrence of so4 by electron spin resonance esr detection at a relatively low concentration of dmpo used as a spin trapping agent since excess dmpo could trap so3 to terminate the formation of so4 chen et al 2020 performed quenching experiments using methanol meoh and tertbutyl alcohol tba as the scavenger for so4 oh and oh respectively it was found that the degradation of pmso dropped gradually and the η pmso2 value in mn vii bisulfite system increased from 67 to 100 and 91 respectively with the increase of meoh and tba concentrations degradation of other selected contaminants was also significantly inhibited by meoh and tba with the former showing a stronger inhibitory effect moreover nb and benzoic acid ba that were the probe compound for oh and so4 oh were effectively decomposed by the mn vii bisulfite system and the decomposition efficiency of ba was much higher than nb according to the above results it could be believed that both so4 and oh were produced during reaction of mn vii with bisulfite and the former played a more important role the main reactions involving in reactive radicals generation could be described by eqs 12 17 briefly the oxidation of bisulfite by mn vii resulted in the generation of various rmns and so3 eqs 5 9 10 6 and 7 simandi et al 1985 which rapidly reacted with oxygen o2 to form so5 with a second order rate constant as high as 1 0 2 5 109 m 1 s 1 eq 12 wu et al 2021 so5 then reacted with bisulfite via an oxygen atom transfer step to form so4 eq 13 meantime so4 could be transformed to oh through reaction with h2o oh eqs 14 and 15 guo et al 2013 neta et al 1988 both so4 and oh might react with bisulfite leading to the regeneration of so3 eqs 16 and 17 hayon et al 1972 huie et al 1989 klewicki and morgan 1998 siskos et al 1984 12 so 3 o 2 so 5 13 so 5 so 3 2 hso 3 so 4 so 4 2 h 14 so 4 h 2 o hso 4 oh 15 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh 16 so 4 so 3 2 hso 3 so 3 so 4 2 h 17 oh so 3 2 hso 3 so 3 o h h 2 o table s1 supplementary material presents the rate constants for reactions involved in the mn vii bisulfite system reactions relating to reactive radicals formation and transformation have been well documented in previous literature while the rates for some elemental steps associated with rmns e g eqs 5 and 6 are not available given the considerably high reactivity of these intermediates it could be speculated that the rate limiting step of the whole reaction may be the one two electron transfer pathway between mn vii and bisulfite i e eqs 5 or 9 since both rmns and so4 are generated in the mn vii bisulfite system the reaction between mn vii and bisulfite is actually a mutual catalytic process namely mn vii is reduced to different valent manganese intermediates and simultaneously bisulfite is oxidized to form so4 in recent studies bisulfite has been proposed as an efficient source of so4 which is a promising alternative to persulfates due to the low cost nontoxicity convenient operation and high efficiency wu et al 2021 zhou et a 2018 xie et al 2017 various methods have been developed for producing so4 by activation of bisulfite such as photo radiation application of homogeneous and heterogeneous metal activators bisulfite induced so4 oxidation processes have been well reviewed in literature wu et al 2021 zhou et a 2018 notably xu et al 2019 supposed that so5 together with so4 were the main contributors to accelerated degradation of carbendazim cbd in the mn vii bisulfite system based on the result of quenching experiments therein 1 hexanol was selected as the scavenger for reactive oxysulfur radicals including so4 and so5 and it exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on cbd oxidation than ethanol etoh however this result might be due to the higher reaction rate of so4 with 1 hexanol 1 6 108 m 1 s 1 scholes and willson 1967 compared to that with etoh 3 5 107 m 1 s 1 hayon et al 1972 previous literature reports that so5 is inert toward alcohols with reaction rates less than 103 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 in addition considering the fast reaction of so5 with bisulfite 3 6 103 3 0 105 m 1 s 1 eq 13 wu et al 2021 as well as its rapid self terminating effects via eq 18 9 6 0 3 109 m 1 s 1 siskos et al 1984 or 19 2 1 108 m 1 s 1 das 2001 table s1 the contribution of so5 to organics degradation in the mn vii bisulfite system could be ruled out 18 so 5 so 5 s 2 o 8 2 o 2 19 so 5 so 5 2 so 4 o 2 similar to bisulfite the combination of thiosulfate with mn vii also led to a rapid degradation of pmso as well as concomitant formation of pmso2 gao et al 2019 the η pmso2 value was quantified to be up to 90 100 independent of the experimental conditions such as the mn vii thiosulfate molar ratio and solution ph this result suggested that the main reactive oxidants responsible for pmso transformation in the mn vii thiosulfate system were rmns i e mn v and or mn vi without the contribution of so4 or oh the non formation of reactive radicals in the case of thiosulfate indicated that the first radicals i e monomeric s2o3 and the dimeric s4o6 generated from thiosulfate oxidation could not be further transformed into so4 das et al 1999 dogliotti and hayon 1968 horváth and nagypál 1998 2 4 role of dissolved oxygen do do as one ubiquitous constituent in surface water and wastewater plays a critical role in formation of reactive intermediates as well as transformation of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system researchers have widely reported the suppressed degradation of contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system under anoxic condition dong et al 2020a gao et al 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018a zhong and zhang 2019 for instance dong et al 2020a found that decreasing do concentration from 2 4 to 0 1 mg l 1 resulted in a significant decline of iopamidol ipm abatement from 56 to 4 by mn vii 50 μm in the presence of bisulfite 250 μm at ph 6 5 similar inhibitory effect induced by the absence of do was also observed in oxidation of phenol and metribuzin under the identical condition the authors proposed that the main formation pathway for mn iii was via the reaction of so5 and mn ii that was in situ generated from mn vii reduction eq 20 rather than the direct reduction of mn vii to mn iii eqs 5 9 10 and 6 20 so 5 mn ii h mn iii hso 5 also so5 was a key intermediate for generation of so4 and oh eqs 13 15 in the mn vii bisulfite system as thus the pathway for so5 generation as well as the following formation of reactive species would be cut off in the absence of do resulting in little degradation of contaminants in other words do governed the reaction by promoting the generation of so5 which played a key role in the formation of not only reactive radicals but also mn iii however this statement may be questionable given that the generation of mn vi and or mn v is not related to so5 eqs 5 9 and 10 so the contribution of mn vi and or mn v to organics degradation should not be influenced by do contradicting the finding of almost complete termination of reaction in the absence of do sun et al 2018a also reported that the abatement of phenol by the mn vii bisulfite system dropped progressively with the decrease of do concentration interestingly they observed that so4 2 and hso5 were the final oxidation products from bisulfite oxidation by mn vii in the presence of do while so4 2 was detected as the unique oxidation product in the absence of do the oxygen isotope labeling experiments demonstrated that hso5 was derived from so3 oxidation by o2 to so5 and the subsequent reduction of so5 by bisulfite eqs 12 and 21 the generated hso5 could be reduced to sulfate by excess bisulfite eq 22 21 so 5 hso 3 so 3 hso 5 22 hso 5 hso 3 2 so 4 2 2 h if o2 was absent so3 generated in mn vii bisulfite system could not be converted to so5 and thus no formation of hso5 was observed differing from dong s viewpoint sun et al 2018a proposed that in the absence of do the generated so3 would mainly serve as an effective reductant to competitively consume the reactive oxidants resulting in extremely low availability of oxidants for reacting with target contaminants gao et al 2019 reported that the absence of do caused negligible degradation of pmso in the mn vii bisulfite system under various conditions and meanwhile do hardly impacted the reactivity of mn v species toward pmso so they attributed the influence of do on pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system to the consumption of reactive mn v species by so3 as a strong reductant in accordance with sun s point sun et al 2018a actually it is documented that the so4 2 so3 couple exhibits a much lower redox potential 2 47 v vs nhe compared to that of the so3 hso3 couple 0 84 v vs nhe neta and huie 1985 in sum understanding the role of do in oxidation of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system is of considerable importance for gaining insights into reaction mechanism as well as providing valuable information on the potential application of this technology comprehensive reaction mechanism for the mn vii bisulfite system is illustrated in fig 1 noticeably each rmns shown in this figure represents the overall form of these manganese intermediates i e mn x sulfito complexes 3 x 7 and probably soluble aquo and or hydroxo mn x species since the speciation dependent stability constant for each aqueous mn x complex is unknown it is difficult to give their specific form at present in addition the cognitive development of reaction mechanism for the mn vii bisulfite system over time is depicted in fig 2 3 influencing factors as mentioned above the chemistry involved in contaminants oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system is highly complex and the variation of solution parameters can make a great impact on both reaction kinetics and mechanism so a large amount of work has been done to evaluate the influences of various factors on the mn vii bisulfite system including the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph contaminant types ligands and water matrix components e g ha and inorganic ions 3 1 mn vii bisulfite molar ratio it was reported that the degradation of various organic contaminants such as phenol bps tcs ipm asa cbd by the mn vii bisulfite system showed a similar dependence on the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio dong et al 2020a gao et al 2017 2018 rao et al 2021 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018a xu et al 2019 zhong and zhang 2019 generally the optimal mn vii bisulfite molar ratio was obtained in the range of 1 5 1 10 under acid and neutral ph conditions except the case of pmso oxidation where the removal of pmso maximized around the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio of 1 2 1 5 table 1 the over stoichiometric bisulfite loss could be attributed to the stabilizing effect of bisulfite for rmns i e mn iii mn v and mn vi as discussed above further increasing the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio resulted in a decline of contaminants decomposition probably due to the fast consumption of reactive oxidants by excess bisulfite as described by eqs 6 7 16 and 17 in addition to the impact on oxidation kinetics of contaminants a mechanistic changeover from rmns to radicals was revealed with the increase of the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio chen et al 2020 reported that rmns contributed to 90 of phenol degradation at a low mn vii bisulfite molar ratio of 1 0 5 at ph 3 while the contribution of reactive radicals increased to over 50 when the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio was increased to 1 10 this result was in agreement with the observation by gao et al 2019 where the η pmso2 value during pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system gradually decreased from 98 to 64 with the increase of mn vii bisulfite molar ratio from 1 0 5 to 1 10 according to reactions involved in the mn vii bisulfite system elevating the concentration of bisulfite could quench the generated rmns and meanwhile enhanced the generation of so3 eqs 6 7 9 and 10 the reaction of so4 with bisulfite eq 16 also led to the generation of so3 which would be again converted into so4 eqs 12 and 13 hence the production of so4 was less impacted by the concentration of bisulfite compared to rmns resulting in the enhancement of radicals contribution to contaminants degradation at higher mn vii bisulfite molar ratios 3 2 solution ph solution ph exhibited a significant effect on reaction of organics with the mn vii bisulfite system in general acid ph condition e g 3 0 6 0 was beneficial to contaminants transformation and their removal was less but still effective at neutral and slightly alkaline conditions e g ph 7 0 9 0 chow and leung 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2016 2018b xu et al 2019 the decrease of contaminants removal efficiency by the mn vii bisulfite system at higher ph might be associated with the shift of hso3 species to so3 2 pka 7 2 which led to lower reaction rates between mn vii and bisulfite as well as the decreased formation of reactive species chow and leung 2019 sun et al 2015 tartar and garretson 1941 it is documented that the rate constant for mn vii with bisulfite is 3 0 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 0 and it decreased to 1 28 0 08 105 at ph 9 0 13 0 table s1 simandi et al 1985 also varying solution ph might influence the transformation of radicals eqs 15 17 as well as the reactivity and stability of rmns jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 wang et al 2014 for instance it was reported that mn iii species was more stable in acidic medium due to its lower disproportionation rate at lower ph chow and leung 2019 sun et al 2015 a similar ph dependency that organics degradation enhanced with decreasing ph was obtained in the mn vii hydrosulfite and mn vii thiosulfate systems gao et al 2017 further chen et al 2020 examined the effect of ph on relative contributions of multiple oxidants in the mn vii bisulfite system using phenol as a model compound it was found that with initial ph increasing from 3 0 to 5 0 both contributions of so4 and oh to phenol degradation increased from 27 to 71 and from 3 to 12 respectively meanwhile the contribution of rmns dropped significantly from 70 to 17 presumably due to the decrease in their reactivity with increasing ph this phenomenon was also consistent with the drop in η pmso2 value from 91 to 49 during pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system with ph increasing from 4 0 to 8 0 implying a gradually rising contribution of radicals with ph gao et al 2019 3 3 contaminant types it is known that so4 and oh are relatively non selective strong oxidants and they react with most organic pollutants at nearly diffusion controlled rates matzek and carter 2016 neta et al 1977 oh et al 2016 sillanpää et al 2018 by contrast rmns are more selective and exhibit higher reactivity to organics with electron rich moieties such as phenolic olefinic and sulfoxide moieties chen et al 2020 chow and leung 2019 so it can be speculated that the degradation kinetics of organics by the mn vii bisulfite system as well as the relative contributions of various reactive species are closely related to contaminant types chow and leung 2019 reported that acesulfame ace and cbz two typical compounds containing olefinic moieties were effectively oxidized by the mn vii bisulfite system at ph 5 0 while sucralose suc without aromatic and olefinic moieties was only slightly degraded chen et al 2020 investigated the transformation of nine pollutants with different structures in the mn vii bisulfite system at ph 3 and explored the relative contributions of various reactive oxidants their results showed that rmns devoted 77 69 30 and 42 of pmso phenol acetaminophen atap and 4 np degradation respectively while they negligibly contributed to the oxidation of contaminants containing electron deficient moieties such as caf benzotriazole btz and para chlorobenzoic acid pcba so so4 was the predominant species for the degradation of contaminants in the latter cases 3 4 ligands the presence of ligands in solution as the competing complexing agents versus bisulfite for rmns can result in formation of different ligand stabilized mn iii mn x complexes in addition to the mn iii mn x sulfito complexes since the reactivity and stability of rmns are greatly affected by the nature of ligands jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 wang et al 2014 different effects on organic contaminants degradation by the mn vii bisulfite system are found in the presence of different types and concentrations of ligands for instance gao et al 2017 reported that the presence of several model ligands including pp edta and citrate considerably inhibited the degradation of bps in the mn vii bisulfite system at the model ligands bisulfite molar ratio of 1 1 their inhibitory effect was attributed to the lower reactivity of these ligand stabilized mn iii mn x complexes as compared to the mn iii mn x sulfito complexes similar inhibitory effects were also observed in phenol oxidation in the presence of pp sun et al 2015 as well as in asa oxidation in the presence of edta shi et al 2019 it was noted that in addition to being a competing complexing agent for rmns edta as an organic ligand could also consume a portion of reactive oxidants generated in the mn vii bisulfite system which also caused a negative effect on target contaminants oxidation in contrast shi et al 2019 found that the degradation of both asa and nb was hardly impacted by the presence of pp at the pp bisulfite molar ratio of 0 2 1 4 1 while pp in the same concentration range showed an enhancing effect on bpa oxidation these results could be explained by the reason that the selective rmns did not participate in degradation of asa or nb i e radicals were the main oxidants for their reaction so the pp induced change of rmns complexes had no impact on the transformation of asa or nb xu et al 2019 also found a very limited influence of pp on cbd degradation by the mn vii bisulfite system probably attributed to the low reactivity of cbd toward rmns however rmns were very reactive toward bpa and their stabilization were increased by pp at relatively low concentrations thus leading to the enhanced transformation of bpa jiang et al 2010 further increasing pp concentration would reduce the reactivity of rmns due to their over high stability and thus this enhancing effect on bpa oxidation became insignificant 3 5 water matrix components natural organic matter nom and inorganic ions are ubiquitous in various water matrices which have important effects on removal of organic contaminants in water treatment in the mn vii bisulfite system the presence of ha one of the main constituents of nom generally inhibited the degradation of target compounds and the inhibitory effect gradually increased with the increase of ha concentration chow and leung 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018b xu et al 2019 on the one hand ha acts as a complexing ligand to compete with bisulfite for rmns as discussed in the above section which thus influences the reactivity of rmns toward organics on the other hand ha is also a reductant and can competitively consume the reactive oxidants including both rmns and radical species to depress the removal of target contaminants the rate constants for nom reaction with so4 have been widely determined in previous literature dependent on the nature of nom guan et al 2020 lutze et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2017 howbeit information on reactions of nom with rmns remains unavailable which deserves further investigation chow and leung 2019 examined the influences of various inorganic anions and cations on transformation of ace and cbz by the mn vii bisulfite system at ph 5 their results showed that no3 so4 2 h2po4 and hco3 at 5 mm hardly impacted the degradation of ace and cbz while the presence of no2 or cl at the same concentration significantly suppressed their oxidation the negative effect of no2 could be attributed to the fact that no2 reacted with bisulfite to yield hydroxylamine disulfonic acid when ph 4 with a reaction rate constant of 3 99 103 m 2 s 1 which restricted the reaction of bisulfite with mn vii to produce reactive oxidants for organics degradation petrissans and zoulalian 2001 the inhibitory effect of cl was also observed in reaction of ciprofloxacin and asa with the mn vii bisulfite system shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018b the reason mainly involved that i rmns such as mn iii could react with cl to yield the stable mncl2 complex with a rate constant of 13 5 m 1 in acidic solution davies 1969 and ii cl could scavenge so4 and oh to form less reactive chlorine radicals e g cl and cl2 luo et al 2016 yuan et al 2012 both aspects decreased the concentration of reactive oxidants in the mn vii bisulfite system thus resulting in less removal of organic pollutants other halide ions including f br and i also exhibited inhibitory effects on the mn vii bisulfite system presumably due to similar reasons shi et al 2019 as for hco3 sun et al 2018b and duan et al 2020 observed the negative influence of hco3 on organics e g metalaxyl and ciprofloxacin oxidation probably because of its buffering capacity and scavenging effect for radicals by contrast most cations e g na k mg2 ca2 fe3 cu2 had no significant influence on organics transformation by the mn vii bisulfite system gao et al 2017 shi et al 2019 exceptionally mg2 and ca2 5 mm suppressed ciprofloxacin removal and this effect was stronger at higher ph i e ph 6 5 ph 5 sun et al 2018b this might be associated with the complexation of mg2 and ca2 with ciprofloxacin which became stronger at higher ph al mustafa and taha 2011 urbaniak and kokot 2009 it was reported that the complexation of mg2 and ca2 with ciprofloxacin changed the molecular orbitals and atomic charge distribution of ciprofloxacin and thus had a stabilizing effect on ciprofloxacin wei et al 2015 however this phenomenon did not occur in transformation of other contaminants e g asa ace and cbz by the mn vii bisulfite system furthermore the degradation performance of organic pollutants by the mn vii bisulfite system was evaluated in various real waters e g tap water fresh water and wastewater chow and leung 2019 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2018b even though the removal efficiency of organics in real waters was relatively lower as compared to that in ultrapure water the abatement of significant amounts of pollutants was still achieved by the mn vii bisulfite system verifying the feasibility of this oxidation technology for application in practical water treatment 4 advantages and application potential owing to the involvement of both selective rmns and non selective radicals the mn vii bisulfite system is advantageous in treating complicated waters containing diverse pollutants e g organics containing electron rich moieties and some refractory compounds the combined application of mn vii and bisulfite effectively avoids the undesirable color induced by excess mn vii moreover the reduction products of mn vii in mn vii bisulfite system including mno2 and mn ii may not be a concerned problem because i mn ii fast converts into mno2 by direct air oxidation or aeration assist so the mn ii residual can remain below 0 1 mg l the upper limit of mn ii threshold in drinking water in china after treatment and ii mno2 can be easily removed by filtration or coagulation sedimentation chen et al 2021 sun et al 2018b in addition to achieve efficient trace organic contaminants abatement the mn vii bisulfite system as a pre oxidation method can improve the algae removal efficiency by post coagulation and meanwhile control some disinfection byproducts dbps chen et al 2021 zhu et al 2019b 2020 for instance a previous study demonstrates that the mn vii bisulfite system is insensitive toward br and thus shows a low potential for brominated dbps br dbps formation sun et al 2018b in addition the mn vii bisulfite system also shows a good potential as a conditioning method to enhance the activated sludge dewatering performance guo et al 2017 in summary the mn vii bisulfite system can be used as an effective oxidation technology for pretreatment of algae and trace organic contaminants in drinking water production as well as for advanced treatment of wastewater especially slightly acid industrial sewage 5 expanding to other high valent metal oxyanions since cr vi and fe vi are analogous to mn vii with several high valent reactive intermediates investigation on activation of cr vi fe vi by bisulfite to enhance the removal of organic contaminants has also been carried out in recent years similar to the case of mn vii reactive species generated in the cr vi bisulfite and fe vi bisulfite systems have been disputed for a period due to the complexity of these systems so in the following section the theoretical development on reaction mechanism of cr vi fe vi with bisulfite is summarized as compared to mn vii 5 1 cr vi activation by bisulfite 5 1 1 mechanism cr vi is widely used in industrial processes such as metal plating mining and leather tanning and thus is released into water environments through various waste streams kotaś and stasicka 2000 owlad et al 2009 cr vi contamination has drawn worldwide attention due to its high toxicity and carcinogenicity which has been listed as one priority pollutant by u s environmental protection agency barrera díaz et al 2012 nowadays the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is the principal strategy for remediating cr vi contaminated waters since cr iii is less toxic and can be readily separated from water in the form of cr oh 3 s barrera díaz et al 2012 bokare and choi 2010 dong et al 2020b jiang et al 2015a schlautman and han 2001 in previous studies bisulfite has been used to reductively treat cr vi in acidic wastewater which is seen as an excellent example of the waste control by waste strategy given that bisulfite is not only a commercial chemical reductant but also a common industrial waste barrera díaz et al 2012 beukes et al 1999 gao et al 2020a jiang et al 2015a pan et al 2014 pettine et al 2006 the reaction between cr vi and bisulfite has been well documented as described by eq 23 cr vi is mainly in the form of hcro4 at ph 6 0 and the hso3 species dominates at ph 2 0 7 0 bokare and choi 2010 dong et al 2018 23 2 hcro 4 3 hso 3 5 h 2 c r 3 3 so 4 2 5 h 2 o interestingly several studies report that the reduction of cr vi by bisulfite can induce the simultaneous oxidation of inorganic e g as iii jiang et al 2015a and organic e g phenolic amino and dye compounds co contaminants under acidic conditions e g ph 3 0 5 0 dong et al 2018 2020b duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a yuan et al 2016 however different mechanisms have been given to explain these phenomena table s2 summarizes the reported oxidation performance of co contaminants by the cr vi bisulfite system under various conditions as well as the proposed reactive species initially jiang et al 2015a suggested that both so4 and oh were primary oxidants for as iii oxidation by the cr vi bisulfite system based on the results of esr detection fluorescence spectroscopy and quenching experiments with etoh and tba yuan et al 2016 reported that oxysulfur radicals including so4 and so5 made a major contribution to fast degradation of the azo dye acid orange 7 ao7 while oh just played a minor role in the cr vi bisulfite system due to the observation that tba had a slight effect on ao7 decolorization while aniline used as the quencher for oxysulfur radicals almost completely inhibited ao7 oxidation dong et al 2018 proposed that quenching experiments with alcohols and other organics might cause misleading conclusions because these quenchers could suppress the oxidation of co contaminants by both inhibiting the production of radicals and competing with target compounds for reactive species formed in the cr vi bisulfite system they ruled out the contribution of so5 oh and identified so4 as the main reactive species in the cr vi bisulfite system responsible for co contaminants degradation according to the observations of i almost complete inhibition of meoh on organics oxidation ii insignificant inhibitory effect of tba and iii no degradation of nb a probe compound for oh according to the chromium chemistry the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is via several sequential one or two electron transfer steps during which transient cr intermediates including cr v and cr iv can be formed as depicted by eqs 24 28 dong et al 2020b gao et al 2020a jiang et al 1995 24 cr vi hso 3 cr v so 3 h 25 cr v hso 3 cr iv so 3 h 26 cr v so 3 cr iv so 4 2 27 cr iv hso 3 cr iii so 3 h 28 cr iv so 3 cr iii so 4 2 these cr intermediates have higher reduction potentials compared to cr vi under acidic conditions bokare and choi 2010 rahman and rocek 1971 westheimer 1949 and their strong oxidation ability has been widely corroborated by previous literature lay and levina 1998 premsingh et al 2004 stearns and wetterhahn 1994 to clarify their roles the underlying reaction mechanism of cr vi with bisulfite was further explored and possible generation of reactive cr intermediates was examined as expected dong et al 2020b observed the occurrence of cr v and cr iv in the cr vi bisulfite system at ph 4 0 by using esr and uv visible spectra with 2 ethyl 2 hydroxy butyric acid ehba as the complexing agent of cr v and cr iv cr v ehba and cr iv ehba complexes had characteristic absorbance peaks at 510 nm they suggested that cr v predominated in oxygenated solutions while cr iv was the primary intermediate in deoxygenated solutions similar to rmns cr v oxidized pmso via an oxygen atom transfer pathway to produce pmso2 this was in contrast to the case of so4 where hydroxylated and or polymeric products would be formed instead so with pmso as a probe compound the important role of cr v in the cr vi bisulfite system was confirmed moreover gao et al 2020a conducted the 18o labeling experiments revealing that the incorporation of 18o from solvent water h2 18o into pmso2 might be due to the competitive oxygen exchange of cr oxo species with h2 18o they supposed that bisulfite acted as a stabilizing agent for cr v and the cr v sulfite complex as an oxygen transfer donor transformed pmso into pmso2 it was noteworthy that do also played a critical role in substrates oxidation by the cr vi bisulfite system dong et al 2018 duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a jiang et al 2015a yuan et al 2016 the absence of do resulted in remarkable inhibition of co contaminants degradation by the cr vi bisulfite system consistent with the case of mn vii bisulfite system this could be explained by the reasons that i o2 was essential for the production of so4 according to eqs 12 and 13 and ii so3 as a strong reductant could competitively consume reactive cr intermediates in the absence of do eqs 26 and 28 comprehensive reaction mechanism for the cr vi bisulfite system is illustrated in fig 3 5 1 2 influencing factors the degradation kinetics of co contaminants by the cr vi bisulfite system was greatly dependent on the cr vi bisulfite molar ratio similar to the mn vii bisulfite system for instance gao et al 2020a reported that the removal efficiency of pmso at ph 3 increased from 72 to 94 with increasing the cr vi bisulfite molar ratio from 1 1 to 1 5 while further raising the ratio to 1 10 caused the decrease of pmso removal efficiency to 82 yuan et al 2016 suggested that at a fixed cr vi dosage 0 1 mm and ph 3 0 the efficiency of ao7 decolorization at bisulfite dosage of 0 55 mm 57 7 was much higher than that at bisulfite dosage of 0 1 mm 26 5 and 1 mm 50 6 namely the optimal cr vi bisulfite molar ratio for ao7 oxidation was achieved at 1 5 5 according to the observation by jiang et al 2015a the maximum of as iii transformation into as v was obtained at the cr vi bisulfite molar ratio of 1 8 and further increasing bisulfite concentration retarded the reaction in summary the optimal cr vi bisulfite molar ratio was higher than the stoichiometric reaction of cr vi with bisulfite 2 3 eq 23 probably ascribed to the dual role of bisulfite as an activating agent for the generation of reactive intermediates and as a reductant for their competitive consumption generally acidic ph conditions facilitated the reduction of cr vi by bisulfite as well as degradation of co contaminants duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a jiang et al 2015a yuan et al 2016 this might be attributed to the reasons that i increasing ph altered the species distribution of cr vi from hcro4 to cro4 2 and the latter had lower standard redox potential e0 cro4 2 cr oh 4 0 13 v than the former e0 hcro4 cr3 1 20 v dean 1990 and ii ph affected the reactivity of high valent cr intermediates and radical species dong et al 2020b gao et al 2020a the presence of some water matrices such as ha cl no3 and hco3 showed inhibitory effects on target organics degradation by the cr vi bisulfite system dong et al 2018 duan et al 2020 the inorganic anions cl no3 and hco3 could scavenge so4 to form secondary radicals i e cl cl2 no3 and co3 which had lower reactivity with most organics compared to so4 and thus resulted in the depressed oxidation of target organics the negative effect of ha could be attributed to its competitive consumption for reactive intermediates in addition to the kinetics aspect the relative contribution of reactive cr intermediates versus so4 to co contaminants oxidation in the cr vi bisulfite system also showed high dependence on solution chemistry similar to the mn vii bisulfite system for instance gao et al 2020a differentiated the relative contribution of these reactive species by monitoring the yield of pmso2 from pmso oxidation by the mn vii bisulfite system under different conditions their results revealed that the increase of cr vi bisulfite molar ratio i e higher bisulfite concentrations facilitated the formation of so4 in the cr vi bisulfite system resulting in the decrease of yield of pmso2 but interestingly the relative contributions of reactive cr intermediates versus so4 were independent of solution ph at each investigated cr vi bisulfite molar ratio dong et al 2020b performed competitive oxidation kinetics experiments to identify the relative contribution of each reactive species to various organic contaminants oxidation at a fixed cr vi bisulfite molar ratio of 1 10 and ph 4 0 it was found that the contribution of so4 to the degradation of ba pcba and cbz in the cr vi bisulfite system was up to 100 probably due to their resistance to reactive cr intermediates the contribution of reactive cr intermediates to pmso degradation was 100 both reactive cr intermediates and so4 contributed to the decomposition of organics containing aromatic rings with electron rich functional groups e g phenol 4 chlorophenol 4 cp bpa atap amoxicillin 17 estradiol aniline sulfamethoxazole smx and ibuprofen and the contribution of the former was larger than the latter 5 2 fe vi activation by bisulfite 5 2 1 mechanism in the past decades fe vi has attracted great attention as an effective and green oxidant which is capable of treating a wide range of organic pollutants with electron rich moieties but has sluggish reactivity toward some refractory micro pollutants such as the antibiotics trimethoprim tmp and flumequine flu feng and sharma 2018 hu et al 2009 lee et al 2005 2009 sharma et al 2006 2016 recent studies have reported that the combination of bisulfite with fe vi can markedly improve its oxidation capacity for organic pollutants in water feng et al 2018 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b shao et al 2019 sun et al 2018c zhang et al 2017 however the reaction mechanism and reactive species generated in the fe vi bisulfite system are controversial table s3 summarizes the reported oxidation performance of various organic contaminants by the fe vi bisulfite system under various conditions as well as the proposed reactive species in earlier studies zhang et al 2017 attributed the extraordinarily fast degradation of organic pollutants in the fe vi bisulfite system to the generation of so4 and oh according to the observation that both meoh and tba greatly inhibited the oxidation of smx however sun et al 2018c did not observed the inhibitory effect of tba during n n diethyl 3 toluamide deet degradation by the fe vi bisulfite system but the presence of etoh decreased the removal efficiency of deet thus they proposed that so4 was the sole reactive species generated in the fe vi bisulfite system feng and sharma 2018 reported that in addition to radical species high valent iron species such as perferryl fe v or ferryl fe iv were also produced via sequential one electron transfer reaction between fe vi and bisulfite reactions relevant to the variation of iron oxidation states in this process were described by eqs 29 32 feng et al 2018 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b johnson and bernard 1992 sharma 2011 29 hf e vi o 4 f e vi o 4 2 so 3 2 hf e v o 4 2 f e v o 4 3 so 3 30 hf e vi o 4 f e vi o 4 2 so 3 hf e v o 4 2 f e v o 4

magnitude higher reactivity than fe vi feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b rush et al 1995 shao et al 2019 sharma 2011 they are very likely to act as the co oxidants participating in organics transformation by the fe vi bisulfite system gao et al 2020b and shao et al 2019 used pmso as the mechanistic probe to verify the generation of high valent iron intermediates as well as to distinguish their relative contribution from so4 to the fe vi bisulfite system because high valent iron species similar to high valent mn cr intermediates oxidized pmso via the oxygen transfer pathway resulting in pmso2 formation kundu et al 2011 pang et al 2011 pestovsky and bakac 2006 pestovsky et al 2005 in contrast to so4 as mentioned above wang et al 2018 gao et al 2020b found that the yield of pmso2 varied in the range of 30 95 with the solution chemistry indicating the changeover of reactive intermediates between high valent iron species and radicals generally lower ph values and lower initial concentrations of bisulfite led to higher pmso2 yields indicating higher contribution of high valent iron species to contaminants degradation in these cases shao et al 2019 employed the sparingly soluble caso3 as a slow releasing source of so3 2 for fe vi activation which was equivalent to an always very low so3 2 concentration in their study almost all of the oxidized pmso was transformed into pmso2 i e η pmso2 95 indicating that fe iv and fe v were the predominant reactive species responsible for the enhanced oxidation without the contribution of radicals besides the above formation pathway eqs 29 32 shao et al 2019 proposed that fe iv fe v species could also be indirectly generated from the self decay of fe vi and fe vi reaction with h2o2 in situ formed which were catalyzed by uncomplexed fe iii jiang et al 2015b 2016 lee et al 2014 shao et al 2019 the relevant reactions were described by eqs 33 39 lee et al 2014 shin et al 2018 33 2 hf e vi o 4 4 h 2 o 2 h 3 f e iv o 4 2 h

decreased the extent of pmso loss in the fe vi bisulfite system significantly but also led to the decline of η pmso2 indicating the scavenging effect of alcohols toward high valent iron intermediates other than radicals gao et al 2020b from this respect quenching experiments with alcohols might not be a reliable method for distinguishing high valent iron species versus so4 in the complex fe vi bisulfite system furthermore the critical influence of do on the fe vi bisulfite system was confirmed in these studies feng et al 2018 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b shao et al 2019 sun et al 2018c zhang et al 2017 similar to the cases of mn vii cr vi the degradation of organics was significantly suppressed in deoxygenated condition this was primarily associated with the fast oxidation of so3 by o2 eq 12 which otherwise competed with target compounds for high valent iron intermediates due to its strong reducibility comprehensive reaction mechanism for the fe vi bisulfite system is illustrated in fig 3 feng et al 2018 investigated the activation of fe vi with various one electron e g bisulfite and two electron transfer reductants e g thiosulfate hydroxylamine arsenite selenite phosphite nitrite and iodide interestingly they found that the combination of fe vi with thiosulfate at a low mn vii thiosulfate molar ratio e g 1 0 125 led to the extraordinarily oxidation of a wide range of organic contaminants e g tmp diclofenac dcf and propranolol ppn the enhancing effect of thiosulfate was noticeably higher than other two electron transfer reductants but was comparable to the one electron transfer reductant bisulfite thus the authors attributed the superiority of thiosulfate to the reason that so3 2 was in situ produced from the reaction of thiosulfate with fe vi which exerted an additional activating effect on fe vi for enhanced oxidation of contaminants to clarify this the oxidation of pmso and formation of pmso2 in the fe vi thiosulfate system under various conditions were examined and compared to the fe vi bisulfite system by gao et al 2020b results revealed that η pmso2 obtained in the fe vi thiosulfate system remained as high as 90 100 independent of the solution conditions e g ph the mn vii thiosulfate molar ratio and alcohol scavengers in contrast to the observation obtained in the fe vi bisulfite system where η pmso2 was highly variable depending on solution conditions moreover both pmso oxidation and pmso2 formation by the fe vi thiosulfate system were hardly impacted by do distinctly differing from the fe vi bisulfite system these discrepancies suggested that different reactive species were involved in the two systems different from the initial one electron transfer from bisulfite toward fe vi to produce fe v and so3 eq 29 thiosulfate as a two electron reductant reacted with fe vi to produce fe iv as described by eq 40 40 hf e vi o 4 f e vi o 4 2 s 2 o 3 2 hf e iv o 3 f e iv o 3 2 s 2 o 4 2 therefore it was plausible that reactive fe iv species was the sole oxidant accounting for the rapid degradation of pmso in the fe vi thiosulfate system resulting in 100 transformation into pmso2 moreover sharma et al 2022 used the density functional theory dft calculation to help explain the first favorable step of the reaction between fe vi and thiosulfate they suggested that if one electron transfer from fe vi to produce fe v occurred thiosulfate had the positive gibbs free energy δg 34 66 kj mol comparatively in the case of two electron oxygen atom transfer from fe vi to produce fe iv thiosulfate had a negative value δg 50 67 kj mol based on the δg values spontaneity of the two electron transfer reaction between fe vi and thiosulfate i e eq 40 could be suggested 5 2 2 influencing factors the enhanced removal of organic substrates by the fe vi bisulfite system was dependent on the fe vi bisulfite molar ratio and the optimal ratio was influenced by solution ph for instance feng and sharma 2018 suggested that the maximum removal efficiency of tmp at ph 9 0 was achieved at fe vi bisulfite molar ratio range of 1 1 5 1 4 while for ph 7 0 and 11 0 the removal efficiency of tmp maximized at the molar ratio range of 1 0 5 1 4 and around 1 2 respectively according to the data by sun et al 2018c gao et al 2020b and feng et al 2018 the optimal fe vi bisulfite molar ratios for deet degradation at ph 8 0 pmso degradation at ph 9 0 and tmp degradation at ph 8 0 were obtained at 1 4 1 1 1 5 and 1 0 25 1 5 respectively around the range observed by feng and sharma 2018 further increasing the molar ratio led to a negligible increase or a certain decrease of organics removal mainly because bisulfite as a powerful reductant competitively consumed the reactive intermediates compared with mn vii bisulfite and cr vi bisulfite systems which were less effective under alkaline conditions the fe vi bisulfite system exhibited a high reactivity toward organic pollutants over a wide ph range especially higher at ph 7 0 9 0 feng and sharma 2018 gao et al 2020b shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 so it has been seen as a good alternative under neutral and alkaline conditions studies revealed that water matrices showed different impacts on organic substrates oxidation by the fe vi bisulfite system sun et al 2018c and gao et al 2020b observed the inhibitory effect of ha cl and hco3 on organics degradation under the condition of fe vi 100 m bisulfite 400 μm and ph 8 0 as well as fe vi 50 μm μm and sulfite 250 μm ph 9 0 respectively feng and sharma 2018 reported that the abatement of tmp was hardly influenced by water constituents under the condition of fe vi 100 m bisulfite 100 μm and ph 9 0 this discrepancy could be attributed to the different experimental conditions used in their studies especially the fe vi bisulfite molar ratio because it strongly influenced the contribution of various reactive species i e high valent iron species versus radicals shao et al 2019 found that inorganic anions including cl br and hco3 had no impact on smx oxidation by the fe vi caso3 system but they exhibited negative effects on the fe vi na2so3 system under a similar condition of fe vi 50 m bisulfite 150 μm and ph 8 0 as mentioned above in the former case caso3 as a slow releasing source of so3 2 led to an always very low so3 2 concentration so the main reactive species were fe iv and fe v without the contribution of radicals these inorganic anions were not reactive toward fe iv and fe v and thus their presence did not interfere the oxidation of smx for the latter case the fe vi bisulfite molar ratio of 1 3 meant a slightly excessive concentration of bisulfite which was conducive to the formation of radicals the inorganic anions had a strong scavenging effect toward radicals thus resulting in the suppressed degradation of smx therefore the effect of water matrices on removal of organic pollutants by the fe vi bisulfite system is closely related to the operational condition which should be carefully optimized for better application in real water treatment furthermore by comparing the reaction parameters and contaminants removal efficiency by mn vii bisulfite fe vi bisulfite and cr vi bisulfite systems tables 1 s2 and s3 it can be concluded that i the mn vii bisulfite system rapidly destructs contaminants under acidic and neutral conditions the cr vi bisulfite system is only effective under acidic conditions and the degradation rate of contaminants is relatively slower compared to that of the mn vii bisulfite system the fe vi bisulfite system can be a good alternative for fast removal of contaminants under neutral and alkaline conditions and ii the optimal metal oxyanion bisulfite molar ratio is dependent on solution parameters e g ph and contaminants structure so the dosage of reagents should be carefully determined in combination with the specific situation of actual waters 6 conclusions and future research needs herein we provide a critical review on current development of bisulfite activated mn vii oxidation technology with particular emphasis on the formation mechanism of various reactive intermediates for the sake of solving academic disputes for years in summary both rmns i e mn iii mn v and possible mn vi species and radicals mainly so4 are generated and devote to the rapid degradation of contaminants in the mn vii bisulfite system in addition to being a reductant for reactive species generation bisulfite also plays an important role as a complexing agent to stabilize rmns the relative contributions of rmns versus radicals highly depend on solution chemistry e g the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph and the type of contaminants do plays a key role in organics degradation because it greatly affects the evolution of reactive oxysulfur radicals as well as their subsequent reaction with rmns key influencing factors on degradation kinetics of contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system are discussed and reasonable explanations are given analogous to mn vii the high valent metal oxyanions fe vi and cr vi can also be activated by bisulfite for enhancing the removal of contaminants and a similar mechanism involving both high valent metal oxo intermediates and reactive radicals is confirmed in summary the mn vii bisulfite system can be a promising strategy for pretreatment of algae and organic contaminants in drinking water production as well as for advanced treatment of wastewater especially slightly acid industrial sewage nevertheless further efforts are needed to fill in the knowledge gaps and to overcome the challenges probably encountered in practical application of this technology based on our review several key points are proposed as follow 1 research on the properties of rmns is rather limited especially when they are involved in water decontamination so the nature and properties of rmns e g the ph dependent speciation reactivity and stability warrant further investigations 2 direct evidence for identification of rmns in the mn vii bisulfite system is largely missing currently characterizing the freeze quenched solid sample of the mn vii bisulfite system with mossbauer and xanes spectroscopies may be a feasible approach since it has been successfully applied in detection of aqueous iron iv oxo complex in the feaq 2 o3 system pestovsky et al 2005 so future investigations are needed 3 dft calculations which have been applied in fe vi creatinine system to elucidate the role of either fe v or fe iv as the main species to enhance the oxidation of pharmaceuticals luo et al 2021 may be a useful method to distinguish the role of mn v and mn vi in the mn vii bisulfite system so theoretical calculation for the mn vii bisulfite system should be supplemented in future 4 most current studies focus on the degradation kinetics of organic contaminants by the mn vii bisulfite system but their toxicity variation during degradation has been overlooked toxicity assessment of organics transformation products is very important because the potential application of the mn vii bisulfite system will be limited if always more toxic products than the parent compound are formed 5 the formation of br dbps in the mn vii bisulfite system may not be a concern however the formation potential of iodinated dbps i dbps should be assessed carefully considering that iodide i is more easily oxidized as compared to cl and br and i dbps show much higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues guan et al 2017 liu and zhang 2014 richardson et al 2007 6 since most current studies are based on the lab scale experiment pilot and field scale tests should be carried out to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this technology in

16113,constructed wetland cw is an environment friendly and low cost technology for nutrients removal from domestic wastewater for a well tuned cw hydraulic loading rate hlr is one of the critical factors particularly under the challenging circumstance of more frequent heavy rainfall events brought by global warming in this study a comprehensive investigation was conducted to explore the influence of different hlrs on the cw s bulk substrate and root associated microbiota aiming to yield new insight for cw management from a hybrid perspective of environmental microbiology and engineering science the response of the microbial community and associated nutrients removal performance under different hlr settings were analyzed after a one year operation results showed that the bulk substrate and rhizosphere genera involved in desulfurization and denitrification such as ferritrophicum sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma were enriched in the higher hlr condition and associated with the higher total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal compared to the lower hlr condition co occurrence network analysis demonstrated a more complex network under the higher hlr condition besides it was observed that more stochastic in microbial assembly under the higher hlr condition surprisingly zoonotic pathogens were observed and showed a greater prevalence under the higher hlr condition indicating the potential correlation between hlr and pathogen intrusion collectively this study revealed that the microbiota could be significantly altered under different hlr conditions thereby resulting in differences in nutrients removal performance graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland hydraulic loading rate microbial assembly nutrients removal endosphere biological risk 1 introduction constructed wetland cw is an environment friendly and low cost technology for nutrients removal from domestic wastewater yang et al 2018 parameters of cws such as type of plant and bulk substrate water depth and hydraulic retention time play essential roles in maintaining the performance of nutrients removal for wastewater treatment wu et al 2015 besides hydraulic loading rate hlr is one of the critical variables which has been extensively studied in previous studies bang et al 2019 stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 according to bang et al suspended solids and organic matter within the cw substrate can demonstrate an excellent buffer capacity when hlr increases from 750 to 1500 l m 2 d 1 bang et al 2019 as a result the relationship between hlr and cw performance in nutrients removal is of great interest bang et al 2019 stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 wu et al 2015 though cws have been designed mainly from an engineering perspective it is now recognized that cw s microbial community is responsible for most of the nutrients removal tang et al 2020 wu et al 2015 and many technical problems could be avoided by monitoring the microbial community structure zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2020 thus a better understanding of cw s microbial community is crucial for cw management however to the best of our knowledge the root associated microbial community in cws is rarely reported zhang et al 2021b zhao et al 2021 the root associated microbial community plays a crucial role in geochemical cycling and has been widely studied in artificial and natural ecosystems such as fields forests and grass edwards et al 2015 naylor et al 2017 sawada et al 2021 previous studies on the root associated microbial community mainly focused on terrestrial plants such as wheat and legume usyskin tonne et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 it should be noted that the root associated ecosystems between the terrestrial and aquatic environments are fundamentally different besides the emergent plant known as the primary type of the cw s plants and its root system can influence the microbial community by releasing oxygen and root exudates leading to a different performance in nutrient removal shelef et al 2013 wu et al 2015 as a result to better understand cws it is crucial to study the root associated microbial community in an engineered aquatic environment microorganisms do not exist in isolation and they usually form a complex inter species network that regulates the structure and function of an ecological community faust and raes 2012 xue et al 2018 for instance using network analysis it is found that in cws the association between microorganisms tends to become more complex and stable under a relatively high temperature mu et al 2021 and network analysis has been used more and more to study microbial interaction within natural and engineered ecological systems guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a which can provide us better insights into microbial ecology and their responses to environmental change that other microbial analyses cannot easily reveal in recent years microbial community assembly has drawn significant attention due to its unique point of view in exploring the mechanisms for biodiversity and microorganism succession ning et al 2020 for engineered ecosystems such as the wastewater treatment plants wwtps microbial community assembly is used to figure out the relationship between the microbial community and the nutrients removal efficiency to improve the performance liébana et al 2019 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a however as far as we know the above two directions have been rarely focused on cws collectively the microbial community in cws has been demonstrated to be affected by many factors including influent characteristics operational parameters and environmental conditions mu et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 additionally the frequent heavy rainfall events brought by global warming may result in a significantly higher hlr than the original design of cws and potentially lead to a perturbation of microorganisms given the current shortage of knowledge two cws were constructed to investigate the bulk substrate and root associate microbial community s response under different hlrs the aims of this study are to 1 investigate the variation of microbial biodiversity and composition in the bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere microbiota under different hlrs 2 uncover the feedback of microbial interaction and assembly in the bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere microbiota under different hlrs 3 figure out how hlr influences the cw s nutrient removal from a hybrid perspective of environmental microbiology and engineering science this study will help improve the understanding of the microbial ecology in cws ecosystems providing a foundation for further improvement of cws microbial community regulation strategy under the global warming circumstance 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the constructed wetlands two identical horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands length width height 9 18 5 00 0 70 m were built in ningbo zhejiang china n29 4 42 28 e121 2 26 37 in may 2019 ningbo has a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 16 4 ºc with the hottest month of july 28 ºc on average and the coldest month of january 4 7 ºc on average the wetland bed was vertically divided into two layers by nylon mesh the bottom layer consisted of 0 55 m gravel φ 25 32 mm and the upper layer contained 0 15 m sand φ 0 5 mm the tailwater from the previous anoxic oxic process was circulated to the two cws by distribution pipes located in the upper layer of the wetlands similar individuals i e canna indica l in the same seedling stage were selected in this study with a cultural density of 6 plants m2 as shown in fig 1 both cws had the same design parameters and influent characteristics except hlr which were 1 06 m3 m 2 d 1 i e lower hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland l cw and 1 56 m3 m 2 d 1 i e higher hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland h cw respectively 2 2 sample collection after one year of operation samples were collected from both cws in may 2020 water samples including influent and effluent of each cw were collected in sump pits fig 1 each water sample was collected approximately 300 ml in a 500 ml clean bottle then the water samples were placed into an icebox sent to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for the water quality test to reduce bias related to random environmental variation and ensure enough samples for subsequent analyses we selected eighteen sites containing canna indica l the sampling position from inlet to outlet of each cw with the dimension of 0 3 m 0 3 m for collecting bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere samples fig 1 within each site samples were collected using the five point sampling method before collecting these samples the above ground parts of canna indica l were harvested put into bags and transported to the laboratory for plant biomass measurement for each soil sample a 10 15 cm deep substrate core was collected by a sterile shovel sealed in sterile bags kept in an icebox and transported to the laboratory for further experiments bulk substrate samples were collected relatively away from roots for rhizosphere samples roots clinging substrate were vigorously shaken by hand until no attached solids could be observed on the roots surface subsequently the roots were placed into a sterile falcon tube containing 20 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs and stirred for 2 min to disperse the tightly attached substrate afterward the roots were transferred to another pbs rinsed twice with fresh pbs and the resulting root samples were considered the endosphere samples after separation the bulk substrate samples were hand picked to remove plant residues stones and earthworms and then stored at 4 and 80 c for physicochemical analyses and dna isolation respectively besides the rhizosphere and endosphere samples were stored at 80 c for dna isolation 2 3 physicochemical analyses of samples the water quality of influent and effluent in cws was analyzed including ph total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n according to standard methods for water and wastewater examination 2002 besides the harvested canna indica l were dried at natural ventilation for a week after which their mass was determined the physicochemical properties of the bulk substrate samples including ph electrical conductivity ec cation exchange capacity cec dissolved organic carbon doc available phosphorus ap available potassium ak available iron afe available sulfur as dissolve total nitrogen dtn tn no3 n nh4 n clay sand and silt contents were tested according to the protocols in agricultural chemistry committee of china 1983 2 4 dna extraction amplification sequencing and data processing a total of 216 samples i e eighteen sites three compartments bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere four replications were subjected to total dna extraction using a dna isolation kit power substrate mobio usa according to the manufacturer guideline a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc usa was used to detect the dna quantity and quality the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 sawada et al 2021 the pcr reaction was carried out in a reaction mixture of 20 μl under the following thermo cycling operations 4 c for 3 min 30 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 50 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s the processed mixture was then incubated at 72 c for 10 min equimolar of the purified dna samples were subsequently sequenced using the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa having a paired end 2 300 bp approach the ncbi accession number of the raw sequencing data is prjna742500 the obtained raw data sequences were processed using the qiime2 pipeline knights et al 2010 we used dada2 yu et al 2021 for denoising removing chimeras trimming rare sequences data and generating amplicon sequences variants asvs furthermore the asvs were recognized by a naïve bayes classifier trained with the feature classifier employing the 16s rrna gene database having a 99 similarity of the silva 132 then sequences identified as mitochondria and unpaired bacterial were removed from the analysis finally we obtained a total of 6216 417 high quality sequences and 82 777 asvs from 216 samples 19 880 38 651 sequences for each sample a total of 19 880 sequences per sample were randomly selected to normalize the sequencing depth of each sample the α diversity index including phylogenetic diversity and shannon index was calculated using qiime2 2 5 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to test significant differences using spss19 0 spss chicago il usa to evaluate the difference of hlr compartment and sampling position principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance was performed using the ape package nonparametric multivariate analysis was used to find a significant difference in β diversity using the vegan package levin s niche breadth index for the microbial community was calculated using the niche width function in spaa package desqe2 analysis was conducted to determine significant discriminant genus adjust p value 0 05 and log2 fold change log2fc 2 between the two cws using the desqe2 package spearman correlation between the bulk substrate s discriminant genera and physicochemical properties was evaluated using a psych package all statistical analyses were conducted with r v3 6 2 statistical software http www r project org unless otherwise stated 2 6 co occurrence network and community assembly analysis for network analysis only robust correlations if the spearman correlation coefficient ρ was 0 6 or 0 6 and statistically significant p value 0 01 zhang et al 2021c were chosen and visualized by gephi interactive platform du et al 2020 subsequently the topology of empirical and random networks was calculated by the igraph package phylogenetic normalized stochasticity ratio pnst was performed by r codes ning et al 2020 to study the microbial community assembly process 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical analyses most physicochemical factors in the bulk substrate except as clay sand and silt contents were significantly higher anova p 0 05 in h cw than in l cw table s1 and the canna indica l biomass in h cw 1468 302 7 g was also significantly higher p 0 05 than in l cw 876 8 126 3 g having identical influent properties fig 2 the effluent quality showed different variations between h cw and l cw specifically the concentrations of nh4 n and cod in the l cw effluent were significantly lower p 0 05 than in the h cw effluent whereas the tn and no3 n showed the opposite trend fig 2 it is well known that the bulk substrate is one of the essential components in cws which removes most of the pollutants from source water through physical adsorption yang et al 2018 as a result a higher hlr can provide more nutrients within the same period allowing the bulk substrate to absorb more nutrients it should be noted that overly adsorbed bulk substrate might suffer from saturation along with time and eventually result in nutrient wash off saeed et al 2019 as expected some nutrient concentrations i e nh4 n and cod were higher in the h cw effluent than in l cw fig 2 surprisingly we found that the tn and no3 n concentrations were significantly lower in the h cw effluent than in l cw indicating the abovementioned physical adsorption might not be a fundamental cause of the different nutrients removal performances thus we believe that the divergence was mainly associated with the microbial community variation the key player in all cws weber 2016 3 2 biodiversity and niche breadth as shown in fig 3 different hydraulic loading rates hlrs caused a remarkable difference in α diversity between the higher hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland h cw and the lower hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland l cw within all the compartments i e bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere specifically the values of α diversity were significantly higher p 0 05 in h cw than in l cw this phenomenon can best be explained by associating it with the great nutrients accessibility offered by the h cw condition which can enhance aquatic plant productivity and boost the total microbial diversity du et al 2020 liu et al 2010 ren et al 2018 besides a higher hlr can potentially contribute to a greater microbial immigration rate therefore favoring microbial diversity evans et al 2017 in terms of compartment differences we found gradually decreased α diversity from the bulk substrate rhizosphere to endosphere regardless of hlr conditions caused by the hierarchical filtration triggered by root effect xiao et al 2017 additionally in all compartments except the rhizosphere the α diversity showed no significant difference p 0 05 within different sampling positions principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance combined with permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed within all samples to rank the factors i e hlr compartment and sampling position in governing the microbial community heterogeneity by order of importance and found that compartment was the most critical factor followed by hlr and sampling position respectively fig s1 based on our preliminary assumption sampling position fig 1 is an essential experimental variable that may profoundly change results within a compartment thus pcoa was performed to evaluate the importance of hlr and sampling position within each compartment as shown in fig s2 hlr had a more superior influence than different sampling positions at the heart of these findings demonstrate the inherently powerful decisive effect of a habitat type upon a microbial community more importantly it directly shows the necessity for investigating cws with different hlrs from the perspective of separated mini environments such as bulk substrate and rhizosphere one of the fundamental differences between h cw and l cw lies in the total available nutrient loading when having a high total nutrient loading a microbial community can access more resources and devote them to develop a broader niche breadth guo et al 2020 in this study we found that the h cw s bulk substrate and rhizosphere had higher niche breadth values than l cw fig s3 in general the higher α diversity of the bulk substrate and rhizosphere under the h cw condition fig 3 together with their broader niche breadth implied a great potential of cw s microbial functions such as denitrification zeng et al 2021 under both h cw and l cw conditions the endosphere environment showed distinct niche patterns that maintained a broader scope than the bulk substrate and rhizosphere compartments in addition the niche breadth of the endosphere compartment in l cw was more expansive than in h cw concerning the distinct niche breadth observed in the endosphere we believe that the unexpected results were strongly correlated with the invasion of different pathogens through plant roots which will be discussed in the following sections 3 3 microbial community variation and nutrients removal performance at the phylum level the microbial community exhibited compositional variations in different compartments and hlrs fig 4 a the observed results showed that proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere followed by bacteroidetes acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia which are consistent with previous studies observations edwards et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 in terms of relative abundance the predominated phylum in each compartment varied with hlr fig 4a for the bulk substrate the degrees of relative abundance of acidobateria and verrucomicrobia in l cw were significantly higher p 0 05 than in h cw in contrast proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi showed the opposite pattern additionally thaumarchaota accounted for nearly 6 15 which was considerably higher p 0 05 in the l cw bulk substrate than in other environments heatmap based on deseq2 was used to determine which genera were responsible for the distinct microbial community in different compartments and hlrs fig 4b based on the observed results genera involved in desulfurization sulfur reduction and sulfur oxidation and denitrogenation denitrification and ammonia oxidation showed a significant difference between the two cws in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig 4b almost all genera involved in desulfurization such as desulforhabdus desulfobulbus sulfuritalea and thiothrix showed significantly higher p 0 05 relative abundance in h cw than in l cw similarly the relative abundance of dechloromonas delftia ferritrophicum sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma involved with denitrification was significantly higher p 0 05 in h cw than in l cw thus it allows us to conclude that keystone genera involved in desulfurization and denitrification were significantly enriched in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere under the h cw condition which directly enhanced the corresponding cws functions leading to higher tn and no3 n removal fig 2 for example the observed sulfurisoma sulfurimonas and ferritrophicum responsible for sulfide based autotrophic denitrification liu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 were more abundant in h cw than in l cw previous studies showed that combining heterotrophic denitrification and sulfide based autotrophic denitrification can result in a high tn removal liu et al 2021 meanwhile sulfur content can enhance the growth of heterogeneous autotrophic denitrifying bacteria leading to higher nitrate nitrogen removal efficiency in cws tang et al 2020 however the presence of sulfide based autotrophic denitrification may make the organic matter less likely to act as an electron donor leading to lower cod removal fig 2 spearman correlation analysis was further conducted to reveal the relationship between the physicochemical factors and associated genera fig 5 the genera involved with desulfurization and denitrogenation showed different association patterns to environmental factors according to fig 5 we found a strong positive correlation between the abovementioned genera and some critical bulk substrate s physicochemical properties including afe doc and tn this observation is consistent with previous studies that reported tn and doc were the determining factors in regulating microbial community and function associated with varied nitrogen removal efficiencies in wwtps fang et al 2018 tian and wang 2020 moreover afe concentration has been recognized as a critical property in cws increasing nitrogen removal in cws by altering the microbial community song et al 2016 tang et al 2020 considering l cw s bulk substrate and rhizosphere the abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaeons aoas including candidatus nirtosoachaeum nitrosotalea and nitrosotenuis belong to thaumarchaota phylum were significantly enriched fig 4b as shown in fig 2 the l cw effluent had lower nh4 n concentrations and higher no3 n concentrations it is well known that in biological wastewater treatment aoas can exert a crucial regulating effect upon ammonia removal you et al 2009 therefore the observed higher abundance of aoas was a clear indicator of a high nitrification activity that had taken place in l cw fig 2 further a strong negative correlation between aoas and the abovementioned physicochemical properties i e tn doc and afe was observed under the l cw condition fig 5 previous studies reported that the substrate properties such as c n li et al 2015 tn wu et al 2010 and toc wu et al 2010 yang et al 2016 were negatively correlated with the abundance of aoas it should be noted that although cws are typically engineered as an open atmospheric aerobic system some immerged subsurface locations within cws can still develop anaerobic environments accommodating anaerobic microorganisms like iron ammonia oxidizing bacteria feammox newly discovered using ferric ion as electron acceptor to oxide ammonia wu et al 2019 therefore the negative correlation between aoas and afe was likely due to feammox competing with aoas song et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in general our results suggested that hlr can directly influence the predominant microorganisms by altering the bulk substrate s physicochemical properties and thus resulting in varied cws performance 3 4 co occurrence network and microbial community assembly the network model analysis for a microbial community provided insight into the complex relationship among microorganisms and converted it into an organized pattern faust and raes 2012 according to the results of empirical networks all networks exhibited a modular structure table 1 i e modularity 0 4 du et al 2020 as shown in table 1 the topological parameters such as modularity and average clustering coefficient of all empirical networks were higher than the random networks and the values of small world coefficient were all greater than one the above results showed that the network structures of cws studied in this work owned non random and small world properties xue et al 2018 in terms of different hlrs the l cw network exhibited much lower nodes i e network size edges i e microbial interaction number and modularity than the h cw network table 1 these observations were mainly associated with the high hlr condition enhancing network complexity and among genera connectivity within the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig 6 which implied more intense microbial cooperation and function wagg et al 2019 besides the network density in l cw was higher than in h cw regardless of compartments whereas the average path length exhibited the opposite trend according to the co occurrence network rhodanobacter was one of the predominant genera in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig 6 previous studies reported that rhodanobacter is a crucial microorganism in anoxic tanks raper et al 2019 sequencing batch reactors cai et al 2022 and biofilm reactors huang et al 2019 in regulating the denitrification activity from wastewater van den heuvel et al 2010 as a result the predominant role of rhodanobacter found in this study again indicates that tn removal is one of the crucial functions in cws besides candidatus nitrosotalea and dyella responsible for ammonia oxidation lehtovirta morely et al 2016 and organic carbon degradation hemme et al 2015 were predominant in the l cw condition fig 6b d that directly led to the lower concentrations of nh4 n and cod observed in the l cw effluent fig 2 moreover we found an interaction between rhodanobacter and sulfurisoma in the h cw bulk substrate fig 6a that confirmed the synergistic effect between denitrifying bacteria and sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria towards the no3 n and tn removal fig 2 in summary we believed that the abovementioned reasons worked together and resulted in superior nitrogen removal performance i e no3 n and tn removal but slightly lower cod and nh4 n degradation under the h cw condition in terms of different compartments the rhizosphere network showed a more complex structure than the bulk substrate network despite its lower α diversity table 1 fig 3 it should be noted that the rhizosphere has been demonstrated to be a special substrate micro environment where microorganisms are more active than the bulk substrate shi et al 2016 hence although the observed α diversity in the rhizosphere was relatively low it still exhibited a more complex interaction within the microbial community surprisingly the endosphere showed a completely different network pattern than the substrate and rhizosphere table 1 fig 6e f it was observed that pathogens including botanic and zoonotic species were predominated in the endosphere of l cw and h cw respectively without strong interactions with other species it is worth mentioning that a more complex network can generally suppress plant pathogen infection on plants yang et al 2017 therefore this may be why ralstonia a type of plant pathogen predominated in the endosphere network under the l cw condition fig 6f taking the distinct niche breadth and co occurrence network together it seems that the microbial community within the endosphere was not only governed by accessible nutrients offered from the ambient substrate but influenced by many other factors such as the invasion of pathogens plant types edwards et al 2015 the null model based index was applied to investigate the degree of ecological stochasticity in three compartments under different hlrs according to the results in figure s4 the determinate process was predominated in bulk substate and rhizosphere compared with h cw l cw showed lower pnst values in all compartments indicating that a more determinate assembly process governed the l cw s microbial community the more stochastic microbial assembly under the h cw condition can be mainly ascribed to the higher dispersal ratio i e microbial immigration rate resulting from the higher hlr evans et al 2017 it is worth noting that the mechanism of microbial community assembly could be used to diagnose system performance and provide information on potential system malfunction liébana et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 for instance a prominent status of deterministic assembly in a full scale wastewater treatment system can allow a well engineered microbial community embedded with a low overlap of functions taxa i e functional dependency and result in a relatively stable operation thus contributing to better nutrients removal performance yu et al 2021 however based on our observations different microbial functional preferences between h cw and l cw are associated with similar microbial community assemblies which was inconsistent with previous studies in wwtps yu et al 2021 and sequencing batch reactors liébana et al 2019 this inconsistency might be attributed to the different pollutant removal mechanisms between wastewater treatment processes and cws 3 5 endosphere and pathogens invasion in both hlr conditions the niche breadth of the endosphere showed a widely divergent pattern compared to the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig s3 the microbial community in the endosphere was primarily regulated by the chemicals excreted by plants instead of the nutrients offered by the bulk substrate or rhizosphere in other words more directly under the plant s control edwards et al 2015 in addition the endosphere s microbial community can play a critical role in nutrient uptake and assimilation through the ambient substrate to maintain healthy plant growth poudel et al 2019 due to the abovementioned multiple roles carried by the endosphere microorganism the observed niche breadth in the endosphere was broader than in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere it should be mentioned that canna indica l i e the selected emergent plant species has been widely used in cws development and river restorations fang et al 2016 yadav et al 2018 however the root associated microbiome of canna indica l has been rarely investigated in the past similar to other emergent plants such as phragmites australis and typha latifolia proteobacteria and acidobacteria were predominant in the rhizosphere fig 4a pietrangelo et al 2018 unlike in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere the endosphere was predominated by cyanobacteria and proteobacteria accounting for more than 94 which is different from other reported plants edwards et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 this discrepancy might be attributed to the niche related selection of microbial functional groups related to plant species and root exudates miranda sánchez et al 2016 in terms of different hlrs the degrees of relative abundance of cyanobacteria and epsilonbacteraeota in h cw were significantly higher p 0 05 than in l cw fig 4a besides ralstonia was enriched in the l cw s endosphere fig 4b suggesting that botanic pathogens can outcompete the original microbial community in the endosphere and further affect plant health this observation was proved by the obtained lower plant biomass in l cw compared to h cw additionally we found that ralstonia was predominant in the endosphere network under the l cw condition rather than h cw fig 6e f showing that factors like hlr could suppress the botanic pathogen infection due to a more complex co occurrence network triggered by high hlr interestingly the zoonotic pathogen including aeromonas arcobacter and escherichia shigella which have been reported to be related with acute gastroenteritis and associated chronic sequelae castaño rodríguez et al 2018 were found in the endosphere under both h cw and l cw and were significantly enriched in h cw fig 4b the observed phenomena indicated that zoonotic pathogens from influent could invade the plant through roots and accumulate under a high hlr condition besides it is worth mentioning that aermonans and families affiliated with enterobacteriaceae were observed in the network of the h cw s endosphere fig 6e which may play an important role in the endosphere microbial community to be the best of our knowledge we are the first study that observed and raised the potential biological risk in the cws plant moreover we addressed the endosphere as the primary microhabitat for accommodating different types of pathogens recently edible plants such as zizania latifolia water spinach have been widely used in cws development due to their additional economic benefit besides cws are generally considered part of modern urban landscapes that simultaneously accommodate wildlife activities and human recreations given these more attention should be paid to prevent potential pathogen dissemination within and without cws in addition the fact that the h cw condition harbored more zoonotic pathogens indicating that the relationship between environmental factors and potential biological risk should be thoroughly considered before building a new cw and during daily operation 3 6 significance cws have recently drawn significant attention due to their proven track record in absorbing and removing overly enriched nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in urban aquatic systems and precluding them from eutrophication which is triggered by excessive growth of algae and other aquatic organisms zeng et al 2021 from the perspective of civil engineering some previous studies showed that different hlrs could influence cw s nutrients removal performance to a large extent however information regarding cw s microorganisms and their responses to the changing environmental factors has been commonly underestimated to address the microbiome within cws we applied different hlrs on two identical cws and studied the microbial community variations in separated microhabitats including the bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere our results showed that instead of physical adsorption via bulk materials microorganisms are the key player under different hlrs altering the effluent quality and leading to discrepant removal efficiencies on various nutrients such as nh4 n no3 n and tn recently severe urban waterlogging has become more and more common due to the frequent heavy rainfall brought by global climate change consequently cws as a part of urban landscapes including the microorganisms therein have to face the challenge of high hlr in this study the comprehensive influence of high hlr was estimated from the response of the microbial community and the associated nutrient removal performance last but not least the potential biological risk in cws was first observed during our investigation particularly the invasion of the zoonotic pathogens into the cw s endosphere and their enriched community under the h cw condition it should be mentioned that plants in cws are harvested periodically for the purpose of system maintenance which can potentially lead to the dissemination of pathogens from cws to human society 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the cw s microbial response to different hlrs and correlated nutrients removal performance specifically a higher abundance of genera in desulfurization and denitrification under the higher hlr was associated with higher tn and no3 n removals more importantly the higher hlr condition bred a more complex network than the lower hlr condition besides this study provides a novel insight into the latent biological contamination risk in cws which has not been reported before according to the 16s rdna sequences analysis zoonotic pathogens showed a greater prevalence under the higher hlr condition indicating the potential correlation between hlr and pathogen intrusion this study has practical significance for those cws managers seeking to understand the outcome of hlr regulation and maintain a well tuned cw for nutrient removal we believe that this will drive improved data collection efforts that can be used for cws management practices credit authorship contribution statement nan zhang writing original draft formal analysis investigation

16113,constructed wetland cw is an environment friendly and low cost technology for nutrients removal from domestic wastewater for a well tuned cw hydraulic loading rate hlr is one of the critical factors particularly under the challenging circumstance of more frequent heavy rainfall events brought by global warming in this study a comprehensive investigation was conducted to explore the influence of different hlrs on the cw s bulk substrate and root associated microbiota aiming to yield new insight for cw management from a hybrid perspective of environmental microbiology and engineering science the response of the microbial community and associated nutrients removal performance under different hlr settings were analyzed after a one year operation results showed that the bulk substrate and rhizosphere genera involved in desulfurization and denitrification such as ferritrophicum sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma were enriched in the higher hlr condition and associated with the higher total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal compared to the lower hlr condition co occurrence network analysis demonstrated a more complex network under the higher hlr condition besides it was observed that more stochastic in microbial assembly under the higher hlr condition surprisingly zoonotic pathogens were observed and showed a greater prevalence under the higher hlr condition indicating the potential correlation between hlr and pathogen intrusion collectively this study revealed that the microbiota could be significantly altered under different hlr conditions thereby resulting in differences in nutrients removal performance graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland hydraulic loading rate microbial assembly nutrients removal endosphere biological risk 1 introduction constructed wetland cw is an environment friendly and low cost technology for nutrients removal from domestic wastewater yang et al 2018 parameters of cws such as type of plant and bulk substrate water depth and hydraulic retention time play essential roles in maintaining the performance of nutrients removal for wastewater treatment wu et al 2015 besides hydraulic loading rate hlr is one of the critical variables which has been extensively studied in previous studies bang et al 2019 stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 according to bang et al suspended solids and organic matter within the cw substrate can demonstrate an excellent buffer capacity when hlr increases from 750 to 1500 l m 2 d 1 bang et al 2019 as a result the relationship between hlr and cw performance in nutrients removal is of great interest bang et al 2019 stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 wu et al 2015 though cws have been designed mainly from an engineering perspective it is now recognized that cw s microbial community is responsible for most of the nutrients removal tang et al 2020 wu et al 2015 and many technical problems could be avoided by monitoring the microbial community structure zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2020 thus a better understanding of cw s microbial community is crucial for cw management however to the best of our knowledge the root associated microbial community in cws is rarely reported zhang et al 2021b zhao et al 2021 the root associated microbial community plays a crucial role in geochemical cycling and has been widely studied in artificial and natural ecosystems such as fields forests and grass edwards et al 2015 naylor et al 2017 sawada et al 2021 previous studies on the root associated microbial community mainly focused on terrestrial plants such as wheat and legume usyskin tonne et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 it should be noted that the root associated ecosystems between the terrestrial and aquatic environments are fundamentally different besides the emergent plant known as the primary type of the cw s plants and its root system can influence the microbial community by releasing oxygen and root exudates leading to a different performance in nutrient removal shelef et al 2013 wu et al 2015 as a result to better understand cws it is crucial to study the root associated microbial community in an engineered aquatic environment microorganisms do not exist in isolation and they usually form a complex inter species network that regulates the structure and function of an ecological community faust and raes 2012 xue et al 2018 for instance using network analysis it is found that in cws the association between microorganisms tends to become more complex and stable under a relatively high temperature mu et al 2021 and network analysis has been used more and more to study microbial interaction within natural and engineered ecological systems guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a which can provide us better insights into microbial ecology and their responses to environmental change that other microbial analyses cannot easily reveal in recent years microbial community assembly has drawn significant attention due to its unique point of view in exploring the mechanisms for biodiversity and microorganism succession ning et al 2020 for engineered ecosystems such as the wastewater treatment plants wwtps microbial community assembly is used to figure out the relationship between the microbial community and the nutrients removal efficiency to improve the performance liébana et al 2019 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a however as far as we know the above two directions have been rarely focused on cws collectively the microbial community in cws has been demonstrated to be affected by many factors including influent characteristics operational parameters and environmental conditions mu et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 additionally the frequent heavy rainfall events brought by global warming may result in a significantly higher hlr than the original design of cws and potentially lead to a perturbation of microorganisms given the current shortage of knowledge two cws were constructed to investigate the bulk substrate and root associate microbial community s response under different hlrs the aims of this study are to 1 investigate the variation of microbial biodiversity and composition in the bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere microbiota under different hlrs 2 uncover the feedback of microbial interaction and assembly in the bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere microbiota under different hlrs 3 figure out how hlr influences the cw s nutrient removal from a hybrid perspective of environmental microbiology and engineering science this study will help improve the understanding of the microbial ecology in cws ecosystems providing a foundation for further improvement of cws microbial community regulation strategy under the global warming circumstance 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the constructed wetlands two identical horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands length width height 9 18 5 00 0 70 m were built in ningbo zhejiang china n29 4 42 28 e121 2 26 37 in may 2019 ningbo has a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 16 4 ºc with the hottest month of july 28 ºc on average and the coldest month of january 4 7 ºc on average the wetland bed was vertically divided into two layers by nylon mesh the bottom layer consisted of 0 55 m gravel φ 25 32 mm and the upper layer contained 0 15 m sand φ 0 5 mm the tailwater from the previous anoxic oxic process was circulated to the two cws by distribution pipes located in the upper layer of the wetlands similar individuals i e canna indica l in the same seedling stage were selected in this study with a cultural density of 6 plants m2 as shown in fig 1 both cws had the same design parameters and influent characteristics except hlr which were 1 06 m3 m 2 d 1 i e lower hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland l cw and 1 56 m3 m 2 d 1 i e higher hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland h cw respectively 2 2 sample collection after one year of operation samples were collected from both cws in may 2020 water samples including influent and effluent of each cw were collected in sump pits fig 1 each water sample was collected approximately 300 ml in a 500 ml clean bottle then the water samples were placed into an icebox sent to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for the water quality test to reduce bias related to random environmental variation and ensure enough samples for subsequent analyses we selected eighteen sites containing canna indica l the sampling position from inlet to outlet of each cw with the dimension of 0 3 m 0 3 m for collecting bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere samples fig 1 within each site samples were collected using the five point sampling method before collecting these samples the above ground parts of canna indica l were harvested put into bags and transported to the laboratory for plant biomass measurement for each soil sample a 10 15 cm deep substrate core was collected by a sterile shovel sealed in sterile bags kept in an icebox and transported to the laboratory for further experiments bulk substrate samples were collected relatively away from roots for rhizosphere samples roots clinging substrate were vigorously shaken by hand until no attached solids could be observed on the roots surface subsequently the roots were placed into a sterile falcon tube containing 20 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs and stirred for 2 min to disperse the tightly attached substrate afterward the roots were transferred to another pbs rinsed twice with fresh pbs and the resulting root samples were considered the endosphere samples after separation the bulk substrate samples were hand picked to remove plant residues stones and earthworms and then stored at 4 and 80 c for physicochemical analyses and dna isolation respectively besides the rhizosphere and endosphere samples were stored at 80 c for dna isolation 2 3 physicochemical analyses of samples the water quality of influent and effluent in cws was analyzed including ph total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n according to standard methods for water and wastewater examination 2002 besides the harvested canna indica l were dried at natural ventilation for a week after which their mass was determined the physicochemical properties of the bulk substrate samples including ph electrical conductivity ec cation exchange capacity cec dissolved organic carbon doc available phosphorus ap available potassium ak available iron afe available sulfur as dissolve total nitrogen dtn tn no3 n nh4 n clay sand and silt contents were tested according to the protocols in agricultural chemistry committee of china 1983 2 4 dna extraction amplification sequencing and data processing a total of 216 samples i e eighteen sites three compartments bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere four replications were subjected to total dna extraction using a dna isolation kit power substrate mobio usa according to the manufacturer guideline a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc usa was used to detect the dna quantity and quality the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 sawada et al 2021 the pcr reaction was carried out in a reaction mixture of 20 μl under the following thermo cycling operations 4 c for 3 min 30 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 50 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s the processed mixture was then incubated at 72 c for 10 min equimolar of the purified dna samples were subsequently sequenced using the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa having a paired end 2 300 bp approach the ncbi accession number of the raw sequencing data is prjna742500 the obtained raw data sequences were processed using the qiime2 pipeline knights et al 2010 we used dada2 yu et al 2021 for denoising removing chimeras trimming rare sequences data and generating amplicon sequences variants asvs furthermore the asvs were recognized by a naïve bayes classifier trained with the feature classifier employing the 16s rrna gene database having a 99 similarity of the silva 132 then sequences identified as mitochondria and unpaired bacterial were removed from the analysis finally we obtained a total of 6216 417 high quality sequences and 82 777 asvs from 216 samples 19 880 38 651 sequences for each sample a total of 19 880 sequences per sample were randomly selected to normalize the sequencing depth of each sample the α diversity index including phylogenetic diversity and shannon index was calculated using qiime2 2 5 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to test significant differences using spss19 0 spss chicago il usa to evaluate the difference of hlr compartment and sampling position principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance was performed using the ape package nonparametric multivariate analysis was used to find a significant difference in β diversity using the vegan package levin s niche breadth index for the microbial community was calculated using the niche width function in spaa package desqe2 analysis was conducted to determine significant discriminant genus adjust p value 0 05 and log2 fold change log2fc 2 between the two cws using the desqe2 package spearman correlation between the bulk substrate s discriminant genera and physicochemical properties was evaluated using a psych package all statistical analyses were conducted with r v3 6 2 statistical software http www r project org unless otherwise stated 2 6 co occurrence network and community assembly analysis for network analysis only robust correlations if the spearman correlation coefficient ρ was 0 6 or 0 6 and statistically significant p value 0 01 zhang et al 2021c were chosen and visualized by gephi interactive platform du et al 2020 subsequently the topology of empirical and random networks was calculated by the igraph package phylogenetic normalized stochasticity ratio pnst was performed by r codes ning et al 2020 to study the microbial community assembly process 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical analyses most physicochemical factors in the bulk substrate except as clay sand and silt contents were significantly higher anova p 0 05 in h cw than in l cw table s1 and the canna indica l biomass in h cw 1468 302 7 g was also significantly higher p 0 05 than in l cw 876 8 126 3 g having identical influent properties fig 2 the effluent quality showed different variations between h cw and l cw specifically the concentrations of nh4 n and cod in the l cw effluent were significantly lower p 0 05 than in the h cw effluent whereas the tn and no3 n showed the opposite trend fig 2 it is well known that the bulk substrate is one of the essential components in cws which removes most of the pollutants from source water through physical adsorption yang et al 2018 as a result a higher hlr can provide more nutrients within the same period allowing the bulk substrate to absorb more nutrients it should be noted that overly adsorbed bulk substrate might suffer from saturation along with time and eventually result in nutrient wash off saeed et al 2019 as expected some nutrient concentrations i e nh4 n and cod were higher in the h cw effluent than in l cw fig 2 surprisingly we found that the tn and no3 n concentrations were significantly lower in the h cw effluent than in l cw indicating the abovementioned physical adsorption might not be a fundamental cause of the different nutrients removal performances thus we believe that the divergence was mainly associated with the microbial community variation the key player in all cws weber 2016 3 2 biodiversity and niche breadth as shown in fig 3 different hydraulic loading rates hlrs caused a remarkable difference in α diversity between the higher hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland h cw and the lower hydraulic loading rate constructed wetland l cw within all the compartments i e bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere specifically the values of α diversity were significantly higher p 0 05 in h cw than in l cw this phenomenon can best be explained by associating it with the great nutrients accessibility offered by the h cw condition which can enhance aquatic plant productivity and boost the total microbial diversity du et al 2020 liu et al 2010 ren et al 2018 besides a higher hlr can potentially contribute to a greater microbial immigration rate therefore favoring microbial diversity evans et al 2017 in terms of compartment differences we found gradually decreased α diversity from the bulk substrate rhizosphere to endosphere regardless of hlr conditions caused by the hierarchical filtration triggered by root effect xiao et al 2017 additionally in all compartments except the rhizosphere the α diversity showed no significant difference p 0 05 within different sampling positions principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance combined with permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed within all samples to rank the factors i e hlr compartment and sampling position in governing the microbial community heterogeneity by order of importance and found that compartment was the most critical factor followed by hlr and sampling position respectively fig s1 based on our preliminary assumption sampling position fig 1 is an essential experimental variable that may profoundly change results within a compartment thus pcoa was performed to evaluate the importance of hlr and sampling position within each compartment as shown in fig s2 hlr had a more superior influence than different sampling positions at the heart of these findings demonstrate the inherently powerful decisive effect of a habitat type upon a microbial community more importantly it directly shows the necessity for investigating cws with different hlrs from the perspective of separated mini environments such as bulk substrate and rhizosphere one of the fundamental differences between h cw and l cw lies in the total available nutrient loading when having a high total nutrient loading a microbial community can access more resources and devote them to develop a broader niche breadth guo et al 2020 in this study we found that the h cw s bulk substrate and rhizosphere had higher niche breadth values than l cw fig s3 in general the higher α diversity of the bulk substrate and rhizosphere under the h cw condition fig 3 together with their broader niche breadth implied a great potential of cw s microbial functions such as denitrification zeng et al 2021 under both h cw and l cw conditions the endosphere environment showed distinct niche patterns that maintained a broader scope than the bulk substrate and rhizosphere compartments in addition the niche breadth of the endosphere compartment in l cw was more expansive than in h cw concerning the distinct niche breadth observed in the endosphere we believe that the unexpected results were strongly correlated with the invasion of different pathogens through plant roots which will be discussed in the following sections 3 3 microbial community variation and nutrients removal performance at the phylum level the microbial community exhibited compositional variations in different compartments and hlrs fig 4 a the observed results showed that proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere followed by bacteroidetes acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia which are consistent with previous studies observations edwards et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 in terms of relative abundance the predominated phylum in each compartment varied with hlr fig 4a for the bulk substrate the degrees of relative abundance of acidobateria and verrucomicrobia in l cw were significantly higher p 0 05 than in h cw in contrast proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi showed the opposite pattern additionally thaumarchaota accounted for nearly 6 15 which was considerably higher p 0 05 in the l cw bulk substrate than in other environments heatmap based on deseq2 was used to determine which genera were responsible for the distinct microbial community in different compartments and hlrs fig 4b based on the observed results genera involved in desulfurization sulfur reduction and sulfur oxidation and denitrogenation denitrification and ammonia oxidation showed a significant difference between the two cws in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig 4b almost all genera involved in desulfurization such as desulforhabdus desulfobulbus sulfuritalea and thiothrix showed significantly higher p 0 05 relative abundance in h cw than in l cw similarly the relative abundance of dechloromonas delftia ferritrophicum sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma involved with denitrification was significantly higher p 0 05 in h cw than in l cw thus it allows us to conclude that keystone genera involved in desulfurization and denitrification were significantly enriched in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere under the h cw condition which directly enhanced the corresponding cws functions leading to higher tn and no3 n removal fig 2 for example the observed sulfurisoma sulfurimonas and ferritrophicum responsible for sulfide based autotrophic denitrification liu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 were more abundant in h cw than in l cw previous studies showed that combining heterotrophic denitrification and sulfide based autotrophic denitrification can result in a high tn removal liu et al 2021 meanwhile sulfur content can enhance the growth of heterogeneous autotrophic denitrifying bacteria leading to higher nitrate nitrogen removal efficiency in cws tang et al 2020 however the presence of sulfide based autotrophic denitrification may make the organic matter less likely to act as an electron donor leading to lower cod removal fig 2 spearman correlation analysis was further conducted to reveal the relationship between the physicochemical factors and associated genera fig 5 the genera involved with desulfurization and denitrogenation showed different association patterns to environmental factors according to fig 5 we found a strong positive correlation between the abovementioned genera and some critical bulk substrate s physicochemical properties including afe doc and tn this observation is consistent with previous studies that reported tn and doc were the determining factors in regulating microbial community and function associated with varied nitrogen removal efficiencies in wwtps fang et al 2018 tian and wang 2020 moreover afe concentration has been recognized as a critical property in cws increasing nitrogen removal in cws by altering the microbial community song et al 2016 tang et al 2020 considering l cw s bulk substrate and rhizosphere the abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaeons aoas including candidatus nirtosoachaeum nitrosotalea and nitrosotenuis belong to thaumarchaota phylum were significantly enriched fig 4b as shown in fig 2 the l cw effluent had lower nh4 n concentrations and higher no3 n concentrations it is well known that in biological wastewater treatment aoas can exert a crucial regulating effect upon ammonia removal you et al 2009 therefore the observed higher abundance of aoas was a clear indicator of a high nitrification activity that had taken place in l cw fig 2 further a strong negative correlation between aoas and the abovementioned physicochemical properties i e tn doc and afe was observed under the l cw condition fig 5 previous studies reported that the substrate properties such as c n li et al 2015 tn wu et al 2010 and toc wu et al 2010 yang et al 2016 were negatively correlated with the abundance of aoas it should be noted that although cws are typically engineered as an open atmospheric aerobic system some immerged subsurface locations within cws can still develop anaerobic environments accommodating anaerobic microorganisms like iron ammonia oxidizing bacteria feammox newly discovered using ferric ion as electron acceptor to oxide ammonia wu et al 2019 therefore the negative correlation between aoas and afe was likely due to feammox competing with aoas song et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in general our results suggested that hlr can directly influence the predominant microorganisms by altering the bulk substrate s physicochemical properties and thus resulting in varied cws performance 3 4 co occurrence network and microbial community assembly the network model analysis for a microbial community provided insight into the complex relationship among microorganisms and converted it into an organized pattern faust and raes 2012 according to the results of empirical networks all networks exhibited a modular structure table 1 i e modularity 0 4 du et al 2020 as shown in table 1 the topological parameters such as modularity and average clustering coefficient of all empirical networks were higher than the random networks and the values of small world coefficient were all greater than one the above results showed that the network structures of cws studied in this work owned non random and small world properties xue et al 2018 in terms of different hlrs the l cw network exhibited much lower nodes i e network size edges i e microbial interaction number and modularity than the h cw network table 1 these observations were mainly associated with the high hlr condition enhancing network complexity and among genera connectivity within the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig 6 which implied more intense microbial cooperation and function wagg et al 2019 besides the network density in l cw was higher than in h cw regardless of compartments whereas the average path length exhibited the opposite trend according to the co occurrence network rhodanobacter was one of the predominant genera in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig 6 previous studies reported that rhodanobacter is a crucial microorganism in anoxic tanks raper et al 2019 sequencing batch reactors cai et al 2022 and biofilm reactors huang et al 2019 in regulating the denitrification activity from wastewater van den heuvel et al 2010 as a result the predominant role of rhodanobacter found in this study again indicates that tn removal is one of the crucial functions in cws besides candidatus nitrosotalea and dyella responsible for ammonia oxidation lehtovirta morely et al 2016 and organic carbon degradation hemme et al 2015 were predominant in the l cw condition fig 6b d that directly led to the lower concentrations of nh4 n and cod observed in the l cw effluent fig 2 moreover we found an interaction between rhodanobacter and sulfurisoma in the h cw bulk substrate fig 6a that confirmed the synergistic effect between denitrifying bacteria and sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria towards the no3 n and tn removal fig 2 in summary we believed that the abovementioned reasons worked together and resulted in superior nitrogen removal performance i e no3 n and tn removal but slightly lower cod and nh4 n degradation under the h cw condition in terms of different compartments the rhizosphere network showed a more complex structure than the bulk substrate network despite its lower α diversity table 1 fig 3 it should be noted that the rhizosphere has been demonstrated to be a special substrate micro environment where microorganisms are more active than the bulk substrate shi et al 2016 hence although the observed α diversity in the rhizosphere was relatively low it still exhibited a more complex interaction within the microbial community surprisingly the endosphere showed a completely different network pattern than the substrate and rhizosphere table 1 fig 6e f it was observed that pathogens including botanic and zoonotic species were predominated in the endosphere of l cw and h cw respectively without strong interactions with other species it is worth mentioning that a more complex network can generally suppress plant pathogen infection on plants yang et al 2017 therefore this may be why ralstonia a type of plant pathogen predominated in the endosphere network under the l cw condition fig 6f taking the distinct niche breadth and co occurrence network together it seems that the microbial community within the endosphere was not only governed by accessible nutrients offered from the ambient substrate but influenced by many other factors such as the invasion of pathogens plant types edwards et al 2015 the null model based index was applied to investigate the degree of ecological stochasticity in three compartments under different hlrs according to the results in figure s4 the determinate process was predominated in bulk substate and rhizosphere compared with h cw l cw showed lower pnst values in all compartments indicating that a more determinate assembly process governed the l cw s microbial community the more stochastic microbial assembly under the h cw condition can be mainly ascribed to the higher dispersal ratio i e microbial immigration rate resulting from the higher hlr evans et al 2017 it is worth noting that the mechanism of microbial community assembly could be used to diagnose system performance and provide information on potential system malfunction liébana et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 for instance a prominent status of deterministic assembly in a full scale wastewater treatment system can allow a well engineered microbial community embedded with a low overlap of functions taxa i e functional dependency and result in a relatively stable operation thus contributing to better nutrients removal performance yu et al 2021 however based on our observations different microbial functional preferences between h cw and l cw are associated with similar microbial community assemblies which was inconsistent with previous studies in wwtps yu et al 2021 and sequencing batch reactors liébana et al 2019 this inconsistency might be attributed to the different pollutant removal mechanisms between wastewater treatment processes and cws 3 5 endosphere and pathogens invasion in both hlr conditions the niche breadth of the endosphere showed a widely divergent pattern compared to the bulk substrate and rhizosphere fig s3 the microbial community in the endosphere was primarily regulated by the chemicals excreted by plants instead of the nutrients offered by the bulk substrate or rhizosphere in other words more directly under the plant s control edwards et al 2015 in addition the endosphere s microbial community can play a critical role in nutrient uptake and assimilation through the ambient substrate to maintain healthy plant growth poudel et al 2019 due to the abovementioned multiple roles carried by the endosphere microorganism the observed niche breadth in the endosphere was broader than in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere it should be mentioned that canna indica l i e the selected emergent plant species has been widely used in cws development and river restorations fang et al 2016 yadav et al 2018 however the root associated microbiome of canna indica l has been rarely investigated in the past similar to other emergent plants such as phragmites australis and typha latifolia proteobacteria and acidobacteria were predominant in the rhizosphere fig 4a pietrangelo et al 2018 unlike in the bulk substrate and rhizosphere the endosphere was predominated by cyanobacteria and proteobacteria accounting for more than 94 which is different from other reported plants edwards et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 this discrepancy might be attributed to the niche related selection of microbial functional groups related to plant species and root exudates miranda sánchez et al 2016 in terms of different hlrs the degrees of relative abundance of cyanobacteria and epsilonbacteraeota in h cw were significantly higher p 0 05 than in l cw fig 4a besides ralstonia was enriched in the l cw s endosphere fig 4b suggesting that botanic pathogens can outcompete the original microbial community in the endosphere and further affect plant health this observation was proved by the obtained lower plant biomass in l cw compared to h cw additionally we found that ralstonia was predominant in the endosphere network under the l cw condition rather than h cw fig 6e f showing that factors like hlr could suppress the botanic pathogen infection due to a more complex co occurrence network triggered by high hlr interestingly the zoonotic pathogen including aeromonas arcobacter and escherichia shigella which have been reported to be related with acute gastroenteritis and associated chronic sequelae castaño rodríguez et al 2018 were found in the endosphere under both h cw and l cw and were significantly enriched in h cw fig 4b the observed phenomena indicated that zoonotic pathogens from influent could invade the plant through roots and accumulate under a high hlr condition besides it is worth mentioning that aermonans and families affiliated with enterobacteriaceae were observed in the network of the h cw s endosphere fig 6e which may play an important role in the endosphere microbial community to be the best of our knowledge we are the first study that observed and raised the potential biological risk in the cws plant moreover we addressed the endosphere as the primary microhabitat for accommodating different types of pathogens recently edible plants such as zizania latifolia water spinach have been widely used in cws development due to their additional economic benefit besides cws are generally considered part of modern urban landscapes that simultaneously accommodate wildlife activities and human recreations given these more attention should be paid to prevent potential pathogen dissemination within and without cws in addition the fact that the h cw condition harbored more zoonotic pathogens indicating that the relationship between environmental factors and potential biological risk should be thoroughly considered before building a new cw and during daily operation 3 6 significance cws have recently drawn significant attention due to their proven track record in absorbing and removing overly enriched nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in urban aquatic systems and precluding them from eutrophication which is triggered by excessive growth of algae and other aquatic organisms zeng et al 2021 from the perspective of civil engineering some previous studies showed that different hlrs could influence cw s nutrients removal performance to a large extent however information regarding cw s microorganisms and their responses to the changing environmental factors has been commonly underestimated to address the microbiome within cws we applied different hlrs on two identical cws and studied the microbial community variations in separated microhabitats including the bulk substrate rhizosphere and endosphere our results showed that instead of physical adsorption via bulk materials microorganisms are the key player under different hlrs altering the effluent quality and leading to discrepant removal efficiencies on various nutrients such as nh4 n no3 n and tn recently severe urban waterlogging has become more and more common due to the frequent heavy rainfall brought by global climate change consequently cws as a part of urban landscapes including the microorganisms therein have to face the challenge of high hlr in this study the comprehensive influence of high hlr was estimated from the response of the microbial community and the associated nutrient removal performance last but not least the potential biological risk in cws was first observed during our investigation particularly the invasion of the zoonotic pathogens into the cw s endosphere and their enriched community under the h cw condition it should be mentioned that plants in cws are harvested periodically for the purpose of system maintenance which can potentially lead to the dissemination of pathogens from cws to human society 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the cw s microbial response to different hlrs and correlated nutrients removal performance specifically a higher abundance of genera in desulfurization and denitrification under the higher hlr was associated with higher tn and no3 n removals more importantly the higher hlr condition bred a more complex network than the lower hlr condition besides this study provides a novel insight into the latent biological contamination risk in cws which has not been reported before according to the 16s rdna sequences analysis zoonotic pathogens showed a greater prevalence under the higher hlr condition indicating the potential correlation between hlr and pathogen intrusion this study has practical significance for those cws managers seeking to understand the outcome of hlr regulation and maintain a well tuned cw for nutrient removal we believe that this will drive improved data collection efforts that can be used for cws management practices credit authorship contribution statement nan zhang writing original draft formal analysis investigation

16114,groundwater contamination by recalcitrant organic micropollutants such as pesticide residues poses a great threat to the quality of drinking water one way to remediate drinking water containing micropollutants is to bioaugment with specific pollutant degrading bacteria previous attempts to augment sand filters with the 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam degrading bacterium aminobacter niigataensis msh1 to remediate bam polluted drinking water initially worked well but the efficiency rapidly decreased due to loss of degrader bacteria here we use pilot scale augmented sand filters to treat retentate of reverse osmosis treatment thus increasing residence time in the biofilters and potentially nutrient availability in a first pilot scale experiment bam and most of the measured nutrients were concentrated 5 10 times in the retentate this did not adversely affect the abundances of inoculated bacteria and the general prokaryotic community of the sand filter presented only minor differences on the other hand the high degradation activity was not prolonged compared to the filter receiving non concentrated water at the same residence time using laboratory columns it was shown that efficient bam degradation could be achieved for 100 days by increasing the residence time in the sand filter a slower flow may have practical implications for the treatment of large volumes of water however this can be circumvented when treating only the retentate water equalling 10 15 of the volume of inlet water we therefore conducted a second pilot scale experiment with two inoculated sand filters receiving membrane retentate operated with different residence times 22 versus 133 min for 65 days while the number of msh1 in the biofilters was not affected the effect on degradation was significant in the filter with short residence time bam degradation decreased from 86 to a stable level of 10 30 degradation within the first two weeks the filter with the long residence time initially showed 97 bam degradation which only slightly decreased with time 88 at day 65 our study demonstrates the advantage of combining membrane filtration with bioaugmented filters in cases where flow rate is of high importance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants bioaugmentation sand filter membrane filtration bacteria biofilter 1 introduction clean drinking water is one of the earth s most important resources and yet the quantity and quality of water available for human consumption is increasingly deteriorated due to anthropogenic activities unesco 2018 the production use and disposal of numerous chemicals in industry private households and agriculture is now recognized to lead to a widespread occurrence of organic micropollutants in the environment including groundwater used for drinking water production barbosa et al 2016 in addition to known groundwater pollutants new screening methods using non target high resolution mass spectrometry kiefer et al 2021 will most likely reveal hazardous chemicals that exceed threshold limits for drinking water for example 0 1 µg l for pesticides and relevant degradation products in the european union not all contaminants can be removed by conventional technologies and not all technologies are equally acceptable due to high energy consumption or other drawbacks such as unwanted by product formation incomplete mineralization or generation of chemical waste hence a continuous need exists to provide remediation solutions to remove low concentrations of organic micropollutants such as recalcitrant pesticide residues from drinking water rapid sand filters at waterworks are known to contain a substantial diversity of bacteria albers et al 2015a de vet et al 2009 which may have the potential to degrade some organic micropollutants hedegaard and albrechtsen 2014 richter et al 2008 zearley and summers 2012 however those organic micropollutants that compromise groundwater quality are often recalcitrant and are thus not readily degradable by the natural microbial populations in sand filters the introduction of specific micropollutant degrading bacteria into rapid sand filters at waterworks has therefore been suggested as a treatment technology for polluted groundwater benner et al 2013 recently such a strategy was found to be very promising for degradation of the pesticide metaldehyde in sand filters castro gutierrez et al 2022 metaldehyde is a common surface water contaminant but rarely detected in groundwater aquifers presumably due to its relatively high degradability typical half life in soil of 5 days http sitem herts ac uk aeru ppdb en reports 446 htm 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam is an example of a widespread recalcitrant organic micropollutant pesticide residue in groundwater where a bacterial degrader organism aminobacter niigataensis msh1 nielsen et al 2021 has been isolated and grown in the laboratory sørensen et al 2007 the msh1 strain has been shown to have the ability to adhere to sand albers et al 2014 and the genes involved in degradation of bam have been well characterized nielsen et al 2021 raes et al 2019 msh1 is therefore a promising candidate to provide a proof of concept of bioaugmentation for treatment of drinking water previous attempts to add msh1 to sand filters were however only partially successful due to loss of bacteria after an initial period with substantial bam degradation albers et al 2015b horemans et al 2017 reverse osmosis ro is a well known membrane separation technology for producing clean water permeate stream as a result of rejecting and consequently concentrating organic micropollutants including pesticide residues as well as inorganic nutrients in a waste stream retentate stream of a smaller volume fini et al 2019 2020 jamil et al 2019 madsen and søgaard 2014 urtiaga et al 2013 by combining membrane filtration with bioaugmented sand filters less water must be bioremediated opening for a longer water residence time in the filter and thereby longer time for the pollutants to be degraded furthermore as nutrients are also concentrated in the retentate the growth and survival of the augmented bacteria may be improved in the present study we therefore made series of pilot and laboratory scale experiments to explore the effect of reverse osmosis and water flow conditions on the long term survival and bam degrading activity of msh1 in a combined membrane biofilter treatment system if successful the purified retentate could even be used to remineralize the permeate from the filters hence leading to a remediation technology where the micropollutant is eliminated completely without any loss of water 2 material and methods 2 1 field site description a pilot waterworks with a ro membrane and two biofilters was installed next to an abandoned drinking water abstraction well with bam contaminated water varying over time from 0 3 to 1 7 µg l the contamination comes from an old farmyard used for loading and cleaning of sprayers the well is located at 55 30 n 8 27 e 2 2 pilot waterworks the pilot waterworks fig 1 was custom designed for this project and was placed in a portable trailer l 401 cm w 185 cm h 205 cm the raw groundwater was pumped into a prefilter consisting of a closed steel cylinder filled with a chalk filter material nevtraco silhorko eurowater a s denmark in which iron was precipitated after aeration using a compressor from there the water was split in two lines one with and one without membrane filtration the membrane filtration line included an ion exchange unit to remove calcium and magnesium ions to prevent scaling and a reverse osmosis membrane unit consisting of two spiral wound filmtec xle 4040 dupont usa membrane elements in series providing 16 2 m2 membrane area the retentate of the filtration being concentrated approx 10 times was led to a 86 l steel cylinder h 135 cm ø 30 cm containing nevtraco filter material biofilter 1 the line without membrane filtration was coupled to a similar steel cylinder biofilter 2 but this could be changed so that both filters received retentate water could be sampled at multiple points along the water flow and water and filter material could be sampled at five different depths of the filters 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 90 cm from the top fig 1a to sample representative samples the water was left running for at least 200 ml with as low flow as possible avoiding changing the pressure and flow in the system sampling of filter material was done by stopping the flow and inserting a brass pipe through a ball vial with costume made insert with o ring to enclose the brass tube at the end of the brass tube a piece of silicon tube was added with a small clamp to stop the water for floating out at each depth a total of 3 times 10 gs was sampled and kept cold until storage in the lab at 20 c until extraction samples were taken at day 1 3 8 22 55 and 77 with regards to microbial analyses we consider the period between day 1 and day 3 to be the beginning of the treatment from day 4 21 is considered middle and day 22 77 is considered the end of the treatment two experiments were conducted at the pilot waterworks to test the effect of preconcentration using ro membrane and to test the effect of residence time respectively before each experiment the two biofilters and the prefilter was filled with fresh filter material with an overhanging water table of 10 cm this corresponds to 75 kg of nevtraco in each filter to remove smaller particles all filters were back washed until exiting water was clear inoculation with aminobacter niigataensis msh1 was carried out basically as described in albers et al 2015b in brief msh1 was grown in 5 l baffle bottle from freeze batch msh1 cells were then diluted with sterile tap water in 10 l bottles to a bacterial number of 1013 cells and transported to the pilot waterworks the culture was added from the top of the filter and left for two hours before starting the flow final cell density was 108 cells g of nevtraco in each of the biofilters before running the pilot waterworks with groundwater the bioaugmented biofilter was treated with nutrient addition for the first 48 h as an improved inoculation strategy developed by ellegaard jensen et al 2020 for more details on the inoculation see supplementary material during the period of nutrient addition the outlet was sampled in order to measure the loss of msh1 in the inoculation phase see section 2 6 this was only done in the second pilot waterwork experiment during the first 48 h there was a loss of bacterial cells of 79 and 84 for biofilter 1 and 2 respectively we did not include a sterile or non inoculated control biofilter since it is well known that bam is not degraded abiotically and does not adsorb to any significant degree neither to different soils clausen et al 2004 nor sand filter material albers et al 2015b we have also tested if any sorption to the nevtraco material exists and the sorption coefficient kd was 0 01 l kg unpublished data meaning no significant adsorption occurs the membrane unit performed successfully during the two pilot waterworks experiments running for 99 and 100 days respectively during operation the inlet and outlet pressure as well as permeate and retentate flow rates were monitored at each sampling time the inlet pressure was kept at 16 bar while the outlet pressure varied within the range of 15 5 to 15 9 bar the influent water flow rate was 780 l h in both pilot tests producing 700 l h permeate and 80 l h of retentate resulting in a 90 recovery throughout the first pilot test during the second pilot test as a result of fouling recovery slightly dropped starting with 80 l h retentate 90 recovery and ending up with 120 l h 85 recovery during the last 60 days 2 3 laboratory column experiments small column experiments were setup to investigate the influence of msh1 cell density and residence time on bioaugmented biofilter performance the small column experimental setup was as the biofilters in the pilot waterwork except water inflow was bottom up three cell densities 108 107 and 106 msh1 per gram of nevtraco and four different residence times 14 28 53 and 133 min were tested the column experiments ran for 104 and 88 days for the cell density and the residence time experiments respectively detailed description can be found in the supplementary material during the first 47 h with an influx of nutrients there was a loss of cells ranging from 15 to 50 of the inoculated msh1 in an additional experiment with triplicate columns operated with two different residence times 28 and 133 min the influence of short term changes in residence time on bam removal was tested after running for 104 days by taking four sets of samples each sampled after exchange of at least 6 pore volumes in the following sequence 1 before changing the flow so at residence times 28 and 133 min 2 after changing the residence time to 28 min in both sets of columns 3 after changing the residence time to 133 min in both sets of columns 4 after changing the flow to the original residence times of each set 28 and 133 min 2 4 bam analysis using lc ms ms at the first pilot waterworks experiment the quantification of bam was done as described in ellegaard jensen et al 2020 with the modification of larger sample volume 20 ml used for solid phase extraction for the remaining experiments the sample was simply filtered and injected directly on the lc ms ms see description in the supplementary material in all experiments bam was analyzed as the sole compound because several studies have shown that metabolite formation is not of concern when inoculating sand filters with msh1 albers et al 2015b 2014 it has long been known that the msh1 strain is capable of mineralizing bam completely to co2 and chloride sørensen et al 2007 and the complete degradation pathway of bam by msh1 was recently published raes et al 2019 also in augmented sand filters msh1 was found to mineralize bam completely albers et al 2014 and in a pilot waterwork study with a sand filter bioaugmented with msh1 no detection of the known bam metabolites 2 6 dichlorobenzoic acid 2 6 dcba ortho chlorobenzamide and ortho chlorobenzoic acid were detected at any point in time albers et al 2015b 2 5 additional water analyses water was

multi 3620 wtw germany 2 6 total cell count using flow cytometry total cell count was measured in the effluent of the two laboratory and the second pilot waterwork experiments for the two laboratory experiments 2 7 ml samples were taken the first 48 h during nutrient addition and added 0 3 ml 30 formaldehyde samples were stored at 4 c until analysis no more than 60 days a subsample of 1 ml was transferred to 2 ml eppendorf tubes with 1 µl of 1000x sybr green 1 sybr green i invitrogen life technologies corporation usa and incubated for 20 min at 30 c after staining samples were measured on accuri c6 becton dickinson lyngby denmark equipped with a 488 nm solid state laser green fluorescence was collected in the fl1 channel at 533 nm with a manual gate setting using side scatter and fl1 selecting for bacterial cells and used as template for all cell count analysis data were processed using the accuri c6 software total cell loss within the first 48 h was calculated by plotting cell concentration against total water volume and then calculating the area under the curve 2 7 dna extraction of water and filter material for molecular analyses water samples were collected in 100 ml of volume from taps along the reactors subsequently filtrated through 0 2 μm pore size microfunnel filter units pall corp ann arbor mi and the filter were stored in freezer at 20 c until dna extraction nevtraco samples were collected from the reactors in sterile 15 ml falcon tubes and stored at 20 c until dna extraction the dna extraction of water samples was done by transferring the filters in the bead tubes supplied with the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen dk following manufacturer s instructions for nevtraco samples 250 mg was placed in the lysis tube provided with dneasy powerlyzer powersoil kit qiagen dk and dna was extracted according to the manufacturer s instructions after the dna extraction we measured the dna concentration with qubit fluorometer thermo fisher scientific and the clarity with nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific all the dna extractions from water and nevtraco samples were performed along with negative controls of the extraction kit and of non inoculated samples 2 8 quantification of total bacteria and aminobacter niigataensis msh1 all the bacterial quantifications based on molecular analyses were performed through qpcr assay with ariamx real time pcr system agilent denmark using 10 μl brilliant iii ultra fast sybr green low rox qpcr master mix agilent in 20 μl reactions containing 1 ng of dna template a final concentration of 400 nm for forward and reverse primers the primer sequences used in this study are summarized in table s1 for the total quantification of bacteria the same primer set were used for the amplicon sequencing approach 341f 806r the presence of msh1 was measured by targeting the bbda gene on msh1 plasmid pbam1 using the primer set bbda f bbda r and a specific prophage insertion region on msh1 genome nielsen et al 2018 using the primers msh1 f and msh1 r developed in a previous study by ellegaard jensen et al 2020 all the amplifications were performed with the following qpcr program 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 of one step cycles of 95 c for 15 s 55 c for 30 s and followed by a melting curve obtained by increasing the temperature of 0 5 c increments every 5 s from 55 c to 95 c to confirm the specificity of the pcr product a calibration curve to measure absolute amount of aminobacter niigataensis msh1 was performed relative to microscopy counts by serially diluting two standards obtained by dna extraction from nevtraco and water filtrate respectively undiluted standard for water filters contains 6 85 107 cells μl while for nevtraco the undiluted standard contains 6 85 106 cells μl all reactions were run along with negative controls during both pilot waterworks experiments no significant difference was observed in the total number of bacteria or the total number of msh1 anova p value 0 465 between the same depth of the two biofilters despite a non homogeneous presence of msh1 in all the different layers of the reactors so bacterial number will be presented as an average of the whole biofilter 2 9 amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics dna samples extracted from nevtraco and filtered water were used for metabarcoding library preparation on the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene library preparation was carried out by a two step pcr according to feld et al 2016 see supplementary material for details the samples were sequenced on an illumina miseq using the v3 kit with paired end illumina inc sandiego us resulting in 2 300 bp reads the sequencing dataset produced was analysed using qiime 2 v 2019 7 bolyen et al 2019 with an analogous pipeline described by gobbi et al 2019 after demultiplexing the reads these were processed with dada2 callahan et al 2016 to obtain the phylogenetic tree a multiple sequence alignment was performed with mafft katoh and standley 2013 and the phylogenetic tree was built using fasttree price et al 2010 diversity analyses were done using the plugin q2 diversity phylogenetic diversity pd from faith 1992 and evenness from pielou 1966 were chosen to measure alpha diversity while beta diversity was measured using bray curtis dissimilarity and visualized through pcoa plots obtained using emperor vázquez baeza et al 2013 taxonomy assignments were done using qiime feature classifier classify sklearn bokulich et al 2013 with a pre trained naïve bayes classifier with greengenes v 13 8 desantis et al 2006 the raw reads are available on sra study accession number in progress to be provided upon final submission 2 10 growth potential assimilable organic carbon aoc in order to estimate the effect of potential additional nutrients from the membrane treatment prior to the biofilter that could lead to bacterial growth a bacterial and msh1 growth potential assay was performed on the different water samples across the pilot water plant this was done by sampling 250 ml water in aoc free 250 ml redcap bottles ptfe coated cap liner from seven different water taps sampled at day 99 from the first pilot waterwork experiment this assay is based on the growth assay by hammes and egli 2005 with few modifications for details see supplementary material in brief growth potential was estimated by adding either groundwater microbiome water bottle inoculum aqua d or brande denmark or msh1 to a density of 5000 cells ml to sterile filtered water samples from seven different water taps at the pilot waterworks into aoc free wheaton 50 ml glass serum bottles dwk life sciences usa the growth of bacteria is assumed to only come from aoc within the water sample bacterial growth was measured by flow cytometry after 12 and 13 days of incubation for groundwater microbiome and msh1 compared to initial added bacteria respectively 2 11 statistical analysis statistical analyses of the residence time change for the small column experiments were done with the multcomp package in r r core team 2013 using anova with a post hoc tukey hsd correction test p 0 05 unless otherwise stated data are presented as mean standard error of mean sem the statistical evaluation of these results was performed separately for qpcr and the sequencing data regarding qpcr dataset all statistical analyses and visualisations of the qpcr data were performed on microsoft office excel 2010 using anova and t test statistical analysis performed on the sequencing dataset was analysed through qiime2 v 2019 7 after qiime 2 pipeline processing the sequencing dataset was evaluated using the kruskal wallis test for alpha diversity and permanova with 999 permutations for beta diversity finally differentially abundant amplicon sequence variants asvs were detected through the analysis of composition of microbiomes ancom from mandal et al 2015 this test is very conservative as it is based on the assumption that only few asvs change in a statistical way between the samples and it controls for false discovery rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of preconcentration using ro membrane for bam removal in the first experiment with the pilot waterworks biofilter 1 received concentrated water and biofilter 2 non concentrated water residence times were identical in the two filters 28 min during 77 days bam was on average concentrated 8 8 0 6 times by the ro membrane which is in line with laboratory scale studies using the same xle membrane where a rejection of around 90 bam was observed fini et al 2019 hylling et al 2019 a seven to ninefold increase in the concentration of most nutrients metal ions and other water solutes was found throughout both pilot experiments see before biofilter 1 data in table 1 table s1 and fig s3 a slight reduction in the concentration of species over time can be a result of membrane fouling which is more pronounced in the case of pilot experiment 2 bam degradation in both biofilters showed 92 96 removal within the first three days followed by a fast decline in degradation efficiency to 37 and 66 at day 8 for biofilter 1 and 2 respectively fig 1a hereafter the bam degradation gradually decreased and at the end of the experiment only 6 and 28 bam was removed in biofilter 1 and 2 respectively to get below the legal threshold limit 0 1 µg l more than 72 degradation would have been needed so in summary the pilot waterworks were able to degrade bam to levels below the legal threshold limit for less than a week regardless of whether the biofilter received membrane retentate or non concentrated groundwater the decrease in bam degradation correlated with the amount of msh1 attached to the filter material fig 1b the attached amount of msh1 within the biofilters was high for the first 3 days 1 3 108 8 7 106 and 1 1 108 6 4 106 msh1 per gram of filter material for biofilter 1 and 2 respectively then the msh1 density within the biofilters dropped to 2 7 106 2 7 105 and 3 0 106 6 9 105 for biofilter 1 and 2 and then slowly decreased to around 4 105 msh1 per gram filter material qpcrs were repeated targeting both the genome of msh1 with the primers msh1 f and msh1 r and the bbda gene carried on the plasmid using bbda f and bbda r primers and the results in terms of abundance are similar throughout the whole treatment for both biofilters the inoculated bacteria thus did not lose their ability to degrade over time and the observed decrease in degradation efficiency must simply be caused by the significant decrease in msh1 abundance 108 to 106 cells g since it has been demonstrated that the genes responsible for bam degradation are constitutively expressed t syen et al 2015 the reason for the massive decrease as also observed and discussed by albers et al 2015b is difficult to assess with certainty and some of the previous suggestions protozoan grazing and bacterial starvation are possible also in our system while others like the influence of backwashing are not relevant here there were no significant differences in msh1 densities between the two biofilters anova p value 0 683 a 5 10x higher content of most nutrients in the permeate thus does not counteract leaching of msh1 from bioaugmented sand filters by supporting growth of msh1 or improving adhesion abilities on the other hand there was no negative impact of membrane retentate on msh1 numbers and degradation activity which is also important carbon for energy and growth has previously been speculated to be a limiting parameter for bioaugmentation in biofilters albers et al 2015a horemans et al 2017 we observed a doc rejection of 78 to 85 equivalent to 4 4 to 7 1x increase in total doc using the ro membrane table 1 only a small fraction of this doc however can be readily assimilated by microorganisms in the biofilters the fraction of doc that can be used for potential growth is often named the assimilable organic carbon aoc hammes and egli 2005 van der kooij et al 1982 aoc represents 0 03 0 36 of the total doc in groundwater samples van der kooij et al 1982 to evaluate the potential of the ro membrane to retain aoc we measured the growth potential of msh1 and general groundwater bacteria in the different water taps in the pilot waterworks fig 3 the growth potential for msh1 was increased by the ro membrane being 2 5 107 msh1 l in water sampled before biofilter 1 and 7 5 106 msh1 l before biofilter 2 indicating the ro membrane increased the growth potential for msh1 roughly by a factor of 3 the same factor for the general bacterial populations seemed to be lower below 2 with 3 3 108 bacteria l before biofilter 1 and 2 0 108 bacteria l before biofilter 2 we did observe bacterial growth in some the blank samples fig 3b this could reflect the lower limit of the method but could also potentially have been caused by bacteria smaller than 0 2 µm and thus not retained by the sterile filtration wang et al 2007 the increase in aoc after membrane filtration was clearly lower than the increase in doc and inorganic nutrients indicating that if the system is carbon limited the increase in inorganic nutrients would have only a small effect on bacterial growth how this small increase in growth would be distributed between inoculated and indigenous bacteria is unknown such an evaluation would require an assay where the growth of total bacteria and degrader strain was evaluated within the same water sample which might be possible using for example gfp marked msh1 sekhar et al 2016 combined with flow cytometry comparing aoc and doc rejection in the pilot waterworks results are in line with previous studies concluding that aoc can be rejected by nf and ro membranes to a lesser extent compared to doc escobar et al 2000 meylan et al 2007 this can most likely be due to a smaller molecular size of aoc in combination with the presence of cations in the water shielding negative charges of the membrane surface that would otherwise repulse negatively charged aoc escobar et al 2000 nghiem et al 2006 soriano et al 2019 in order to determine the effect of the membrane on the microbial community within the biofilters a microbial composition analysis was conducted throughout the operation of the pilot waterwork from the sequencing dataset we obtained 481 932 high quality reads they correspond to 1 257 unique asvs divided in 110 sequenced samples of filter material and water on average we obtained 15 500 reads sample after denoising we retained an average of 4381 asvs sample for the analyses we included the samples that had at least 1350 asvs each based on this criteria 18 samples including all negative controls were discarded due to insufficient sequencing coverage the overall taxonomy accounts for 17 asvs assigned to archaea while the remaining 1239 were assigned to bacteria despite some differences in relative abundance the community is overall conserved in the dataset and mostly composed by aminobacter comamonadaceae pseudomonas zooglea curvibacter gallionella arthrobacter and sediminibacterium which are commonly found in waterworks sand filters albers et al 2015a ellegaard jensen et al 2020 gülay et al 2018 hu et al 2020 the major visible difference is due to the depletion of aminobacter from nevtraco after day 3 beginning in fig 4c when focusing on the differences in terms of biofilter microbial community that can be ascribed to the presence of a preconcentration membrane before biofilter 1 the results are summarized in fig 4 biofilter 1 generally displays a higher phylogenetic diversity compared with biofilter 2 when samples from all timepoints and depths are included fig 4a p value 0 001 the pcoa plot based on bray curtis dissimilarity displays along axes 2 a distinct clustering of the samples belonging to the two biofilters fig 4b which is statistically significant when tested with permanova p value 0 001 these differences can be further observed looking at the taxonomic barplots fig 4c which compares the prokaryotic community composition the two biofilters along the whole treatment to test the effect of the membrane retentate on the microbial community of nevtraco we applied ancom and the result shows that 16 taxa only 8 assigned to genus level are differentially abundant between biofilters at genus level we found that there was a differentially abundance of zooglea polaromonas flavobacterium arthrobacter sphingopyxis rubrivivax cupriavidus and algoriphagus of these it appears that flavobacterium sphingopyxis cupriavidus and algoriphagus are more abundant in biofilter 1 together with some other taxa assigned to cytophagaceae chitinophagaceae xanthomonadaceae and holophagaceae some of the organisms relative more abundant in biofilter 1 have been linked to oligotrophic water environments jogler et al 2013 mijnendonckx et al 2013 sack et al 2011 indicating that it is most likely not the increase in nutrients from the membrane that drives the differences in abundance aminobacter is not included in this list of differences between biofilters supporting the qpcr data fig 2 b that the membrane did not have a positive affect on the dominance of aminobacter niigataensis msh1 in summary the ro preconcentration prior to biofiltration did not change the overall composition of the microbial community within the biofilters but we did observe an increase in the microbial diversity increased microbial diversity has been linked to improved performance of waterwork sand filters haig et al 2015 and it most likely increases the microbial gene pool which potentially could be beneficial for the degradation of micropollutants found in groundwater 3 2 small column experiments the fact that msh1 degrades bam equally well with ro retentate as inlet water opens up possibilities to increase residence time of augmented sand filters without having to install very large filter units to explore the effect of residence time on bam degradation we made a series of laboratory column experiments with residence time varied from 14 to 133 min since msh1 density seems to be very important for degradation we included columns with different initial msh1 cell densities 106 to 108 cells g of filter material in the experiment increased cell density showed a clear positive effect but the effect diminished somewhat over time fig 5b the effect of residence time was much larger and consistent over time fig 5a the period in which 90 of bam could be removed was 6 10 26 70 days for residence times of 14 28 53 133 min respectively this fits the general perception that longer residence time increases the degradation of organic micropollutants in soil meckenstock et al 2015 sediments weatherill et al 2018 and biofilters bioreactors haest et al 2011 montes et al 2012 the pattern of complete bam degradation for the first 21 days and more than 90 for 70 days was observed in two independent experiments with 108 cells g filter material and 133 min residence time figs 5a and 6a at the end of each of the small column experiments filter material was sampled for quantification of total bacteria and msh1 using qpcr fig 4 c for the experiments with varying densities there was no significant difference in the density of msh1 on the biofilters at the end of the experiment despite there being a 100 fold different msh1 inoculation density 108 vs 106 the degradation was 1 5 2 5 times higher in the columns where 108 cells g were added so probably the msh1 cell density was still higher at the end of experiment but the relatively minor difference in degradation and a difference in cell numbers smaller than can be detected by qpcr demonstrates that over time merely adding more cells does not make a big difference when dealing with an oligotrophic system like a groundwater treating sand filter this is different compared to what was recently concluded for the degradation of the pesticide metaldehyde in bioaugmented sand filters castro gutierrez et al 2022 so the potential effect of adding more cells is probably strain and or system specific additionally it has to be mentioned that the abundance of msh1 was quantified by dna which makes it difficult to calculate the activity of the bacteria within the filters because dna is extracted from both living and dead cells the fraction of msh1 in relation to the total microbial community ranged from 3 to 32 across all columns with the highest dominance in the columns with the longest residence time 133 min this is a smaller dominance compared to comparable laboratory biofilter experiments 70 95 msh1 dominance ellegaard jensen et al 2020 the difference between the two experiments could be due to the longer runtime in our experiment probably increasing the effect of death of msh1 due to starvation the short term instantaneous influence of the residence time on bam removal in biofilters was investigated in small biofilters after 104 days of operation as described in section 2 3 when equalizing the residence time to 28 min equal bam removal of 30 was observed with no significant difference between the two sets of biofilters fig 6b when both sets of columns then were shifted to have a residence time of 133 min all columns removed 80 finally the two sets of biofilters were set to their original flows corresponding to 28 and 133 minutes residence time respectively and their bam removal capacities were then the same as before changing the flow together with the qpcr results fig 5 c this short term manipulation illustrates that the long term differences in degradation capacity at different residence times are not due to different abundance or activity of msh1 cells in other words the amount and activity of msh1 cells seem quite robust towards differences in residence time during operation with almost equal loss of biomass and hence degradation activity over time a full or almost full degradation of an organic micropollutant like bam for a few months before reinoculation could be operational for a waterworks but as the laboratory experiments show this would require long residence time which again would require large biofilters however as demonstrated during our first pilot experiment the filters seem to work at least as well with membrane concentrate as with raw water treated only to remove dissolved iron fig 2 and thus membrane filtration could be a way to minimize the volume needed to be treated by the biofilters to test this we set up a second pilot filter experiment applying only membrane retentate to the biofilters 3 3 second pilot waterworks experiment in this experiment the two biofilters received similar water ro membrane retentate with on average of 7 3 0 2 times preconcentration of bam compared to the raw water but with different flow and hence residence time 133 vs 28 min in biofilter 1 and 2 respectively the bam concentration in the raw water was higher during the second experiment 1 µg l than during the first experiment 0 4 µg l and hence 90 removal was needed to get below the legal threshold limit of 0 1 µg l the residence time in biofilter 2 was the same as in the first pilot experiment and indeed the bam degradation pattern was quite similar as well with high removal during the first few days and then decreasing to only little removal during the following few weeks followed by a long relatively stable period with 10 30 removal figs 7a and 2a biofilter 1 on the other hand showed complete bam removal for approximately 10 days followed by a very slow decrease in degradation which was still close to 90 at day 65 and 70 at day 100 fig 7a in both filters most of the initially adhered msh1 cells were lost within the first week followed by a slight decrease in msh1 density during the following two months fig 7b at day 64 a short term equalization in flow was made similar to what we did with the laboratory filters fig 6 b although we could only decrease the flow in the fast filter not increase in the slow filter due to deficits in water supply from the membrane the test showed that when run at similar residence times the two biofilters had similar degradation capacity for bam sup fig s5 exactly as was observed in the laboratory fig 6b analysis of msh1 using qpcr also showed similar numbers in the two biofilters fig 7b the flow test and the qpcr altogether strongly suggest that the large difference in degradation is not caused by different msh1 activities but rather that the amount of msh1 cells that can be sustained in the filters is enough for a high degradation of bam at the slowest of the two tested flow rates but not at the faster flow overall the second pilot experiment thus confirms results from the laboratory columns that a high degradation of bam can be achieved for a long time at a relatively long residence time but also that this is not due to a higher survival or lower detachment of bacteria at lower flow but simply because too few msh1 cells can be sustained at the oligotrophic conditions of a groundwater fed filter to cope with shorter residence times in other words a relatively long residence time is needed to equal the reaction time obtainable with aminobacter niigataensis msh1 in groundwater treating sand filters whether residence time could be increased further to obtain even higher or more prolonged degradation remains an open question for future studies but there will be a maximum residence time beyond which no further improvement can be obtained due to diffusion limited mass transfer from the water to the attached bacteria through the boundary layer surrounding individual sand grains simoni et al 2001 in principle one should be able to predict the optimal flow based on porous flow models that include diffusion through stagnant boundary layers using specific bam degradation rates for msh1 that have been published for batch studies schultz jensen et al 2014 simonsen et al 2012 however specific bam degradation rates have been found to be up to two orders lower in flow through sand filters than in batch albers et al 2014 2015b so until a better understanding of this phenomenon is achieved actual experiments demonstrating relationships between residence time and degradation would be preferred all in all the combination of ro membrane filtration and biofilter opens new possibilities of removing organic micropollutants in groundwater through microbial degradation in the case of the recalcitrant pollutant bam the biofilters need to be inoculated with a degrading strain such as msh1 to achieve degradation in other cases with more easily degradable micropollutants degrading populations might evolve in the biofilter with the groundwater microbiome as inoculum feld et al 2016 4 conclusion here we show a long time removal 2 months of bam from contaminated groundwater using a combination of ro membrane and augmented biofilters in a large scale pilot waterworks by increasing the residence time 10x using ro membrane retentate we could obtain a removal of the groundwater contaminant bam for a much longer period and residence time is probably a crucial parameter no matter if one attempts to achieve biodegradation of organic micropollutants through inoculation or by natural degrader bacteria the use of ro membrane prior to biofiltration showed no negative effect on either msh1 survival or the overall microbial community within the biofilter membrane filtration could thus be the way to increase residence time in biofilters at relatively low cost and without compromising water quality for the degrading bacteria as well as for the subsequent use of the treated water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16114,groundwater contamination by recalcitrant organic micropollutants such as pesticide residues poses a great threat to the quality of drinking water one way to remediate drinking water containing micropollutants is to bioaugment with specific pollutant degrading bacteria previous attempts to augment sand filters with the 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam degrading bacterium aminobacter niigataensis msh1 to remediate bam polluted drinking water initially worked well but the efficiency rapidly decreased due to loss of degrader bacteria here we use pilot scale augmented sand filters to treat retentate of reverse osmosis treatment thus increasing residence time in the biofilters and potentially nutrient availability in a first pilot scale experiment bam and most of the measured nutrients were concentrated 5 10 times in the retentate this did not adversely affect the abundances of inoculated bacteria and the general prokaryotic community of the sand filter presented only minor differences on the other hand the high degradation activity was not prolonged compared to the filter receiving non concentrated water at the same residence time using laboratory columns it was shown that efficient bam degradation could be achieved for 100 days by increasing the residence time in the sand filter a slower flow may have practical implications for the treatment of large volumes of water however this can be circumvented when treating only the retentate water equalling 10 15 of the volume of inlet water we therefore conducted a second pilot scale experiment with two inoculated sand filters receiving membrane retentate operated with different residence times 22 versus 133 min for 65 days while the number of msh1 in the biofilters was not affected the effect on degradation was significant in the filter with short residence time bam degradation decreased from 86 to a stable level of 10 30 degradation within the first two weeks the filter with the long residence time initially showed 97 bam degradation which only slightly decreased with time 88 at day 65 our study demonstrates the advantage of combining membrane filtration with bioaugmented filters in cases where flow rate is of high importance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants bioaugmentation sand filter membrane filtration bacteria biofilter 1 introduction clean drinking water is one of the earth s most important resources and yet the quantity and quality of water available for human consumption is increasingly deteriorated due to anthropogenic activities unesco 2018 the production use and disposal of numerous chemicals in industry private households and agriculture is now recognized to lead to a widespread occurrence of organic micropollutants in the environment including groundwater used for drinking water production barbosa et al 2016 in addition to known groundwater pollutants new screening methods using non target high resolution mass spectrometry kiefer et al 2021 will most likely reveal hazardous chemicals that exceed threshold limits for drinking water for example 0 1 µg l for pesticides and relevant degradation products in the european union not all contaminants can be removed by conventional technologies and not all technologies are equally acceptable due to high energy consumption or other drawbacks such as unwanted by product formation incomplete mineralization or generation of chemical waste hence a continuous need exists to provide remediation solutions to remove low concentrations of organic micropollutants such as recalcitrant pesticide residues from drinking water rapid sand filters at waterworks are known to contain a substantial diversity of bacteria albers et al 2015a de vet et al 2009 which may have the potential to degrade some organic micropollutants hedegaard and albrechtsen 2014 richter et al 2008 zearley and summers 2012 however those organic micropollutants that compromise groundwater quality are often recalcitrant and are thus not readily degradable by the natural microbial populations in sand filters the introduction of specific micropollutant degrading bacteria into rapid sand filters at waterworks has therefore been suggested as a treatment technology for polluted groundwater benner et al 2013 recently such a strategy was found to be very promising for degradation of the pesticide metaldehyde in sand filters castro gutierrez et al 2022 metaldehyde is a common surface water contaminant but rarely detected in groundwater aquifers presumably due to its relatively high degradability typical half life in soil of 5 days http sitem herts ac uk aeru ppdb en reports 446 htm 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam is an example of a widespread recalcitrant organic micropollutant pesticide residue in groundwater where a bacterial degrader organism aminobacter niigataensis msh1 nielsen et al 2021 has been isolated and grown in the laboratory sørensen et al 2007 the msh1 strain has been shown to have the ability to adhere to sand albers et al 2014 and the genes involved in degradation of bam have been well characterized nielsen et al 2021 raes et al 2019 msh1 is therefore a promising candidate to provide a proof of concept of bioaugmentation for treatment of drinking water previous attempts to add msh1 to sand filters were however only partially successful due to loss of bacteria after an initial period with substantial bam degradation albers et al 2015b horemans et al 2017 reverse osmosis ro is a well known membrane separation technology for producing clean water permeate stream as a result of rejecting and consequently concentrating organic micropollutants including pesticide residues as well as inorganic nutrients in a waste stream retentate stream of a smaller volume fini et al 2019 2020 jamil et al 2019 madsen and søgaard 2014 urtiaga et al 2013 by combining membrane filtration with bioaugmented sand filters less water must be bioremediated opening for a longer water residence time in the filter and thereby longer time for the pollutants to be degraded furthermore as nutrients are also concentrated in the retentate the growth and survival of the augmented bacteria may be improved in the present study we therefore made series of pilot and laboratory scale experiments to explore the effect of reverse osmosis and water flow conditions on the long term survival and bam degrading activity of msh1 in a combined membrane biofilter treatment system if successful the purified retentate could even be used to remineralize the permeate from the filters hence leading to a remediation technology where the micropollutant is eliminated completely without any loss of water 2 material and methods 2 1 field site description a pilot waterworks with a ro membrane and two biofilters was installed next to an abandoned drinking water abstraction well with bam contaminated water varying over time from 0 3 to 1 7 µg l the contamination comes from an old farmyard used for loading and cleaning of sprayers the well is located at 55 30 n 8 27 e 2 2 pilot waterworks the pilot waterworks fig 1 was custom designed for this project and was placed in a portable trailer l 401 cm w 185 cm h 205 cm the raw groundwater was pumped into a prefilter consisting of a closed steel cylinder filled with a chalk filter material nevtraco silhorko eurowater a s denmark in which iron was precipitated after aeration using a compressor from there the water was split in two lines one with and one without membrane filtration the membrane filtration line included an ion exchange unit to remove calcium and magnesium ions to prevent scaling and a reverse osmosis membrane unit consisting of two spiral wound filmtec xle 4040 dupont usa membrane elements in series providing 16 2 m2 membrane area the retentate of the filtration being concentrated approx 10 times was led to a 86 l steel cylinder h 135 cm ø 30 cm containing nevtraco filter material biofilter 1 the line without membrane filtration was coupled to a similar steel cylinder biofilter 2 but this could be changed so that both filters received retentate water could be sampled at multiple points along the water flow and water and filter material could be sampled at five different depths of the filters 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 90 cm from the top fig 1a to sample representative samples the water was left running for at least 200 ml with as low flow as possible avoiding changing the pressure and flow in the system sampling of filter material was done by stopping the flow and inserting a brass pipe through a ball vial with costume made insert with o ring to enclose the brass tube at the end of the brass tube a piece of silicon tube was added with a small clamp to stop the water for floating out at each depth a total of 3 times 10 gs was sampled and kept cold until storage in the lab at 20 c until extraction samples were taken at day 1 3 8 22 55 and 77 with regards to microbial analyses we consider the period between day 1 and day 3 to be the beginning of the treatment from day 4 21 is considered middle and day 22 77 is considered the end of the treatment two experiments were conducted at the pilot waterworks to test the effect of preconcentration using ro membrane and to test the effect of residence time respectively before each experiment the two biofilters and the prefilter was filled with fresh filter material with an overhanging water table of 10 cm this corresponds to 75 kg of nevtraco in each filter to remove smaller particles all filters were back washed until exiting water was clear inoculation with aminobacter niigataensis msh1 was carried out basically as described in albers et al 2015b in brief msh1 was grown in 5 l baffle bottle from freeze batch msh1 cells were then diluted with sterile tap water in 10 l bottles to a bacterial number of 1013 cells and transported to the pilot waterworks the culture was added from the top of the filter and left for two hours before starting the flow final cell density was 108 cells g of nevtraco in each of the biofilters before running the pilot waterworks with groundwater the bioaugmented biofilter was treated with nutrient addition for the first 48 h as an improved inoculation strategy developed by ellegaard jensen et al 2020 for more details on the inoculation see supplementary material during the period of nutrient addition the outlet was sampled in order to measure the loss of msh1 in the inoculation phase see section 2 6 this was only done in the second pilot waterwork experiment during the first 48 h there was a loss of bacterial cells of 79 and 84 for biofilter 1 and 2 respectively we did not include a sterile or non inoculated control biofilter since it is well known that bam is not degraded abiotically and does not adsorb to any significant degree neither to different soils clausen et al 2004 nor sand filter material albers et al 2015b we have also tested if any sorption to the nevtraco material exists and the sorption coefficient kd was 0 01 l kg unpublished data meaning no significant adsorption occurs the membrane unit performed successfully during the two pilot waterworks experiments running for 99 and 100 days respectively during operation the inlet and outlet pressure as well as permeate and retentate flow rates were monitored at each sampling time the inlet pressure was kept at 16 bar while the outlet pressure varied within the range of 15 5 to 15 9 bar the influent water flow rate was 780 l h in both pilot tests producing 700 l h permeate and 80 l h of retentate resulting in a 90 recovery throughout the first pilot test during the second pilot test as a result of fouling recovery slightly dropped starting with 80 l h retentate 90 recovery and ending up with 120 l h 85 recovery during the last 60 days 2 3 laboratory column experiments small column experiments were setup to investigate the influence of msh1 cell density and residence time on bioaugmented biofilter performance the small column experimental setup was as the biofilters in the pilot waterwork except water inflow was bottom up three cell densities 108 107 and 106 msh1 per gram of nevtraco and four different residence times 14 28 53 and 133 min were tested the column experiments ran for 104 and 88 days for the cell density and the residence time experiments respectively detailed description can be found in the supplementary material during the first 47 h with an influx of nutrients there was a loss of cells ranging from 15 to 50 of the inoculated msh1 in an additional experiment with triplicate columns operated with two different residence times 28 and 133 min the influence of short term changes in residence time on bam removal was tested after running for 104 days by taking four sets of samples each sampled after exchange of at least 6 pore volumes in the following sequence 1 before changing the flow so at residence times 28 and 133 min 2 after changing the residence time to 28 min in both sets of columns 3 after changing the residence time to 133 min in both sets of columns 4 after changing the flow to the original residence times of each set 28 and 133 min 2 4 bam analysis using lc ms ms at the first pilot waterworks experiment the quantification of bam was done as described in ellegaard jensen et al 2020 with the modification of larger sample volume 20 ml used for solid phase extraction for the remaining experiments the sample was simply filtered and injected directly on the lc ms ms see description in the supplementary material in all experiments bam was analyzed as the sole compound because several studies have shown that metabolite formation is not of concern when inoculating sand filters with msh1 albers et al 2015b 2014 it has long been known that the msh1 strain is capable of mineralizing bam completely to co2 and chloride sørensen et al 2007 and the complete degradation pathway of bam by msh1 was recently published raes et al 2019 also in augmented sand filters msh1 was found to mineralize bam completely albers et al 2014 and in a pilot waterwork study with a sand filter bioaugmented with msh1 no detection of the known bam metabolites 2 6 dichlorobenzoic acid 2 6 dcba ortho chlorobenzamide and ortho chlorobenzoic acid were detected at any point in time albers et al 2015b 2 5 additional water analyses water was

reverse primers the primer sequences used in this study are summarized in table s1 for the total quantification of bacteria the same primer set were used for the amplicon sequencing approach 341f 806r the presence of msh1 was measured by targeting the bbda gene on msh1 plasmid pbam1 using the primer set bbda f bbda r and a specific prophage insertion region on msh1 genome nielsen et al 2018 using the primers msh1 f and msh1 r developed in a previous study by ellegaard jensen et al 2020 all the amplifications were performed with the following qpcr program 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 of one step cycles of 95 c for 15 s 55 c for 30 s and followed by a melting curve obtained by increasing the temperature of 0 5 c increments every 5 s from 55 c to 95 c to confirm the specificity of the pcr product a calibration curve to measure absolute amount of aminobacter niigataensis msh1 was performed relative to microscopy counts by serially diluting two standards obtained by dna extraction from nevtraco and water filtrate respectively undiluted standard for water filters contains 6 85 107 cells μl while for nevtraco the undiluted standard contains 6 85 106 cells μl all reactions were run along with negative controls during both pilot waterworks experiments no significant difference was observed in the total number of bacteria or the total number of msh1 anova p value 0 465 between the same depth of the two biofilters despite a non homogeneous presence of msh1 in all the different layers of the reactors so bacterial number will be presented as an average of the whole biofilter 2 9 amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics dna samples extracted from nevtraco and filtered water were used for metabarcoding library preparation on the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene library preparation was carried out by a two step pcr according to feld et al 2016 see supplementary material for details the samples were sequenced on an illumina miseq using the v3 kit with paired end illumina inc sandiego us resulting in 2 300 bp reads the sequencing dataset produced was analysed using qiime 2 v 2019 7 bolyen et al 2019 with an analogous pipeline described by gobbi et al 2019 after demultiplexing the reads these were processed with dada2 callahan et al 2016 to obtain the phylogenetic tree a multiple sequence alignment was performed with mafft katoh and standley 2013 and the phylogenetic tree was built using fasttree price et al 2010 diversity analyses were done using the plugin q2 diversity phylogenetic diversity pd from faith 1992 and evenness from pielou 1966 were chosen to measure alpha diversity while beta diversity was measured using bray curtis dissimilarity and visualized through pcoa plots obtained using emperor vázquez baeza et al 2013 taxonomy assignments were done using qiime feature classifier classify sklearn bokulich et al 2013 with a pre trained naïve bayes classifier with greengenes v 13 8 desantis et al 2006 the raw reads are available on sra study accession number in progress to be provided upon final submission 2 10 growth potential assimilable organic carbon aoc in order to estimate the effect of potential additional nutrients from the membrane treatment prior to the biofilter that could lead to bacterial growth a bacterial and msh1 growth potential assay was performed on the different water samples across the pilot water plant this was done by sampling 250 ml water in aoc free 250 ml redcap bottles ptfe coated cap liner from seven different water taps sampled at day 99 from the first pilot waterwork experiment this assay is based on the growth assay by hammes and egli 2005 with few modifications for details see supplementary material in brief growth potential was estimated by adding either groundwater microbiome water bottle inoculum aqua d or brande denmark or msh1 to a density of 5000 cells ml to sterile filtered water samples from seven different water taps at the pilot waterworks into aoc free wheaton 50 ml glass serum bottles dwk life sciences usa the growth of bacteria is assumed to only come from aoc within the water sample bacterial growth was measured by flow cytometry after 12 and 13 days of incubation for groundwater microbiome and msh1 compared to initial added bacteria respectively 2 11 statistical analysis statistical analyses of the residence time change for the small column experiments were done with the multcomp package in r r core team 2013 using anova with a post hoc tukey hsd correction test p 0 05 unless otherwise stated data are presented as mean standard error of mean sem the statistical evaluation of these results was performed separately for qpcr and the sequencing data regarding qpcr dataset all statistical analyses and visualisations of the qpcr data were performed on microsoft office excel 2010 using anova and t test statistical analysis performed on the sequencing dataset was analysed through qiime2 v 2019 7 after qiime 2 pipeline processing the sequencing dataset was evaluated using the kruskal wallis test for alpha diversity and permanova with 999 permutations for beta diversity finally differentially abundant amplicon sequence variants asvs were detected through the analysis of composition of microbiomes ancom from mandal et al 2015 this test is very conservative as it is based on the assumption that only few asvs change in a statistical way between the samples and it controls for false discovery rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of preconcentration using ro membrane for bam removal in the first experiment with the pilot waterworks biofilter 1 received concentrated water and biofilter 2 non concentrated water residence times were identical in the two filters 28 min during 77 days bam was on average concentrated 8 8 0 6 times by the ro membrane which is in line with laboratory scale studies using the same xle membrane where a rejection of around 90 bam was observed fini et al 2019 hylling et al 2019 a seven to ninefold increase in the concentration of most nutrients metal ions and other water solutes was found throughout both pilot experiments see before biofilter 1 data in table 1 table s1 and fig s3 a slight reduction in the concentration of species over time can be a result of membrane fouling which is more pronounced in the case of pilot experiment 2 bam degradation in both biofilters showed 92 96 removal within the first three days followed by a fast decline in degradation efficiency to 37 and 66 at day 8 for biofilter 1 and 2 respectively fig 1a hereafter the bam degradation gradually decreased and at the end of the experiment only 6 and 28 bam was removed in biofilter 1 and 2 respectively to get below the legal threshold limit 0 1 µg l more than 72 degradation would have been needed so in summary the pilot waterworks were able to degrade bam to levels below the legal threshold limit for less than a week regardless of whether the biofilter received membrane retentate or non concentrated groundwater the decrease in bam degradation correlated with the amount of msh1 attached to the filter material fig 1b the attached amount of msh1 within the biofilters was high for the first 3 days 1 3 108 8 7 106 and 1 1 108 6 4 106 msh1 per gram of filter material for biofilter 1 and 2 respectively then the msh1 density within the biofilters dropped to 2 7 106 2 7 105 and 3 0 106 6 9 105 for biofilter 1 and 2 and then slowly decreased to around 4 105 msh1 per gram filter material qpcrs were repeated targeting both the genome of msh1 with the primers msh1 f and msh1 r and the bbda gene carried on the plasmid using bbda f and bbda r primers and the results in terms of abundance are similar throughout the whole treatment for both biofilters the inoculated bacteria thus did not lose their ability to degrade over time and the observed decrease in degradation efficiency must simply be caused by the significant decrease in msh1 abundance 108 to 106 cells g since it has been demonstrated that the genes responsible for bam degradation are constitutively expressed t syen et al 2015 the reason for the massive decrease as also observed and discussed by albers et al 2015b is difficult to assess with certainty and some of the previous suggestions protozoan grazing and bacterial starvation are possible also in our system while others like the influence of backwashing are not relevant here there were no significant differences in msh1 densities between the two biofilters anova p value 0 683 a 5 10x higher content of most nutrients in the permeate thus does not counteract leaching of msh1 from bioaugmented sand filters by supporting growth of msh1 or improving adhesion abilities on the other hand there was no negative impact of membrane retentate on msh1 numbers and degradation activity which is also important carbon for energy and growth has previously been speculated to be a limiting parameter for bioaugmentation in biofilters albers et al 2015a horemans et al 2017 we observed a doc rejection of 78 to 85 equivalent to 4 4 to 7 1x increase in total doc using the ro membrane table 1 only a small fraction of this doc however can be readily assimilated by microorganisms in the biofilters the fraction of doc that can be used for potential growth is often named the assimilable organic carbon aoc hammes and egli 2005 van der kooij et al 1982 aoc represents 0 03 0 36 of the total doc in groundwater samples van der kooij et al 1982 to evaluate the potential of the ro membrane to retain aoc we measured the growth potential of msh1 and general groundwater bacteria in the different water taps in the pilot waterworks fig 3 the growth potential for msh1 was increased by the ro membrane being 2 5 107 msh1 l in water sampled before biofilter 1 and 7 5 106 msh1 l before biofilter 2 indicating the ro membrane increased the growth potential for msh1 roughly by a factor of 3 the same factor for the general bacterial populations seemed to be lower below 2 with 3 3 108 bacteria l before biofilter 1 and 2 0 108 bacteria l before biofilter 2 we did observe bacterial growth in some the blank samples fig 3b this could reflect the lower limit of the method but could also potentially have been caused by bacteria smaller than 0 2 µm and thus not retained by the sterile filtration wang et al 2007 the increase in aoc after membrane filtration was clearly lower than the increase in doc and inorganic nutrients indicating that if the system is carbon limited the increase in inorganic nutrients would have only a small effect on bacterial growth how this small increase in growth would be distributed between inoculated and indigenous bacteria is unknown such an evaluation would require an assay where the growth of total bacteria and degrader strain was evaluated within the same water sample which might be possible using for example gfp marked msh1 sekhar et al 2016 combined with flow cytometry comparing aoc and doc rejection in the pilot waterworks results are in line with previous studies concluding that aoc can be rejected by nf and ro membranes to a lesser extent compared to doc escobar et al 2000 meylan et al 2007 this can most likely be due to a smaller molecular size of aoc in combination with the presence of cations in the water shielding negative charges of the membrane surface that would otherwise repulse negatively charged aoc escobar et al 2000 nghiem et al 2006 soriano et al 2019 in order to determine the effect of the membrane on the microbial community within the biofilters a microbial composition analysis was conducted throughout the operation of the pilot waterwork from the sequencing dataset we obtained 481 932 high quality reads they correspond to 1 257 unique asvs divided in 110 sequenced samples of filter material and water on average we obtained 15 500 reads sample after denoising we retained an average of 4381 asvs sample for the analyses we included the samples that had at least 1350 asvs each based on this criteria 18 samples including all negative controls were discarded due to insufficient sequencing coverage the overall taxonomy accounts for 17 asvs assigned to archaea while the remaining 1239 were assigned to bacteria despite some differences in relative abundance the community is overall conserved in the dataset and mostly composed by aminobacter comamonadaceae pseudomonas zooglea curvibacter gallionella arthrobacter and sediminibacterium which are commonly found in waterworks sand filters albers et al 2015a ellegaard jensen et al 2020 gülay et al 2018 hu et al 2020 the major visible difference is due to the depletion of aminobacter from nevtraco after day 3 beginning in fig 4c when focusing on the differences in terms of biofilter microbial community that can be ascribed to the presence of a preconcentration membrane before biofilter 1 the results are summarized in fig 4 biofilter 1 generally displays a higher phylogenetic diversity compared with biofilter 2 when samples from all timepoints and depths are included fig 4a p value 0 001 the pcoa plot based on bray curtis dissimilarity displays along axes 2 a distinct clustering of the samples belonging to the two biofilters fig 4b which is statistically significant when tested with permanova p value 0 001 these differences can be further observed looking at the taxonomic barplots fig 4c which compares the prokaryotic community composition the two biofilters along the whole treatment to test the effect of the membrane retentate on the microbial community of nevtraco we applied ancom and the result shows that 16 taxa only 8 assigned to genus level are differentially abundant between biofilters at genus level we found that there was a differentially abundance of zooglea polaromonas flavobacterium arthrobacter sphingopyxis rubrivivax cupriavidus and algoriphagus of these it appears that flavobacterium sphingopyxis cupriavidus and algoriphagus are more abundant in biofilter 1 together with some other taxa assigned to cytophagaceae chitinophagaceae xanthomonadaceae and holophagaceae some of the organisms relative more abundant in biofilter 1 have been linked to oligotrophic water environments jogler et al 2013 mijnendonckx et al 2013 sack et al 2011 indicating that it is most likely not the increase in nutrients from the membrane that drives the differences in abundance aminobacter is not included in this list of differences between biofilters supporting the qpcr data fig 2 b that the membrane did not have a positive affect on the dominance of aminobacter niigataensis msh1 in summary the ro preconcentration prior to biofiltration did not change the overall composition of the microbial community within the biofilters but we did observe an increase in the microbial diversity increased microbial diversity has been linked to improved performance of waterwork sand filters haig et al 2015 and it most likely increases the microbial gene pool which potentially could be beneficial for the degradation of micropollutants found in groundwater 3 2 small column experiments the fact that msh1 degrades bam equally well with ro retentate as inlet water opens up possibilities to increase residence time of augmented sand filters without having to install very large filter units to explore the effect of residence time on bam degradation we made a series of laboratory column experiments with residence time varied from 14 to 133 min since msh1 density seems to be very important for degradation we included columns with different initial msh1 cell densities 106 to 108 cells g of filter material in the experiment increased cell density showed a clear positive effect but the effect diminished somewhat over time fig 5b the effect of residence time was much larger and consistent over time fig 5a the period in which 90 of bam could be removed was 6 10 26 70 days for residence times of 14 28 53 133 min respectively this fits the general perception that longer residence time increases the degradation of organic micropollutants in soil meckenstock et al 2015 sediments weatherill et al 2018 and biofilters bioreactors haest et al 2011 montes et al 2012 the pattern of complete bam degradation for the first 21 days and more than 90 for 70 days was observed in two independent experiments with 108 cells g filter material and 133 min residence time figs 5a and 6a at the end of each of the small column experiments filter material was sampled for quantification of total bacteria and msh1 using qpcr fig 4 c for the experiments with varying densities there was no significant difference in the density of msh1 on the biofilters at the end of the experiment despite there being a 100 fold different msh1 inoculation density 108 vs 106 the degradation was 1 5 2 5 times higher in the columns where 108 cells g were added so probably the msh1 cell density was still higher at the end of experiment but the relatively minor difference in degradation and a difference in cell numbers smaller than can be detected by qpcr demonstrates that over time merely adding more cells does not make a big difference when dealing with an oligotrophic system like a groundwater treating sand filter this is different compared to what was recently concluded for the degradation of the pesticide metaldehyde in bioaugmented sand filters castro gutierrez et al 2022 so the potential effect of adding more cells is probably strain and or system specific additionally it has to be mentioned that the abundance of msh1 was quantified by dna which makes it difficult to calculate the activity of the bacteria within the filters because dna is extracted from both living and dead cells the fraction of msh1 in relation to the total microbial community ranged from 3 to 32 across all columns with the highest dominance in the columns with the longest residence time 133 min this is a smaller dominance compared to comparable laboratory biofilter experiments 70 95 msh1 dominance ellegaard jensen et al 2020 the difference between the two experiments could be due to the longer runtime in our experiment probably increasing the effect of death of msh1 due to starvation the short term instantaneous influence of the residence time on bam removal in biofilters was investigated in small biofilters after 104 days of operation as described in section 2 3 when equalizing the residence time to 28 min equal bam removal of 30 was observed with no significant difference between the two sets of biofilters fig 6b when both sets of columns then were shifted to have a residence time of 133 min all columns removed 80 finally the two sets of biofilters were set to their original flows corresponding to 28 and 133 minutes residence time respectively and their bam removal capacities were then the same as before changing the flow together with the qpcr results fig 5 c this short term manipulation illustrates that the long term differences in degradation capacity at different residence times are not due to different abundance or activity of msh1 cells in other words the amount and activity of msh1 cells seem quite robust towards differences in residence time during operation with almost equal loss of biomass and hence degradation activity over time a full or almost full degradation of an organic micropollutant like bam for a few months before reinoculation could be operational for a waterworks but as the laboratory experiments show this would require long residence time which again would require large biofilters however as demonstrated during our first pilot experiment the filters seem to work at least as well with membrane concentrate as with raw water treated only to remove dissolved iron fig 2 and thus membrane filtration could be a way to minimize the volume needed to be treated by the biofilters to test this we set up a second pilot filter experiment applying only membrane retentate to the biofilters 3 3 second pilot waterworks experiment in this experiment the two biofilters received similar water ro membrane retentate with on average of 7 3 0 2 times preconcentration of bam compared to the raw water but with different flow and hence residence time 133 vs 28 min in biofilter 1 and 2 respectively the bam concentration in the raw water was higher during the second experiment 1 µg l than during the first experiment 0 4 µg l and hence 90 removal was needed to get below the legal threshold limit of 0 1 µg l the residence time in biofilter 2 was the same as in the first pilot experiment and indeed the bam degradation pattern was quite similar as well with high removal during the first few days and then decreasing to only little removal during the following few weeks followed by a long relatively stable period with 10 30 removal figs 7a and 2a biofilter 1 on the other hand showed complete bam removal for approximately 10 days followed by a very slow decrease in degradation which was still close to 90 at day 65 and 70 at day 100 fig 7a in both filters most of the initially adhered msh1 cells were lost within the first week followed by a slight decrease in msh1 density during the following two months fig 7b at day 64 a short term equalization in flow was made similar to what we did with the laboratory filters fig 6 b although we could only decrease the flow in the fast filter not increase in the slow filter due to deficits in water supply from the membrane the test showed that when run at similar residence times the two biofilters had similar degradation capacity for bam sup fig s5 exactly as was observed in the laboratory fig 6b analysis of msh1 using qpcr also showed similar numbers in the two biofilters fig 7b the flow test and the qpcr altogether strongly suggest that the large difference in degradation is not caused by different msh1 activities but rather that the amount of msh1 cells that can be sustained in the filters is enough for a high degradation of bam at the slowest of the two tested flow rates but not at the faster flow overall the second pilot experiment thus confirms results from the laboratory columns that a high degradation of bam can be achieved for a long time at a relatively long residence time but also that this is not due to a higher survival or lower detachment of bacteria at lower flow but simply because too few msh1 cells can be sustained at the oligotrophic conditions of a groundwater fed filter to cope with shorter residence times in other words a relatively long residence time is needed to equal the reaction time obtainable with aminobacter niigataensis msh1 in groundwater treating sand filters whether residence time could be increased further to obtain even higher or more prolonged degradation remains an open question for future studies but there will be a maximum residence time beyond which no further improvement can be obtained due to diffusion limited mass transfer from the water to the attached bacteria through the boundary layer surrounding individual sand grains simoni et al 2001 in principle one should be able to predict the optimal flow based on porous flow models that include diffusion through stagnant boundary layers using specific bam degradation rates for msh1 that have been published for batch studies schultz jensen et al 2014 simonsen et al 2012 however specific bam degradation rates have been found to be up to two orders lower in flow through sand filters than in batch albers et al 2014 2015b so until a better understanding of this phenomenon is achieved actual experiments demonstrating relationships between residence time and degradation would be preferred all in all the combination of ro membrane filtration and biofilter opens new possibilities of removing organic micropollutants in groundwater through microbial degradation in the case of the recalcitrant pollutant bam the biofilters need to be inoculated with a degrading strain such as msh1 to achieve degradation in other cases with more easily degradable micropollutants degrading populations might evolve in the biofilter with the groundwater microbiome as inoculum feld et al 2016 4 conclusion here we show a long time removal 2 months of bam from contaminated groundwater using a combination of ro membrane and augmented biofilters in a large scale pilot waterworks by increasing the residence time 10x using ro membrane retentate we could obtain a removal of the groundwater contaminant bam for a much longer period and residence time is probably a crucial parameter no matter if one attempts to achieve biodegradation of organic micropollutants through inoculation or by natural degrader bacteria the use of ro membrane prior to biofiltration showed no negative effect on either msh1 survival or the overall microbial community within the biofilter membrane filtration could thus be the way to increase residence time in biofilters at relatively low cost and without compromising water quality for the degrading bacteria as well as for the subsequent use of the treated water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
