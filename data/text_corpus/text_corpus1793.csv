8965,hydrological models and drought indices based on simulation of soil moisture have been widely used in large scale agricultural drought assessments however hydrological models often oversimplify crop modules and does not consider irrigation crop growth and water demand impacts therefore in the present study a coupled hydrological crop growth model variable infiltration capacity environmental policy integrated climate vic epic was used to consider the impact of the irrigation process on drought and propose a crop water anomaly percentage index cwapi based on the crop water demand and consumption processes identification and assessment methods of drought events were also evaluated the validation results of the vic epic model showed that the correlation coefficients between the modis evapotranspiration and the simulated evapotranspiration at 37 merged grids were above 0 74 the correlation coefficient 0 79 of the cwapi simulated values and statistical values of drought area rates was greater than that 0 72 of soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi indicating that the simulation of drought area rate based on cwapi was more reasonable after identifying regional drought events and comparing the identified characteristic values of these events with the average drought data of each city it was found that smapi misjudged some regions with high hydraulic conductivity as severe drought regions this limitation was overcome by cwapi which directly reflects the degree of crop water shortage and considers the impact of irrigation on drought agricultural drought occurs due to low soil water content which is caused by rapid percolation of soil water and insufficient storage of local and irrigation water this study of drought indices will help develop a more timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with droughts by considering the impacts of irrigation crop growth and water demand on drought keywords agricultural drought assessment coupled hydrological and crop growth model vic epic crop water anomaly percentage index cwapi soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi drought event identification agricultural drought characteristic spatial distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural drought refers to the phenomenon in which external environmental factors cause a water deficit in crops which affects normal crop growth and development leading to yield reduction or harvest loss china meteorological administration 2015 yield reduction caused by agricultural drought has seriously affected food security and sustainable economic and social development in the past decade agricultural drought in china has been the largest among all kinds of disasters national bureau of statistics 2021 which shows that compared with other kinds of disasters drought disasters have a huge impact on agriculture in recent years the direct economic losses caused by drought in china have been over 20 billion yuan and have increased since 2018 china national knowledge infrastructure 2021 indicating that the economic losses caused by drought have seriously affected sustainable economic and social development to reduce the impact of drought on economic and social development the concerned authorities often take relevant drought mitigation measures to reduce drought induced economic losses however when implementing drought mitigation measures it is necessary to understand the extent of drought in various regions before deploying these measures according to the local conditions this requires the assessment of agricultural drought in various regions therefore research on agricultural drought assessment is of great importance for implementing sustainable development strategies and achieving stable economic and social development the formation mechanism of agricultural drought is complex and is influenced by numerous factors at present there is no unified understanding of the occurrence development duration and other elements of agricultural drought mishra and singh 2010 sheffield et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 further an accurate assessment of agricultural droughts is difficult biao et al 2018 therefore scholars from various countries have tried different methods to assess agricultural droughts liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 and in these methods drought indices were used for quantitative assessment the study of drought indices will help form a more timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with drought problems 1 drought assessment based on meteorological factors in drought assessment meteorological elements are often used to build drought indices which have both advantages and disadvantages among these the palmer drought index palmer 1965 has been widely used this index was based on the principle of water balance in which water deficit was calculated by considering precipitation and evaporation duan et al 2013 and climate suitable precipitation was introduced the drought assessment results based on this index were highly consistent with that of the actual situation yan et al 2016 therefore it was found suitable for the identification rhee and carbone 2007 zhao et al 2017 evaluation dai 2011 and prediction dai and zhao 2017 of agricultural drought however the two layer soil model used for calculating the water balance in the palmer index is too simple alley 1984 and cannot identify drought events at different time scales vicenteserrano et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 which limits its popularity and application while building the palmer index palmer developed the crop moisture index palmer 1968 which is the sum of the abnormal evapotranspiration index and humidity index this index is mainly used to monitor the impact of short term moisture conditions on growing crops hence it is not suitable for monitoring long term droughts to consider the impact of different time scales on drought assessment mckee et al 1993 proposed the standardized precipitation index spi which ignores the impact of water demand on quantified drought events vicenteserrano et al 2010 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei considers the impact of regional water demand on potential evapotranspiration however the calculated results based on this index were inconsistent with that of the actual records under water stress conditions zhang and he 2016 for this reason zhang et al 2015 proposed a standardized moisture anomaly index szi based on the calculation of the shortage value d the difference between the actual precipitation and the climate suitable precipitation in the palmer index and the normalization of spi compared with spei szi also considers the impact of runoff and soil water content on regional water demand which is more suitable for quantifying drought processes biao et al 2018 although this index can assess drought on multiple time scales it fails to consider the influence of different land surface conditions on the drought index 2 drought assessment based on soil moisture to consider the impact of land surface conditions on the agricultural drought index a large scale hydrological model was used as a tool and the calculated soil water content was used to build the agricultural drought index for example an et al 2017 used soil relative humidity as an indicator to quantify the severity of agricultural drought they analyzed the relationship between soil relative humidity index and disaster data and found that the index has good applicability the national agricultural drought grade china meteorological administration 2015 standard also recommended to use the soil relative humidity index to estimate agricultural drought levels however the drought level was determined using the same threshold of the soil relative humidity index for different regions which usually had different index thresholds owing to their underlying surface and climate using the same threshold to determine the drought level affects the accuracy of agricultural drought assessment therefore jaranilla sanchez et al 2011 used soil moisture deficit as an indicator to quantify the agricultural drought process pandey et al 2004 sawada et al 2014 wu et al 2012 simulated soil moisture based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 1996 built the soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi and studied the characteristics of large scale drought events in china wu et al 2013 2011 the above index takes the multi year average soil water content as the normal value quantifies the soil water content anomaly and constructs the drought index to quantify the extent of agricultural drought using the anomaly percentage however building a drought index from the sole perspective of soil water content cannot accurately measure the extent of agricultural drought because agricultural drought is caused by crop water deficit it is necessary to further consider the influence of crop water requirements to quantify crop water deficit and accurately assess the extent of agricultural drought sawada et al 2014 hence the relevant agricultural drought indices based on soil water content only indirectly reflect the characteristics of agricultural droughts 3 drought assessment based on crop water deficit the empirical estimation method uses the empirical relationship between precipitation or yield and water consumption to estimate crop water consumption and obtain an index reflecting the degree of water deficit based on the difference between water demand and consumption for example yin et al 2009 used the linear empirical relationship between crop yield and crop water consumption to estimate crop water demand and consumption and the crop water deficit was calculated based on the difference between crop water demand and consumption zhu 2013 used the empirical method of effective precipitation to estimate crop water consumption which was calculated based on penman s formula and the crop water deficit was estimated based on the difference between crop water demand and consumption jia et al 2018 analyzed the drought identification accuracy of crop water stress index cwsi which was used to quantify the crop water deficit based on an empirical estimation method and found that drought was poorly quantified using cwsi and several drought events were not identified owing to the significant error in crop water consumption overall the empirical estimation method is simple to use but the accuracy of the identified drought events based on this method needs to be improved li et al 2020 indicated that the model considering crop growth and vegetation response mechanism to the water stress is more suitable for agricultural drought assessment the crop model is an effective technical means to simulate crop growth and vegetation response mechanism it considers the effects of various interactions in the atmosphere crops and soil and can better simulate the agricultural drought process simulation of agricultural drought processes based on crop models is an important development direction for agricultural drought assessment however crop models are often used to simulate crop growth at the field scale and cannot simulate crop growth and water deficits at the macro scale to simulate the crop growth process at the macro scale soil moisture data must be input to the crop model remote sensing data products can be used to input soil moisture data on a large scale to the crop model the growth process of crops was simulated and the cwdi was calculated to assess agricultural drought zhang et al 2021c zhou et al 2022 however the time continuous soil moisture of the entire root layer of the crop cannot be retrieved through remote sensing although there is a lack of the time continuous soil moisture data in large areas these data can be supplemented by hydrological model simulations however crop growth processes are not included in the hydrological model wang et al 2012 introducing crop growth simulation into hydrological models will greatly improve the simulation accuracy of soil water content and crop growth processes and build a more reasonable agricultural drought index by describing the degree of water deficit providing a theoretical basis for agricultural drought assessment research to solve the problem in introducing crop growth into hydrological models for drought assessment this study coupled a crop model with a hydrological model to simulate crop water consumption and demand an agricultural drought index was proposed to identify large scale agricultural drought event and agricultural drought characteristics were evaluated under different underlying surface conditions in jiangsu province the research results will be of great significance for accurately assessing agricultural drought providing a scientific basis for comprehensively understanding the drought formation process and providing an important theoretical basis and technical support for formulating drought resistance and disaster reduction measures according to local conditions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area and data jiangsu province is located in the jianghuai region of eastern china and belongs to the east asian monsoon climate zone the annual average temperature is between 13 and 16 and the annual average precipitation is approximately 1000 mm it is composed of approximately 8000 river basins however the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in jiangsu province which is a typical region in china with frequent drought and flood disasters is uneven with obvious regional differences bao et al 2011 fig 1 shows that there is more rice area in the east and there is more wheat area in the north in recent years under the joint influence of global warming and human activities large scale high impact drought events have occurred frequently for example in 2011 jiangsu province suffered a severe drought and nanjing shijiu lake dried up and in 2016 the water area of hongze lake was continuously dry which caused a great inconvenience to water transportation in the lake area changzhou also suffered from continuous high temperatures and drought which seriously restricted the healthy development of local agriculture from mid september to december 2019 the average rainfall in jiangsu province was 91 mm which was 48 less than that in the same period of the year most regions of the province had moderate or severe meteorological droughts and the south of the huaihe river was severely dry jiangsu province is also one of the provinces with a high gross domestic product gdp ranking fourth in the total agricultural output value of 31 provinces in 2019 the frequent occurrence of drought in this province has seriously affected normal local agricultural production and has become an important factor restricting the economic and social development the vic epic model was built in jiangsu province to study the formation process of local agricultural drought the meteorological data used in the model were the 5 km and 6 h scale data obtained using inverse distance weight interpolation based on the daily dataset of china s surface climate data from the china meteorological data network ren et al 2020 crop spatial distribution data were obtained based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi enhanced vegetation index evi and land surface water index lswi data using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis remote sensing products and decision tree models as shown in fig 1 dem data were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr and kobrick 2000 with a resolution of 30 m the water area data were obtained from the 30 m resolution water area data product developed by the european commission joint research center pekel et al 2016 vegetation type data were obtained from the global 1 km land cover type database developed by the university of maryland parameters such as albedo minimum stomatal conductance roughness and monthly leaf area index of vegetation other than crops were obtained from the land surface data assimilation system pisek and chen 2007 wiegand et al 1979 and the leaf area index of crops was simulated using the epic model the soil parameters in the vic model were calculated according to the soil database reynolds et al 2000 and the saxton saxton et al 1986 soil characteristic parameter formula developed by reynolds et al the property parameters of different types of crops were derived from the crop parameter library of the swat soil water assessment tool model hydrologic model parameters were obtained by calibrating the measured hydrological data and parameter transfer lu et al 2013 mao 2017 wu et al 2007a 2007b 2 2 coupling of variable infiltration capacity environmental policy integrated climate model the vic model liang et al 1994 is a large scale semi distributed hydrological model that simulates hydrological processes including runoff generation infiltration and base flow based on the variable infiltration capacity curve and the arno model however the vic model cannot simulate the crop growth process it only uses a series of discrete numerical values to generalize the monthly change process of the crop leaf area and simulates the evapotranspiration for each month additionally the leaf area for a particular month does not change every year which leads to a systemic error in evapotranspiration simulated by the vic model lu et al 2015 tsarouchi et al 2014 meanwhile the evapotranspiration of agricultural land includes only canopy interception evaporation and plant transpiration without considering soil evaporation therefore in the growth period of crops with a low leaf area index soil evaporation is dominant in crop evapotranspiration and the simulated evapotranspiration would be smaller than the actual evapotranspiration to improve the calculation accuracy of evapotranspiration the crop model was coupled to the vic model and the dynamic leaf area index vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation were calculated simultaneously the epic model was selected as the crop model the epic model uses a unified approach to simulate more than 100 crop types and is widely used different crop types have different parameters such as planting date root growth and lai therefore different crop growth stages are simulated with different results rich data and documents are available for this model which requires little data and can easily be applied to large scale simulations the epic model uses temperature soil water and nutrient data to simulate potential evapotranspiration maximum crop transpiration actual crop transpiration actual soil evaporation plant height lai biomass root length and yield the simulation method is described by neitsch et al 2011 this model also simulates the effect of water stress on crop growth quantified by the ratio of actual to maximum plant transpiration neitsch et al 2011 the maximum plant transpiration namely the potential transpiration was calculated using equation 1 and the actual plant transpiration was influenced by the water stress coefficient k s based on the formula 2 1 λ e t δ h n e t g γ k 1 0 622 λ ρ a i r p e z o e z r a δ γ 1

hydrological model and proposed a parametric scheme for the impact of irrigation process on crop evapotranspiration to overcome the problem of irrigation impact not being considered in the coupled hydrological and crop growth models the variable infiltration capacity environmental policy integrated climate vic epic model was constructed zhang et al 2021a to integrate the advantages of the hydrological model to simulate soil water content and crop models to simulate crop evapotranspiration simultaneously the evapotranspiration module in the vic epic model was improved based on the water stress method recommended by the food and agriculture organization which laid the foundation for agricultural drought assessment the flow chart of the coupled vic epic model was shown in fig 2 2 3 large scale vic epic model construction incorporating reservoir and irrigation modules the method of building the vic epic model over a large area includes forcing data and parameter files of the vic model routing model crop module reservoir module and irrigation module 1 building the vic model the vic model in jiangsu province was constructed based on a 5 km merged grid for the forced data the inverse distance weight interpolation method was used to interpolate the meteorological station data for each merged grid for the parameter file the model parameters mao 2017 were determined based on the research of mao et al 2016 combined with the regional transfer formula of hydrological parameters lu et al 2013 wu et al 2007a 2007b owing to space limitations only the shape index b of the saturated storage capacity curve and the base flow parameter ds are displayed in fig 3 which shows that their spatial differences were large the soil type sand content and clay content were set based on the soil database developed by reynolds et al 2000 which was classified into 12 soil texture types the dominant soil type in the merged grid was considered to be the soil type of the merged grid the soil data were divided into upper and lower layers the soil at a depth of 0 30 cm was the upper layer and the soil at a depth of 30 100 cm was the lower layer the parameters of the first soil layer set by the vic model in this study were the upper soil layer values and those of the second and third soil layers were the lower soil layer values vegetation parameters were obtained from the global 1 km land cover type database and the land surface data assimilation system developed by the university of maryland pisek and chen 2007 wiegand et al 1979 these parameters included albedo minimum stomatal conductance roughness and the monthly leaf area index of vegetation except for crops the vic model uses the basin saturation capacity curve and water balance equation to calculate surface runoff and soil moisture based on the above vegetation and soil parameters and the arno model and hydrological parameters were used to calculate the base flow 2 building the routing model the flow direction determination method liu 2017 was used to divide jiangsu province and its basin into 8810 merged grids as shown in fig 4 based on the routing parameter transfer formulas in seven climate zones proposed by liu 2017 the routing response functions of the merged grids and their channels were generated based on the kinematic wave and diffusive wave equations the vic epic model calculated the flow process of the outlet section in each merged grid based on the merged grid response function then calculated the channel flow process based on the channel response function and finally obtained the flow data of all of the merged grids 3 constructing the crop model the crop module simulated the growth processes of crops under different rotation modes land use type data including crop types planted at different times and the planting proportion of different rotation modes in each merged grid were identified based on modis data and the decision tree model as the vic model also needs to input land use type data when the crop model is closely coupled to the vic model the land use data of the vic and crop models need to be unified to ensure that the data can be transferred between the vic and crop models currently the land use data of the vic model are only for corn which does not consider other crop types and crop rotation planting methods therefore this study addressed the lack of other crop types in the vic model and added several crop rotation types widely planted in jiangsu province to the vegetation database file according to the results of crop distribution recognition based on modis remote sensing data and the decision tree model eight crop rotation types were extracted maize rice wheat wheat maize wheat rice rapeseed rapeseed maize and rapeseed rice based on these crop rotation types the area proportion of different rotation types in each merged grid was calculated and the vegetation database files of the vic model and the vegetation parameter file of each merged grid were updated these eight crop rotations included rice crops and rice often needs to maintain a water depth during planting however the epic model does not consider the simulation variation of water depth in the paddy field according to the critical water depth requirements of paddy fields in different growth periods in the reference guo 1997 the study simulated the irrigation and drainage process of paddy fields in the vic epic model the input files of the crop module included the crop library file crop library txt crop soil parameter file crop soil txt crop rotation type file crop rotation type txt and paddy critical water depth file rice depth threshold txt the crop library file contained various parameters for each crop type such as the maximum leaf area index and leaf stomatal conductance these parameters were selected as default values in the swat model manual arnold et al 2012 crop soil parameters included the redistribution ratio of crop water absorption to the lower layer planting time of different crops on each merged grid and redistribution ratio parameters the parameters were determined using a test basin calibration the planting time was determined according to the ten day dataset of crop growth and farmland soil moisture in china wang 2015 crop rotation type parameters included the crop type number in the study area and the corresponding crop type number sequence of different crop rotation types which were determined based on the identification results of crop types at different times the paddy critical water depth file provides the maximum and minimum water depths that the paddy field needs to maintain at different growth stages as determined by reference guo 1997 the meteorological data input to the crop module was obtained from the forcing data of the vic model the crop model calculated the heat unit based on meteorological data estimated the leaf area and root depth of crops based on the heat unit and calculated the potential crop transpiration based on meteorological data and leaf area the actual crop transpiration rate was obtained according to the root depth soil moisture content and water stress formula the calculation process is described in detail in neitsch et al 2011 zhang et al 2021a 4 reservoir module building the reservoir module requires the aggregate reservoir capacity data for each merged grid currently there is no published database of aggregate reservoir capacity in this study the water area in each merged grid was calculated based on the water area data pekel et al 2016 developed by the european commission joint research center and the maximum volume of the surface water body corresponding to the maximum water area of each water body was calculated based on formula 3 neitsch et al 2011 the aggregate reservoir capacity of each merged grid was obtained by summing up the maximum volume of the surface water body in each merged grid the water area and capacity of the aggregate reservoirs were incorporated into the input file for the reservoir module according to the water balance eq 4 the storage capacity of the aggregate reservoir was simulated time by time 3 v c sa β sa 1 expsa 4 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep i a where sa is the water area hm2 β sa and expsa are the calculation parameters which were obtained by fitting the storage capacity and area data of some reservoirs in jiangsu province v is the volume of water stored in the reservoir at the end of the period m3 v stored is the volume of water stored in the reservoir at the beginning of the period m3 v flowin is the volume of water entering the reservoir during the period m3 v flowout is the volume of water flowing out of the reservoir during the period m3 v pcp is the precipitation volume during the period m3 v evap is the evaporation of the reservoir during the period m3 and v seep is the water lost from the reservoir by seepage during the period m3 5 building the irrigation module the irrigation module requires effective irrigation area rate parameters for each merged grid the effective irrigation area rate was calculated based on the effective irrigation area and cultivated land area in the jiangsu statistical yearbook tang 1985 2019 combined with the distribution data of the crop and river grids the irrigation parameters and effective irrigation area rate of each merged grid can be calculated according to the method in a previous study zhang et al 2021a based on which the input file was made the threshold value of soil water content triggering irrigation was transferred from the results of the test basin zhang et al 2021b and the irrigation interval was taken as 5 d etchanchu et al 2019 when the soil water content was lower than the set threshold the irrigation module was induced for irrigation simulation and the irrigation water demand was calculated based on the difference between field water capacity wu et al 2018a and current soil water content the actual irrigation water was calculated by combining the effective irrigation area rate with eq 5 5 i a α i r e α i r e v v α i r e v where i a is the actual irrigation water mm i r is the irrigation water demand mm v is the water stored in the water body mm α is the effective irrigation rate and e is the irrigation efficiency 2 4 building of crop water anomaly percentage index based on the agricultural drought definition water deficit in crops caused by external environmental factors china meteorological administration 2015 a drought index that reflects the degree of crop water deficit was constructed the crop water stress index jackson et al 1981 has been proposed by researchers to reflect the degree of water shortage but this index is a drought index calculated based on the sum of crop water consumption and soil evaporation which would be affected by surface soil evaporation and this effect is greater during the seedling stage of crops therefore it cannot directly reflect the degree of drought in crops pablos et al 2017 tang and li 2017 yang et al 2018 to improve the evaluation accuracy of agricultural drought crop water demand and water consumption zhang et al 2021b which do not consider soil evaporation were used to measure the degree of crop water shortage first the crop water anomaly index cwai jackson et al 1981 was constructed 6 c w a i j e a c t j e s o i l a c t j e j e s o i l j 1 100 e t a c t j e t j 1 100 where cwai j is the crop water anomaly index of the j th time unit the time unit is one day e act j is the actual evapotranspiration of the j th time unit mm e soil act j is the actual soil evaporation of the j th time unit mm e j is the potential evapotranspiration of the j th time unit mm e soil j is the soil potential evaporation of the j th time unit mm e t act j is the actual crop transpiration of the j th time unit that is crop water consumption mm and e t j is the maximum crop transpiration of the j th time unit that is crop water demand mm owing to different evapotranspiration in different seasons climatic regions and crop types it is difficult for the crop water anomaly index to express the water deficit degree of each region in a unified standard therefore the crop water anomaly percentage index cwapi was built based on formula 7 to evaluate agricultural drought china meteorological administration 2015 this index integrates the construction of crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 and the crop water deficit abnormal index cwdia china meteorological administration 2015 to realize the complementary advantages of directly reflecting the degree of crop water deficit from cwsi and considering the impact of early water deficit from cwdia 7 c w a p i c w a i i c w a i 100 c w a i 100 where cwapi is the crop water anomaly percentage index in a period cwai i is the weighted average crop water anomaly index in the i th period as shown in formula 8 and c w a i is the average crop water anomaly index value on the same days of each year of the calculated period taking 30 years as shown in formula 9 8 cwai i k 1 cwai j k 2 cwai j 1 k 50 cwai j 49 where cwai i is the weighted average crop water anomaly index of the i th period cwai j is the crop water anomaly index of the j th time unit taken as 1 d calculated based on equation 6 and k i is the weight coefficient of the crop water anomaly index of each time unit which was selected with reference to agricultural drought grade china meteorological administration 2015 because there is a fallow period for crop growth there is no cwai j value for some periods 9 c w a i 1 n m 1 n c w a i m where n is the total number of years generally over 30 years and m is the serial number of each year m 1 2 n to formulate a reasonable drought classification standard the frequency distribution of cwapi in the study area was calculated by referring to the research ideas of wu et al 2011 mao 2017 and palmer 1965 based on this frequency distribution and the occurrence frequency of different drought levels in the studies by mao 2017 and wu et al 2011 the drought levels of cwapi were divided as shown in table 1 to consider the impact of different crop growth periods on the determination of agricultural drought levels the drought levels of the critical crop water demand period and other growth periods were assigned respectively in table 1 by referring to the treatment method of drought level classification standard in agricultural drought grade china meteorological administration 2015 for the critical crop water demand period the critical period for crop water demand refers to the growing period when crops are more sensitive to water if the water is not sufficient during this growing period crop yield would be greatly affected therefore the cwapi of the critical crop water demand period was slightly larger than that of the other growth periods at the same level the potential evapotranspiration e t and actual evapotranspiration e t act data obtained from the simulation calculation of the vic epic model were combined with the cwapi formula to calculate the daily cwapi and agricultural drought level of the 5 km merged grid in jiangsu province as there are corresponding cwapis for different crop rotation types in the merged grid to simplify the presentation of diagrams and improve the readability of diagrams the cwapi corresponding to the crop with the largest planting proportion in the merged grid was selected to represent the cwapi of the merged grid and the corresponding soil drought index was compared in this study the smapi was selected as the soil drought index the smapi often uses the soil water content calculated by the vic model mao et al 2016 wu et al 2011 because the vic model failed to simulate irrigation and crop growth processes and the output soil water content was the average soil water content of all land use types the smapi based on vic was not affected by crop growth and irrigation the smapi based on the vic epic model was affected by irrigation however because the regional average soil moisture was affected by the soil moisture of land use types other than cultivated land the impact of irrigation on the regional average soil moisture was limited therefore the impact of irrigation on smapi that was simulated based on the vic epic model was limited huang et al 2020 the smapi dryness and wetness grading table table 2 recommended by lu et al 2021 was used in this study because smapi is proportional to the soil water content the smaller the smapi the smaller the soil water content and the more severe the drought in this study the drought identified by the cwapi was called crop drought the smaller the cwapi value the more severe is the drought 2 5 regional drought event identification method according to the scope of drought events drought event recognition methods include merged grid drought event recognition and regional drought event recognition the drought event in the merged grid is a drought event occurring in a single merged grid and the characteristics of the drought event can be described by the duration intensity and severity of drought when the drought events of a single merged grid gradually expanded into drought events of multiple merged grids that met certain requirements they could be identified as regional drought events the characteristics of regional drought events can be described by drought duration intensity severity and area the characteristic values of drought events for different indices have different definitions 1 the characteristic values of drought events in the merged grid of smapi were defined as follows the duration of drought based on smapi was defined as the duration of the consecutive days when the smapi value was under 5 60 d were taken as the threshold of drought duration to identify a merged grid drought event the average smapi value of a drought event is the drought intensity based on smapi the drought severity based on smapi is the product of drought intensity and drought duration as shown in eq 10 two consecutive drought events with an interval of no more than 10 d would be merged into one drought wu et al 2018b 10 s r d where s is drought severity r is drought intensity and d is drought duration 2 the characteristic values of drought events in the merged grid of cwapi were defined as follows during the drought events based on smapi the duration of drought events based on cwapi takes the number of consecutive days in which cwapi in the critical period of crop water demand was less than the drought threshold of 5 and cwapi in other periods was less than the drought threshold of 10 the average cwapi value in the duration of drought events based on cwapi is the drought intensity based on cwapi and the drought severity based on cwapi is the product of drought intensity and drought duration based on cwapi see eq 10 3 the regional drought event characteristic values of smapi were defined as follows the drought area based on smapi was defined as the percentage of merged grids with smapi values under 5 in the region the drought intensity based on smapi is the average value of merged grids with smapi values under 5 in the region the duration of drought based on smapi is the duration of regional daily drought area over 30 the regional drought severity based on smapi is the product of regional drought intensity and drought duration 60 d were taken as the threshold of drought duration to identify a regional drought event 4 the characteristic values of regional drought events of cwapi were defined as follows the drought area ratio based on cwapi was defined as the percentage of merged grids with cwapi in the critical period of crop water demand less than the drought threshold of 5 and cwapi in other periods less than the drought threshold of 10 the drought intensity based on cwapi is the average value of the cwapi of the merged grids where cwapi in the critical crop water demand period is less than the drought threshold of 5 and cwapi in other periods is less than the drought threshold of 10 the duration of drought based on cwapi is the duration when the regional daily drought area ratio based on cwapi is over 30 and the regional drought severity based on cwapi is the product of regional drought intensity and drought duration see eq 10 3 results 3 1 comparative analysis of evapotranspiration to validate the simulation results of the vic epic model the evapotranspiration data which has a greater impact on the cwapi were selected for comparison the et product of modis from 2001 to 2017 running et al 2017 was compared with the simulated evapotranspiration results of the vic epic model in the corresponding period the error index was calculated based on formulas 11 14 and fig 5 was obtained 11 p b i a s t 1 t f t y t t 1 t y t 100 12 n r m s e 1 t t 1 t f t y t 2 100 y 13 r t 1 t f t

simulated value of the model at all time y is the average value of the observed value at all time fig 6 shows that the correlation coefficients of evapotranspiration in 37 of the merged grid were above 0 74 the average nrmse and rmse were 56 and 88 which were lower than that of marek et al 2016 fig 5 a shows that these merged grids with high correlation coefficients were mainly located in the south and northwest of jiangsu province while the correlation coefficient of evapotranspiration in the central part of jiangsu province was low and the correlation coefficient of some merged grid was lower than 0 60 most of the central part of jiangsu province belonged to the plain river network area where artificial and natural rivers were crisscrossed human activities such as irrigation and water transfer had a great impact on evapotranspiration the vic epic model did not consider the impact of water transfer on evapotranspiration and the elevations of the central part were very similar which affected the simulation accuracy of the water flow direction and the water storage of the merged grids the uncertainty of the water storage would further affect the simulation accuracy of evapotranspiration by affecting the simulation accuracy of irrigation therefore the simulated evapotranspiration in jiangsu province generally has a good correlation with modis et but factors such as human activities lead to a low correlation between the simulated evapotranspiration and modis et in the plain river network area fig 5 shows that the spatial distribution of errors reflected by different error indices was not completely consistent among them b d show that the southern error was larger while a shows that the southern error was smaller this difference existed because of different error metrics the correlation coefficient describes the consistency of the changes in the two columns of data while pbias rmse and nrmse reflect the average absolute deviation of the data at the same time therefore the variation trend of simulated evapotranspiration and satellite retrieved evapotranspiration in southern jiangsu province were consistent but the absolute value of the difference was large the satellite data itself has large systematic errors and random errors and its absolute numerical precision is not high but the relative change information is more accurate hence the spatial distribution of errors displayed by the correlation coefficient is more reasonable 3 2 validation based on the drought record to validate the simulated agricultural drought in jiangsu province two drought indices smapi and cwapi and their drought levels were calculated from 1985 to 2017 for all of the merged grids because the water absorbed by crop roots comes from the soil at a depth of 0 40 cm jiang 2013 wang 2017 you jie et al 2014 the default soil water content used in the smapi index constructed in this study was the average soil water content at a depth of 0 40 cm for all land use types calculated by the vic epic model mao et al 2016 wu et al 2011 the light drought area rate corresponding to each year s drought index in jiangsu province was calculated and compared with the drought affected area rate recorded in yearbooks jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 fig 7 shows that the average correlation coefficient between the simulated drought area rate based on the cwapi and the statistical drought affected area rate was slightly larger than the average correlation coefficient between the simulated drought area rate based on the smapi and the statistical value a better simulation effect was observed for the calculated area rate of light drought based on cwapi whereas the simulation results of the two drought indices were close in the calculated area rates of moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought the statistical drought affected area refers to the area where crop water deficit occurs and the drought grade of crops in the drought affected area is the closest to the light drought grade as a result the correlation coefficient between the simulated light drought area rates and the drought affected area rates can be considered an important indicator of the simulation accuracy of the drought index in the correlation coefficient cc between light drought area rates and statistical drought area rates the cc of cwapi is higher than that of smapi therefore cwapi drought simulation accuracy is higher than that of smapi water storage in light and moderate droughts often meets the water requirements of crop irrigation but water storage in extreme droughts is often insufficient to meet crop irrigation water requirements as a result the impact of irrigation on light and moderate drought was greater than that on extreme drought while cwapi considered the impact of irrigation on agricultural drought smapi was affected by the soil water content of non cropland use types that were not affected by irrigation and was less affected by irrigation therefore compared to smapi the simulated area rates of light and moderate droughts based on cwapi were more reasonable when considering the effects of crop growth irrigation and water demand 3 3 analysis of drought characteristics of large scale drought events to analyze and explain the distribution law of agricultural drought characteristics in jiangsu province the smapi and cwapi drought events were identified for all merged grids from 1985 to 2017 and the average values of drought duration intensity and severity of each drought event in all merged grids were calculated as shown in fig 8 fig 10 the soil drought characteristics in this study were consistent with the average soil drought intensity and drought severity distribution law of mao et al 2016 in terms of drought duration fig 8 the average soil drought duration in the north of jiangsu province was greater than that in the south while the crop drought duration distribution was more complex in the north region of the yangtze river in jiangsu province the average crop drought duration of crops in the west was greater than that in the east and in the south region of the yangtze river in jiangsu province the average drought duration of crops in the east was greater than that in the west in general the crop drought duration was shorter than that of soil drought and the spatial distribution law of crop and soil drought duration was also different in terms of drought intensity fig 9 the average soil drought intensity in the north of jiangsu province was relatively high and there was also a relatively high average soil drought intensity in the local areas of southern jiangsu province the distribution law of average crop drought intensity in jiangsu province was very similar to that of average crop drought duration that is the northern distribution law was high in the west and low in the east while the southern distribution law was high in the east and low in the west distinct differences existed in the distributions of crop and soil drought intensities the spatial distribution of drought severity fig 10 was consistent with that of drought intensity 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of causes of drought characteristics in jiangsu province the difference between the distribution maps of the characteristic values of soil drought and crop drought indicates that the factors influencing soil drought and crop drought are different the spatial differences in soil drought characteristic values are related to climate and soil attribute parameter differences and the difference in soil attribute parameters has a greater influence on the difference in soil drought characteristic values mao et al 2016 among the soil attribute parameters hydraulic conductivity and field capacity are two important parameters when the soil hydraulic conductivity is high and the field capacity is small the soil water holding capacity declines resulting in low soil water content in the region due to quick infiltration which is more likely to cause soil drought fig 11 shows that sandy loam was distributed in taizhou nantong xuzhou huai an and lianyungang cities which led to higher soil hydraulic conductivity fig 12 higher water permeability lower field capacity fig 13 and lower water holding capacity in these areas as a result these areas were frequently affected by lower soil water content and soil drought was more likely to occur in these areas which is depicted by the three dark red areas in fig 10 a these three dark red areas correspond to taizhou nantong xuzhou huai an and lianyungang cities according to the average drought area rate data of the cities in jiangsu province from 2009 to 2019 jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 fig 14 xuzhou huai an and lianyungang belong to the regions with large average drought area rates whereas taizhou and nantong belong to the regions with small average drought area rates hence smapi can be used to explain the frequent occurrence of drought in xuzhou and huai an through soil types but cannot explain why drought rarely occurs in taizhou and nantong the distribution map of crop drought severity in fig 10 b shows that the dark red areas with higher absolute values of crop drought intensity are mainly distributed in xuzhou lianyungang and suqian cities which correspond to the three cities with higher average drought area rates in jiangsu province whereas there are no dark red areas in taizhou and nantong cities with higher absolute soil drought intensity values taizhou and nantong belong to the regions with small average drought area rates jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 fig 14 and the spatial distribution characteristics of agricultural drought calculated by the cwapi were more reasonable this is because the density of river network in taizhou and nantong is high see fig 4 and the irrigation area rate is high wu et al 2020 also found a significant relationship between irrigated and drought affected areas on the other hand taizhou and nantong are closer to the southern jiangsu province than xuzhou and suqian the precipitation in taizhou and nantong is sufficient the river water is more abundant and the water storage per unit area is larger hence the irrigation water per unit area can be increased to decrease the probability of drought omer et al 2020 and leng et al 2017 also found that an increase in irrigation water would reduce drought severity and duration and decrease the effect of water stress on crops ciais et al 2005 huang et al 2020 also found that in areas with more irrigation the evaluation performance of some drought indices that did not consider irrigation was worse to verify the difference in irrigation water volume per unit area in regions with high soil drought intensity xuzhou and taizhou were selected as examples according to the agricultural water consumption data in jiangsu water conservancy yearbook jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 and the sown area data in the statistical yearbook fan 2010 2020 liu and cai 2010 2020 in the recent 10 years the irrigation water volumes per unit area in xuzhou and taizhou were 0 29 m3 m2 and 0 37 m3 m2 respectively indicating that the large irrigation water volume per unit area led to a small average drought area rate in taizhou in 2013 the drought affected area in taizhou reached a maximum in nearly 10 years and the agricultural water consumption in that year also reached a minimum indicating that agricultural irrigation is an important factor affecting drought in taizhou therefore the cwapi can be used to explain why drought often occurs in xuzhou and huai an based on soil types but it can also be used to explain considering irrigation area and water volume why taizhou and nantong do not often suffer from drought wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 it can be seen that the distribution law of the soil drought characteristic value reflects the distribution law of soil hydraulic conductivity and is affected by precipitation and temperature crop growth is also affected by the above factors but greatly affected by human beings who would build water conservation projects and carry out agricultural irrigation activities according to local conditions to avoid agricultural drought as much as possible as a result crop drought characteristics are not only affected by meteorological conditions and soil type distribution but also by human irrigation water area crop water demand crop critical growth period and other factors wang et al 2019 also indicated that artificial irrigation and crop factors are the reasons for the difference and rationality of the crop drought index compared to other drought indices hence wu et al 2020 pointed out that as human activities could reduce natural drought conditions crop drought is less than soil drought qin et al 2015 yang et al 2018 5 conclusions this study takes jiangsu province as a study area simulates crop water demand based on the vic epic model applies the cwapi index to carry out large scale agricultural drought event identification and drought characteristics research discusses the spatial characteristics of agricultural drought reveals the influence of soil water deficit and crop water deficit on agricultural drought formation under different underlying surface conditions in jiangsu province and draws the following conclusions 1 a vic epic model was constructed in jiangsu province and the simulation results of the vic epic model and the evaluation results of cwapi drought index were verified the average correlation coefficients between the simulated evapotranspiration of simulation and observed evapotranspiration in the 37 merged grids were above 0 74 the validation results based on the actual drought records showed that the correlation coefficient 0 79 of the statistical values and cwapi simulated values of drought area rates was greater than that of smapi 0 72 indicating that the simulation results of vic epic model in jiangsu province were highly reasonable 2 the spatial distribution of the drought characteristics of large scale drought events in jiangsu province was analyzed in terms of soil drought characteristics the average soil drought duration intensity and severity in the north of jiangsu province were greater than those in the south the average soil drought intensity and drought severity distribution law were consistent with the results obtained by mao et al 2016 in terms of crop drought characteristics in the north drought characteristics were higher in the west and lower in the east while in the south drought characteristics were higher in the east and lower in the west the duration of crop drought was generally shorter than that of soil drought 3 the effects of soil and crop water deficits on the formation of agricultural drought characteristics under different underlying surface conditions in jiangsu province were revealed according to the distribution law of the characteristic values of agricultural drought events in jiangsu province it was found that the absolute value of average drought characteristics based on smapi was larger in regions with higher hydraulic conductivity and the calculation results in some regions were inconsistent with the actual record cwapi was affected by the irrigation process and regional water volume hence the spatial distribution characteristics of agricultural drought duration intensity and severity in jiangsu province were more reasonable this shows that agricultural drought was not only caused by rapid soil water infiltration and low water content which led to water stress effects on crops but also by insufficient irrigation water due to insufficient local water storage in this study the crop drought index was used to evaluate agricultural drought and results were more reasonable than those of the soil drought index the extent of influence of water stress on the yield of different crops during different growth periods is a very important indicator if the water stress index can be directly converted into the corresponding yield reduction the yield reduction as an agricultural drought index will have a clearer physical significance directly reflecting the impact of drought on agricultural production which will have an important guiding significance in drought mitigation and food security hence a drought index that can directly reflect crop yield loss will be developed declaration of competing interest

8965,hydrological models and drought indices based on simulation of soil moisture have been widely used in large scale agricultural drought assessments however hydrological models often oversimplify crop modules and does not consider irrigation crop growth and water demand impacts therefore in the present study a coupled hydrological crop growth model variable infiltration capacity environmental policy integrated climate vic epic was used to consider the impact of the irrigation process on drought and propose a crop water anomaly percentage index cwapi based on the crop water demand and consumption processes identification and assessment methods of drought events were also evaluated the validation results of the vic epic model showed that the correlation coefficients between the modis evapotranspiration and the simulated evapotranspiration at 37 merged grids were above 0 74 the correlation coefficient 0 79 of the cwapi simulated values and statistical values of drought area rates was greater than that 0 72 of soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi indicating that the simulation of drought area rate based on cwapi was more reasonable after identifying regional drought events and comparing the identified characteristic values of these events with the average drought data of each city it was found that smapi misjudged some regions with high hydraulic conductivity as severe drought regions this limitation was overcome by cwapi which directly reflects the degree of crop water shortage and considers the impact of irrigation on drought agricultural drought occurs due to low soil water content which is caused by rapid percolation of soil water and insufficient storage of local and irrigation water this study of drought indices will help develop a more timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with droughts by considering the impacts of irrigation crop growth and water demand on drought keywords agricultural drought assessment coupled hydrological and crop growth model vic epic crop water anomaly percentage index cwapi soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi drought event identification agricultural drought characteristic spatial distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural drought refers to the phenomenon in which external environmental factors cause a water deficit in crops which affects normal crop growth and development leading to yield reduction or harvest loss china meteorological administration 2015 yield reduction caused by agricultural drought has seriously affected food security and sustainable economic and social development in the past decade agricultural drought in china has been the largest among all kinds of disasters national bureau of statistics 2021 which shows that compared with other kinds of disasters drought disasters have a huge impact on agriculture in recent years the direct economic losses caused by drought in china have been over 20 billion yuan and have increased since 2018 china national knowledge infrastructure 2021 indicating that the economic losses caused by drought have seriously affected sustainable economic and social development to reduce the impact of drought on economic and social development the concerned authorities often take relevant drought mitigation measures to reduce drought induced economic losses however when implementing drought mitigation measures it is necessary to understand the extent of drought in various regions before deploying these measures according to the local conditions this requires the assessment of agricultural drought in various regions therefore research on agricultural drought assessment is of great importance for implementing sustainable development strategies and achieving stable economic and social development the formation mechanism of agricultural drought is complex and is influenced by numerous factors at present there is no unified understanding of the occurrence development duration and other elements of agricultural drought mishra and singh 2010 sheffield et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 further an accurate assessment of agricultural droughts is difficult biao et al 2018 therefore scholars from various countries have tried different methods to assess agricultural droughts liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 and in these methods drought indices were used for quantitative assessment the study of drought indices will help form a more timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with drought problems 1 drought assessment based on meteorological factors in drought assessment meteorological elements are often used to build drought indices which have both advantages and disadvantages among these the palmer drought index palmer 1965 has been widely used this index was based on the principle of water balance in which water deficit was calculated by considering precipitation and evaporation duan et al 2013 and climate suitable precipitation was introduced the drought assessment results based on this index were highly consistent with that of the actual situation yan et al 2016 therefore it was found suitable for the identification rhee and carbone 2007 zhao et al 2017 evaluation dai 2011 and prediction dai and zhao 2017 of agricultural drought however the two layer soil model used for calculating the water balance in the palmer index is too simple alley 1984 and cannot identify drought events at different time scales vicenteserrano et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 which limits its popularity and application while building the palmer index palmer developed the crop moisture index palmer 1968 which is the sum of the abnormal evapotranspiration index and humidity index this index is mainly used to monitor the impact of short term moisture conditions on growing crops hence it is not suitable for monitoring long term droughts to consider the impact of different time scales on drought assessment mckee et al 1993 proposed the standardized precipitation index spi which ignores the impact of water demand on quantified drought events vicenteserrano et al 2010 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei considers the impact of regional water demand on potential evapotranspiration however the calculated results based on this index were inconsistent with that of the actual records under water stress conditions zhang and he 2016 for this reason zhang et al 2015 proposed a standardized moisture anomaly index szi based on the calculation of the shortage value d the difference between the actual precipitation and the climate suitable precipitation in the palmer index and the normalization of spi compared with spei szi also considers the impact of runoff and soil water content on regional water demand which is more suitable for quantifying drought processes biao et al 2018 although this index can assess drought on multiple time scales it fails to consider the influence of different land surface conditions on the drought index 2 drought assessment based on soil moisture to consider the impact of land surface conditions on the agricultural drought index a large scale hydrological model was used as a tool and the calculated soil water content was used to build the agricultural drought index for example an et al 2017 used soil relative humidity as an indicator to quantify the severity of agricultural drought they analyzed the relationship between soil relative humidity index and disaster data and found that the index has good applicability the national agricultural drought grade china meteorological administration 2015 standard also recommended to use the soil relative humidity index to estimate agricultural drought levels however the drought level was determined using the same threshold of the soil relative humidity index for different regions which usually had different index thresholds owing to their underlying surface and climate using the same threshold to determine the drought level affects the accuracy of agricultural drought assessment therefore jaranilla sanchez et al 2011 used soil moisture deficit as an indicator to quantify the agricultural drought process pandey et al 2004 sawada et al 2014 wu et al 2012 simulated soil moisture based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 1996 built the soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi and studied the characteristics of large scale drought events in china wu et al 2013 2011 the above index takes the multi year average soil water content as the normal value quantifies the soil water content anomaly and constructs the drought index to quantify the extent of agricultural drought using the anomaly percentage however building a drought index from the sole perspective of soil water content cannot accurately measure the extent of agricultural drought because agricultural drought is caused by crop water deficit it is necessary to further consider the influence of crop water requirements to quantify crop water deficit and accurately assess the extent of agricultural drought sawada et al 2014 hence the relevant agricultural drought indices based on soil water content only indirectly reflect the characteristics of agricultural droughts 3 drought assessment based on crop water deficit the empirical estimation method uses the empirical relationship between precipitation or yield and water consumption to estimate crop water consumption and obtain an index reflecting the degree of water deficit based on the difference between water demand and consumption for example yin et al 2009 used the linear empirical relationship between crop yield and crop water consumption to estimate crop water demand and consumption and the crop water deficit was calculated based on the difference between crop water demand and consumption zhu 2013 used the empirical method of effective precipitation to estimate crop water consumption which was calculated based on penman s formula and the crop water deficit was estimated based on the difference between crop water demand and consumption jia et al 2018 analyzed the drought identification accuracy of crop water stress index cwsi which was used to quantify the crop water deficit based on an empirical estimation method and found that drought was poorly quantified using cwsi and several drought events were not identified owing to the significant error in crop water consumption overall the empirical estimation method is simple to use but the accuracy of the identified drought events based on this method needs to be improved li et al 2020 indicated that the model considering crop growth and vegetation response mechanism to the water stress is more suitable for agricultural drought assessment the crop model is an effective technical means to simulate crop growth and vegetation response mechanism it considers the effects of various interactions in the atmosphere crops and soil and can better simulate the agricultural drought process simulation of agricultural drought processes based on crop models is an important development direction for agricultural drought assessment however crop models are often used to simulate crop growth at the field scale and cannot simulate crop growth and water deficits at the macro scale to simulate the crop growth process at the macro scale soil moisture data must be input to the crop model remote sensing data products can be used to input soil moisture data on a large scale to the crop model the growth process of crops was simulated and the cwdi was calculated to assess agricultural drought zhang et al 2021c zhou et al 2022 however the time continuous soil moisture of the entire root layer of the crop cannot be retrieved through remote sensing although there is a lack of the time continuous soil moisture data in large areas these data can be supplemented by hydrological model simulations however crop growth processes are not included in the hydrological model wang et al 2012 introducing crop growth simulation into hydrological models will greatly improve the simulation accuracy of soil water content and crop growth processes and build a more reasonable agricultural drought index by describing the degree of water deficit providing a theoretical basis for agricultural drought assessment research to solve the problem in introducing crop growth into hydrological models for drought assessment this study coupled a crop model with a hydrological model to simulate crop water consumption and demand an agricultural drought index was proposed to identify large scale agricultural drought event and agricultural drought characteristics were evaluated under different underlying surface conditions in jiangsu province the research results will be of great significance for accurately assessing agricultural drought providing a scientific basis for comprehensively understanding the drought formation process and providing an important theoretical basis and technical support for formulating drought resistance and disaster reduction measures according to local conditions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area and data jiangsu province is located in the jianghuai region of eastern china and belongs to the east asian monsoon climate zone the annual average temperature is between 13 and 16 and the annual average precipitation is approximately 1000 mm it is composed of approximately 8000 river basins however the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in jiangsu province which is a typical region in china with frequent drought and flood disasters is uneven with obvious regional differences bao et al 2011 fig 1 shows that there is more rice area in the east and there is more wheat area in the north in recent years under the joint influence of global warming and human activities large scale high impact drought events have occurred frequently for example in 2011 jiangsu province suffered a severe drought and nanjing shijiu lake dried up and in 2016 the water area of hongze lake was continuously dry which caused a great inconvenience to water transportation in the lake area changzhou also suffered from continuous high temperatures and drought which seriously restricted the healthy development of local agriculture from mid september to december 2019 the average rainfall in jiangsu province was 91 mm which was 48 less than that in the same period of the year most regions of the province had moderate or severe meteorological droughts and the south of the huaihe river was severely dry jiangsu province is also one of the provinces with a high gross domestic product gdp ranking fourth in the total agricultural output value of 31 provinces in 2019 the frequent occurrence of drought in this province has seriously affected normal local agricultural production and has become an important factor restricting the economic and social development the vic epic model was built in jiangsu province to study the formation process of local agricultural drought the meteorological data used in the model were the 5 km and 6 h scale data obtained using inverse distance weight interpolation based on the daily dataset of china s surface climate data from the china meteorological data network ren et al 2020 crop spatial distribution data were obtained based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi enhanced vegetation index evi and land surface water index lswi data using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis remote sensing products and decision tree models as shown in fig 1 dem data were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr and kobrick 2000 with a resolution of 30 m the water area data were obtained from the 30 m resolution water area data product developed by the european commission joint research center pekel et al 2016 vegetation type data were obtained from the global 1 km land cover type database developed by the university of maryland parameters such as albedo minimum stomatal conductance roughness and monthly leaf area index of vegetation other than crops were obtained from the land surface data assimilation system pisek and chen 2007 wiegand et al 1979 and the leaf area index of crops was simulated using the epic model the soil parameters in the vic model were calculated according to the soil database reynolds et al 2000 and the saxton saxton et al 1986 soil characteristic parameter formula developed by reynolds et al the property parameters of different types of crops were derived from the crop parameter library of the swat soil water assessment tool model hydrologic model parameters were obtained by calibrating the measured hydrological data and parameter transfer lu et al 2013 mao 2017 wu et al 2007a 2007b 2 2 coupling of variable infiltration capacity environmental policy integrated climate model the vic model liang et al 1994 is a large scale semi distributed hydrological model that simulates hydrological processes including runoff generation infiltration and base flow based on the variable infiltration capacity curve and the arno model however the vic model cannot simulate the crop growth process it only uses a series of discrete numerical values to generalize the monthly change process of the crop leaf area and simulates the evapotranspiration for each month additionally the leaf area for a particular month does not change every year which leads to a systemic error in evapotranspiration simulated by the vic model lu et al 2015 tsarouchi et al 2014 meanwhile the evapotranspiration of agricultural land includes only canopy interception evaporation and plant transpiration without considering soil evaporation therefore in the growth period of crops with a low leaf area index soil evaporation is dominant in crop evapotranspiration and the simulated evapotranspiration would be smaller than the actual evapotranspiration to improve the calculation accuracy of evapotranspiration the crop model was coupled to the vic model and the dynamic leaf area index vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation were calculated simultaneously the epic model was selected as the crop model the epic model uses a unified approach to simulate more than 100 crop types and is widely used different crop types have different parameters such as planting date root growth and lai therefore different crop growth stages are simulated with different results rich data and documents are available for this model which requires little data and can easily be applied to large scale simulations the epic model uses temperature soil water and nutrient data to simulate potential evapotranspiration maximum crop transpiration actual crop transpiration actual soil evaporation plant height lai biomass root length and yield the simulation method is described by neitsch et al 2011 this model also simulates the effect of water stress on crop growth quantified by the ratio of actual to maximum plant transpiration neitsch et al 2011 the maximum plant transpiration namely the potential transpiration was calculated using equation 1 and the actual plant transpiration was influenced by the water stress coefficient k s based on the formula 2 1 λ e t δ h n e t g γ k 1 0 622 λ ρ a i r p e z o e z r a δ γ 1

hydrological model and proposed a parametric scheme for the impact of irrigation process on crop evapotranspiration to overcome the problem of irrigation impact not being considered in the coupled hydrological and crop growth models the variable infiltration capacity environmental policy integrated climate vic epic model was constructed zhang et al 2021a to integrate the advantages of the hydrological model to simulate soil water content and crop models to simulate crop evapotranspiration simultaneously the evapotranspiration module in the vic epic model was improved based on the water stress method recommended by the food and agriculture organization which laid the foundation for agricultural drought assessment the flow chart of the coupled vic epic model was shown in fig 2 2 3 large scale vic epic model construction incorporating reservoir and irrigation modules the method of building the vic epic model over a large area includes forcing data and parameter files of the vic model routing model crop module reservoir module and irrigation module 1 building the vic model the vic model in jiangsu province was constructed based on a 5 km merged grid for the forced data the inverse distance weight interpolation method was used to interpolate the meteorological station data for each merged grid for the parameter file the model parameters mao 2017 were determined based on the research of mao et al 2016 combined with the regional transfer formula of hydrological parameters lu et al 2013 wu et al 2007a 2007b owing to space limitations only the shape index b of the saturated storage capacity curve and the base flow parameter ds are displayed in fig 3 which shows that their spatial differences were large the soil type sand content and clay content were set based on the soil database developed by reynolds et al 2000 which was classified into 12 soil texture types the dominant soil type in the merged grid was considered to be the soil type of the merged grid the soil data were divided into upper and lower layers the soil at a depth of 0 30 cm was the upper layer and the soil at a depth of 30 100 cm was the lower layer the parameters of the first soil layer set by the vic model in this study were the upper soil layer values and those of the second and third soil layers were the lower soil layer values vegetation parameters were obtained from the global 1 km land cover type database and the land surface data assimilation system developed by the university of maryland pisek and chen 2007 wiegand et al 1979 these parameters included albedo minimum stomatal conductance roughness and the monthly leaf area index of vegetation except for crops the vic model uses the basin saturation capacity curve and water balance equation to calculate surface runoff and soil moisture based on the above vegetation and soil parameters and the arno model and hydrological parameters were used to calculate the base flow 2 building the routing model the flow direction determination method liu 2017 was used to divide jiangsu province and its basin into 8810 merged grids as shown in fig 4 based on the routing parameter transfer formulas in seven climate zones proposed by liu 2017 the routing response functions of the merged grids and their channels were generated based on the kinematic wave and diffusive wave equations the vic epic model calculated the flow process of the outlet section in each merged grid based on the merged grid response function then calculated the channel flow process based on the channel response function and finally obtained the flow data of all of the merged grids 3 constructing the crop model the crop module simulated the growth processes of crops under different rotation modes land use type data including crop types planted at different times and the planting proportion of different rotation modes in each merged grid were identified based on modis data and the decision tree model as the vic model also needs to input land use type data when the crop model is closely coupled to the vic model the land use data of the vic and crop models need to be unified to ensure that the data can be transferred between the vic and crop models currently the land use data of the vic model are only for corn which does not consider other crop types and crop rotation planting methods therefore this study addressed the lack of other crop types in the vic model and added several crop rotation types widely planted in jiangsu province to the vegetation database file according to the results of crop distribution recognition based on modis remote sensing data and the decision tree model eight crop rotation types were extracted maize rice wheat wheat maize wheat rice rapeseed rapeseed maize and rapeseed rice based on these crop rotation types the area proportion of different rotation types in each merged grid was calculated and the vegetation database files of the vic model and the vegetation parameter file of each merged grid were updated these eight crop rotations included rice crops and rice often needs to maintain a water depth during planting however the epic model does not consider the simulation variation of water depth in the paddy field according to the critical water depth requirements of paddy fields in different growth periods in the reference guo 1997 the study simulated the irrigation and drainage process of paddy fields in the vic epic model the input files of the crop module included the crop library file crop library txt crop soil parameter file crop soil txt crop rotation type file crop rotation type txt and paddy critical water depth file rice depth threshold txt the crop library file contained various parameters for each crop type such as the maximum leaf area index and leaf stomatal conductance these parameters were selected as default values in the swat model manual arnold et al 2012 crop soil parameters included the redistribution ratio of crop water absorption to the lower layer planting time of different crops on each merged grid and redistribution ratio parameters the parameters were determined using a test basin calibration the planting time was determined according to the ten day dataset of crop growth and farmland soil moisture in china wang 2015 crop rotation type parameters included the crop type number in the study area and the corresponding crop type number sequence of different crop rotation types which were determined based on the identification results of crop types at different times the paddy critical water depth file provides the maximum and minimum water depths that the paddy field needs to maintain at different growth stages as determined by reference guo 1997 the meteorological data input to the crop module was obtained from the forcing data of the vic model the crop model calculated the heat unit based on meteorological data estimated the leaf area and root depth of crops based on the heat unit and calculated the potential crop transpiration based on meteorological data and leaf area the actual crop transpiration rate was obtained according to the root depth soil moisture content and water stress formula the calculation process is described in detail in neitsch et al 2011 zhang et al 2021a 4 reservoir module building the reservoir module requires the aggregate reservoir capacity data for each merged grid currently there is no published database of aggregate reservoir capacity in this study the water area in each merged grid was calculated based on the water area data pekel et al 2016 developed by the european commission joint research center and the maximum volume of the surface water body corresponding to the maximum water area of each water body was calculated based on formula 3 neitsch et al 2011 the aggregate reservoir capacity of each merged grid was obtained by summing up the maximum volume of the surface water body in each merged grid the water area and capacity of the aggregate reservoirs were incorporated into the input file for the reservoir module according to the water balance eq 4 the storage capacity of the aggregate reservoir was simulated time by time 3 v c sa β sa 1 expsa 4 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep i a where sa is the water area hm2 β sa and expsa are the calculation parameters which were obtained by fitting the storage capacity and area data of some reservoirs in jiangsu province v is the volume of water stored in the reservoir at the end of the period m3 v stored is the volume of water stored in the reservoir at the beginning of the period m3 v flowin is the volume of water entering the reservoir during the period m3 v flowout is the volume of water flowing out of the reservoir during the period m3 v pcp is the precipitation volume during the period m3 v evap is the evaporation of the reservoir during the period m3 and v seep is the water lost from the reservoir by seepage during the period m3 5 building the irrigation module the irrigation module requires effective irrigation area rate parameters for each merged grid the effective irrigation area rate was calculated based on the effective irrigation area and cultivated land area in the jiangsu statistical yearbook tang 1985 2019 combined with the distribution data of the crop and river grids the irrigation parameters and effective irrigation area rate of each merged grid can be calculated according to the method in a previous study zhang et al 2021a based on which the input file was made the threshold value of soil water content triggering irrigation was transferred from the results of the test basin zhang et al 2021b and the irrigation interval was taken as 5 d etchanchu et al 2019 when the soil water content was lower than the set threshold the irrigation module was induced for irrigation simulation and the irrigation water demand was calculated based on the difference between field water capacity wu et al 2018a and current soil water content the actual irrigation water was calculated by combining the effective irrigation area rate with eq 5 5 i a α i r e α i r e v v α i r e v where i a is the actual irrigation water mm i r is the irrigation water demand mm v is the water stored in the water body mm α is the effective irrigation rate and e is the irrigation efficiency 2 4 building of crop water anomaly percentage index based on the agricultural drought definition water deficit in crops caused by external environmental factors china meteorological administration 2015 a drought index that reflects the degree of crop water deficit was constructed the crop water stress index jackson et al 1981 has been proposed by researchers to reflect the degree of water shortage but this index is a drought index calculated based on the sum of crop water consumption and soil evaporation which would be affected by surface soil evaporation and this effect is greater during the seedling stage of crops therefore it cannot directly reflect the degree of drought in crops pablos et al 2017 tang and li 2017 yang et al 2018 to improve the evaluation accuracy of agricultural drought crop water demand and water consumption zhang et al 2021b which do not consider soil evaporation were used to measure the degree of crop water shortage first the crop water anomaly index cwai jackson et al 1981 was constructed 6 c w a i j e a c t j e s o i l a c t j e j e s o i l j 1 100 e t a c t j e t j 1 100 where cwai j is the crop water anomaly index of the j th time unit the time unit is one day e act j is the actual evapotranspiration of the j th time unit mm e soil act j is the actual soil evaporation of the j th time unit mm e j is the potential evapotranspiration of the j th time unit mm e soil j is the soil potential evaporation of the j th time unit mm e t act j is the actual crop transpiration of the j th time unit that is crop water consumption mm and e t j is the maximum crop transpiration of the j th time unit that is crop water demand mm owing to different evapotranspiration in different seasons climatic regions and crop types it is difficult for the crop water anomaly index to express the water deficit degree of each region in a unified standard therefore the crop water anomaly percentage index cwapi was built based on formula 7 to evaluate agricultural drought china meteorological administration 2015 this index integrates the construction of crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 and the crop water deficit abnormal index cwdia china meteorological administration 2015 to realize the complementary advantages of directly reflecting the degree of crop water deficit from cwsi and considering the impact of early water deficit from cwdia 7 c w a p i c w a i i c w a i 100 c w a i 100 where cwapi is the crop water anomaly percentage index in a period cwai i is the weighted average crop water anomaly index in the i th period as shown in formula 8 and c w a i is the average crop water anomaly index value on the same days of each year of the calculated period taking 30 years as shown in formula 9 8 cwai i k 1 cwai j k 2 cwai j 1 k 50 cwai j 49 where cwai i is the weighted average crop water anomaly index of the i th period cwai j is the crop water anomaly index of the j th time unit taken as 1 d calculated based on equation 6 and k i is the weight coefficient of the crop water anomaly index of each time unit which was selected with reference to agricultural drought grade china meteorological administration 2015 because there is a fallow period for crop growth there is no cwai j value for some periods 9 c w a i 1 n m 1 n c w a i m where n is the total number of years generally over 30 years and m is the serial number of each year m 1 2 n to formulate a reasonable drought classification standard the frequency distribution of cwapi in the study area was calculated by referring to the research ideas of wu et al 2011 mao 2017 and palmer 1965 based on this frequency distribution and the occurrence frequency of different drought levels in the studies by mao 2017 and wu et al 2011 the drought levels of cwapi were divided as shown in table 1 to consider the impact of different crop growth periods on the determination of agricultural drought levels the drought levels of the critical crop water demand period and other growth periods were assigned respectively in table 1 by referring to the treatment method of drought level classification standard in agricultural drought grade china meteorological administration 2015 for the critical crop water demand period the critical period for crop water demand refers to the growing period when crops are more sensitive to water if the water is not sufficient during this growing period crop yield would be greatly affected therefore the cwapi of the critical crop water demand period was slightly larger than that of the other growth periods at the same level the potential evapotranspiration e t and actual evapotranspiration e t act data obtained from the simulation calculation of the vic epic model were combined with the cwapi formula to calculate the daily cwapi and agricultural drought level of the 5 km merged grid in jiangsu province as there are corresponding cwapis for different crop rotation types in the merged grid to simplify the presentation of diagrams and improve the readability of diagrams the cwapi corresponding to the crop with the largest planting proportion in the merged grid was selected to represent the cwapi of the merged grid and the corresponding soil drought index was compared in this study the smapi was selected as the soil drought index the smapi often uses the soil water content calculated by the vic model mao et al 2016 wu et al 2011 because the vic model failed to simulate irrigation and crop growth processes and the output soil water content was the average soil water content of all land use types the smapi based on vic was not affected by crop growth and irrigation the smapi based on the vic epic model was affected by irrigation however because the regional average soil moisture was affected by the soil moisture of land use types other than cultivated land the impact of irrigation on the regional average soil moisture was limited therefore the impact of irrigation on smapi that was simulated based on the vic epic model was limited huang et al 2020 the smapi dryness and wetness grading table table 2 recommended by lu et al 2021 was used in this study because smapi is proportional to the soil water content the smaller the smapi the smaller the soil water content and the more severe the drought in this study the drought identified by the cwapi was called crop drought the smaller the cwapi value the more severe is the drought 2 5 regional drought event identification method according to the scope of drought events drought event recognition methods include merged grid drought event recognition and regional drought event recognition the drought event in the merged grid is a drought event occurring in a single merged grid and the characteristics of the drought event can be described by the duration intensity and severity of drought when the drought events of a single merged grid gradually expanded into drought events of multiple merged grids that met certain requirements they could be identified as regional drought events the characteristics of regional drought events can be described by drought duration intensity severity and area the characteristic values of drought events for different indices have different definitions 1 the characteristic values of drought events in the merged grid of smapi were defined as follows the duration of drought based on smapi was defined as the duration of the consecutive days when the smapi value was under 5 60 d were taken as the threshold of drought duration to identify a merged grid drought event the average smapi value of a drought event is the drought intensity based on smapi the drought severity based on smapi is the product of drought intensity and drought duration as shown in eq 10 two consecutive drought events with an interval of no more than 10 d would be merged into one drought wu et al 2018b 10 s r d where s is drought severity r is drought intensity and d is drought duration 2 the characteristic values of drought events in the merged grid of cwapi were defined as follows during the drought events based on smapi the duration of drought events based on cwapi takes the number of consecutive days in which cwapi in the critical period of crop water demand was less than the drought threshold of 5 and cwapi in other periods was less than the drought threshold of 10 the average cwapi value in the duration of drought events based on cwapi is the drought intensity based on cwapi and the drought severity based on cwapi is the product of drought intensity and drought duration based on cwapi see eq 10 3 the regional drought event characteristic values of smapi were defined as follows the drought area based on smapi was defined as the percentage of merged grids with smapi values under 5 in the region the drought intensity based on smapi is the average value of merged grids with smapi values under 5 in the region the duration of drought based on smapi is the duration of regional daily drought area over 30 the regional drought severity based on smapi is the product of regional drought intensity and drought duration 60 d were taken as the threshold of drought duration to identify a regional drought event 4 the characteristic values of regional drought events of cwapi were defined as follows the drought area ratio based on cwapi was defined as the percentage of merged grids with cwapi in the critical period of crop water demand less than the drought threshold of 5 and cwapi in other periods less than the drought threshold of 10 the drought intensity based on cwapi is the average value of the cwapi of the merged grids where cwapi in the critical crop water demand period is less than the drought threshold of 5 and cwapi in other periods is less than the drought threshold of 10 the duration of drought based on cwapi is the duration when the regional daily drought area ratio based on cwapi is over 30 and the regional drought severity based on cwapi is the product of regional drought intensity and drought duration see eq 10 3 results 3 1 comparative analysis of evapotranspiration to validate the simulation results of the vic epic model the evapotranspiration data which has a greater impact on the cwapi were selected for comparison the et product of modis from 2001 to 2017 running et al 2017 was compared with the simulated evapotranspiration results of the vic epic model in the corresponding period the error index was calculated based on formulas 11 14 and fig 5 was obtained 11 p b i a s t 1 t f t y t t 1 t y t 100 12 n r m s e 1 t t 1 t f t y t 2 100 y 13 r t 1 t f t f y t y t 1 t f t f 2 t 1 t y t y 2 14 r m s e 1 t t 1 t f t y t 2 where f t is the simulated value of the model at time t t 1 2 t y t is the observed value at time t f is the average value of the simulated value of the model at all time y is the average value of the observed value at all time fig 6 shows that the correlation coefficients of evapotranspiration in 37 of the merged grid were above 0 74 the average nrmse and rmse were 56 and 88 which were lower than that of marek et al 2016 fig 5 a shows that these merged grids with high correlation coefficients were mainly located in the south and northwest of jiangsu province while the correlation coefficient of evapotranspiration in the central part of jiangsu province was low and the correlation coefficient of some merged grid was lower than 0 60 most of the central part of jiangsu province belonged to the plain river network area where artificial and natural rivers were crisscrossed human activities such as irrigation and water transfer had a great impact on evapotranspiration the vic epic model did not consider the impact of water transfer on evapotranspiration and the elevations of the central part were very similar which affected the simulation accuracy of the water flow direction and the water storage of the merged grids the uncertainty of the water storage would further affect the simulation accuracy of evapotranspiration by affecting the simulation accuracy of irrigation therefore the simulated evapotranspiration in jiangsu province generally has a good correlation with modis et but factors such as human activities lead to a low correlation between the simulated evapotranspiration and modis et in the plain river network area fig 5 shows that the spatial distribution of errors reflected by different error indices was not completely consistent among them b d show that the southern error was larger while a shows that the southern error was smaller this difference existed because of different error metrics the correlation coefficient describes the consistency of the changes in the two columns of data while pbias rmse and nrmse reflect the average absolute deviation of the data at the same time therefore the variation trend of simulated evapotranspiration and satellite retrieved evapotranspiration in southern jiangsu province were consistent but the absolute value of the difference was large the satellite data itself has large systematic errors and random errors and its absolute numerical precision is not high but the relative change information is more accurate hence the spatial distribution of errors displayed by the correlation coefficient is more reasonable 3 2 validation based on the drought record to validate the simulated agricultural drought in jiangsu province two drought indices smapi and cwapi and their drought levels were calculated from 1985 to 2017 for all of the merged grids because the water absorbed by crop roots comes from the soil at a depth of 0 40 cm jiang 2013 wang 2017 you jie et al 2014 the default soil water content used in the smapi index constructed in this study was the average soil water content at a depth of 0 40 cm for all land use types calculated by the vic epic model mao et al 2016 wu et al 2011 the light drought area rate corresponding to each year s drought index in jiangsu province was calculated and compared with the drought affected area rate recorded in yearbooks jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 fig 7 shows that the average correlation coefficient between the simulated drought area rate based on the cwapi and the statistical drought affected area rate was slightly larger than the average correlation coefficient between the simulated drought area rate based on the smapi and the statistical value a better simulation effect was observed for the calculated area rate of light drought based on cwapi whereas the simulation results of the two drought indices were close in the calculated area rates of moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought the statistical drought affected area refers to the area where crop water deficit occurs and the drought grade of crops in the drought affected area is the closest to the light drought grade as a result the correlation coefficient between the simulated light drought area rates and the drought affected area rates can be considered an important indicator of the simulation accuracy of the drought index in the correlation coefficient cc between light drought area rates and statistical drought area rates the cc of cwapi is higher than that of smapi therefore cwapi drought simulation accuracy is higher than that of smapi water storage in light and moderate droughts often meets the water requirements of crop irrigation but water storage in extreme droughts is often insufficient to meet crop irrigation water requirements as a result the impact of irrigation on light and moderate drought was greater than that on extreme drought while cwapi considered the impact of irrigation on agricultural drought smapi was affected by the soil water content of non cropland use types that were not affected by irrigation and was less affected by irrigation therefore compared to smapi the simulated area rates of light and moderate droughts based on cwapi were more reasonable when considering the effects of crop growth irrigation and water demand 3 3 analysis of drought characteristics of large scale drought events to analyze and explain the distribution law of agricultural drought characteristics in jiangsu province the smapi and cwapi drought events were identified for all merged grids from 1985 to 2017 and the average values of drought duration intensity and severity of each drought event in all merged grids were calculated as shown in fig 8 fig 10 the soil drought characteristics in this study were consistent with the average soil drought intensity and drought severity distribution law of mao et al 2016 in terms of drought duration fig 8 the average soil drought duration in the north of jiangsu province was greater than that in the south while the crop drought duration distribution was more complex in the north region of the yangtze river in jiangsu province the average crop drought duration of crops in the west was greater than that in the east and in the south region of the yangtze river in jiangsu province the average drought duration of crops in the east was greater than that in the west in general the crop drought duration was shorter than that of soil drought and the spatial distribution law of crop and soil drought duration was also different in terms of drought intensity fig 9 the average soil drought intensity in the north of jiangsu province was relatively high and there was also a relatively high average soil drought intensity in the local areas of southern jiangsu province the distribution law of average crop drought intensity in jiangsu province was very similar to that of average crop drought duration that is the northern distribution law was high in the west and low in the east while the southern distribution law was high in the east and low in the west distinct differences existed in the distributions of crop and soil drought intensities the spatial distribution of drought severity fig 10 was consistent with that of drought intensity 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of causes of drought characteristics in jiangsu province the difference between the distribution maps of the characteristic values of soil drought and crop drought indicates that the factors influencing soil drought and crop drought are different the spatial differences in soil drought characteristic values are related to climate and soil attribute parameter differences and the difference in soil attribute parameters has a greater influence on the difference in soil drought characteristic values mao et al 2016 among the soil attribute parameters hydraulic conductivity and field capacity are two important parameters when the soil hydraulic conductivity is high and the field capacity is small the soil water holding capacity declines resulting in low soil water content in the region due to quick infiltration which is more likely to cause soil drought fig 11 shows that sandy loam was distributed in taizhou nantong xuzhou huai an and lianyungang cities which led to higher soil hydraulic conductivity fig 12 higher water permeability lower field capacity fig 13 and lower water holding capacity in these areas as a result these areas were frequently affected by lower soil water content and soil drought was more likely to occur in these areas which is depicted by the three dark red areas in fig 10 a these three dark red areas correspond to taizhou nantong xuzhou huai an and lianyungang cities according to the average drought area rate data of the cities in jiangsu province from 2009 to 2019 jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 fig 14 xuzhou huai an and lianyungang belong to the regions with large average drought area rates whereas taizhou and nantong belong to the regions with small average drought area rates hence smapi can be used to explain the frequent occurrence of drought in xuzhou and huai an through soil types but cannot explain why drought rarely occurs in taizhou and nantong the distribution map of crop drought severity in fig 10 b shows that the dark red areas with higher absolute values of crop drought intensity are mainly distributed in xuzhou lianyungang and suqian cities which correspond to the three cities with higher average drought area rates in jiangsu province whereas there are no dark red areas in taizhou and nantong cities with higher absolute soil drought intensity values taizhou and nantong belong to the regions with small average drought area rates jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 fig 14 and the spatial distribution characteristics of agricultural drought calculated by the cwapi were more reasonable this is because the density of river network in taizhou and nantong is high see fig 4 and the irrigation area rate is high wu et al 2020 also found a significant relationship between irrigated and drought affected areas on the other hand taizhou and nantong are closer to the southern jiangsu province than xuzhou and suqian the precipitation in taizhou and nantong is sufficient the river water is more abundant and the water storage per unit area is larger hence the irrigation water per unit area can be increased to decrease the probability of drought omer et al 2020 and leng et al 2017 also found that an increase in irrigation water would reduce drought severity and duration and decrease the effect of water stress on crops ciais et al 2005 huang et al 2020 also found that in areas with more irrigation the evaluation performance of some drought indices that did not consider irrigation was worse to verify the difference in irrigation water volume per unit area in regions with high soil drought intensity xuzhou and taizhou were selected as examples according to the agricultural water consumption data in jiangsu water conservancy yearbook jiangsu provincial water resources department 1989 2020 and the sown area data in the statistical yearbook fan 2010 2020 liu and cai 2010 2020 in the recent 10 years the irrigation water volumes per unit area in xuzhou and taizhou were 0 29 m3 m2 and 0 37 m3 m2 respectively indicating that the large irrigation water volume per unit area led to a small average drought area rate in taizhou in 2013 the drought affected area in taizhou reached a maximum in nearly 10 years and the agricultural water consumption in that year also reached a minimum indicating that agricultural irrigation is an important factor affecting drought in taizhou therefore the cwapi can be used to explain why drought often occurs in xuzhou and huai an based on soil types but it can also be used to explain considering irrigation area and water volume why taizhou and nantong do not often suffer from drought wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 it can be seen that the distribution law of the soil drought characteristic value reflects the distribution law of soil hydraulic conductivity and is affected by precipitation and temperature crop growth is also affected by the above factors but greatly affected by human beings who would build water conservation projects and carry out agricultural irrigation activities according to local conditions to avoid agricultural drought as much as possible as a result crop drought characteristics are not only affected by meteorological conditions and soil type distribution but also by human irrigation water area crop water demand crop critical growth period and other factors wang et al 2019 also indicated that artificial irrigation and crop factors are the reasons for the difference and rationality of the crop drought index compared to other drought indices hence wu et al 2020 pointed out that as human activities could reduce natural drought conditions crop drought is less than soil drought qin et al 2015 yang et al 2018 5 conclusions this study takes jiangsu province as a study area simulates crop water demand based on the vic epic model applies the cwapi index to carry out large scale agricultural drought event identification and drought characteristics research discusses the spatial characteristics of agricultural drought reveals the influence of soil water deficit and crop water deficit on agricultural drought formation under different underlying surface conditions in jiangsu province and draws the following conclusions 1 a vic epic model was constructed in jiangsu province and the simulation results of the vic epic model and the evaluation results of cwapi drought index were verified the average correlation coefficients between the simulated evapotranspiration of simulation and observed evapotranspiration in the 37 merged grids were above 0 74 the validation results based on the actual drought records showed that the correlation coefficient 0 79 of the statistical values and cwapi simulated values of drought area rates was greater than that of smapi 0 72 indicating that the simulation results of vic epic model in jiangsu province were highly reasonable 2 the spatial distribution of the drought characteristics of large scale drought events in jiangsu province was analyzed in terms of soil drought characteristics the average soil drought duration intensity and severity in the north of jiangsu province were greater than those in the south the average soil drought intensity and drought severity distribution law were consistent with the results obtained by mao et al 2016 in terms of crop drought characteristics in the north drought characteristics were higher in the west and lower in the east while in the south drought characteristics were higher in the east and lower in the west the duration of crop drought was generally shorter than that of soil drought 3 the effects of soil and crop water deficits on the formation of agricultural drought characteristics under different underlying surface conditions in jiangsu province were revealed according to the distribution law of the characteristic values of agricultural drought events in jiangsu province it was found that the absolute value of average drought characteristics based on smapi was larger in regions with higher hydraulic conductivity and the calculation results in some regions were inconsistent with the actual record cwapi was affected by the irrigation process and regional water volume hence the spatial distribution characteristics of agricultural drought duration intensity and severity in jiangsu province were more reasonable this shows that agricultural drought was not only caused by rapid soil water infiltration and low water content which led to water stress effects on crops but also by insufficient irrigation water due to insufficient local water storage in this study the crop drought index was used to evaluate agricultural drought and results were more reasonable than those of the soil drought index the extent of influence of water stress on the yield of different crops during different growth periods is a very important indicator if the water stress index can be directly converted into the corresponding yield reduction the yield reduction as an agricultural drought index will have a clearer physical significance directly reflecting the impact of drought on agricultural production which will have an important guiding significance in drought mitigation and food security hence a drought index that can directly reflect crop yield loss will be developed declaration of competing interest

8966,site specific irrigation decisions require information about variations in soil moisture within the active rooting depth of the crop producers have been using soil moisture sensors to make irrigation decisions and soil moisture sensors have been shown to help reduce water usage without reducing yields there are still unanswered questions on improving efficiency with soil moisture sensors based on density and location of sensors within a field this three year study used sensors to evaluate the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture across an 18 ha production field in a corn soybean rotation a 55 m by 55 m grid was laid on the field resulting in 44 sampling points that fell either underneath the center pivot irrigation or the end gun at each point location two watermark granular matrix sensors were installed at depths of 31 and 61 cm for 2018 and 2020 and an additional 76 cm sensor in 2019 analysis of soil samples collected in year one revealed fairly homogeneous soils across the field with silty clay loam as the major soil type and only eight percent silt loam plant height and leaf area index lai were measured weekly at each of the 44 sampling points inverse distance weighted idw interpolation methods were used to predict soil water tension swt values for locations between known points and aid in sensor density and placement within the field linear regression was used to model the relationship of lai and plant height with soil matric potential to find surrogate methods for predicting swt the idw results show that when uniform irrigation applications are made to the field fewer sensors that are placed in better locations throughout the field can be as useful as a densely gridded array of sensors results showed that while not strong plant height had a better relationship to swt than lai keywords soil water tension irrigation variability lai geospatial soil moisture sensors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when used effectively soil moisture sensors can reduce water use and energy costs while maintaining yields in irrigated fields therefore sensors also increase producers profitability lo et al 2020b however soil moisture is variable over space and time especially in layered soils and often makes timing irrigation events difficult for producers soulis and elmaloglou 2018 some producers apply irrigation because their neighbor is irrigating at that time others look at the soil or crop or feel the moisture in the soil with soil moisture sensors farmers can obtain a quantitative measurement of soil moisture and gain a better understanding of soil moisture through the root zone of the crop there has been considerable research using different methods and sensor technologies to measure both volumetric soil moisture and soil water tension swt but many studies focused only on the upper depths of the soil profile or have a limited number of measurements throughout the growing season barker et al 2017 baroni et al 2013 jabro et al 2020 lo et al 2016 lo et al 2020a lo et al 2020b wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 to estimate crop water use for the purpose of irrigation scheduling it is important to measure soil moisture through the active rooting zone of the crop da silva et al 2018 there are many variables that can affect soil moisture such as vegetative factors soil texture and topography huang et al 2016 yetbarek ojha 2020 these variables may be used as a surrogate to help estimate soil moisture variability throughout a field barker et al 2017 mapped elevation deviation from mean elevation dev and apparent electrical conductivity ec a to predict sensor mean relative difference mrd with inconsistent results and found that no spatial variable or set of spatial variables predicted mrd consistently baroni et al 2013 monitored soil moisture on a grid and found that spatial variability in both soil texture and vegetation impacted soil water variability however spatial variability of soil texture was more impactful in wet conditions and vegetation had a greater impact in drier conditions wang et al 2015 also found that vegetation has a greater impact on soil water under dry conditions suo et al 2018 investigated factors affecting in field and regional soil moisture and found that lai was one of the most important vegetation factors when trying to predict soil moisture content as lai increased soil moisture content generally decreased landrum et al 2015 found that using a high resolution data set of ec a increased the ability to predict soil moisture over using sparse direct soil moisture observations alone they recommend combining data from different sources such as ec a lidar soil testing and farmers knowledge to set a foundation suitable for mapping spatial distributions and delineating management zones placement of sensors within a field and within the soil profile varies depending on the irrigation system used soulis et al 2015 regardless of the method of application questions remain on the appropriate density and placement of sensors within a given field especially under center pivot systems instructions from one manufacturer recommend placing sensors at four to five locations down the length of the pivot adding more at higher or lower production areas of the field along with the general suggestion of installing a sensing station every four to six hectares installation and operating instructions watermark soil moisture meter 2019 however researchers from the university of georgia created the smart sensor array vellidis et al 2008 which used multiple sensor sets spread throughout a field under pivot irrigation a sensor array was used to monitor soil water tension in fields split into management zones based on soil survey maps topography aerial photographs and visual inspection of the fields vellidis et al 2013 there were no more than 10 sensor sets in fields with an average size of 80 ha with at least one set in each management zone the goal was to have three sensor sets in each management zone for the next season of the study results from the swt graphs proved there was high variability within each field the variation in recommendations for sensor placement and density demonstrate a need to better understand the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture and particularly rooting zone soil moisture throughout a field this will advance the development of irrigation management zones to mitigate variability and apply water only to areas of the field where and when it is needed therefore the overall goal of this study is to improve guidelines for sensor density and placement within a field for irrigation scheduling the specific objectives are to 1 measure the range of in field spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in the active rooting zone of the crop using granular matrix sensors and 2 evaluate the correlation of root zone soil moisture to soil texture elevation and crop vegetative characteristics plant height and lai 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area fig 1 is a production agriculture field in brooksville mississippi which is in the blackland prairie region located in the east central area of the state usda n d the blackland prairie region is in northwest alabama and northeast mississippi the topography of this region consists of rolling hills with elevations ranging from 15 to 30 m above sea level the total land area of the blackland prairie in these two states is 1 65 million hectares with 53 in alabama and 47 7760 km2 in mississippi usda n d this region accounts for 14 of mississippi s total cropland feng et al 2018 the soil in this region is very conducive to growing crops and cropland makes up 16 of the land use usda n d the counties that make up the blackland prairie in mississippi account for 10 of mississippi s combined soybean corn and cotton production cropland in this region has historically been rainfed because of the price of pumping deep ground water but more producers have begun irrigating over the past several years to reduce risk and increase yields many producers have invested in on farm water storage ofws systems to provide a water source for irrigation in this part of the state with hilly topography rainfall runoff gravity feeds into the storage pond and ponds can be constructed to the necessary size in a natural low spot tagert et al 2018 over 90 of irrigation water is pumped from ofws systems in the blackland prairie feng et al 2016 producers who use surface water for irrigation and have a finite amount of water available for a growing season must use best management practices bmps to conserve water while irrigating to ensure they have ample water to last through the growing season granular matrix soil moisture sensors are a relatively inexpensive bmp that can measure swt as a proxy for soil moisture to ensure irrigation timing matches crop water needs the study field was an 18 ha field irrigated by a center pivot system with three spans totaling approximately 174 m in length plus a 20 meter overhang with an end gun at the end of the lateral the primary crops grown were corn and soybeans which are rotated annually the source of water for irrigation is an ofws pond built in 2012 the soil type in the field was predominantly brooksville silty clay 91 8 with 8 2 catalpa silty clay on the northwest portion of the field near a ditch that is occasionally flooded soil survey staff et al n d additional information about the site can be found in karki et al 2018 irrigated soybean variety trials were also conducted in the field in 2018 and 2020 fig 1 when harvesting the variety trials researchers harvested the middle two rows of each individual plot and the farmer harvested the remaining rows when he harvested the field collection of weather data began on may 11 2018 from a campbell scientific weather station that was used by the msu extension service for soybean variety trials a watchdog 2900 et weather station was placed in the northeastern corner of the field outside of the field boundary beginning november of 2019 and this weather station was used for collection of weather data for the remainder of the study period until september 12 2020 if there were any missing data between those two weather stations a weather station at the black belt experiment station just 4 8 km away was used to fill in the missing data the field was farmed and managed by the producer and the authors had access to the field to install and uninstall sensors and data loggers and collect weekly field data throughout each growing season all management decisions were made by the producer table 1 2 2 data collection a 55 55 meter grid was applied to the field resulting in 44 grid point locations under the pivot or end gun range at each grid point watermark 200ss granular matrix gm sensors were placed in the row with the plants at 31 cm and 61 cm depths for 2018 and 2020 with an additional 76 cm sensor in 2019 and connected to a watermark 900 m data logger set to log hourly measurements gm sensors use electrical resistance units to measure swt which is a critical index of water availability to plants irmak and haman 2013 the sensors relay electrical resistance based on the amount of water in the porous material inside the sensor to the data logger where it is converted into swt kpa swt has an inverse relationship with soil moisture meaning the higher the swt the lower the soil moisture and the drier the soil and vice versa gm sensors have limitations responding in coarse textured soils and when soil water content is at high levels but they have been successfully used for practical irrigation scheduling in row crop production in the mid south us to decrease irrigation water use irmak and haman 2013 marković et al 2016 spencer et al 2019 gm sensors were used for this study because they are relatively inexpensive have been around long enough to be tested and proven effective and are being increasingly used to develop irrigation scheduling recommendations in row crop production eldredge et al 1993 shock et al 1998 shock et al 2016 thomson et al 2002 thomson and armstrong 1987 although soil moisture release curves were developed for the two soil types in the field to convert swt values to soil water content those results are discussed in a companion paper because irrigation scheduling was not the focus of this study hodges et al 2022 sensors were installed early in the growing season when the plant was roughly 15 cm tall in the center of the row between plants and care was taken to avoid any skips in the row soil moisture was adequate for germination each year from the amount of rainfall that came a week before and after planting 8 mm in 2018 and 64 mm in 2019 except in 2020 the producer irrigated 10 mm on may 11 2020 to get an even stand because there had only been 7 mm of precipitation and no rain was in the forecast installation holes were drilled with a power auger equipped with a 22 mm bit when installing sensors the manufacturer s instructions were followed for pre conditioning through installation installation and operating instructions watermark soil moisture meter 2019 ensuring the sensors were grouted into the soil with good soil to sensor contact leaf area index lai and plant height were measured at each grid point almost weekly throughout each growing season in 2018 and the first three measurement dates in 2019 a li cor lai 2000 li cor inc lincoln ne plant canopy analyzer was used to measure lai it was replaced with a newer model li cor lai 2200 c li cor inc lincoln ne plant canopy analyzer on july 12 2019 there were eight collection days in 2018 on june 26 july 6 12 18 and 25 and august 2 9 and 17 in 2019 field measurements were recorded on 12 days as follows may 16 23 and 31 june 12 19 and 26 july 3 10 19 24 and 31 and august 7 in 2020 field measurements were recorded on 10 days june 4 11 17 and 30 july 15 23 and 31 and august 6 14 and 24 the lai measurements were taken early in the morning in diffuse light without direct sunlight to the lens and in accordance with the li cor instruction manual 2016 and a 270 lens cap was used to block the user from the sight of the lens when conducting lai measurements one reading above the canopy was recorded and four readings were measured below the canopy to get a spatial average along and across the row at the same time lai measurements were collected a tape measure was used to take three measurements for plant height around each grid point and the average value was recorded on days when field measurements were taken swt data was also downloaded from each datalogger using an irrometer data shuttle irrometer company inc riverside ca and growth stage of the crop was recorded the daily depth weighted average was recorded by averaging the hourly swt measurements for each sensor over a 24 hour span however during the earlier vegetative stages of the crop the active root zone might not yet reach beyond the sensor depth of 31 cm in this case the crop would not be using water in the lower part of the soil profile and the sensors installed at 61 or 76 cm would not be responding therefore the sensor readings at these depths should not be included in the weighted average when the daily average readings for each sensor reached 10 kpa the readings would be factored into the average based on the percentage of the active root zone the sensor represented soil samples were pulled on september 20 2018 to analyze soil texture three to four 61 cm soil cores were pulled around each grid point in the field using an ams soil probe ams inc american falls id and mixed to form a composite sample these 44 composite samples were subsequently analyzed at the mississippi state university soil lab using the hydrometer method gee g w bauder j w 1986 the producer recorded yield data and provided the data in shapefile format raw yield data were obtained for each growing season from the john deere greenstar yield monitor deere and company moline il yield data were imported into the usda arc yield editor 2 0 software which cleaned the data by removing abnormalities and points that were logged while navigating turn rows 2 3 geospatial analysis maps were created in arcmap to assess the variability in swt using the inverse distance weighted method idw which is an exact deterministic local interpolation method used to predict values at locations that were not measured the idw method with a default power of two was selected over other more robust geostatistical methods due to the relatively small sample size 44 points and the even distribution of sampling points over the field oliver and webster 2014 meng et al 2013 webster and oliver 1992 the predicted values fall inside the range of the minimum and maximum known values idw is considered a deterministic method because a formula is used to calculate the values based on weighted averages given to surrounding locations the weights are calculated by using the inverse distance from the predicted location to the known location and more weight is given to locations closer to one another meng et al 2013 for each growing season six dates were chosen to assess the variability in swt over the field of the six dates three were wet days and three were dry days for 2018 the dry days were june 26 july 1 and july 29 and the wet days were june 27 july 3 and july 31 in 2019 the dry days were june 17 july 1 and july 17 and the wet days were june 20 july 2 and july 30 in 2020 the dry days were june 24 july 24 and august 8 and the wet days were june 26 july 26 and august 10 dry days were chosen as the day with the highest average swt for the field immediately before an irrigation or rainfall event and wet days were chosen as the day closest to the end of an irrigation or rainfall event that had the lowest average swt over the field on the three wet days and three dry days for each growing season the predictions of the idw interpolations were compared to measured swt data the interpolated values were compared to measured swt based on the root mean square error rmse of the interpolation runs 1 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n where pi is predicted value oi is observed value n is number of observed values and o i is mean of observed values 2 4 sampling schemes first five of the 44 grid point locations were eliminated from the data set because they were outside of the pivot only received water from the pivot end gun and were thus not uniformly irrigated fig 2 this resulted in a full sensor grid of 39 point locations that were considered in the analysis next seven sensor sampling schemes were assessed by comparing the average daily swt readings for each sensor set in the full sensor grid to the interpolated values predicted by the different sensor schemes for the aforementioned wet and dry days each growing season six of the schemes included subsets of the original 39 sensor points and were evenly spaced or gridded sampling points that resulted in 25 18 12 9 5 and 4 point locations which are referenced as scheme s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 respectively for the seventh scheme s7 a digital elevation model dem was obtained for the field from the mississippi automated resource information system maris website maris n d and the raster data in the original dem fig 2 was used to develop elevation based management zones raster elevations were grouped into four classes based on the natural breaks jenks method baz et al 2009 in arcmap and four point locations from the original grid were selected from these management zones fig 3 the selection of the point location in each of the four elevation based management zones was mostly subjective but the chosen point in the dark blue zone is just north of the center pivot start point before it traverses clockwise the location in the light blue zone is near the end of the irrigation cycle the point in the red zone is halfway through the cycle and the point in the yellow zone is approximately 75 through the irrigation cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variability in figs 4 5 and 6 the daily root zone average swt for each of the 44 point locations is shown for every day sensors were installed these data are represented by the lines in the graph and show the patterns of the daily depth weighted average swt for each sensor location in the field for each of the three growing seasons the horizontal black line across the charts represents the recommended irrigation triggers for sprinkler irrigation applications during the prime reproductive growth stages of both crops which is roughly 60 kpa for corn and 65 kpa for soybeans krutz and roach 2016 in 2018 the weighted average of both depths was taken beginning june 15 once the soybean roots reached the 61 cm sensor and readings rose above 10 kpa in 2019 the same approach was used and a weighted average of sensors was calculated when the corn roots reached the 61 and 76 cm sensors and readings rose above 10 kpa which occurred during the first week of june in 2020 using the same approach readings did not rise above 10 kpa for the 61 cm sensor depth until approximately july 20 total daily water received from precipitation and irrigation events are also shown figs 4 5 and 6 show that swt is more variable within the field on dry days than on wet days which agrees with previous studies barker et al 2017 baroni et al 2013 lo et al 2020 it is evident that the variation in swt decreases after rain or irrigation events and increases as the field dries out in 2018 there was less early season rainfall than in 2019 and 2020 three weeks from sensor installation the field had received a total of 36 98 and 110 mm for the 2018 2019 and 2020 season respectively also in 2018 tension readings on the 61 cm sensors began to increase and soil moisture decrease earlier in the growing season only two weeks from when sensors were installed june 14 and the soybean crop had reached the r2 growth stage it appears that in 2018 the active root zone extended deeper into the profile to reach soil with more available water as a result weighted averages of the sensor readings began earlier in the 2018 growing season conversely there was considerable rainfall early in the growing season in both 2019 and 2020 which resulted in slower root growth of the corn and soybean crop respectively in 2019 measurements for the deeper sensors did begin to increase until a month after being installed june 4 6 when the corn plant was at the tasseling stage in 2020 the deeper sensor measurements did not increase until a month and a half after being installed july 20 when the soybeans had reached the r4 growth stage figs 7 8 and 9 show the minimum and maximum daily root zone average swt along with the range to represent the variability the range in the sensor readings also increases as the swt increases and decreases as the swt decreases for each season the large amounts of rainfall in 2019 and 2020 are evident in figs 8 and 9 with a low swt reading of 0 5 kpa at the beginning of the growing season and at three to four additional times throughout the growing season in 2018 the swt only decreases to 0 kpa for one day at a time excluding the one time it stays relatively low below 20 kpa between july 16 and july 23 2018 3 2 spatial variability the soil texture analysis showed mostly homogenous soils with 39 of the 44 locations classified as a silty clay loam soil texture and the other five classified as a silt loam the range in percent clay was 25 32 5 although there are two different soil textures in the field the soil texture triangle shows the similarity of the soils fig 10 3 3 relationship of soil water tension to crop vegetative characteristics scatter plots were created to evaluate the relationship between soil water tension and other variables such as plant height and lai to investigate the possibility of using them as surrogates to estimate soil moisture results for the three growing seasons are shown in figs 11 12 and 13 although relationships were not strong plant height related to swt more than lai for all three years the r2 for plant height vs swt in 2018 2019 and 2020 was 0 221 0 3122 and 0 408 respectively also the r2 for lai vs swt in 2018 2019 and 2020 was 0 0629 0 1909 and 0 346 respectively the same regression analysis was also performed only for the days that lai and plant height were measured each season based on whether those days were classified as dry or wet a day was considered dry when swt was 40kpa and wet when swt measured 40 kpa the r2 values for 2018 2019 and 2020 for plant height and swt were 0 003 for wet and 0 005 for dry days 0 488 for wet and 0 0002 for dry days and 0 207 for wet and 0 011 for dry days respectively in addition the r2 values for 2018 2019 and 2020 for lai and swt are as follows 0 096 for wet and 0 062 for dry days 0 471 for wet and 0 009 for dry days and 0 276 for wet and 0 045 for dry days respectively there were higher r2 values for wet days when comparing plant height with swt and also lai with swt over all three years except in 2018 for plant height and swt we also averaged swt data over seven days leading up to the day of lai and plant height measurements and evaluated the relationship of the seven day average swt to both plant height and lai those r2 values were comparable to the r2 values obtained when using the one day averages in 2018 the data show that there is a negative relationship between swt and plant height and swt and lai but in 2019 and 2020 the data show a positive relationship for both this could be because of the rainfall timing in the three different growing seasons during the 2018 growing season the field received a 19 mm irrigation application on july 13 followed by a 23 mm rainfall event on july 15 another rainfall event of 31 mm occurred just four days later on july 19 there were 73 mm of water added to the soil profile over a 7 day period causing swt readings to decrease during the same time peak lai and plant height were recorded and this likely caused the inverse relationship during the 2019 and 2020 seasons the lowest values 0 30 kpa for swt occurred during the early weeks following installation from early season rainfall swt values never drop that low again because there were no instances where the producer irrigated that close to multiple large rainfall events 3 4 cross validation results the results for the cross validation of the interpolations are shown in table 2 3 and 4 for each growing season when comparing a dry day before and a wet day after an irrigation or rainfall event e g 2018 july 1 versus july 3 dry vs wet the highlighted cells indicate the day wet or dry that had the lower rmse value this was repeated for every set of wet and dry days and for every sampling scheme as expected in all three growing seasons the lower rmse values occurred more often on days that were considered wet in 2018 the lower rmse values occurred 15 times on wet days and only 6 times on dry days in 2019 13 times out of 21 comparisons rmse was lower on wet days and in 2020 there were 16 of 21 comparisons with lower rmse values on wet days also the average rmse generally decreased as the number of sensor sets increased for all three years as expected for average rmse the elevation zone scheme s7 performed better two out of three years than the four equally spaced sensor scheme this suggests that even with the same number of sensors in a field better placement can improve results in the 25 scheme where only nine sensors are used on a grid three were missing data during the 2020 season for july 24 and july 26 so only six sensors were used for the predictions also these same three points were missing data for august 8 and 10 2020 so they were excluded from the 100 scheme with all 39 sensor locations for those days short periods of missing data occurred because a battery died unexpectedly or the data logger simply quit logging and had to be reset visits were made to the field each week to collect field data so no period of missing data lasted more than one week this occurred sporadically during all three seasons but more often in 2020 causing some data to be lost the sensor schemes can be seen in fig 14 and the schemes with missing data 100 coverage and the 25 scheme are shown in fig 15 with the locations missing data represented with an x fig 16 shows the idw results of a dry date before an irrigation event in 2018 for all sampling schemes the daily depth weighted averages for june 26 were used to make the idw interpolations the swt classes were grouped with the irrigation thresholds in mind sensor readings under 40 kpa are considered to have adequate soil moisture swt values in the range of 41 60 kpa are approaching the recommended irrigation threshold and swt readings in the range of 61 70 kpa are at the recommended irrigation threshold for center pivot irrigation systems swt values over 70 kpa indicate the field needs to be irrigated as soon as possible henry et al 2018 unless a producer has the ability to apply precision irrigation an irrigation decision for any given field is usually made based on the soil moisture for the majority of the field it is important to keep this in mind when determining the number of sensors needed in a field in fig 16 the decision to irrigate on june 26 2018 would be supported by each of the management schemes s1 s7 the same irrigation decision could be made with only one set of sensors present in the field as long as this sensor set was not located in the low spot in the northwestern corner of the field fig 17 shows 2018 2019 and 2020 yield recorded by our cooperating producer in addition the average yield for each grid cell was calculated by averaging all of the yield points inside each cell the yield for each cell was then compared to the season long average swt at that point by finding pearson s correlation coefficient r for each season 2018 0 24 2019 0 04 and 2020 0 05 the variety trials are evident 2018 and 2020 on the east side of the field where low yields were recorded because part of the variety trials were harvested by mississippi state university also in 2020 the yield monitor malfunctioned and had to be recalibrated in the northern section of the field this resulted in missing data that caused the interpolation results to look different than the rest of the field in 2018 the low elevation spot in the field on the west side also had a negative impact on yield in 2019 the yield was negatively impacted in the southwest portion of the field by a gully that was formed early in the season heavy rainfall occurred close to the planting date and washed away a lot of the seed that later had to be replanted fig 18 shows the progression patterns of the swt across the field as the soil dries for all three growing seasons each set of images shows four consecutive days prior to an irrigation event with the fourth day falling immediately before the irrigation event all three years show a similar pattern of a wet spot on the west side of the field that correlates to the low elevation on the dem the western side of the field that is lower in elevation dried out slower than the rest of the field also there is an area in the east central part of the field that dried out slower as well while the middle of the field generally dried out faster the overall drying pattern generally holds true for all three years 4 conclusions the results analyzing the relationship of lai and plant height to measured swt show that vegetative variables are not good predictors of temporal variability in swt primarily because plant height cannot decrease when swt decreases when there are high amounts of rainfall and irrigation during the peak lai and plant height there is a negative relationship between swt and plant height and swt and lai although the relationships still have similar absolute values future work should include the evaluation of lai and plant height spatial patterns to the spatial distribution of swt even with a homogenous soil type there is considerable variability in swt throughout the field there are many factors that influence soil moisture and swt variability including non uniform crop growth irrigation system and topography the variability in the study field could also be due in part to variation in soils by depth within each grid cell while soil cores for textural analysis were taken to a depth of 61 cm textural analysis was not done at individual depth specific layers in addition swt was measured to a depth of 76 cm in 2019 when corn was grown the primary source of variability in the study field can likely be attributed to the topography of the field and the six meter difference in elevation over the field causing water to move to the low lying areas even when evaluating swt through the crop s active rooting zone swt variability is highest when the soil is driest as others have also found barker et al 2017 baroni et al 2013 lo et al 2020 although there is variability in swt between the measured point locations each set of sensors responded to all irrigation and rainfall events that were more than 5 mm there was also a similar pattern of drying as the field dried out each time with the western side of the field that is lower in elevation drying out slower than the rest of the field the east central part of the field dried out more slowly while the middle of the field generally dried out faster possibly due to elevation differences when comparing the sampling schemes the density of the sensors is not as important as the placement of sensors within the field if uniform irrigation applications are made in this field with uniform irrigation applications the elevation management zone would be the best scheme to use because it combines established recommendations of using soil moisture sensors with center pivots such as placing one at the beginning and end of the cycle and considers the differences in elevation of the 18 days the sensor schemes were compared over the three years of the study the elevation based scheme s7 had a lower rmse than other schemes as follows s6 on seven days s5 on five days s4 for four days and s3 for two days for these instances where the elevation based scheme s7 had a lower rmse than the same or greater number of sensors evenly spaced throughout the field nine were on dry days and nine were on wet days this demonstrates that the spatial placement of sensors can be more critical than the density of sensors in a field the elevation scheme performs better than the gridded scheme with only four sensor sets in terms of predicting the swt over the whole field and if it is used the same irrigation decision would be made as with the full sensor grid producers using uniform irrigation should not assume that one sensor location is sufficient especially in heterogenous fields whether using uniform irrigation applications or moving to vri applications producers should take advantage of publicly available data such as soil type and evaluate changes in elevation from topographic maps or dems by using these free resources producers can improve spatial placement of sensors within the field with minimal effort if variable rate irrigation vri is desired careful attention should be given to the primary factors that affect soil moisture since the general drying pattern holds true for the field all three growing seasons the producer could combine the swt data with soil elevation and yield data to develop management zones for vri applications after three seasons of data collection with two of the three being soybean crops and one being a corn crop there does not seem to be much of a difference in spatial swt patterns of water usage between the two crops but future data collection is planned to better capture those differences and similarities at 18 ha the field evaluated in this study was relatively small which demonstrates that smaller fields can have spatial variability in swt throughout the growing season evaluation of a larger area or additional days during each growing season might have resulted in greater differences in the elevation based sensor scheme s7 and the other schemes s1 s6 future work includes evaluation of larger

8966,site specific irrigation decisions require information about variations in soil moisture within the active rooting depth of the crop producers have been using soil moisture sensors to make irrigation decisions and soil moisture sensors have been shown to help reduce water usage without reducing yields there are still unanswered questions on improving efficiency with soil moisture sensors based on density and location of sensors within a field this three year study used sensors to evaluate the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture across an 18 ha production field in a corn soybean rotation a 55 m by 55 m grid was laid on the field resulting in 44 sampling points that fell either underneath the center pivot irrigation or the end gun at each point location two watermark granular matrix sensors were installed at depths of 31 and 61 cm for 2018 and 2020 and an additional 76 cm sensor in 2019 analysis of soil samples collected in year one revealed fairly homogeneous soils across the field with silty clay loam as the major soil type and only eight percent silt loam plant height and leaf area index lai were measured weekly at each of the 44 sampling points inverse distance weighted idw interpolation methods were used to predict soil water tension swt values for locations between known points and aid in sensor density and placement within the field linear regression was used to model the relationship of lai and plant height with soil matric potential to find surrogate methods for predicting swt the idw results show that when uniform irrigation applications are made to the field fewer sensors that are placed in better locations throughout the field can be as useful as a densely gridded array of sensors results showed that while not strong plant height had a better relationship to swt than lai keywords soil water tension irrigation variability lai geospatial soil moisture sensors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when used effectively soil moisture sensors can reduce water use and energy costs while maintaining yields in irrigated fields therefore sensors also increase producers profitability lo et al 2020b however soil moisture is variable over space and time especially in layered soils and often makes timing irrigation events difficult for producers soulis and elmaloglou 2018 some producers apply irrigation because their neighbor is irrigating at that time others look at the soil or crop or feel the moisture in the soil with soil moisture sensors farmers can obtain a quantitative measurement of soil moisture and gain a better understanding of soil moisture through the root zone of the crop there has been considerable research using different methods and sensor technologies to measure both volumetric soil moisture and soil water tension swt but many studies focused only on the upper depths of the soil profile or have a limited number of measurements throughout the growing season barker et al 2017 baroni et al 2013 jabro et al 2020 lo et al 2016 lo et al 2020a lo et al 2020b wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 to estimate crop water use for the purpose of irrigation scheduling it is important to measure soil moisture through the active rooting zone of the crop da silva et al 2018 there are many variables that can affect soil moisture such as vegetative factors soil texture and topography huang et al 2016 yetbarek ojha 2020 these variables may be used as a surrogate to help estimate soil moisture variability throughout a field barker et al 2017 mapped elevation deviation from mean elevation dev and apparent electrical conductivity ec a to predict sensor mean relative difference mrd with inconsistent results and found that no spatial variable or set of spatial variables predicted mrd consistently baroni et al 2013 monitored soil moisture on a grid and found that spatial variability in both soil texture and vegetation impacted soil water variability however spatial variability of soil texture was more impactful in wet conditions and vegetation had a greater impact in drier conditions wang et al 2015 also found that vegetation has a greater impact on soil water under dry conditions suo et al 2018 investigated factors affecting in field and regional soil moisture and found that lai was one of the most important vegetation factors when trying to predict soil moisture content as lai increased soil moisture content generally decreased landrum et al 2015 found that using a high resolution data set of ec a increased the ability to predict soil moisture over using sparse direct soil moisture observations alone they recommend combining data from different sources such as ec a lidar soil testing and farmers knowledge to set a foundation suitable for mapping spatial distributions and delineating management zones placement of sensors within a field and within the soil profile varies depending on the irrigation system used soulis et al 2015 regardless of the method of application questions remain on the appropriate density and placement of sensors within a given field especially under center pivot systems instructions from one manufacturer recommend placing sensors at four to five locations down the length of the pivot adding more at higher or lower production areas of the field along with the general suggestion of installing a sensing station every four to six hectares installation and operating instructions watermark soil moisture meter 2019 however researchers from the university of georgia created the smart sensor array vellidis et al 2008 which used multiple sensor sets spread throughout a field under pivot irrigation a sensor array was used to monitor soil water tension in fields split into management zones based on soil survey maps topography aerial photographs and visual inspection of the fields vellidis et al 2013 there were no more than 10 sensor sets in fields with an average size of 80 ha with at least one set in each management zone the goal was to have three sensor sets in each management zone for the next season of the study results from the swt graphs proved there was high variability within each field the variation in recommendations for sensor placement and density demonstrate a need to better understand the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture and particularly rooting zone soil moisture throughout a field this will advance the development of irrigation management zones to mitigate variability and apply water only to areas of the field where and when it is needed therefore the overall goal of this study is to improve guidelines for sensor density and placement within a field for irrigation scheduling the specific objectives are to 1 measure the range of in field spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in the active rooting zone of the crop using granular matrix sensors and 2 evaluate the correlation of root zone soil moisture to soil texture elevation and crop vegetative characteristics plant height and lai 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area fig 1 is a production agriculture field in brooksville mississippi which is in the blackland prairie region located in the east central area of the state usda n d the blackland prairie region is in northwest alabama and northeast mississippi the topography of this region consists of rolling hills with elevations ranging from 15 to 30 m above sea level the total land area of the blackland prairie in these two states is 1 65 million hectares with 53 in alabama and 47 7760 km2 in mississippi usda n d this region accounts for 14 of mississippi s total cropland feng et al 2018 the soil in this region is very conducive to growing crops and cropland makes up 16 of the land use usda n d the counties that make up the blackland prairie in mississippi account for 10 of mississippi s combined soybean corn and cotton production cropland in this region has historically been rainfed because of the price of pumping deep ground water but more producers have begun irrigating over the past several years to reduce risk and increase yields many producers have invested in on farm water storage ofws systems to provide a water source for irrigation in this part of the state with hilly topography rainfall runoff gravity feeds into the storage pond and ponds can be constructed to the necessary size in a natural low spot tagert et al 2018 over 90 of irrigation water is pumped from ofws systems in the blackland prairie feng et al 2016 producers who use surface water for irrigation and have a finite amount of water available for a growing season must use best management practices bmps to conserve water while irrigating to ensure they have ample water to last through the growing season granular matrix soil moisture sensors are a relatively inexpensive bmp that can measure swt as a proxy for soil moisture to ensure irrigation timing matches crop water needs the study field was an 18 ha field irrigated by a center pivot system with three spans totaling approximately 174 m in length plus a 20 meter overhang with an end gun at the end of the lateral the primary crops grown were corn and soybeans which are rotated annually the source of water for irrigation is an ofws pond built in 2012 the soil type in the field was predominantly brooksville silty clay 91 8 with 8 2 catalpa silty clay on the northwest portion of the field near a ditch that is occasionally flooded soil survey staff et al n d additional information about the site can be found in karki et al 2018 irrigated soybean variety trials were also conducted in the field in 2018 and 2020 fig 1 when harvesting the variety trials researchers harvested the middle two rows of each individual plot and the farmer harvested the remaining rows when he harvested the field collection of weather data began on may 11 2018 from a campbell scientific weather station that was used by the msu extension service for soybean variety trials a watchdog 2900 et weather station was placed in the northeastern corner of the field outside of the field boundary beginning november of 2019 and this weather station was used for collection of weather data for the remainder of the study period until september 12 2020 if there were any missing data between those two weather stations a weather station at the black belt experiment station just 4 8 km away was used to fill in the missing data the field was farmed and managed by the producer and the authors had access to the field to install and uninstall sensors and data loggers and collect weekly field data throughout each growing season all management decisions were made by the producer table 1 2 2 data collection a 55 55 meter grid was applied to the field resulting in 44 grid point locations under the pivot or end gun range at each grid point watermark 200ss granular matrix gm sensors were placed in the row with the plants at 31 cm and 61 cm depths for 2018 and 2020 with an additional 76 cm sensor in 2019 and connected to a watermark 900 m data logger set to log hourly measurements gm sensors use electrical resistance units to measure swt which is a critical index of water availability to plants irmak and haman 2013 the sensors relay electrical resistance based on the amount of water in the porous material inside the sensor to the data logger where it is converted into swt kpa swt has an inverse relationship with soil moisture meaning the higher the swt the lower the soil moisture and the drier the soil and vice versa gm sensors have limitations responding in coarse textured soils and when soil water content is at high levels but they have been successfully used for practical irrigation scheduling in row crop production in the mid south us to decrease irrigation water use irmak and haman 2013 marković et al 2016 spencer et al 2019 gm sensors were used for this study because they are relatively inexpensive have been around long enough to be tested and proven effective and are being increasingly used to develop irrigation scheduling recommendations in row crop production eldredge et al 1993 shock et al 1998 shock et al 2016 thomson et al 2002 thomson and armstrong 1987 although soil moisture release curves were developed for the two soil types in the field to convert swt values to soil water content those results are discussed in a companion paper because irrigation scheduling was not the focus of this study hodges et al 2022 sensors were installed early in the growing season when the plant was roughly 15 cm tall in the center of the row between plants and care was taken to avoid any skips in the row soil moisture was adequate for germination each year from the amount of rainfall that came a week before and after planting 8 mm in 2018 and 64 mm in 2019 except in 2020 the producer irrigated 10 mm on may 11 2020 to get an even stand because there had only been 7 mm of precipitation and no rain was in the forecast installation holes were drilled with a power auger equipped with a 22 mm bit when installing sensors the manufacturer s instructions were followed for pre conditioning through installation installation and operating instructions watermark soil moisture meter 2019 ensuring the sensors were grouted into the soil with good soil to sensor contact leaf area index lai and plant height were measured at each grid point almost weekly throughout each growing season in 2018 and the first three measurement dates in 2019 a li cor lai 2000 li cor inc lincoln ne plant canopy analyzer was used to measure lai it was replaced with a newer model li cor lai 2200 c li cor inc lincoln ne plant canopy analyzer on july 12 2019 there were eight collection days in 2018 on june 26 july 6 12 18 and 25 and august 2 9 and 17 in 2019 field measurements were recorded on 12 days as follows may 16 23 and 31 june 12 19 and 26 july 3 10 19 24 and 31 and august 7 in 2020 field measurements were recorded on 10 days june 4 11 17 and 30 july 15 23 and 31 and august 6 14 and 24 the lai measurements were taken early in the morning in diffuse light without direct sunlight to the lens and in accordance with the li cor instruction manual 2016 and a 270 lens cap was used to block the user from the sight of the lens when conducting lai measurements one reading above the canopy was recorded and four readings were measured below the canopy to get a spatial average along and across the row at the same time lai measurements were collected a tape measure was used to take three measurements for plant height around each grid point and the average value was recorded on days when field measurements were taken swt data was also downloaded from each datalogger using an irrometer data shuttle irrometer company inc riverside ca and growth stage of the crop was recorded the daily depth weighted average was recorded by averaging the hourly swt measurements for each sensor over a 24 hour span however during the earlier vegetative stages of the crop the active root zone might not yet reach beyond the sensor depth of 31 cm in this case the crop would not be using water in the lower part of the soil profile and the sensors installed at 61 or 76 cm would not be responding therefore the sensor readings at these depths should not be included in the weighted average when the daily average readings for each sensor reached 10 kpa the readings would be factored into the average based on the percentage of the active root zone the sensor represented soil samples were pulled on september 20 2018 to analyze soil texture three to four 61 cm soil cores were pulled around each grid point in the field using an ams soil probe ams inc american falls id and mixed to form a composite sample these 44 composite samples were subsequently analyzed at the mississippi state university soil lab using the hydrometer method gee g w bauder j w 1986 the producer recorded yield data and provided the data in shapefile format raw yield data were obtained for each growing season from the john deere greenstar yield monitor deere and company moline il yield data were imported into the usda arc yield editor 2 0 software which cleaned the data by removing abnormalities and points that were logged while navigating turn rows 2 3 geospatial analysis maps were created in arcmap to assess the variability in swt using the inverse distance weighted method idw which is an exact deterministic local interpolation method used to predict values at locations that were not measured the idw method with a default power of two was selected over other more robust geostatistical methods due to the relatively small sample size 44 points and the even distribution of sampling points over the field oliver and webster 2014 meng et al 2013 webster and oliver 1992 the predicted values fall inside the range of the minimum and maximum known values idw is considered a deterministic method because a formula is used to calculate the values based on weighted averages given to surrounding locations the weights are calculated by using the inverse distance from the predicted location to the known location and more weight is given to locations closer to one another meng et al 2013 for each growing season six dates were chosen to assess the variability in swt over the field of the six dates three were wet days and three were dry days for 2018 the dry days were june 26 july 1 and july 29 and the wet days were june 27 july 3 and july 31 in 2019 the dry days were june 17 july 1 and july 17 and the wet days were june 20 july 2 and july 30 in 2020 the dry days were june 24 july 24 and august 8 and the wet days were june 26 july 26 and august 10 dry days were chosen as the day with the highest average swt for the field immediately before an irrigation or rainfall event and wet days were chosen as the day closest to the end of an irrigation or rainfall event that had the lowest average swt over the field on the three wet days and three dry days for each growing season the predictions of the idw interpolations were compared to measured swt data the interpolated values were compared to measured swt based on the root mean square error rmse of the interpolation runs 1 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n where pi is predicted value oi is observed value n is number of observed values and o i is mean of observed values 2 4 sampling schemes first five of the 44 grid point locations were eliminated from the data set because they were outside of the pivot only received water from the pivot end gun and were thus not uniformly irrigated fig 2 this resulted in a full sensor grid of 39 point locations that were considered in the analysis next seven sensor sampling schemes were assessed by comparing the average daily swt readings for each sensor set in the full sensor grid to the interpolated values predicted by the different sensor schemes for the aforementioned wet and dry days each growing season six of the schemes included subsets of the original 39 sensor points and were evenly spaced or gridded sampling points that resulted in 25 18 12 9 5 and 4 point locations which are referenced as scheme s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 respectively for the seventh scheme s7 a digital elevation model dem was obtained for the field from the mississippi automated resource information system maris website maris n d and the raster data in the original dem fig 2 was used to develop elevation based management zones raster elevations were grouped into four classes based on the natural breaks jenks method baz et al 2009 in arcmap and four point locations from the original grid were selected from these management zones fig 3 the selection of the point location in each of the four elevation based management zones was mostly subjective but the chosen point in the dark blue zone is just north of the center pivot start point before it traverses clockwise the location in the light blue zone is near the end of the irrigation cycle the point in the red zone is halfway through the cycle and the point in the yellow zone is approximately 75 through the irrigation cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variability in figs 4 5 and 6 the daily root zone average swt for each of the 44 point locations is shown for every day sensors were installed these data are represented by the lines in the graph and show the patterns of the daily depth weighted average swt for each sensor location in the field for each of the three growing seasons the horizontal black line across the charts represents the recommended irrigation triggers for sprinkler irrigation applications during the prime reproductive growth stages of both crops which is roughly 60 kpa for corn and 65 kpa for soybeans krutz and roach 2016 in 2018 the weighted average of both depths was taken beginning june 15 once the soybean roots reached the 61 cm sensor and readings rose above 10 kpa in 2019 the same approach was used and a weighted average of sensors was calculated when the corn roots reached the 61 and 76 cm sensors and readings rose above 10 kpa which occurred during the first week of june in 2020 using the same approach readings did not rise above 10 kpa for the 61 cm sensor depth until approximately july 20 total daily water received from precipitation and irrigation events are also shown figs 4 5 and 6 show that swt is more variable within the field on dry days than on wet days which agrees with previous studies barker et al 2017 baroni et al 2013 lo et al 2020 it is evident that the variation in swt decreases after rain or irrigation events and increases as the field dries out in 2018 there was less early season rainfall than in 2019 and 2020 three weeks from sensor installation the field had received a total of 36 98 and 110 mm for the 2018 2019 and 2020 season respectively also in 2018 tension readings on the 61 cm sensors began to increase and soil moisture decrease earlier in the growing season only two weeks from when sensors were installed june 14 and the soybean crop had reached the r2 growth stage it appears that in 2018 the active root zone extended deeper into the profile to reach soil with more available water as a result weighted averages of the sensor readings began earlier in the 2018 growing season conversely there was considerable rainfall early in the growing season in both 2019 and 2020 which resulted in slower root growth of the corn and soybean crop respectively in 2019 measurements for the deeper sensors did begin to increase until a month after being installed june 4 6 when the corn plant was at the tasseling stage in 2020 the deeper sensor measurements did not increase until a month and a half after being installed july 20 when the soybeans had reached the r4 growth stage figs 7 8 and 9 show the minimum and maximum daily root zone average swt along with the range to represent the variability the range in the sensor readings also increases as the swt increases and decreases as the swt decreases for each season the large amounts of rainfall in 2019 and 2020 are evident in figs 8 and 9 with a low swt reading of 0 5 kpa at the beginning of the growing season and at three to four additional times throughout the growing season in 2018 the swt only decreases to 0 kpa for one day at a time excluding the one time it stays relatively low below 20 kpa between july 16 and july 23 2018 3 2 spatial variability the soil texture analysis showed mostly homogenous soils with 39 of the 44 locations classified as a silty clay loam soil texture and the other five classified as a silt loam the range in percent clay was 25 32 5 although there are two different soil textures in the field the soil texture triangle shows the similarity of the soils fig 10 3 3 relationship of soil water tension to crop vegetative characteristics scatter plots were created to evaluate the relationship between soil water tension and other variables such as plant height and lai to investigate the possibility of using them as surrogates to estimate soil moisture results for the three growing seasons are shown in figs 11 12 and 13 although relationships were not strong plant height related to swt more than lai for all three years the r2 for plant height vs swt in 2018 2019 and 2020 was 0 221 0 3122 and 0 408 respectively also the r2 for lai vs swt in 2018 2019 and 2020 was 0 0629 0 1909 and 0 346 respectively the same regression analysis was also performed only for the days that lai and plant height were measured each season based on whether those days were classified as dry or wet a day was considered dry when swt was 40kpa and wet when swt measured 40 kpa the r2 values for 2018 2019 and 2020 for plant height and swt were 0 003 for wet and 0 005 for dry days 0 488 for wet and 0 0002 for dry days and 0 207 for wet and 0 011 for dry days respectively in addition the r2 values for 2018 2019 and 2020 for lai and swt are as follows 0 096 for wet and 0 062 for dry days 0 471 for wet and 0 009 for dry days and 0 276 for wet and 0 045 for dry days respectively there were higher r2 values for wet days when comparing plant height with swt and also lai with swt over all three years except in 2018 for plant height and swt we also averaged swt data over seven days leading up to the day of lai and plant height measurements and evaluated the relationship of the seven day average swt to both plant height and lai those r2 values were comparable to the r2 values obtained when using the one day averages in 2018 the data show that there is a negative relationship between swt and plant height and swt and lai but in 2019 and 2020 the data show a positive relationship for both this could be because of the rainfall timing in the three different growing seasons during the 2018 growing season the field received a 19 mm irrigation application on july 13 followed by a 23 mm rainfall event on july 15 another rainfall event of 31 mm occurred just four days later on july 19 there were 73 mm of water added to the soil profile over a 7 day period causing swt readings to decrease during the same time peak lai and plant height were recorded and this likely caused the inverse relationship during the 2019 and 2020 seasons the lowest values 0 30 kpa for swt occurred during the early weeks following installation from early season rainfall swt values never drop that low again because there were no instances where the producer irrigated that close to multiple large rainfall events 3 4 cross validation results the results for the cross validation of the interpolations are shown in table 2 3 and 4 for each growing season when comparing a dry day before and a wet day after an irrigation or rainfall event e g 2018 july 1 versus july 3 dry vs wet the highlighted cells indicate the day wet or dry that had the lower rmse value this was repeated for every set of wet and dry days and for every sampling scheme as expected in all three growing seasons the lower rmse values occurred more often on days that were considered wet in 2018 the lower rmse values occurred 15 times on wet days and only 6 times on dry days in 2019 13 times out of 21 comparisons rmse was lower on wet days and in 2020 there were 16 of 21 comparisons with lower rmse values on wet days also the average rmse generally decreased as the number of sensor sets increased for all three years as expected for average rmse the elevation zone scheme s7 performed better two out of three years than the four equally spaced sensor scheme this suggests that even with the same number of sensors in a field better placement can improve results in the 25 scheme where only nine sensors are used on a grid three were missing data during the 2020 season for july 24 and july 26 so only six sensors were used for the predictions also these same three points were missing data for august 8 and 10 2020 so they were excluded from the 100 scheme with all 39 sensor locations for those days short periods of missing data occurred because a battery died unexpectedly or the data logger simply quit logging and had to be reset visits were made to the field each week to collect field data so no period of missing data lasted more than one week this occurred sporadically during all three seasons but more often in 2020 causing some data to be lost the sensor schemes can be seen in fig 14 and the schemes with missing data 100 coverage and the 25 scheme are shown in fig 15 with the locations missing data represented with an x fig 16 shows the idw results of a dry date before an irrigation event in 2018 for all sampling schemes the daily depth weighted averages for june 26 were used to make the idw interpolations the swt classes were grouped with the irrigation thresholds in mind sensor readings under 40 kpa are considered to have adequate soil moisture swt values in the range of 41 60 kpa are approaching the recommended irrigation threshold and swt readings in the range of 61 70 kpa are at the recommended irrigation threshold for center pivot irrigation systems swt values over 70 kpa indicate the field needs to be irrigated as soon as possible henry et al 2018 unless a producer has the ability to apply precision irrigation an irrigation decision for any given field is usually made based on the soil moisture for the majority of the field it is important to keep this in mind when determining the number of sensors needed in a field in fig 16 the decision to irrigate on june 26 2018 would be supported by each of the management schemes s1 s7 the same irrigation decision could be made with only one set of sensors present in the field as long as this sensor set was not located in the low spot in the northwestern corner of the field fig 17 shows 2018 2019 and 2020 yield recorded by our cooperating producer in addition the average yield for each grid cell was calculated by averaging all of the yield points inside each cell the yield for each cell was then compared to the season long average swt at that point by finding pearson s correlation coefficient r for each season 2018 0 24 2019 0 04 and 2020 0 05 the variety trials are evident 2018 and 2020 on the east side of the field where low yields were recorded because part of the variety trials were harvested by mississippi state university also in 2020 the yield monitor malfunctioned and had to be recalibrated in the northern section of the field this resulted in missing data that caused the interpolation results to look different than the rest of the field in 2018 the low elevation spot in the field on the west side also had a negative impact on yield in 2019 the yield was negatively impacted in the southwest portion of the field by a gully that was formed early in the season heavy rainfall occurred close to the planting date and washed away a lot of the seed that later had to be replanted fig 18 shows the progression patterns of the swt across the field as the soil dries for all three growing seasons each set of images shows four consecutive days prior to an irrigation event with the fourth day falling immediately before the irrigation event all three years show a similar pattern of a wet spot on the west side of the field that correlates to the low elevation on the dem the western side of the field that is lower in elevation dried out slower than the rest of the field also there is an area in the east central part of the field that dried out slower as well while the middle of the field generally dried out faster the overall drying pattern generally holds true for all three years 4 conclusions the results analyzing the relationship of lai and plant height to measured swt show that vegetative variables are not good predictors of temporal variability in swt primarily because plant height cannot decrease when swt decreases when there are high amounts of rainfall and irrigation during the peak lai and plant height there is a negative relationship between swt and plant height and swt and lai although the relationships still have similar absolute values future work should include the evaluation of lai and plant height spatial patterns to the spatial distribution of swt even with a homogenous soil type there is considerable variability in swt throughout the field there are many factors that influence soil moisture and swt variability including non uniform crop growth irrigation system and topography the variability in the study field could also be due in part to variation in soils by depth within each grid cell while soil cores for textural analysis were taken to a depth of 61 cm textural analysis was not done at individual depth specific layers in addition swt was measured to a depth of 76 cm in 2019 when corn was grown the primary source of variability in the study field can likely be attributed to the topography of the field and the six meter difference in elevation over the field causing water to move to the low lying areas even when evaluating swt through the crop s active rooting zone swt variability is highest when the soil is driest as others have also found barker et al 2017 baroni et al 2013 lo et al 2020 although there is variability in swt between the measured point locations each set of sensors responded to all irrigation and rainfall events that were more than 5 mm there was also a similar pattern of drying as the field dried out each time with the western side of the field that is lower in elevation drying out slower than the rest of the field the east central part of the field dried out more slowly while the middle of the field generally dried out faster possibly due to elevation differences when comparing the sampling schemes the density of the sensors is not as important as the placement of sensors within the field if uniform irrigation applications are made in this field with uniform irrigation applications the elevation management zone would be the best scheme to use because it combines established recommendations of using soil moisture sensors with center pivots such as placing one at the beginning and end of the cycle and considers the differences in elevation of the 18 days the sensor schemes were compared over the three years of the study the elevation based scheme s7 had a lower rmse than other schemes as follows s6 on seven days s5 on five days s4 for four days and s3 for two days for these instances where the elevation based scheme s7 had a lower rmse than the same or greater number of sensors evenly spaced throughout the field nine were on dry days and nine were on wet days this demonstrates that the spatial placement of sensors can be more critical than the density of sensors in a field the elevation scheme performs better than the gridded scheme with only four sensor sets in terms of predicting the swt over the whole field and if it is used the same irrigation decision would be made as with the full sensor grid producers using uniform irrigation should not assume that one sensor location is sufficient especially in heterogenous fields whether using uniform irrigation applications or moving to vri applications producers should take advantage of publicly available data such as soil type and evaluate changes in elevation from topographic maps or dems by using these free resources producers can improve spatial placement of sensors within the field with minimal effort if variable rate irrigation vri is desired careful attention should be given to the primary factors that affect soil moisture since the general drying pattern holds true for the field all three growing seasons the producer could combine the swt data with soil elevation and yield data to develop management zones for vri applications after three seasons of data collection with two of the three being soybean crops and one being a corn crop there does not seem to be much of a difference in spatial swt patterns of water usage between the two crops but future data collection is planned to better capture those differences and similarities at 18 ha the field evaluated in this study was relatively small which demonstrates that smaller fields can have spatial variability in swt throughout the growing season evaluation of a larger area or additional days during each growing season might have resulted in greater differences in the elevation based sensor scheme s7 and the other schemes s1 s6 future work includes evaluation of larger

8967,high water consumption in the agricultural sector population growth urbanization and industrialization have gradually turned groundwater into a quantitative and qualitative crisis this study investigated aquifer storage and recovery asr as the environmental effect of modernization projects in agricultural water distribution systems for this purpose a numerical model of the qazvin aquifer located in central iran was developed using modflow for spatial analysis of asr before after modernization besides to investigate the operational performance of the water distribution systems in the status quo a hydraulic flow simulation model of the surface water distribution systems including the main open canal and lateral was developed in matlab calibrated and verified by the observed operational data then this hydraulic model was coupled with the developed automatic control systems including the de centralized centralized real time controllers as the modernization alternatives the hydraulic operation simulation results reveal that the agricultural water distribution system s performance improved the reliability of the surface water delivery process by nearly 33 for the de centralized control system and by approximately 35 for the centralized control system consequently numerical modeling results indicate that the groundwater table will keep declining at an annual rate of about 1 5 m using the conventional operating system in the status quo also the results show that groundwater extraction decreased by 45 and 60 in the de centralized and centralized automated methods respectively therefore the proposed asr approach in the present study based on the operational automation of the surface flow within the irrigation district can be introduced as a practical

irrigation district automated control systems sustainable management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid areas water deficiency is a severe constraint for the recovery and development of agricultural land groundwater accounting for 30 of all freshwater is the primary water source for agriculture industry and domestic water however there is currently an increase in groundwater consumption due to the increasing scarcity of surface water resources and the growing needs of the urban population lahjouj et al 2021 the increasingly excessive extraction of groundwater resources is causing numerous problems such as sometimes irreversible states for aquifers reduced groundwater quality and subsidence in this regard studies have shown that agricultural water use is inefficient chakraei et al 2021 hosseini jolfan et al 2019 kourakos et al 2019 srinivasan and nuthalapati 2019 therefore developing methods to improve agricultural water efficiency and save groundwater resources is essential studies on aquifer storage and recovery asr have involved analyses of water balances relationships between agriculture and groundwater extraction effects of mulching on groundwater table simulations of irrigation and evapotranspiration and different cropping patterns bordbar et al 2019 dash et al 2019 shahdany et al 2018 wu et al 2018 gibson et al 2018 analyzed 284 locations for applying asr to address reasons for declining groundwater levels in the yakima river basin in washington state they found that more than 50 of the evaluated locations were appropriate for asr and that the national potential for recharge in the country was 6 400 million liters daily another study was conducted on the possible effect of using rain stored from the previous year to irrigate the current year s crops in the central valley of california as a potential for asr the study used four methods of groundwater recharge from agricultural areas eight methods of changing the volume of water recharge and five methods of changing the time of aquifer recharge the results revealed that the general availability of water flow played a considerable role in asr moreover it was noticed that the recharge period would be longer and take place at a slower rate if there were limitations in available water flow kourakos et al 2019 sathish and mohamed 2018 analyzed appropriate locations for asr to ensure sustainable water supply in abu dhabi using the modflow simulation model recharge wells and ponds were employed to raise the groundwater table and recover the aquifer the results indicated that the water table did not reach the previous level after 100 recovery knapton et al 2019 addressed managed aquifer recharge mar by analyzing population growth excessive groundwater extraction and aquifer deletion during the dry seasons of the year in darwin australia the study showed that mar in the early to mid dry season decreased the decline in the groundwater table during the dry season and saved about 500 000 m3 of water per year most asr studies have involved the effects of improving on farm activities to reduce water extraction from aquifers thus the effects of improvement in off farm activities i e agricultural water conveyance distribution and delivery systems supplied by surface water resources on reducing extraction of groundwater resources are usually not involved off farm activities can cause excessive groundwater extraction in developing countries considering the dissatisfaction of stakeholders with insufficient and inappropriate surface water distribution fard et al 2021 despite substantial governmental investments in iran to construct storage and dams in line and off line reservoirs guan et al 2011 liu et al 2012 and water distribution networks unreliable operation of these networks has led to the simultaneous exploitation of groundwater resources in addition to using surface water tork et al 2021 the reasons for this over exploitation of groundwater include poor performance of the agricultural water distribution system caused by defects in design improper manual operating systems lack of regular inspection and poor maintenance and top down operational strategies that lead to inequitable water distribution among upstream and downstream farmers burt 2013 improvement of performance processes in these systems is not a priority because water planning managers are unaware of the water losses occurring in agricultural water distribution for instance a study conducted in an irrigation district in spain showed that more than 50 of the supplied water was lost due to poor management of operation and maintenance of the agricultural water distribution network serra et al 2016 serrano tovar et al 2019 a study in ethiopia showed that inappropriate exploitation damaged hydrologic structures and development of irrigation infrastructure without proper management were the cause of low agricultural water efficiency followed by extreme inequity in water distribution karimi avargani et al 2020 hence it is necessary to improve the performance of the surface water distribution systems to save groundwater in this context intelligent management of agricultural water distribution through automatic hydraulic structures including water level regulators and off takes can reduce water losses and improve aquifer conditions in light of the above the primary objective of this study is to investigate the agricultural surface water distribution systems performance before and after the modernization project in improving the reliability of the surface water distribution within the farmers and consequently decreasing groundwater overexploitation during water deficiency periods in this regard the sub objective of the present study is stated below develop test and perform automated operation systems for the study area and investigate the potential improvement in surface water distribution adequacy within the irrigated units developing the groundwater modeling system of the aquifer beneath the study area to assess the groundwater levels alteration before after the modernization project to find out the modernization project effects as an asr measure groundwater resources conservation accordingly the aquifer was first modeled using the modflow code to determine the status of groundwater next the proposed approach for improving the surface water supply system and providing sufficient stable and reasonable surface water was simulated in matlab finally the results from matlab were applied to the groundwater model and the consequent changes in the groundwater level and the aquifer withdrawal were calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water distribution models and their interactions according to fig 1 the methodology involved two distinct but interconnected parts the first part introduces solutions for automating the agricultural water transport and distribution system this is carried out in two subsections as follows analyzing widely used alternatives in automating the agricultural water distribution systems and selecting a de centralized proportional integral pi control system and centralized model predictive control cmpc system as automation strategies for the agricultural water distribution systems designing developing and calibrating the existing operating system as well as the pi and mpc controllers for a l agricultural water distribution system in central iran to evaluate the results of the first part on groundwater withdrawal and changes in groundwater level we developed a numerical model for the aquifer using the modflow gms code this section in turn consists of the following two parts collecting and classifying the information on numerical modeling of groundwater designing steady state and transient models for the studied aquifer using the modflow model in gms software to simulate the groundwater level here we evaluate the effects of applying exploitation methods in the asr scenario and assess the results as distributional effects 2 2 study area the study was conducted for the qazvin aquifer one of the largest iranian aquifers with an area of 3952 km2 it is located in the namak lake catchment area with longitude 49 28 e to 50 53 e and latitude 35 67 n to 36 37 n fig 2 groundwater resources are exploited by 7881 wells with an annual discharge of 1572 million cubic meters mcm 1959 springs with an annual discharge of 40 3 mcm and 260 qanats with an annual discharge of 53 3 mcm the annual water consumption in this region is 2095 mcm 1665 mcm of which come from groundwater and 430 mcm from surface water the agricultural domestic and industrial water use are 1901 31 107 69 and 36 54 million m3 respectively given the limited surface water resources and the dissatisfaction of farmers with the performance of the agricultural water distribution system the irrigation water in this plain is mainly extracted from groundwater this has led to an annual decline of 1 6 m in the water table ministry of energy 2014 qazvin s agricultural water distribution system is among the main water suppliers for farming areas of the study region constituting one of the most important agricultural areas on this plain the system became operational in 1977 with a total area of 80000 ha and a net area of 60000 ha nearly 72 of which consist of grade 1 and grade 2 land hashemy and monem 2012 monem and hashemy 2011 the water resources of this network are provided by surface water taleghan dam and groundwater authorized and unauthorized wells in the farming areas due to the excessive withdrawal of groundwater from the aquifer and the decrease in rainfall the condition of this aquifer was declared critical and further withdrawal was prohibited in 2013 since then various solutions have been advanced to ameliorate the condition of the aquifer for example enhancing the water transmission system and the existing canals that transfer a large volume of irrigation water and stopping water wasting can significantly help reduce withdrawal from the aquifer and improve its condition 2 3 simulation of surface water distribution system 2 3 1 current operating system the hydraulic flow in the studied system and its current performance was assessed to evaluate improvement in the surface operating system performance using automated control systems for this purpose a hydrodynamic simulation model that can link the designed controllers and simultaneously receive and execute control commands was developed for this purpose an integral delay id model recommended in several studies yang et al 2021 yin et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 zhonghao et al 2019 was developed in matlab to simulate the hydraulic conditions of the water distribution system and allow easy exchange of data with the controllers based on this model the part of the water conveyance system located between two water regulating structures is called an interval each interval consisted of two sections i e a uniform flow section and a backwater curve section accordingly the two main characteristics of each interval are delay time tc and storage area as in addition eq 1 was employed to measure the water depth at the end of each interval hashemy and roozbahani 2016 kaghazchi et al 2021 kamrani et al 2020

closed loop control method in which the controlled variable water surface elevation is measured upstream of the adjustment structure in this method the deviation of water surface elevation from the

actions degree of opening of the adjustment structure disturbances volume of water diverted at the intakes runoff entering the water distribution system or leaving it even if unknown are taken into account indirectly and through their effects on the system output water level elevation in each interval based on the pi controller algorithm variations in the discharge of the flow passing under the

study designed pi controllers in the upstream control method and the feedback control mode due to the existing structural conditions in the agricultural water distribution system the input of each controller is the measured water level upstream of each adjustment structure then based on the measured error in the water level from the target water level the control variable is calculated and the opening degree of the gate is determined 2 3 3 centralized automated model predictive control mpc system this method is a control system designed using feedback and feed forward control modes in addition to an optimization method to calculate the output variable of the controller water levels first the controller is responsible for equalling the downstream water level of the interval to the target water level by adjusting the upstream level and the gates opening adjustment then the mpc system starts to predict the future hydraulic variables of the system using a combination of time horizon and the mathematical model for the controlled canal internal model at each time step the control commands are determined based on the predicted hydraulic status and instantaneous measurements

e k h k h r e f 2 3 4 performance evaluation indicators to investigate the system s performance and evaluate the proposed approach we relied on three indicators water delivery adequacy indicator and indicators based on controlled water level error these indicators are explained below 2 3 4 1 water delivery adequacy indicator according to the definition given by molden et al 2007 molden and gates 1990 the water delivery adequacy indicator is defined as 8 pa 1 t t 1 r r q d q r in this definition pa is the performance indicator for the whole system t is the time intervals considered for performance evaluation r is the total number of measured intakes q d is the delivery discharge and q r is the required discharge as molden and gates 1990 recommended table 1 shows the classification of the adequacy indicator 2 3 4 2 indicators based on controlled water level error the most common performance evaluation indicators used in different studies include the maximum absolute error mae and the integral absolute error iae molden et al 2007 molden and gates 1990 9 mae max y t y t arg e t y t arg e t in this equation y t is the observed water level calculated by using the flow simulation model at t and y target is the target water level 10 iae δ t t t 0 t y t y t arg e t y t arg e t in this relation t is the time step of applying adjustments and t the execution time of the test 2 4 groundwater modeling system the modflow model was used in gms software to simulate the effects of the groundwater extraction reduction scenario fig 4 shows the conceptual model developed in this study the initial boundary conditions entered into the modflow model were classified as source sink areal property and observation points categories the layers related to aquifer boundaries exploitation wells and rivers and characteristics of aquifer layers such as the horizontal hydraulic conductivity groundwater recharge adequate rainfall return water from the agricultural surface water distribution system and exploitation wells and runoff and recharge resulting from groundwater inflow as general head boundary ghb package were entered into the modflow observed groundwater levels in 59 observation wells were used the aquifer grid was a 250 m 250 m network fig 4 a shows a summary of recharge and depletion parameters estimated by dividing the aquifer into land use and flow network that were entered into the conceptual model according to fig 4 b the infiltration from rainfall agricultural return flows domestic and industrial water surface runoff and recharge resulting from groundwater inflow as general head boundary ghb were applied as recharge parameters in the model moreover groundwater extraction from exploitation wells evapotranspiration at aquifer outlets where the groundwater table is less than 5 m deep and the outflow fronts with the constant head ghb were considered and entered into the model as depletion parameters after all the groundwater balance sheet parameters were entered the simulation was performed in steady and transient states the aquifer was modeled in three years 2017 2020 with a monthly stress period and the calibration period included two years and one year to verify the model the simulation time step was one month and october 2017 as it had minor variations in groundwater level the lowest sensitivity to recharge and depletion sources and available data was selected for simulating the model s steady state the steady state model shows the first time step of modeling in which the hydraulic conductivity parameter had to be calibrated based on groundwater flow equations after the steady state simulation the transient simulation defined 36 monthly stress periods until september 2020 then model calibration and verification steps were performed to implement exploitation scenarios the aquifer s specific yield was selected for calibration based on the transient groundwater flow equations finally the findings obtained in the section on renovating canals and surface water systems were applied to the groundwater model 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational simulation of the agricultural water distribution system the main objective was to analyze the operational status i e surface water distribution efficiency of the distribution system under water deficiency conditions according to this scenario when demands for water at the off takes i e stakeholders water demands were kept constant the inflow discharge into the system faced a 20 reduction the agricultural water distribution system was simulated separately for the three operation methods conventional manual operation pi automated control and mpc automated control the degree of interest in the surface water distribution was evaluated based on the performance evaluation indicators given in table 2 the table shows that the mean performance evaluation indicators of mae and iae for the surface water distribution system under conventional operation were 35 4 and 10 3 respectively the results show that the mean adequacy indicator for the entire agricultural water distribution system was 47 moreover table 2 indicates that the water delivery adequacy indicator for the first and second intervals was 93 and 86 respectively however these values decreased when 30 of water losses occurring in the lateral distribution were considered therefore the appeal of water delivery based on the adequacy indicator table 1 is less than 80 consequently all of the wells within these two intervals are entirely operated however the water delivery adequacy indicators for intervals 3 10 were unattractive even without considering the lateral distribution losses so surface water did not reach the farming areas table 2 and fig 5 shows that the surface water distribution system s performance verifies that the wells work at 100 capacity nevertheless according to the severe scenario results which arise from a 20 reduction of the inflow supplied for the surface distribution system the inability of this operational method is revealed to meet the water demands therefore the simulated operational status of the agricultural water distribution system under the severe scenario indicates that the conjunctive operation of surface and groundwater resources has a crucial role in supplying agricultural demands table 2 indicates that the calculated mean mae and iae for the upgraded water distribution system with the de centralized pi controller were 9 2 and 5 4 respectively which showed that the mae improved by 26 compared to the conventional surface water distribution system also the cumulative absolute error iae improved by about 5 compared to the conventional method the results of the operational simulation using the de centralized pi control system suggest that its mean adequacy indicator was 79 9 therefore the adequacy indicator improved by 33 compared to the conventional method for this operating system consequently with increased water delivery adequacy using the pi control system we will witness a more significant reduction in groundwater extraction since less water will be pumped from the aquifer as seen from table 2 and the adequacy indicator 72 92 67 and 66 of the total areas in these four intervals will fulfill 90 100 adequate water supply which is quite acceptable the areas in intervals 1 4 are colored green in fig 5 b and here groundwater pumping will stop however the water adequacy indicator for the pi automated control system shows no acceptable performance for the interval 5 7 in these intervals less than 60 of the total land area has an adequacy indicator of 100 besides intervals 8 10 did not receive any water calculating the area covered by the average adequacy indicator colored in yellow in fig 5 b indicates that the tube wells in these areas extracted 50 less water from the groundwater resources moreover calculating the area covered by an adequacy indicator lower than 80 colored red in fig 5 b reveals that 100 of wells in these areas extracted the maximum possible amount of groundwater the mean performance evaluation indicators for absolute and cumulative absolute errors in the mpc system in table 2 were 4 4 and 2 6 respectively for the agricultural water distribution system these values improved by 31 0 and 7 7 compared to the conventional operating system moreover the performance evaluation indicators for mae and iae improved by 4 8 and 2 7 compared to the pi operating system the improvement in the adequacy indicator through the centralized operating system indicates that the mpc system with a mean adequacy indicator of 81 8 outperformed the conventional operational method by 34 8 the results also indicate that the mean adequacy indicator improvement was 1 9 for the entire district compared to the pi de centralized automated control system therefore the mpc system improved the water delivery adequacy and surface water distribution network compared to the other operating systems increasing the water delivery adequacy through the mpc system will increase the reduction in water extraction from the aquifer resulting from less volume of pumped water consequently it can be stated that the mpc system performed well in water distribution under the severe exploitation scenario so all three performance evaluation indicators presented in table 2 indicated fair water distribution within the downstream intervals hence the mpc system operated well in distributing water among the off takes in other words the smallest area covered by the 100 adequacy indicator was that of the last interval which accounts for 60 of the total area fig 5 c in addition calculating the area covered by the 80 89 adequacy indicator colored in yellow indicates that the tube wells in these areas extracted 50 less water from the groundwater resources also calculating the area covered by the adequacy indicator smaller than 80 showed that the tube wells located in these areas colored in red pumped the maximum possible volume of water from the groundwater resources generally based on these results it can be concluded that the volume of groundwater extraction was lower in the final intervals than in the other operating systems 3 2 results of the groundwater model simulation identifying and calibrating sensitive factors to obtain optimal results is essential in accurately implementing the modeling given the model implementation and sensitivity analysis hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were identified as sensitive parameters in steady state and transient state groundwater models in fig 6 a b for calibration hydraulic conductivity and specific yield from excavation logs in the region pumping tests estimated water transfer and previous studies were also used to achieve accurate calibration results fig 6 c presents observed and calculated groundwater tables for the 59 piezometers in the qazvin aquifer the base modeling simulation error was smaller than 1 0 m between observed and simulated groundwater levels during the modeling period table 3 shows the error in the final steady state and transient models the results indicate that the mean squared error was less than 0 49 m in all 59 piezometers fig 7 shows the scatterplot for observed and validated groundwater levels 3 3 spatial assessment of the aquifer status after the surface water operating systems modernization the groundwater model was used to analyze the system behavior under current and future conditions i e aquifer status with manual current and automatic operation thus the aquifer model was utilized to simulate the effects of water extraction reduction scenarios fig 8 shows the aquifer water level for the period 2006 2016 according to the figure the mean groundwater level decreased by 15 2 m during the ten years from 12 42 m to 27 65 m consequently it is concluded that the groundwater table showed a decreasing trend under the scenario where water extraction from the aquifer did not decrease i e the conventional surface water distribution after validation the groundwater model was used to calculate the extraction volume in each farming area under the different exploitation scenarios first the distribution of the groundwater table was determined by applying each of the developed surface water operating systems for example fig 10 shows that using the de centralized pi controller and the centralized mpc system decreased water extraction from the aquifer in the farming areas by 45 3 and 60 1 respectively the volume of consumed water in each farming area was then calculated for each of the three operating systems i e conventional operation pi controller system and mpc system fig 9 as mentioned earlier an operational scenario using water deficiency 20 reduction in the water inflow to the agricultural areas was used without changing the demand for water in the off takes in the conventional distribution system it was assumed that water extraction from agricultural tube wells would continue with the current trend therefore the water extraction time series was applied to the groundwater model fig 10 shows that the groundwater table would continue declining by nearly 1 5 m per year as formerly presented in fig 8 the groundwater levels were then recalculated for the pi operating system by including the water volumes extracted from the groundwater for each farming area the results reveal a saving of 45 3 of groundwater from the aquifer fig 11 a shows the reduction in groundwater extraction within the farming areas and the increased groundwater table compared with the conventional operating system throughout the aquifer as shown in the fig 11 c d the groundwater table increased compared to the conventional operation and the observation wells in the farming areas exhibited a rise in the groundwater table the reasons are the increasing sufficiency of surface water distribution and the reduced need for groundwater in the conventional operating system the annual groundwater withdrawal reached 96 mcm this figure was 18 mcm for the pi system the mpc system reduced aquifer water extraction in farming areas by 60 1 fig 12 shows the result of this reduction in groundwater levels fig 12 a presents the results of the reduction in groundwater extraction in the farming areas and the increase in groundwater table compared to the conventional operation in the piezometers and the entire aquifer figs 12 c and 12 d demonstrate the increase in the groundwater table compared to the conventional operation the groundwater level rose in the observation wells within the district the reason for this is the reduction in groundwater extraction in these parts compared to the conventional operation consequently the mpc system acceptably distributed the water among the off takes so that the smallest area covered by 100 of the adequacy indicator was that of the final interval accounting for 60 of the total area in the interval generally considering the results it can be declared that the volume of water extraction in the downstream intervals was much smaller in the mpc system compared to the conventional operation since fig 12 e and f show an increased groundwater table compared to the pi there was an increase in the groundwater table in the observation wells throughout the district thus increasing the distribution efficiency of surface water the pi automated 4 discussion modernization projects for the agricultural water supply distribution and delivery system supplied from surface water resources have confronted many challenges in different countries the routine risk assessment projects conducted by the dam owners and utility companies show that these water conveyance infrastructures are the most vulnerable sector not only because of the frequent potential failure modes in these systems but also because water supply restrictions occurred due to adverse effects of climate change however the modernization of these systems is generally subject to economies of scale the proposed method in this study brings up another perspective for justifying these irrigation infrastructure modernization projects based on the environmental benefits and explicitly reducing the aquifer vulnerability due to overexploitation by the farmers this new perspective helps the decision makers and different stakeholders from the dam owners utility companies and district managers to farmers cooperations and from local governors to environmental activists ngos to facilitate the process of issuing re issuing these modernization projects by shifting the technical economic managerial perspectives to environmental technical ones in comparison with similar studies in this scope the proposed method here gets the advantages of i the hydraulic simulation model of surface water conveyance distribution systems to specify the exact amount of the delivered surface water to each stakeholder ii groundwater extraction spatial assessment to specify the over extraction from the aquifer and to make a realistic projection of the modernization in short and long term periods it may be argued that if this improved distribution system is used the farmers will probably try to increase the cultivated areas and or use more water to grow their crops this is an undeniable fact however in many communities similar to the present study extracting agricultural water from groundwater aquifers entails high costs for energy drilling in such conditions the only demand of most farmers is to receive reliable water from the surface water distribution system in any case the proposed approach could improve the current situation in the region it should be stressed that the water distribution system farmers and beneficiaries and groundwater resources are three interconnected systems therefore having a sustainable management system requires considering the limitations of each of these elements in developing countries groundwater resources are more vulnerable to irreversible damage due to difficulties in enforcing restrictions in any case the results of this research show that agricultural water use can be made more efficient using new technology and thus save groundwater see also bordbar et al 2019 chakraei et al 2021 milan et al 2018 safavi and enteshari 2016 5 conclusions this study proposed a new strategy for aquifer storage and recovery asr in a region where agricultural water is supplied by both surface water and groundwater resources a systematic approach was employed to determine the spatial distribution of reduced groundwater needs the approach consisted of two major components 1 hydraulic modeling and 2 an automatic operation model for the agricultural water distribution system a mutual relationship was established between these two components to simulate surface water distribution using different operating systems the surface water distribution modeling in farming areas determined the reduced groundwater extraction location therefore the proposed scenario for asr in the present research is contrary to the everyday situations to reduce extraction from all wells in the aquifer equally the practical results of using the developed asr scenario are briefly presented below introducing an automatic water distribution system enhanced the efficiency of water distribution in upstream middle and downstream agricultural areas on average by 33 35 under 20 water deficiency conditions resulting in efficiency in surface water distribution meant reduced groundwater extraction groundwater extraction during the modeling period decreased by nearly 182 and 242 mcm for the de centralized and centralized control systems respectively after implementing the asr scenario the following recommendations are made to improve the combined utilization of surface water and groundwater in farming areas under the abovementioned conditions and to conduct future studies developing a framework for selecting the appropriate operating system and analyzing its effects on the aquifer based on socioeconomic concerns evaluation of the cost to apply automated control system s for future studies evaluating the asr in the form of temporal distribution declaration of competing interest the

8967,high water consumption in the agricultural sector population growth urbanization and industrialization have gradually turned groundwater into a quantitative and qualitative crisis this study investigated aquifer storage and recovery asr as the environmental effect of modernization projects in agricultural water distribution systems for this purpose a numerical model of the qazvin aquifer located in central iran was developed using modflow for spatial analysis of asr before after modernization besides to investigate the operational performance of the water distribution systems in the status quo a hydraulic flow simulation model of the surface water distribution systems including the main open canal and lateral was developed in matlab calibrated and verified by the observed operational data then this hydraulic model was coupled with the developed automatic control systems including the de centralized centralized real time controllers as the modernization alternatives the hydraulic operation simulation results reveal that the agricultural water distribution system s performance improved the reliability of the surface water delivery process by nearly 33 for the de centralized control system and by approximately 35 for the centralized control system consequently numerical modeling results indicate that the groundwater table will keep declining at an annual rate of about 1 5 m using the conventional operating system in the status quo also the results show that groundwater extraction decreased by 45 and 60 in the de centralized and centralized automated methods respectively therefore the proposed asr approach in the present study based on the operational automation of the surface flow within the irrigation district can be introduced as a practical and reliable approach to upgrading the conjunctive surface groundwater agricultural water distribution system in irrigation districts worldwide keywords environmental assessment conjunctive operation irrigation district automated control systems sustainable management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid areas water deficiency is a severe constraint for the recovery and development of agricultural land groundwater accounting for 30 of all freshwater is the primary water source for agriculture industry and domestic water however there is currently an increase in groundwater consumption due to the increasing scarcity of surface water resources and the growing needs of the urban population lahjouj et al 2021 the increasingly excessive extraction of groundwater resources is causing numerous problems such as sometimes irreversible states for aquifers reduced groundwater quality and subsidence in this regard studies have shown that agricultural water use is inefficient chakraei et al 2021 hosseini jolfan et al 2019 kourakos et al 2019 srinivasan and nuthalapati 2019 therefore developing methods to improve agricultural water efficiency and save groundwater resources is essential studies on aquifer storage and recovery asr have involved analyses of water balances relationships between agriculture and groundwater extraction effects of mulching on groundwater table simulations of irrigation and evapotranspiration and different cropping patterns bordbar et al 2019 dash et al 2019 shahdany et al 2018 wu et al 2018 gibson et al 2018 analyzed 284 locations for applying asr to address reasons for declining groundwater levels in the yakima river basin in washington state they found that more than 50 of the evaluated locations were appropriate for asr and that the national potential for recharge in the country was 6 400 million liters daily another study was conducted on the possible effect of using rain stored from the previous year to irrigate the current year s crops in the central valley of california as a potential for asr the study used four methods of groundwater recharge from agricultural areas eight methods of changing the volume of water recharge and five methods of changing the time of aquifer recharge the results revealed that the general availability of water flow played a considerable role in asr moreover it was noticed that the recharge period would be longer and take place at a slower rate if there were limitations in available water flow kourakos et al 2019 sathish and mohamed 2018 analyzed appropriate locations for asr to ensure sustainable water supply in abu dhabi using the modflow simulation model recharge wells and ponds were employed to raise the groundwater table and recover the aquifer the results indicated that the water table did not reach the previous level after 100 recovery knapton et al 2019 addressed managed aquifer recharge mar by analyzing population growth excessive groundwater extraction and aquifer deletion during the dry seasons of the year in darwin australia the study showed that mar in the early to mid dry season decreased the decline in the groundwater table during the dry season and saved about 500 000 m3 of water per year most asr studies have involved the effects of improving on farm activities to reduce water extraction from aquifers thus the effects of improvement in off farm activities i e agricultural water conveyance distribution and delivery systems supplied by surface water resources on reducing extraction of groundwater resources are usually not involved off farm activities can cause excessive groundwater extraction in developing countries considering the dissatisfaction of stakeholders with insufficient and inappropriate surface water distribution fard et al 2021 despite substantial governmental investments in iran to construct storage and dams in line and off line reservoirs guan et al 2011 liu et al 2012 and water distribution networks unreliable operation of these networks has led to the simultaneous exploitation of groundwater resources in addition to using surface water tork et al 2021 the reasons for this over exploitation of groundwater include poor performance of the agricultural water distribution system caused by defects in design improper manual operating systems lack of regular inspection and poor maintenance and top down operational strategies that lead to inequitable water distribution among upstream and downstream farmers burt 2013 improvement of performance processes in these systems is not a priority because water planning managers are unaware of the water losses occurring in agricultural water distribution for instance a study conducted in an irrigation district in spain showed that more than 50 of the supplied water was lost due to poor management of operation and maintenance of the agricultural water distribution network serra et al 2016 serrano tovar et al 2019 a study in ethiopia showed that inappropriate exploitation damaged hydrologic structures and development of irrigation infrastructure without proper management were the cause of low agricultural water efficiency followed by extreme inequity in water distribution karimi avargani et al 2020 hence it is necessary to improve the performance of the surface water distribution systems to save groundwater in this context intelligent management of agricultural water distribution through automatic hydraulic structures including water level regulators and off takes can reduce water losses and improve aquifer conditions in light of the above the primary objective of this study is to investigate the agricultural surface water distribution systems performance before and after the modernization project in improving the reliability of the surface water distribution within the farmers and consequently decreasing groundwater overexploitation during water deficiency periods in this regard the sub objective of the present study is stated below develop test and perform automated operation systems for the study area and investigate the potential improvement in surface water distribution adequacy within the irrigated units developing the groundwater modeling system of the aquifer beneath the study area to assess the groundwater levels alteration before after the modernization project to find out the modernization project effects as an asr measure groundwater resources conservation accordingly the aquifer was first modeled using the modflow code to determine the status of groundwater next the proposed approach for improving the surface water supply system and providing sufficient stable and reasonable surface water was simulated in matlab finally the results from matlab were applied to the groundwater model and the consequent changes in the groundwater level and the aquifer withdrawal were calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water distribution models and their interactions according to fig 1 the methodology involved two distinct but interconnected parts the first part introduces solutions for automating the agricultural water transport and distribution system this is carried out in two subsections as follows analyzing widely used alternatives in automating the agricultural water distribution systems and selecting a de centralized proportional integral pi control system and centralized model predictive control cmpc system as automation strategies for the agricultural water distribution systems designing developing and calibrating the existing operating system as well as the pi and mpc controllers for a l agricultural water distribution system in central iran to evaluate the results of the first part on groundwater withdrawal and changes in groundwater level we developed a numerical model for the aquifer using the modflow gms code this section in turn consists of the following two parts collecting and classifying the information on numerical modeling of groundwater designing steady state and transient models for the studied aquifer using the modflow model in gms software to simulate the groundwater level here we evaluate the effects of applying exploitation methods in the asr scenario and assess the results as distributional effects 2 2 study area the study was conducted for the qazvin aquifer one of the largest iranian aquifers with an area of 3952 km2 it is located in the namak lake catchment area with longitude 49 28 e to 50 53 e and latitude 35 67 n to 36 37 n fig 2 groundwater resources are exploited by 7881 wells with an annual discharge of 1572 million cubic meters mcm 1959 springs with an annual discharge of 40 3 mcm and 260 qanats with an annual discharge of 53 3 mcm the annual water consumption in this region is 2095 mcm 1665 mcm of which come from groundwater and 430 mcm from surface water the agricultural domestic and industrial water use are 1901 31 107 69 and 36 54 million m3 respectively given the limited surface water resources and the dissatisfaction of farmers with the performance of the agricultural water distribution system the irrigation water in this plain is mainly extracted from groundwater this has led to an annual decline of 1 6 m in the water table ministry of energy 2014 qazvin s agricultural water distribution system is among the main water suppliers for farming areas of the study region constituting one of the most important agricultural areas on this plain the system became operational in 1977 with a total area of 80000 ha and a net area of 60000 ha nearly 72 of which consist of grade 1 and grade 2 land hashemy and monem 2012 monem and hashemy 2011 the water resources of this network are provided by surface water taleghan dam and groundwater authorized and unauthorized wells in the farming areas due to the excessive withdrawal of groundwater from the aquifer and the decrease in rainfall the condition of this aquifer was declared critical and further withdrawal was prohibited in 2013 since then various solutions have been advanced to ameliorate the condition of the aquifer for example enhancing the water transmission system and the existing canals that transfer a large volume of irrigation water and stopping water wasting can significantly help reduce withdrawal from the aquifer and improve its condition 2 3 simulation of surface water distribution system 2 3 1 current operating system the hydraulic flow in the studied system and its current performance was assessed to evaluate improvement in the surface operating system performance using automated control systems for this purpose a hydrodynamic simulation model that can link the designed controllers and simultaneously receive and execute control commands was developed for this purpose an integral delay id model recommended in several studies yang et al 2021 yin et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 zhonghao et al 2019 was developed in matlab to simulate the hydraulic conditions of the water distribution system and allow easy exchange of data with the controllers based on this model the part of the water conveyance system located between two water regulating structures is called an interval each interval consisted of two sections i e a uniform flow section and a backwater curve section accordingly the two main characteristics of each interval are delay time tc and storage area as in addition eq 1 was employed to measure the water depth at the end of each interval hashemy and roozbahani 2016 kaghazchi et al 2021 kamrani et al 2020

closed loop control method in which the controlled variable water surface elevation is measured upstream of the adjustment structure in this method the deviation of water surface elevation from the target elevation is returned to the control algorithm so that the controlled variable water surface elevation upstream of the adjustment structure is returned to the target value by taking corrective actions degree of opening of the adjustment structure disturbances volume of water diverted at the intakes runoff entering the water distribution system or leaving it even if unknown are taken into account indirectly and through their effects on the system output water level elevation in each interval based on the pi controller algorithm variations in the discharge of the flow passing under the

study designed pi controllers in the upstream control method and the feedback control mode due to the existing structural conditions in the agricultural water distribution system the input of each controller is the measured water level upstream of each adjustment structure then based on the measured error in the water level from the target water level the control variable is calculated and the opening degree of the gate is determined 2 3 3 centralized automated model predictive control mpc system this method is a control system designed using feedback and feed forward control modes in addition to an optimization method to calculate the output variable of the controller water levels first the controller is responsible for equalling the downstream water level of the interval to the target water level by adjusting the upstream level and the gates opening adjustment then the mpc system starts to predict the future hydraulic variables of the system using a combination of time horizon and the mathematical model for the controlled canal internal model at each time step the control commands are determined based on the predicted hydraulic status and instantaneous measurements

e k h k h r e f 2 3 4 performance evaluation indicators to investigate the system s performance and evaluate the proposed approach we relied on three indicators water delivery adequacy indicator and indicators based on controlled water level error these indicators are explained below 2 3 4 1 water delivery adequacy indicator according to the definition given by molden et al 2007 molden and gates 1990 the water delivery adequacy indicator is defined as 8 pa 1 t t 1 r r q d q r in this definition pa is the performance indicator for the whole system t is the time intervals considered for performance evaluation r is the total number of measured intakes q d is the delivery discharge and q r is the required discharge as molden and gates 1990 recommended table 1 shows the classification of the adequacy indicator 2 3 4 2 indicators based on controlled water level error the most common performance evaluation indicators used in different studies include the maximum absolute error mae and the integral absolute error iae molden et al 2007 molden and gates 1990 9 mae max y t y t arg e t y t arg e t in this equation y t is the observed water level calculated by using the flow simulation model at t and y target is the target water level 10 iae δ t t t 0 t y t y t arg e t y t arg e t in this relation t is the time step of applying adjustments and t the execution time of the test 2 4 groundwater modeling system the modflow model was used in gms software to simulate the effects of the groundwater extraction reduction scenario fig 4 shows the conceptual model developed in this study the initial boundary conditions entered into the modflow model were classified as source sink areal property and observation points categories the layers related to aquifer boundaries exploitation wells and rivers and characteristics of aquifer layers such as the horizontal hydraulic conductivity groundwater recharge adequate rainfall return water from the agricultural surface water distribution system and exploitation wells and runoff and recharge resulting from groundwater inflow as general head boundary ghb package were entered into the modflow observed groundwater levels in 59 observation wells were used the aquifer grid was a 250 m 250 m network fig 4 a shows a summary of recharge and depletion parameters estimated by dividing the aquifer into land use and flow network that were entered into the conceptual model according to fig 4 b the infiltration from rainfall agricultural return flows domestic and industrial water surface runoff and recharge resulting from groundwater inflow as general head boundary ghb were applied as recharge parameters in the model moreover groundwater extraction from exploitation wells evapotranspiration at aquifer outlets where the groundwater table is less than 5 m deep and the outflow fronts with the constant head ghb were considered and entered into the model as depletion parameters after all the groundwater balance sheet parameters were entered the simulation was performed in steady and transient states the aquifer was modeled in three years 2017 2020 with a monthly stress period and the calibration period included two years and one year to verify the model the simulation time step was one month and october 2017 as it had minor variations in groundwater level the lowest sensitivity to recharge and depletion sources and available data was selected for simulating the model s steady state the steady state model shows the first time step of modeling in which the hydraulic conductivity parameter had to be calibrated based on groundwater flow equations after the steady state simulation the transient simulation defined 36 monthly stress periods until september 2020 then model calibration and verification steps were performed to implement exploitation scenarios the aquifer s specific yield was selected for calibration based on the transient groundwater flow equations finally the findings obtained in the section on renovating canals and surface water systems were applied to the groundwater model 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational simulation of the agricultural water distribution system the main objective was to analyze the operational status i e surface water distribution efficiency of the distribution system under water deficiency conditions according to this scenario when demands for water at the off takes i e stakeholders water demands were kept constant the inflow discharge into the system faced a 20 reduction the agricultural water distribution system was simulated separately for the three operation methods conventional manual operation pi automated control and mpc automated control the degree of interest in the surface water distribution was evaluated based on the performance evaluation indicators given in table 2 the table shows that the mean performance evaluation indicators of mae and iae for the surface water distribution system under conventional operation were 35 4 and 10 3 respectively the results show that the mean adequacy indicator for the entire agricultural water distribution system was 47 moreover table 2 indicates that the water delivery adequacy indicator for the first and second intervals was 93 and 86 respectively however these values decreased when 30 of water losses occurring in the lateral distribution were considered therefore the appeal of water delivery based on the adequacy indicator table 1 is less than 80 consequently all of the wells within these two intervals are entirely operated however the water delivery adequacy indicators for intervals 3 10 were unattractive even without considering the lateral distribution losses so surface water did not reach the farming areas table 2 and fig 5 shows that the surface water distribution system s performance verifies that the wells work at 100 capacity nevertheless according to the severe scenario results which arise from a 20 reduction of the inflow supplied for the surface distribution system the inability of this operational method is revealed to meet the water demands therefore the simulated operational status of the agricultural water distribution system under the severe scenario indicates that the conjunctive operation of surface and groundwater resources has a crucial role in supplying agricultural demands table 2 indicates that the calculated mean mae and iae for the upgraded water distribution system with the de centralized pi controller were 9 2 and 5 4 respectively which showed that the mae improved by 26 compared to the conventional surface water distribution system also the cumulative absolute error iae improved by about 5 compared to the conventional method the results of the operational simulation using the de centralized pi control system suggest that its mean adequacy indicator was 79 9 therefore the adequacy indicator improved by 33 compared to the conventional method for this operating system consequently with increased water delivery adequacy using the pi control system we will witness a more significant reduction in groundwater extraction since less water will be pumped from the aquifer as seen from table 2 and the adequacy indicator 72 92 67 and 66 of the total areas in these four intervals will fulfill 90 100 adequate water supply which is quite acceptable the areas in intervals 1 4 are colored green in fig 5 b and here groundwater pumping will stop however the water adequacy indicator for the pi automated control system shows no acceptable performance for the interval 5 7 in these intervals less than 60 of the total land area has an adequacy indicator of 100 besides intervals 8 10 did not receive any water calculating the area covered by the average adequacy indicator colored in yellow in fig 5 b indicates that the tube wells in these areas extracted 50 less water from the groundwater resources moreover calculating the area covered by an adequacy indicator lower than 80 colored red in fig 5 b reveals that 100 of wells in these areas extracted the maximum possible amount of groundwater the mean performance evaluation indicators for absolute and cumulative absolute errors in the mpc system in table 2 were 4 4 and 2 6 respectively for the agricultural water distribution system these values improved by 31 0 and 7 7 compared to the conventional operating system moreover the performance evaluation indicators for mae and iae improved by 4 8 and 2 7 compared to the pi operating system the improvement in the adequacy indicator through the centralized operating system indicates that the mpc system with a mean adequacy indicator of 81 8 outperformed the conventional operational method by 34 8 the results also indicate that the mean adequacy indicator improvement was 1 9 for the entire district compared to the pi de centralized automated control system therefore the mpc system improved the water delivery adequacy and surface water distribution network compared to the other operating systems increasing the water delivery adequacy through the mpc system will increase the reduction in water extraction from the aquifer resulting from less volume of pumped water consequently it can be stated that the mpc system performed well in water distribution under the severe exploitation scenario so all three performance evaluation indicators presented in table 2 indicated fair water distribution within the downstream intervals hence the mpc system operated well in distributing water among the off takes in other words the smallest area covered by the 100 adequacy indicator was that of the last interval which accounts for 60 of the total area fig 5 c in addition calculating the area covered by the 80 89 adequacy indicator colored in yellow indicates that the tube wells in these areas extracted 50 less water from the groundwater resources also calculating the area covered by the adequacy indicator smaller than 80 showed that the tube wells located in these areas colored in red pumped the maximum possible volume of water from the groundwater resources generally based on these results it can be concluded that the volume of groundwater extraction was lower in the final intervals than in the other operating systems 3 2 results of the groundwater model simulation identifying and calibrating sensitive factors to obtain optimal results is essential in accurately implementing the modeling given the model implementation and sensitivity analysis hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were identified as sensitive parameters in steady state and transient state groundwater models in fig 6 a b for calibration hydraulic conductivity and specific yield from excavation logs in the region pumping tests estimated water transfer and previous studies were also used to achieve accurate calibration results fig 6 c presents observed and calculated groundwater tables for the 59 piezometers in the qazvin aquifer the base modeling simulation error was smaller than 1 0 m between observed and simulated groundwater levels during the modeling period table 3 shows the error in the final steady state and transient models the results indicate that the mean squared error was less than 0 49 m in all 59 piezometers fig 7 shows the scatterplot for observed and validated groundwater levels 3 3 spatial assessment of the aquifer status after the surface water operating systems modernization the groundwater model was used to analyze the system behavior under current and future conditions i e aquifer status with manual current and automatic operation thus the aquifer model was utilized to simulate the effects of water extraction reduction scenarios fig 8 shows the aquifer water level for the period 2006 2016 according to the figure the mean groundwater level decreased by 15 2 m during the ten years from 12 42 m to 27 65 m consequently it is concluded that the groundwater table showed a decreasing trend under the scenario where water extraction from the aquifer did not decrease i e the conventional surface water distribution after validation the groundwater model was used to calculate the extraction volume in each farming area under the different exploitation scenarios first the distribution of the groundwater table was determined by applying each of the developed surface water operating systems for example fig 10 shows that using the de centralized pi controller and the centralized mpc system decreased water extraction from the aquifer in the farming areas by 45 3 and 60 1 respectively the volume of consumed water in each farming area was then calculated for each of the three operating systems i e conventional operation pi controller system and mpc system fig 9 as mentioned earlier an operational scenario using water deficiency 20 reduction in the water inflow to the agricultural areas was used without changing the demand for water in the off takes in the conventional distribution system it was assumed that water extraction from agricultural tube wells would continue with the current trend therefore the water extraction time series was applied to the groundwater model fig 10 shows that the groundwater table would continue declining by nearly 1 5 m per year as formerly presented in fig 8 the groundwater levels were then recalculated for the pi operating system by including the water volumes extracted from the groundwater for each farming area the results reveal a saving of 45 3 of groundwater from the aquifer fig 11 a shows the reduction in groundwater extraction within the farming areas and the increased groundwater table compared with the conventional operating system throughout the aquifer as shown in the fig 11 c d the groundwater table increased compared to the conventional operation and the observation wells in the farming areas exhibited a rise in the groundwater table the reasons are the increasing sufficiency of surface water distribution and the reduced need for groundwater in the conventional operating system the annual groundwater withdrawal reached 96 mcm this figure was 18 mcm for the pi system the mpc system reduced aquifer water extraction in farming areas by 60 1 fig 12 shows the result of this reduction in groundwater levels fig 12 a presents the results of the reduction in groundwater extraction in the farming areas and the increase in groundwater table compared to the conventional operation in the piezometers and the entire aquifer figs 12 c and 12 d demonstrate the increase in the groundwater table compared to the conventional operation the groundwater level rose in the observation wells within the district the reason for this is the reduction in groundwater extraction in these parts compared to the conventional operation consequently the mpc system acceptably distributed the water among the off takes so that the smallest area covered by 100 of the adequacy indicator was that of the final interval accounting for 60 of the total area in the interval generally considering the results it can be declared that the volume of water extraction in the downstream intervals was much smaller in the mpc system compared to the conventional operation since fig 12 e and f show an increased groundwater table compared to the pi there was an increase in the groundwater table in the observation wells throughout the district thus increasing the distribution efficiency of surface water the pi automated 4 discussion modernization projects for the agricultural water supply distribution and delivery system supplied from surface water resources have confronted many challenges in different countries the routine risk assessment projects conducted by the dam owners and utility companies show that these water conveyance infrastructures are the most vulnerable sector not only because of the frequent potential failure modes in these systems but also because water supply restrictions occurred due to adverse effects of climate change however the modernization of these systems is generally subject to economies of scale the proposed method in this study brings up another perspective for justifying these irrigation infrastructure modernization projects based on the environmental benefits and explicitly reducing the aquifer vulnerability due to overexploitation by the farmers this new perspective helps the decision makers and different stakeholders from the dam owners utility companies and district managers to farmers cooperations and from local governors to environmental activists ngos to facilitate the process of issuing re issuing these modernization projects by shifting the technical economic managerial perspectives to environmental technical ones in comparison with similar studies in this scope the proposed method here gets the advantages of i the hydraulic simulation model of surface water conveyance distribution systems to specify the exact amount of the delivered surface water to each stakeholder ii groundwater extraction spatial assessment to specify the over extraction from the aquifer and to make a realistic projection of the modernization in short and long term periods it may be argued that if this improved distribution system is used the farmers will probably try to increase the cultivated areas and or use more water to grow their crops this is an undeniable fact however in many communities similar to the present study extracting agricultural water from groundwater aquifers entails high costs for energy drilling in such conditions the only demand of most farmers is to receive reliable water from the surface water distribution system in any case the proposed approach could improve the current situation in the region it should be stressed that the water distribution system farmers and beneficiaries and groundwater resources are three interconnected systems therefore having a sustainable management system requires considering the limitations of each of these elements in developing countries groundwater resources are more vulnerable to irreversible damage due to difficulties in enforcing restrictions in any case the results of this research show that agricultural water use can be made more efficient using new technology and thus save groundwater see also bordbar et al 2019 chakraei et al 2021 milan et al 2018 safavi and enteshari 2016 5 conclusions this study proposed a new strategy for aquifer storage and recovery asr in a region where agricultural water is supplied by both surface water and groundwater resources a systematic approach was employed to determine the spatial distribution of reduced groundwater needs the approach consisted of two major components 1 hydraulic modeling and 2 an automatic operation model for the agricultural water distribution system a mutual relationship was established between these two components to simulate surface water distribution using different operating systems the surface water distribution modeling in farming areas determined the reduced groundwater extraction location therefore the proposed scenario for asr in the present research is contrary to the everyday situations to reduce extraction from all wells in the aquifer equally the practical results of using the developed asr scenario are briefly presented below introducing an automatic water distribution system enhanced the efficiency of water distribution in upstream middle and downstream agricultural areas on average by 33 35 under 20 water deficiency conditions resulting in efficiency in surface water distribution meant reduced groundwater extraction groundwater extraction during the modeling period decreased by nearly 182 and 242 mcm for the de centralized and centralized control systems respectively after implementing the asr scenario the following recommendations are made to improve the combined utilization of surface water and groundwater in farming areas under the abovementioned conditions and to conduct future studies developing a framework for selecting the appropriate operating system and analyzing its effects on the aquifer based on socioeconomic concerns evaluation of the cost to apply automated control system s for future studies evaluating the asr in the form of temporal distribution declaration of competing interest the

8968,sustainable water resources management is a main objective of government macro level documents assessments of such documents should be performed before their implementation because they may be ineffective or even result in negative consequences the current study quantitatively determined the capacity of four important iranian macro level documents and their policies to achieve sustainability for water resources commonly considered measures include a expansion of modern irrigation systems b change in the cropping pattern c change in the cropping date and d deficit irrigation a comprehensive approach was developed by linking the swat optimization model and water footprint sustainability indices for the assessments the two management scenarios examined were 1 improving the status of water resources and 2 improving the economic situation or minimizing income loss the tashk bakhtegan tb basin was selected as a pilot study to explore the effectiveness of the methodology and assessment of the documents the results showed that under scenario 1 the policies from the documents had the capacity to improve the blue sustainability indices of the basin but they were unable to meet the environmental water demand the policy for scenario 2 was associated with a decrease in the level of income in the agricultural sector and a decrease in the area cultivated it was found that a 20 28 reduction in the cultivated area was required for the sustainability of the tb basin environment it was shown that the approaches in the documents had the potential for improving the sustainability of water resources however their capacity was insufficient and their success depended on issues such as the ability for effective water allocation and control of rebound effects as well as compensation for economic loss this was crucial for consideration of future macro level documents the proposed modeling framework can be strongly recommended for wider applications keywords macro level document water sustainability water foot print swat model iran data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainable water resources management must consider long term future demand and supply in addition to current conditions without system degradation loucks 2000 accordingly a disruption in supply and demand continuous decrease in groundwater resources and a lack of environmental flow all can be indicators of unsustainability to address this issue governments usually provide policies in the form of macro level documents pre assessment of such documents before implementation is crucial since they could be too weak to address existing challenges or even produce contradictory results or negative side effects raeisi et al 2019 these concerns can threaten the objectives of the documents and achievement of the intended objectives the discovery of misleading or erroneous directives in water policies after their implementation has been reported by researchers for example qureshi et al 2011 examined water use and economic efficiency in the murray darling basin in australia the goal was to increase the environmental flow through subsidized investment in improving the irrigation efficiency the results showed that this policy was not cost effective compared to other alternatives such as buying water through water markets dumont et al 2013 reported the consequences of improving the irrigation efficiency in spain and warned that this policy may even increase water consumption due to a phenomenon called the rebound effect or jevons paradox the possibility of an increase in resource consumption due to an increase in efficiency similarly berbel et al 2015 reviewed water saving policies in spain as well as their impacts on energy consumption they concluded that the results of the available empirical evidence and the published theoretical research were diverse and to some extent contradictory they recommended that the government should consider the dynamic effects of such investments as well as economic instruments for the prevention of negative outcomes these issues also have been considered by the food and agriculture organization in a discussion paper entitled does improved irrigation technology save water perry et al 2017 regarding investment in modernizing irrigation systems for reducing water consumption they emphasized the application of a water accounting system for smart water saving policies moreover they stated that governments should avoid investment in the absence of prior control over water allocations as stated by berbel et al 2018 and bigdeli et al 2023 the lack of such an infrastructure could increase the crop area compensate for deficit irrigation and change the cropping pattern in favor of more water intensive crops another issue that is crucial to water policies is integration there is evidence that concentration on one sector such as the restoration of lakes or groundwater resources can have a negative effect on other sectors for example farokhnia et al 2018 showed that some of the policies applied to increase water flow to urmia lake iran lowered the recharge of groundwater resources similarly the water saving policies implemented in the imperial irrigation district in california which aimed for water transfer to the city of san diego eventually caused deterioration of environmental flows into the salton sea scott 2014 the scale of analysis is another issue that requires consideration zhou et al 2021 investigated water saving irrigation over the past 40 years by applying remotely sensed data they showed that the results changed depending on the scale of the study for example at field scale water saving technologies failed to save water because the increase in accumulated return flow was greater than the decrease in accumulated non beneficial water consumption at the same time the accumulated increase in beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeded regional water savings which illustrates the paradox between widely applied water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortages when considering such fundamental aspects of water policy quantitative assessment is advised before implementation of the policies such an approach also provides more insight to policymakers about the consequences of their decisions schuol et al 2008 zang et al 2012 a number of frameworks are available for evaluating the effectiveness and sustainability of water policies examples include the lifecycle assessment framework matohlang mohlotsane et al 2018 finkbeiner 2014 environmental impact analysis beanlands 1983 and sustainability standards with principles criteria and indicators jamshidi 2019 the water footprint accounting wfa framework has recently received attention hoekstra 2019 the wfa originated from the use of blue and green water resources and was proposed by falkenmark and rockstrom 2004 blue water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from the surface water and groundwater while green water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture hoekstra 2019 the wfa framework can reveal the total water consumed in the course of the production of goods or services and has the capacity to be applied for comprehensive and integrated assessment of water and agricultural systems muratoglu et al 2022 its application in conjunction with available water can give valuable information about how water is being consumed its productivity and sustainability hoekstra 2019 another advantage of wfa is that it also considers the interaction between blue and green water veettil and mishra 2018 this feature is important for assessment of policies implemented upstream of a basin to manage green water and track its effect on blue water downstream using these concepts and the interaction of blue and green water jeyrani et al 2021 assessed available basin water under different management and climate scenarios they found that the green water components were more robust for climate variations and concluded that the current policies for dryland farming could be continued in tashk bakhtegan basin in iran for the simulation of the wfa framework integrated process based conceptual hydrological models that facilitate the assessment of water policies in a quantitative manner are crucial for this aim the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 has been shown to be able to simulate a range of hydrological processes affected by water and agricultural policies delavar et al 2020 raeisi et al 2019 applied swat to the effects and side effects of water policies on water savings water productivity and environmental flow at the field and basin scales they emphasized that the indirect effects of water policies are as important as their direct effects and should not be neglected jeyrani et al 2021 demonstrated the ability of the swat model to simulate blue and green water interactions as emphasized in the wfa framework such approaches for the evaluation of water saving policies from the perspective of sustainability are the objective of the current study which focuses on policies that have been proposed in macro level documents from iran the selection of documents has been based on the research of heydari and morid 2020 they evaluated the most recent macro level documents and determined that four of them have the strongest effects on water and agricultural policies in iran see section 2 4 for quantitative evaluation swat was applied in conjunction with an optimization model the tashk bakhtegan tb basin was selected as a case study in order to explore this methodology and the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tb basin fig 1 is located in south central iran to the north of mond basin the tb basin covers an area of 27 523 km2 the highest point is 3900 m above sea level and is located to the west of the basin the lowest point is 1620 m and is located at the margin of tb lake this basin is considered to be a major agricultural hub of the country doroodzan dam one of the oldest dams in iran and the mollasadra and mousivand dams have become operational in recent decades to control flooding provide irrigation and industrial water and generate electricity for the basin the kor river is the main river of the basin it flows into tb lake and has dried up in recent years because of changes in the climate and human consumption results from desertification analyses of tb basin in 1987 and 2013 extracted from landsat satellite images indicated that about 117 000 ha of surface water in the basin including the tb and kaftar lakes had dried up over the 26 year span bigdeli et al 2023 these had become salt pans that were a source of dust see updated report on the comprehensive water plan of maharloo bakhtegan basin 2013 the water flow regime of the river originates from rain and snow in the upper part of kaftar lake and from the rain in the lower part of the basin the climate of the region is semiarid with an annual average rainfall of 216 933 mm and annual average pan evaporation of 1763 2849 mm across the basin moe 2017 this includes a vast agricultural area 412 000 ha that is irrigated using surface 40 and groundwater 60 2 2 swat wfa framework for sustainability analysis fig 2 shows a conceptual framework for the study in accordance with the objectives of this research the methodology has been defined as comprehensive modeling of water resources agriculture systems and management strategies using the swat model analysis of the current sustainability of the basin and after implementation of water saving policies from macro level documents using the wfa framework and the respective indices to explore green water and blue water sustainability assessment of the capacity of the water saving policies using a simulation optimization s o model the sustainability of tb basin system was evaluated under the base condition the current condition of the basin during 2007 2017 as well as after the policies considered in order to determine the optimal pattern of policies for the basin agricultural sector a s o model was developed and applied the objective functions of the optimization model were maximizing water resources sustainability using wfa indices and maximizing the gross income of the agricultural sector 2 3 swat model swat is a physically based model that is continuous over time semi distributed and operates at the basin scale it was designed for predicting the long term effects of various land management practices on the amounts of water sediment and chemical agricultural materials in complex large scale basins arnold et al 1998 the model is open source which makes it possible to be customized with respect to the objectives of a study in order to meet the proper data requirements for the wfa using this feature the original swat model faced limitations especially for groundwater simulation and estimation of water loss from irrigation events to overcome these limitations we applied the swat fars model delavar et al 2020 that had been developed for the study area table 1 provides short descriptions of swat fars modiﬁcations further details are available in delavar et al 2020 the swat fars model requires a relatively large amount of diverse data these include data about the gis layers dem soil and land use climate hydrometrics hydro structural information e g dams water use and agricultural management table 2 shows the types and sources used in the case study tb basin was divided into 56 sub basins and the simulations were done for 1980 2017 the two ﬁrst years of the simulation period were considered as the warm up to investigate the management policies the swat fars model initially was calibrated and validated it should be emphasized that the required inputs for the wfp framework fig 2 were diverse therefore conventional reliance on hydrometric data was insufficient and it was necessary to evaluate the performance of the model for other processes especially actual evapotranspiration in the course of calibration multi variable and multi site calibration were applied using the maximum available observation data this included river discharges groundwater level base flow potential and actual evapotranspiration and crop yield the performance of the model during calibration for the flow simulation was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse moriasi et al 2015 crop yield calibration was done simultaneously with evapotranspiration calibration by using the average yield information of the products in each subbasin 2 4 macro level policies and their simulation by the swat fars model as stated before four iranian macro level documents that have had the strongest effect on water and agriculture policies are selected for this study they include heydari and morid 2020 1 general iranian policies for the agricultural sector 2012 2 general policies for a resilient economy 2013 3 agricultural sector policies for crisis and disaster management and 4 the sixth five year plan for socio economic and cultural development 2017 2021 they mainly focus on saving agricultural water restoring groundwater resources and supplying environmental flows table 3 for this purpose a comprehensive simulation of the policies in the case study area was done to determine their effectiveness for the sustainability of water resources and agricultural systems the method of applying and simulating the selected policies using swat fars model capacities is given in table 3 2 5 sustainability analysis fig 2 shows the wfa framework and its green and blue water scarcity indices as employed to evaluate the effects of water saving policies on the basin sustainability the green water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture and the blue water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from the surface water and groundwater hoekstra 2019 the green water footprint was investigated for agricultural and non agricultural land such as rangelands and forests to perform the analyses of interest the blue water footprint was studied separately for the agricultural land and water bodies the swat model supported these components and their interactions as reported jeyrani et al 2021 2 5 1 green water sustainability the green water scarcity index ws green was calculated as shown in eq 2 to assess the water system sustainability a value of less than 1 indicates that the green water available for agricultural needs mainly rainfed crops is sustainable without causing harm to natural protected areas 2 ws green x t wf green x t wa green x t where wf green is the green water footprint for the agricultural sector wa green is the green water available for the agricultural sector x is the subbasin counter and t is the time period the value of wf green can be obtained from eq 3 and that for wa green from eq 4 to provide these values the swat model was run without irrigation 3 wf green x t et green x t area 1000 4 wa green x t sw green x t area 1000 where area is the surface area of each subbasin et green is the evapotranspiration from the rainwater stored in the soil and sw green is the soil measure received from rainfall hoekstra et al 2011 2 5 2 blue water sustainability the blue water scarcity index ws blue eq 5 is calculated by comparing the blue water footprint for the agricultural sector wf blue eq 6 and the blue water available to the agricultural sector wa blue eq 7 and has been applied to evaluate blue water sustainability in the basin if its value is less than 1 the blue water available for irrigated agricultural consumption is sustainable otherwise over drafting will occur and will mainly harm the groundwater resources as the value was less than 1 the blue water use was deemed sustainable as all the water requirements are provided by subbasin water resources without excessive pressures on groundwater resources pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 5 ws blue x t wf blue x t wa blue x t 6 wf blue x t et irr area 1000 wf green irr x t 7 wa blue x t pcp x t area 1000 wa green x t efr x t industrial and drinking wf where et irr is total evapotranspiration resulting from irrigated area wf green irr is the green water footprint in the irrigated area wa green is the green water available in the basin pcp is the amount of precipitation efr x t is the environmental water requirements of river x or lake x over time period t that has been calculated using the montana method for rivers tennant 1976 for tb lake the total efr x t was 525 mcm per year on average delavar et al 2020 although the water footprint scarcity indices include sub basin analysis they must be generalized to the entire basin only blue water can be evaluated in an area i e sub basin and the downstream water requirements are usually met from upstream sub basins in our case study of the dams as explained by pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 therefore ws blue must by present for the entire basin for m sub basins and n time periods as follows 8 ws blue t 1 n x 1 m wf blue x t t 1 n x 1 m wa blue x t thus the combined value of ws blue of greater than 1 for the basin reveals its unsustainability and vice versa it is possible that sub basins with values of less than 1 hide sub basins with values of greater than 1 in such a case the evaluation of basin sustainability would be inaccurate to tackle this issue the environmental blue water scarcity ws blue env index and black water scarcity index ws black which shows groundwater scarcity also should be implemented to identify such sub basins and their respective periods pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 further ws blue env is defined as the greatest amount of water required for the environmental demand efr x t to the actual volume of the water provided wa blue env x t eq 9 when ws blue env x 1 the environmental water supply for water body x is sustainable 9 ws blue env x max t efr x t wa blue env x t similarly ws black identifies the degree of utilization of the aquifers in a basin and their sustainability it is calculated by comparing the total volume of groundwater extracted ex ground with the total recharge wa blue ground natural recharge plus other sources of recharge such as irrigation return flow in aquifer r as follows pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 10 ws black r t 1 n ex ground r t t 1 n wa blue ground r t if the value of ws black is less than 1 the aquifer management is sustainable if the value is greater than 1 the utilization of the aquifer is greater than its recharge rate for example if the value of ws black is 2 the volume of water extraction will be twice that of its natural recharge 2 6 capacity of water saving policies in order to determine the optimal application of macro policies in the agricultural sector and their capacities to save water the s o model and water footprint based approaches eqs 9 and 10 were applied fig 2 shows that the combination of the swat model and nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 also can be applied to optimize the management approaches provided in the policies the objective function eq 11 of the optimization model is maximizing the water resource sustainability min wsblue and ws black and maximizing the gross income of crop productions i 11 max z i ws blue env ws black where i is the total gross revenue and ws blue env and ws black are the groundwater scarcity and environmental demand indices respectively sect 2 2 2 in order to estimate i in sub basin i the price kg and yield kg ha data net price and yield of crop j have been provided by the agricultural jihad organization of fars province 2014 as 12 i i j 1 n area ij yield ij price ij in this study we implemented the selected water saving policies table 3 in 3 5 levels as shown in table 4 in order to evaluate the capacity of the water saving policies to improve the status of water resources and agricultural systems of the basin the following optimal management scenarios were investigated based on the set of pareto solutions to determine their effects on water resources and agricultural income management scenario 1 focuses on improving the status of water resources i e groundwater extraction and environmental flows management scenario 2 focuses on improving the economic situation or the minimum income reduction the emphasis of this research was on management scenario 1 and the sustainability of water resources attaining sustainability indices of less than 1 however scenario 2 also was assessed to incorporate socio economic criteria because of their importance in the selected macro level documents therefore the paradoxes of these scenarios can be evaluated as well 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model setup and calibration the swat fars model was calibrated and validated using swat cup and sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 as mentioned before the model calibration process was comprehensively done using observed time series of river flow groundwater level and reported crop yields and actual and potential evapotranspiration table 2 the calibration and validation periods are 1983 2005 and 2006 2017 respectively the results of this section for river flows are presented in table 5 which shows the acceptable performance of the model for all of the stations using the r2 ns and rmse fig 3 a and b also show the box plot diagram for observed crop yield and reported evapotranspiration values in comparison with the average simulated values in the study area note that actual evapotranspiration data was not available however for irrigated crops the potential evapotranspiration value has been provided in the national water document this was compared with the simulated average evapotranspiration for fully irrigated crop conditions in each sub basin crop yield calibration was done simultaneously with evapotranspiration calibration by using the average yield information of the products in each sub basin the results show good agreement between the simulated and observed values fig 3 a and b further details about the calibration process are available in delavar et al 2020 3 2 historical sustainability of the basin the status of the basin was first studied during the historical period fig 4 shows a significant breakpoint in the time series of river flows at the outlet of the basin inflows to the lakes the non parametric pettitt test confirmed that after 2006 the basin experienced new behavior on this basis the study period was divided into two sections 1985 2006 and 2007 2017 fig 4 shows the rainfall and actual evaporation eta trends for the entire basin it can be seen that despite the substantial reduction in stream flow the eta time series was steady this could be attributed to over exploitation of groundwater resources as the river flows declined 3 3 sustainability indices to assess the sustainability of tb basin during the two periods the respective indices of green water blue water groundwater and environmental scarcity were calculated using the calibrated swat model the results in fig 5 reveal that except for green water the sustainability of blue water and its components including groundwater and environmental demand further deteriorated in the second period groundwater instability also was detected during the first period this confirms that stable water consumption in the basin put increased pressure on groundwater resources and increased instability furthermore the outflow the main source of water to the lake also was under pressure in the second period 3 4 assessing water saving policies in national documents in this section the capacities of some of national policies policies table 3 for stability of water and agriculture management are evaluated the policies and respected areas throughout the basin are indicated and evaluated by the s o model in another word the model indicates the best policy for each hru and its area throughout the basin to achieve the objectives which required extensive computation cost it is essential to emphasize that for all the policies especially the deficit irrigation and increasing irrigation efficiency the rebound effect is fully controlled by the s o model as raeisi et al 2019 reported the lack of control of this phenomenon would have a negative impact on water saving policies and even increases water consumption 3 4 1 optimal pattern of policies the alternatives of the pareto solutions obtained by nsga ii and the selected management scenarios are shown in fig 6 the corresponding optimal pareto solutions are obtained after 800 generations with a population size of 20 mutation rate of 0 2 and crossover probability of 0 6 having the results of s o model the optimal pattern of the policies and respected implemented areas are shown in figs 7 and 8 it is evident from the figures that achieving the objectives of the management scenario 1 needs a wider range of the areas to be treated by the policies in other word more investment to install modern irrigation systems for larger areas of the basin and water allocation infrastructures as well as institutional arrangements to apply deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns calendar notably all the policies have been incorporated for the scenario 1 while for the scenario 2 increasing incomes only deficit irrigation and increasing irrigation efficiency are fund to be enough effective 3 4 2 capacity of policies for stabilizing basin water budget components the effects of the scenarios proposed in the documents and application of the selected optimum policies to the basin water budget components are shown in fig 9 it is evident that inflows to tb lake increased under management scenarios 1 and 2 however the increase in inflows continued to be insignificant the capacities for the two approaches were 79 and 46 mcm yr respectively although 525 mcm yr was required it is clear that restoration of the lake was more complex than had been predicted by the solutions proposed in the macro level documents scenario 1 i e groundwater restoration reduces withdrawal by 1920 mcm and eventually compensated for part of these resources negative balance 365 and 153 mcm this situation was achieved by 100 expansion of modern irrigation systems extensive changes to cropping patterns and maintaining or increasing deficit irrigation which required huge budgetary investment and institutional water management note the difference between withdrawal and actual consumption in the documents under management scenarios 1 and 2 withdrawal of water resources decreased about 1920 and 700 mcm yr respectively while decreases in agriculture water consumption water depletion was about 482 and 38 mcm yr respectively 3 4 3 gross income and calories in agricultural sector under optimal management fig 10 compares the capacity of change in gross income and calorie production of the basin agricultural sector with current conditions caloric units have been applied to make it possible to sum production by different crops when focusing on improving the state of water resources management scenario 1 and applying optimum strategies in the basin the income of the agricultural sector decreased by about 20 with a change in crop patterns to those with low water consumption and appropriate calories substitution of rice with wheat and barley the basin was able to maintain its caloric production the paradox for crops like rice is evident in the figure the decrease in the calories produced was simultaneous with an increase in income 3 4 4 capacity of policies for improving sustainability indices fig 11 shows the sustainability assessment in terms of blue water including groundwater and environmental demand and green water indices for the two management scenarios the figure illustrates how the indices have changed under each management scenario in the period 2007 2017 their relative changes are also compared to the base scenario before optimization i e arrows the blue water sustainability indices examine the status of environmental flows and groundwater it can be seen that the groundwater shortage index under the management scenario 1 decreased about 27 6 and led to sustainability in the basin fig 11 this was not the case for scenario 2 as stated the environmental demand index decreased slightly under both management conditions neither scenario fell into the sustainable range however but were above the basin environmental sustainability threshold the results showed that the changes in the green water sustainability index were not significant under both scenarios 3 4 5 evaluation of policies for changes in cultivated area for blue water sustainability as shown even the best implementation of macro level policies in favor of water resources scenario 1 failed to achieve sustainability of blue water resources or meet the required environmental water for tb basin the summery of previous results are shown in table 6 in this section a reduction in the area cultivated also was added to indicate the extent to which such an aggressive policy is required to achieve sustainability of the basin accordingly the sustainability indices table 6 and the water balance components fig 12 also were calculated it can be seen that meeting the sustainability of ground water resources and lake water required the optimal combination of policies plus a reduction of at least 20 in the cultivation area this occurred under optimal management and full control of the rebound effect no increase in water consumption and maintenance of current deficit irrigation if this could not be controlled the reduction in crop area should be expanded to 28 4 discussion the current study quantitatively investigated the capacity of iranian macro level documents to achieve sustainability in water resources the policies most frequently outlined in the documents were retrieved and evaluated these were deficit irrigation increased irrigation efficiency changes in cropping patterns and shifting the crop calendar a comprehensive approach was developed by linking the swat model as an optimization model and the water footprint sustainability indices for the considered evaluations the use of this platform and optimal implementation of the foreseen policies throughout the tb basin allowed the assessment of the macro level documents for two management scenarios 1 improving the status of water resources and 2 improving the economic situation and minimizing income loss the following results were obtained evaluation of the tb basin showed a breakpoint in the sustainability indices in 2008 such that the blue water groundwater and environmental scarcity indices deteriorated dramatically from 0 79 to 1 1 for the blue water index and 0 9 1 24 for the environmental demand index this illustrates that policies should not be evaluated solely on long term historical information temporal changes must be considered as well the blue water sustainability indices which reveal the status of environmental flows and groundwater showed that the groundwater shortage index decreased by about 27 6 under scenario 1 and led to the sustainability of the basin however the environmental demand index remained above 1 which was unsustainable for the basin environment this illustrates that the macro level policies had insufficient capacity to secure environmental flows although this issue has been one of their objectives similar results have been reported by farrokhnia et al 2018 for urmia lake iran they showed that some of the water saving policies applied to restore urmia lake had negative impacts on groundwater resources similarly the water saving policies in the imperial irrigation district in california caused deterioration of environmental flows to the salton sea scott 2014 the effectiveness of water saving policies in the macro level documents was assessed by two fundamental assumptions of controlling the rebound effect and distinguishing between water depletion and water withdrawal these issues have not been clearly defined in the documents for example under scenarios 1 and 2 withdrawal of water resources decreased by about 1920 and 700 mcm yr respectively but decreases in agricultural water consumption i e water depletion were about 482 and 38 mcm yr respectively it was shown that improving the water sustainability of the basin can maintain its caloric production rates with the substitution of low water consumption crops that provide appropriate calories however at least a 20 reduction in the basin s agricultural income would result this will have social and political consequences that must be considered in future documents raeisi et al 2019 in general the macro level policies under scenario 1 have the potential to create sustainability of groundwater resources while maintaining caloric production however the policies do not have the capacity to maintain current income levels or restore the lake as representative of the environmental sustainability of the basin more aggressive policies are needed to accomplish this thus a reduction in the amount of area cultivated should be added to the aforementioned policies this would result in an increase of 20 28 for the reduction in the area cultivated to maintain the sustainability of the tb basin environment depending on how rebound effects are controlled water saving rebound effects also have been reported by dumont et al 2013 they showed that the consequences of improving the irrigation efficiency in spain could actually increase water consumption due to the rebound effect similarly these issues have been considered by the fao regarding investment in modernizing irrigation systems for water saving perry et al 2017 the proposed modeling framework can provide the relevant quantitative information for the evaluation of macro level policies prior to implementation the swat model makes it possible to simulate a varied spectrum of policies in an integrated framework it also has the ability to optimize the application of policies with regard to temporal and spatial effects and show the results as water footprint indices that are more relevant for policy making of course such an application requires more expertize it is particularly necessary to calibrate and evaluate the performance of the model for the different hydrological processes that would be affected by the policies finally the presented framework is an appropriate tool requiring relatively accessible data and is strongly recommended for wider applications 5 conclusions the results of this study revealed that some important points had not been sufficiently considered while preparing the macro level documents these have been addressed in a quantitative manner that provides more insight to policy makers the most critical were the capacity of policies for saving water improving environmental flow and groundwater restoration should be assessed in an integrated framework in another words none of them should have negative consequences for the others the effectiveness of water saving policies in the macro level documents e g investment in the development of modern irrigation systems changing cropping pattern greenhouses etc depends on insuring the reduction of water depletion i e actual evapotranspiration furthermore controlling the rebound effect is a serious challenge which requires improved water allocation management with relevant infrastructures and institutional arrangements any lack in this regard can actually increase water consumption in the definition of water productivity and its indices reduction of depletion should be a major component sole reliance on reduction of withdrawal can lead to incorrect decisions it is fortunate that the documents have attempted to secure environmental flows however it was shown that they are insufficient to achieve the indicated objectives to address some of the weaknesses that were found in the macro level documents strategic concepts like water resources carrying capacity and sustainability should play greater roles in the formulation of water policies application of the suggested integrated modeling and its capacity to track water budget components as well as simulate the hydrological processes at the field and basin scales is a wise approach to assessing the effectiveness of policies and their possible negative side effects it is an action that prevents investment in weak policies that is done to insure water resources sustainability note that our literature review showed similar problems have been reported in other studies therefore the presented methodology and aforementioned recommendations should be widely considered especially in those countries that are more threatened by water shortages declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8968,sustainable water resources management is a main objective of government macro level documents assessments of such documents should be performed before their implementation because they may be ineffective or even result in negative consequences the current study quantitatively determined the capacity of four important iranian macro level documents and their policies to achieve sustainability for water resources commonly considered measures include a expansion of modern irrigation systems b change in the cropping pattern c change in the cropping date and d deficit irrigation a comprehensive approach was developed by linking the swat optimization model and water footprint sustainability indices for the assessments the two management scenarios examined were 1 improving the status of water resources and 2 improving the economic situation or minimizing income loss the tashk bakhtegan tb basin was selected as a pilot study to explore the effectiveness of the methodology and assessment of the documents the results showed that under scenario 1 the policies from the documents had the capacity to improve the blue sustainability indices of the basin but they were unable to meet the environmental water demand the policy for scenario 2 was associated with a decrease in the level of income in the agricultural sector and a decrease in the area cultivated it was found that a 20 28 reduction in the cultivated area was required for the sustainability of the tb basin environment it was shown that the approaches in the documents had the potential for improving the sustainability of water resources however their capacity was insufficient and their success depended on issues such as the ability for effective water allocation and control of rebound effects as well as compensation for economic loss this was crucial for consideration of future macro level documents the proposed modeling framework can be strongly recommended for wider applications keywords macro level document water sustainability water foot print swat model iran data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainable water resources management must consider long term future demand and supply in addition to current conditions without system degradation loucks 2000 accordingly a disruption in supply and demand continuous decrease in groundwater resources and a lack of environmental flow all can be indicators of unsustainability to address this issue governments usually provide policies in the form of macro level documents pre assessment of such documents before implementation is crucial since they could be too weak to address existing challenges or even produce contradictory results or negative side effects raeisi et al 2019 these concerns can threaten the objectives of the documents and achievement of the intended objectives the discovery of misleading or erroneous directives in water policies after their implementation has been reported by researchers for example qureshi et al 2011 examined water use and economic efficiency in the murray darling basin in australia the goal was to increase the environmental flow through subsidized investment in improving the irrigation efficiency the results showed that this policy was not cost effective compared to other alternatives such as buying water through water markets dumont et al 2013 reported the consequences of improving the irrigation efficiency in spain and warned that this policy may even increase water consumption due to a phenomenon called the rebound effect or jevons paradox the possibility of an increase in resource consumption due to an increase in efficiency similarly berbel et al 2015 reviewed water saving policies in spain as well as their impacts on energy consumption they concluded that the results of the available empirical evidence and the published theoretical research were diverse and to some extent contradictory they recommended that the government should consider the dynamic effects of such investments as well as economic instruments for the prevention of negative outcomes these issues also have been considered by the food and agriculture organization in a discussion paper entitled does improved irrigation technology save water perry et al 2017 regarding investment in modernizing irrigation systems for reducing water consumption they emphasized the application of a water accounting system for smart water saving policies moreover they stated that governments should avoid investment in the absence of prior control over water allocations as stated by berbel et al 2018 and bigdeli et al 2023 the lack of such an infrastructure could increase the crop area compensate for deficit irrigation and change the cropping pattern in favor of more water intensive crops another issue that is crucial to water policies is integration there is evidence that concentration on one sector such as the restoration of lakes or groundwater resources can have a negative effect on other sectors for example farokhnia et al 2018 showed that some of the policies applied to increase water flow to urmia lake iran lowered the recharge of groundwater resources similarly the water saving policies implemented in the imperial irrigation district in california which aimed for water transfer to the city of san diego eventually caused deterioration of environmental flows into the salton sea scott 2014 the scale of analysis is another issue that requires consideration zhou et al 2021 investigated water saving irrigation over the past 40 years by applying remotely sensed data they showed that the results changed depending on the scale of the study for example at field scale water saving technologies failed to save water because the increase in accumulated return flow was greater than the decrease in accumulated non beneficial water consumption at the same time the accumulated increase in beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeded regional water savings which illustrates the paradox between widely applied water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortages when considering such fundamental aspects of water policy quantitative assessment is advised before implementation of the policies such an approach also provides more insight to policymakers about the consequences of their decisions schuol et al 2008 zang et al 2012 a number of frameworks are available for evaluating the effectiveness and sustainability of water policies examples include the lifecycle assessment framework matohlang mohlotsane et al 2018 finkbeiner 2014 environmental impact analysis beanlands 1983 and sustainability standards with principles criteria and indicators jamshidi 2019 the water footprint accounting wfa framework has recently received attention hoekstra 2019 the wfa originated from the use of blue and green water resources and was proposed by falkenmark and rockstrom 2004 blue water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from the surface water and groundwater while green water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture hoekstra 2019 the wfa framework can reveal the total water consumed in the course of the production of goods or services and has the capacity to be applied for comprehensive and integrated assessment of water and agricultural systems muratoglu et al 2022 its application in conjunction with available water can give valuable information about how water is being consumed its productivity and sustainability hoekstra 2019 another advantage of wfa is that it also considers the interaction between blue and green water veettil and mishra 2018 this feature is important for assessment of policies implemented upstream of a basin to manage green water and track its effect on blue water downstream using these concepts and the interaction of blue and green water jeyrani et al 2021 assessed available basin water under different management and climate scenarios they found that the green water components were more robust for climate variations and concluded that the current policies for dryland farming could be continued in tashk bakhtegan basin in iran for the simulation of the wfa framework integrated process based conceptual hydrological models that facilitate the assessment of water policies in a quantitative manner are crucial for this aim the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 has been shown to be able to simulate a range of hydrological processes affected by water and agricultural policies delavar et al 2020 raeisi et al 2019 applied swat to the effects and side effects of water policies on water savings water productivity and environmental flow at the field and basin scales they emphasized that the indirect effects of water policies are as important as their direct effects and should not be neglected jeyrani et al 2021 demonstrated the ability of the swat model to simulate blue and green water interactions as emphasized in the wfa framework such approaches for the evaluation of water saving policies from the perspective of sustainability are the objective of the current study which focuses on policies that have been proposed in macro level documents from iran the selection of documents has been based on the research of heydari and morid 2020 they evaluated the most recent macro level documents and determined that four of them have the strongest effects on water and agricultural policies in iran see section 2 4 for quantitative evaluation swat was applied in conjunction with an optimization model the tashk bakhtegan tb basin was selected as a case study in order to explore this methodology and the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tb basin fig 1 is located in south central iran to the north of mond basin the tb basin covers an area of 27 523 km2 the highest point is 3900 m above sea level and is located to the west of the basin the lowest point is 1620 m and is located at the margin of tb lake this basin is considered to be a major agricultural hub of the country doroodzan dam one of the oldest dams in iran and the mollasadra and mousivand dams have become operational in recent decades to control flooding provide irrigation and industrial water and generate electricity for the basin the kor river is the main river of the basin it flows into tb lake and has dried up in recent years because of changes in the climate and human consumption results from desertification analyses of tb basin in 1987 and 2013 extracted from landsat satellite images indicated that about 117 000 ha of surface water in the basin including the tb and kaftar lakes had dried up over the 26 year span bigdeli et al 2023 these had become salt pans that were a source of dust see updated report on the comprehensive water plan of maharloo bakhtegan basin 2013 the water flow regime of the river originates from rain and snow in the upper part of kaftar lake and from the rain in the lower part of the basin the climate of the region is semiarid with an annual average rainfall of 216 933 mm and annual average pan evaporation of 1763 2849 mm across the basin moe 2017 this includes a vast agricultural area 412 000 ha that is irrigated using surface 40 and groundwater 60 2 2 swat wfa framework for sustainability analysis fig 2 shows a conceptual framework for the study in accordance with the objectives of this research the methodology has been defined as comprehensive modeling of water resources agriculture systems and management strategies using the swat model analysis of the current sustainability of the basin and after implementation of water saving policies from macro level documents using the wfa framework and the respective indices to explore green water and blue water sustainability assessment of the capacity of the water saving policies using a simulation optimization s o model the sustainability of tb basin system was evaluated under the base condition the current condition of the basin during 2007 2017 as well as after the policies considered in order to determine the optimal pattern of policies for the basin agricultural sector a s o model was developed and applied the objective functions of the optimization model were maximizing water resources sustainability using wfa indices and maximizing the gross income of the agricultural sector 2 3 swat model swat is a physically based model that is continuous over time semi distributed and operates at the basin scale it was designed for predicting the long term effects of various land management practices on the amounts of water sediment and chemical agricultural materials in complex large scale basins arnold et al 1998 the model is open source which makes it possible to be customized with respect to the objectives of a study in order to meet the proper data requirements for the wfa using this feature the original swat model faced limitations especially for groundwater simulation and estimation of water loss from irrigation events to overcome these limitations we applied the swat fars model delavar et al 2020 that had been developed for the study area table 1 provides short descriptions of swat fars modiﬁcations further details are available in delavar et al 2020 the swat fars model requires a relatively large amount of diverse data these include data about the gis layers dem soil and land use climate hydrometrics hydro structural information e g dams water use and agricultural management table 2 shows the types and sources used in the case study tb basin was divided into 56 sub basins and the simulations were done for 1980 2017 the two ﬁrst years of the simulation period were considered as the warm up to investigate the management policies the swat fars model initially was calibrated and validated it should be emphasized that the required inputs for the wfp framework fig 2 were diverse therefore conventional reliance on hydrometric data was insufficient and it was necessary to evaluate the performance of the model for other processes especially actual evapotranspiration in the course of calibration multi variable and multi site calibration were applied using the maximum available observation data this included river discharges groundwater level base flow potential and actual evapotranspiration and crop yield the performance of the model during calibration for the flow simulation was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse moriasi et al 2015 crop yield calibration was done simultaneously with evapotranspiration calibration by using the average yield information of the products in each subbasin 2 4 macro level policies and their simulation by the swat fars model as stated before four iranian macro level documents that have had the strongest effect on water and agriculture policies are selected for this study they include heydari and morid 2020 1 general iranian policies for the agricultural sector 2012 2 general policies for a resilient economy 2013 3 agricultural sector policies for crisis and disaster management and 4 the sixth five year plan for socio economic and cultural development 2017 2021 they mainly focus on saving agricultural water restoring groundwater resources and supplying environmental flows table 3 for this purpose a comprehensive simulation of the policies in the case study area was done to determine their effectiveness for the sustainability of water resources and agricultural systems the method of applying and simulating the selected policies using swat fars model capacities is given in table 3 2 5 sustainability analysis fig 2 shows the wfa framework and its green and blue water scarcity indices as employed to evaluate the effects of water saving policies on the basin sustainability the green water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture and the blue water footprint is the volume of water that has evaporated from the surface water and groundwater hoekstra 2019 the green water footprint was investigated for agricultural and non agricultural land such as rangelands and forests to perform the analyses of interest the blue water footprint was studied separately for the agricultural land and water bodies the swat model supported these components and their interactions as reported jeyrani et al 2021 2 5 1 green water sustainability the green water scarcity index ws green was calculated as shown in eq 2 to assess the water system sustainability a value of less than 1 indicates that the green water available for agricultural needs mainly rainfed crops is sustainable without causing harm to natural protected areas 2 ws green x t wf green x t wa green x t where wf green is the green water footprint for the agricultural sector wa green is the green water available for the agricultural sector x is the subbasin counter and t is the time period the value of wf green can be obtained from eq 3 and that for wa green from eq 4 to provide these values the swat model was run without irrigation 3 wf green x t et green x t area 1000 4 wa green x t sw green x t area 1000 where area is the surface area of each subbasin et green is the evapotranspiration from the rainwater stored in the soil and sw green is the soil measure received from rainfall hoekstra et al 2011 2 5 2 blue water sustainability the blue water scarcity index ws blue eq 5 is calculated by comparing the blue water footprint for the agricultural sector wf blue eq 6 and the blue water available to the agricultural sector wa blue eq 7 and has been applied to evaluate blue water sustainability in the basin if its value is less than 1 the blue water available for irrigated agricultural consumption is sustainable otherwise over drafting will occur and will mainly harm the groundwater resources as the value was less than 1 the blue water use was deemed sustainable as all the water requirements are provided by subbasin water resources without excessive pressures on groundwater resources pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 5 ws blue x t wf blue x t wa blue x t 6 wf blue x t et irr area 1000 wf green irr x t 7 wa blue x t pcp x t area 1000 wa green x t efr x t industrial and drinking wf where et irr is total evapotranspiration resulting from irrigated area wf green irr is the green water footprint in the irrigated area wa green is the green water available in the basin pcp is the amount of precipitation efr x t is the environmental water requirements of river x or lake x over time period t that has been calculated using the montana method for rivers tennant 1976 for tb lake the total efr x t was 525 mcm per year on average delavar et al 2020 although the water footprint scarcity indices include sub basin analysis they must be generalized to the entire basin only blue water can be evaluated in an area i e sub basin and the downstream water requirements are usually met from upstream sub basins in our case study of the dams as explained by pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 therefore ws blue must by present for the entire basin for m sub basins and n time periods as follows 8 ws blue t 1 n x 1 m wf blue x t t 1 n x 1 m wa blue x t thus the combined value of ws blue of greater than 1 for the basin reveals its unsustainability and vice versa it is possible that sub basins with values of less than 1 hide sub basins with values of greater than 1 in such a case the evaluation of basin sustainability would be inaccurate to tackle this issue the environmental blue water scarcity ws blue env index and black water scarcity index ws black which shows groundwater scarcity also should be implemented to identify such sub basins and their respective periods pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 further ws blue env is defined as the greatest amount of water required for the environmental demand efr x t to the actual volume of the water provided wa blue env x t eq 9 when ws blue env x 1 the environmental water supply for water body x is sustainable 9 ws blue env x max t efr x t wa blue env x t similarly ws black identifies the degree of utilization of the aquifers in a basin and their sustainability it is calculated by comparing the total volume of groundwater extracted ex ground with the total recharge wa blue ground natural recharge plus other sources of recharge such as irrigation return flow in aquifer r as follows pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 10 ws black r t 1 n ex ground r t t 1 n wa blue ground r t if the value of ws black is less than 1 the aquifer management is sustainable if the value is greater than 1 the utilization of the aquifer is greater than its recharge rate for example if the value of ws black is 2 the volume of water extraction will be twice that of its natural recharge 2 6 capacity of water saving policies in order to determine the optimal application of macro policies in the agricultural sector and their capacities to save water the s o model and water footprint based approaches eqs 9 and 10 were applied fig 2 shows that the combination of the swat model and nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 also can be applied to optimize the management approaches provided in the policies the objective function eq 11 of the optimization model is maximizing the water resource sustainability min wsblue and ws black and maximizing the gross income of crop productions i 11 max z i ws blue env ws black where i is the total gross revenue and ws blue env and ws black are the groundwater scarcity and environmental demand indices respectively sect 2 2 2 in order to estimate i in sub basin i the price kg and yield kg ha data net price and yield of crop j have been provided by the agricultural jihad organization of fars province 2014 as 12 i i j 1 n area ij yield ij price ij in this study we implemented the selected water saving policies table 3 in 3 5 levels as shown in table 4 in order to evaluate the capacity of the water saving policies to improve the status of water resources and agricultural systems of the basin the following optimal management scenarios were investigated based on the set of pareto solutions to determine their effects on water resources and agricultural income management scenario 1 focuses on improving the status of water resources i e groundwater extraction and environmental flows management scenario 2 focuses on improving the economic situation or the minimum income reduction the emphasis of this research was on management scenario 1 and the sustainability of water resources attaining sustainability indices of less than 1 however scenario 2 also was assessed to incorporate socio economic criteria because of their importance in the selected macro level documents therefore the paradoxes of these scenarios can be evaluated as well 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model setup and calibration the swat fars model was calibrated and validated using swat cup and sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 as mentioned before the model calibration process was comprehensively done using observed time series of river flow groundwater level and reported crop yields and actual and potential evapotranspiration table 2 the calibration and validation periods are 1983 2005 and 2006 2017 respectively the results of this section for river flows are presented in table 5 which shows the acceptable performance of the model for all of the stations using the r2 ns and rmse fig 3 a and b also show the box plot diagram for observed crop yield and reported evapotranspiration values in comparison with the average simulated values in the study area note that actual evapotranspiration data was not available however for irrigated crops the potential evapotranspiration value has been provided in the national water document this was compared with the simulated average evapotranspiration for fully irrigated crop conditions in each sub basin crop yield calibration was done simultaneously with evapotranspiration calibration by using the average yield information of the products in each sub basin the results show good agreement between the simulated and observed values fig 3 a and b further details about the calibration process are available in delavar et al 2020 3 2 historical sustainability of the basin the status of the basin was first studied during the historical period fig 4 shows a significant breakpoint in the time series of river flows at the outlet of the basin inflows to the lakes the non parametric pettitt test confirmed that after 2006 the basin experienced new behavior on this basis the study period was divided into two sections 1985 2006 and 2007 2017 fig 4 shows the rainfall and actual evaporation eta trends for the entire basin it can be seen that despite the substantial reduction in stream flow the eta time series was steady this could be attributed to over exploitation of groundwater resources as the river flows declined 3 3 sustainability indices to assess the sustainability of tb basin during the two periods the respective indices of green water blue water groundwater and environmental scarcity were calculated using the calibrated swat model the results in fig 5 reveal that except for green water the sustainability of blue water and its components including groundwater and environmental demand further deteriorated in the second period groundwater instability also was detected during the first period this confirms that stable water consumption in the basin put increased pressure on groundwater resources and increased instability furthermore the outflow the main source of water to the lake also was under pressure in the second period 3 4 assessing water saving policies in national documents in this section the capacities of some of national policies policies table 3 for stability of water and agriculture management are evaluated the policies and respected areas throughout the basin are indicated and evaluated by the s o model in another word the model indicates the best policy for each hru and its area throughout the basin to achieve the objectives which required extensive computation cost it is essential to emphasize that for all the policies especially the deficit irrigation and increasing irrigation efficiency the rebound effect is fully controlled by the s o model as raeisi et al 2019 reported the lack of control of this phenomenon would have a negative impact on water saving policies and even increases water consumption 3 4 1 optimal pattern of policies the alternatives of the pareto solutions obtained by nsga ii and the selected management scenarios are shown in fig 6 the corresponding optimal pareto solutions are obtained after 800 generations with a population size of 20 mutation rate of 0 2 and crossover probability of 0 6 having the results of s o model the optimal pattern of the policies and respected implemented areas are shown in figs 7 and 8 it is evident from the figures that achieving the objectives of the management scenario 1 needs a wider range of the areas to be treated by the policies in other word more investment to install modern irrigation systems for larger areas of the basin and water allocation infrastructures as well as institutional arrangements to apply deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns calendar notably all the policies have been incorporated for the scenario 1 while for the scenario 2 increasing incomes only deficit irrigation and increasing irrigation efficiency are fund to be enough effective 3 4 2 capacity of policies for stabilizing basin water budget components the effects of the scenarios proposed in the documents and application of the selected optimum policies to the basin water budget components are shown in fig 9 it is evident that inflows to tb lake increased under management scenarios 1 and 2 however the increase in inflows continued to be insignificant the capacities for the two approaches were 79 and 46 mcm yr respectively although 525 mcm yr was required it is clear that restoration of the lake was more complex than had been predicted by the solutions proposed in the macro level documents scenario 1 i e groundwater restoration reduces withdrawal by 1920 mcm and eventually compensated for part of these resources negative balance 365 and 153 mcm this situation was achieved by 100 expansion of modern irrigation systems extensive changes to cropping patterns and maintaining or increasing deficit irrigation which required huge budgetary investment and institutional water management note the difference between withdrawal and actual consumption in the documents under management scenarios 1 and 2 withdrawal of water resources decreased about 1920 and 700 mcm yr respectively while decreases in agriculture water consumption water depletion was about 482 and 38 mcm yr respectively 3 4 3 gross income and calories in agricultural sector under optimal management fig 10 compares the capacity of change in gross income and calorie production of the basin agricultural sector with current conditions caloric units have been applied to make it possible to sum production by different crops when focusing on improving the state of water resources management scenario 1 and applying optimum strategies in the basin the income of the agricultural sector decreased by about 20 with a change in crop patterns to those with low water consumption and appropriate calories substitution of rice with wheat and barley the basin was able to maintain its caloric production the paradox for crops like rice is evident in the figure the decrease in the calories produced was simultaneous with an increase in income 3 4 4 capacity of policies for improving sustainability indices fig 11 shows the sustainability assessment in terms of blue water including groundwater and environmental demand and green water indices for the two management scenarios the figure illustrates how the indices have changed under each management scenario in the period 2007 2017 their relative changes are also compared to the base scenario before optimization i e arrows the blue water sustainability indices examine the status of environmental flows and groundwater it can be seen that the groundwater shortage index under the management scenario 1 decreased about 27 6 and led to sustainability in the basin fig 11 this was not the case for scenario 2 as stated the environmental demand index decreased slightly under both management conditions neither scenario fell into the sustainable range however but were above the basin environmental sustainability threshold the results showed that the changes in the green water sustainability index were not significant under both scenarios 3 4 5 evaluation of policies for changes in cultivated area for blue water sustainability as shown even the best implementation of macro level policies in favor of water resources scenario 1 failed to achieve sustainability of blue water resources or meet the required environmental water for tb basin the summery of previous results are shown in table 6 in this section a reduction in the area cultivated also was added to indicate the extent to which such an aggressive policy is required to achieve sustainability of the basin accordingly the sustainability indices table 6 and the water balance components fig 12 also were calculated it can be seen that meeting the sustainability of ground water resources and lake water required the optimal combination of policies plus a reduction of at least 20 in the cultivation area this occurred under optimal management and full control of the rebound effect no increase in water consumption and maintenance of current deficit irrigation if this could not be controlled the reduction in crop area should be expanded to 28 4 discussion the current study quantitatively investigated the capacity of iranian macro level documents to achieve sustainability in water resources the policies most frequently outlined in the documents were retrieved and evaluated these were deficit irrigation increased irrigation efficiency changes in cropping patterns and shifting the crop calendar a comprehensive approach was developed by linking the swat model as an optimization model and the water footprint sustainability indices for the considered evaluations the use of this platform and optimal implementation of the foreseen policies throughout the tb basin allowed the assessment of the macro level documents for two management scenarios 1 improving the status of water resources and 2 improving the economic situation and minimizing income loss the following results were obtained evaluation of the tb basin showed a breakpoint in the sustainability indices in 2008 such that the blue water groundwater and environmental scarcity indices deteriorated dramatically from 0 79 to 1 1 for the blue water index and 0 9 1 24 for the environmental demand index this illustrates that policies should not be evaluated solely on long term historical information temporal changes must be considered as well the blue water sustainability indices which reveal the status of environmental flows and groundwater showed that the groundwater shortage index decreased by about 27 6 under scenario 1 and led to the sustainability of the basin however the environmental demand index remained above 1 which was unsustainable for the basin environment this illustrates that the macro level policies had insufficient capacity to secure environmental flows although this issue has been one of their objectives similar results have been reported by farrokhnia et al 2018 for urmia lake iran they showed that some of the water saving policies applied to restore urmia lake had negative impacts on groundwater resources similarly the water saving policies in the imperial irrigation district in california caused deterioration of environmental flows to the salton sea scott 2014 the effectiveness of water saving policies in the macro level documents was assessed by two fundamental assumptions of controlling the rebound effect and distinguishing between water depletion and water withdrawal these issues have not been clearly defined in the documents for example under scenarios 1 and 2 withdrawal of water resources decreased by about 1920 and 700 mcm yr respectively but decreases in agricultural water consumption i e water depletion were about 482 and 38 mcm yr respectively it was shown that improving the water sustainability of the basin can maintain its caloric production rates with the substitution of low water consumption crops that provide appropriate calories however at least a 20 reduction in the basin s agricultural income would result this will have social and political consequences that must be considered in future documents raeisi et al 2019 in general the macro level policies under scenario 1 have the potential to create sustainability of groundwater resources while maintaining caloric production however the policies do not have the capacity to maintain current income levels or restore the lake as representative of the environmental sustainability of the basin more aggressive policies are needed to accomplish this thus a reduction in the amount of area cultivated should be added to the aforementioned policies this would result in an increase of 20 28 for the reduction in the area cultivated to maintain the sustainability of the tb basin environment depending on how rebound effects are controlled water saving rebound effects also have been reported by dumont et al 2013 they showed that the consequences of improving the irrigation efficiency in spain could actually increase water consumption due to the rebound effect similarly these issues have been considered by the fao regarding investment in modernizing irrigation systems for water saving perry et al 2017 the proposed modeling framework can provide the relevant quantitative information for the evaluation of macro level policies prior to implementation the swat model makes it possible to simulate a varied spectrum of policies in an integrated framework it also has the ability to optimize the application of policies with regard to temporal and spatial effects and show the results as water footprint indices that are more relevant for policy making of course such an application requires more expertize it is particularly necessary to calibrate and evaluate the performance of the model for the different hydrological processes that would be affected by the policies finally the presented framework is an appropriate tool requiring relatively accessible data and is strongly recommended for wider applications 5 conclusions the results of this study revealed that some important points had not been sufficiently considered while preparing the macro level documents these have been addressed in a quantitative manner that provides more insight to policy makers the most critical were the capacity of policies for saving water improving environmental flow and groundwater restoration should be assessed in an integrated framework in another words none of them should have negative consequences for the others the effectiveness of water saving policies in the macro level documents e g investment in the development of modern irrigation systems changing cropping pattern greenhouses etc depends on insuring the reduction of water depletion i e actual evapotranspiration furthermore controlling the rebound effect is a serious challenge which requires improved water allocation management with relevant infrastructures and institutional arrangements any lack in this regard can actually increase water consumption in the definition of water productivity and its indices reduction of depletion should be a major component sole reliance on reduction of withdrawal can lead to incorrect decisions it is fortunate that the documents have attempted to secure environmental flows however it was shown that they are insufficient to achieve the indicated objectives to address some of the weaknesses that were found in the macro level documents strategic concepts like water resources carrying capacity and sustainability should play greater roles in the formulation of water policies application of the suggested integrated modeling and its capacity to track water budget components as well as simulate the hydrological processes at the field and basin scales is a wise approach to assessing the effectiveness of policies and their possible negative side effects it is an action that prevents investment in weak policies that is done to insure water resources sustainability note that our literature review showed similar problems have been reported in other studies therefore the presented methodology and aforementioned recommendations should be widely considered especially in those countries that are more threatened by water shortages declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8969,the water footprint wf of crop production is a measure of the volumes of blue water irrigation water and green water effective precipitation consumed during crop growth setting the wf benchmarks of crop production in an irrigation district exploring the optimal tillage practices and clearly specifying blue and green water saving potentials wsps are essential for efficient utilization and reasonable allocation of agricultural water resources however related studies disregarded the wf benchmark setting according to tillage practices and the corresponding wsps at the irrigation district scale meanwhile the evaluation of wsp is limited to blue water considering summer maize and winter wheat grown in baojixia irrigation district bid of shaanxi province in china as the study case this study aims to evaluate the gross irrigation wsp actual blue and green wsps based on crop wf simulation and wf benchmark setting for the best tillage practice eighteen water saving tillage practice scenarios were set considering three irrigation techniques three irrigation strategies and two mulching practices results show that crop responses to different tillage practices differ maize wf has low sensitivity whereas wheat wf shows a significant difference following a change in irrigation techniques in the practice under 40 deficit irrigation with no mulching there is the highest actual wsps but at the cost of at least 57 reduction in crop yield whereas the practice of 20 deficit irrigation furrow irrigation and mulching has no yield reduction and relatively low wf which can save 20 blue water and 8 12 green water in the bid which is the optimal balance point between the yield and water consumption of the two crops from the perspective of crop wf this study quantified the agricultural wsps of different water resources and formulated a method for evaluating agricultural wsps based on set wf benchmarks to provide reference for building a water saving culture and sustainable development graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation techniques irrigation strategies water footprint benchmarking water saving potential data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is performed on 28 of the arable land produces 46 of the food globally and accounts for 70 of freshwater withdrawal fao 2011 grafton et al 2018 nagaraj et al 2020 irrigation is an important way of enhancing crop production and closing the yield gap particularly in arid regions with severe water scarcity mueller et al 2012 rosa et al 2018 2020 given the gradual increase in population and consumption food and water security are under serious threat however according to davis et al 2017 the current global food production has neither maximized yield nor minimized water use in this context how to realize the larger crop yield with less water become an essential key point to solve the problem of food and water security therefore the accurate evaluation of water saving potential wsp under varies practices and well defined the best tillage practices in agricultural production is a foundation work to promoting sustainable agricultural development gross wsp refers to the difference between gross irrigation water before and after the implementation of water saving irrigation practices that is the decrease in water required or intook cui and liu 2015 it is generated by irrigation quota s reduction and the improvement of irrigation efficiency mainly reflecting the decrease of blue water required adjusting irrigation schemes and optimizing plantation structures can effectively reduce irrigation water use under the premise of guaranteed yield and profitat different spatial scales hu et al 2010 zhang and guo 2016 uygan et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 solgi et al 2022 li et al 2022 yin et al 2022 meanwhile considering the spatio temporal variability of hydrogeological elements and the reuse of return flow the concept of actual wsp which refers to the wsp from the perspective of water consumption was gradually proposed the gross wsp focuses on only irrigation water supply requirement reductions whereas the actual wsp shows the reduction potentials of crop evapotranspiration which consists of not only the irrigation water consumption but also the appropriation of rainwater during the crop growing period peng et al 2009 raeisi et al 2019 wu et al 2019 huang et al 2020 and wei et al 2022 found that crop evapotranspiration et can be decreased significantly by improving the irrigation and management technology past related studies quantified the crop wsp from the perspective of total crop et and did not distinguish the sources of wsp green water resources rainfall that is stored in unsaturated soil and utilized in crop production falkenmark 1997 are the main source of water for crop production and for maintenance of the natural ecological system schyns et al 2019 limitless consumption of green water resources owing to human activities will damage the ecosystem therefore based on the past total crop et considering green wsp in the evaluation of wsp is essential to assessing water resource shortage and food security the water footprint wf of crop production provides an effective tool for quantifying and distinguishing actual wsp and its sources including blue wf consumption of irrigation water and green wf consumption of effective precipitation hoekstra 2003 hoekstra et al 2011 crop wf benchmark hoekstra et al 2011 refers to a target for wf reduction and is an important parameter for evaluating crop productivity and wsp presently there are two ways of determining the crop wf benchmark one is a statistical analysis method based on yield accumulation mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 wang et al 2019 gao et al 2020 the other one is based on the optimal tillage technical analysis method which has limited application chukalla et al 2015 2017 zhuo and hoekstra 2017 however their evaluation was at field scale and there was no clear indication of the wf benchmark under the optimal tillage practice for a certain area to provide a water saving standard and practice for farmers to fill the abovementioned research gaps this study has two main improvements as following firstly the current analysis makes up the lack of green wsp in traditional wsp evaluation by providing a method for evaluating gross irrigation wsp actual blue and green wsps according to the crop wf simulation and wf benchmark secondly this is the first study to the best our knowledge setting for crop wf benchmark under the best tillage practice at regional scale rather than field scales meanwhile the determined method of crop wf benchmark based on the optimal tillage technical analysis is explored the framework of current study shown as fig 1 the summer maize and winter wheat production in the baojixia irrigation district bid of shaanxi province in china were selected for this study firstly crop yield and wf components variations of crop production of the whole district under 18 tillage practices in typical years dry normal wet were simulated based on aquacrop model then the wf benchmark at grid scales was established from the perspective of the currently available optimal tillage practice lastly the gross wsp actual blue and green wsps of each practice were analyzed according to the wsp evaluation method based on the crop wf benchmark therefore the reasonable wf benchmark and optimal water saving practice was determined thereby providing reference for a crop production practice that promotes the efficient utilization of green water resources and realize reasonable allocation of blue water resources bid fig 2 is located in western guanzhong 34 30 n 108 30 e which is the largest irrigation area in shaanxi province it belongs to the sub humid area of continental monsoon climate bid accounted for 1 18 of the provincial cultivated land and produced 1 7 of the food bid baojixia irrigation district 2019 gao et al 2021a wheat and maize are grown in rotation however water resources are extremely scarce the blue water scarcity ranges between 3 38 and 4 0 and is unevenly distributed within the year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 2 method and data 2 1 tillage practice scenario set up the wfs of maize and wheat production under 18 tillage practice scenarios table 1 in bid were quantified using aquacrop model by setting three irrigation strategies full irrigation 20 deficit irrigation 40 deficit irrigation three irrigation techniques furrow irrigation sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and two mulching practices no mulching and mulching 2 2 estimation of crop water footprint aquacrop is a water driven model of crop growth that mainly reveals the response mechanism of crop yield to water use steduto et al 2009 it was proposed by fao in 2009 and has become an effective tool for optimizing the cropping and irrigation systems as well as guiding agricultural management decisions because of the small number of parameters required convenient operation and accurate and reliable simulation results in this model crop et was divided into two parts non productive water use soil evaporation in mm and productive water use crop transpiration in mm crop yield y t ha 1 was obtained from biomass b kg m 2 and harvest index hi eq 1 the biomass was obtained from the normalized biomass water productivity of the crop wp kg m 2 and the ratio of t to the reference evapotranspiration et0 eq 2 raes et al 2017 zhuo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the model simulates the process of crop growth under irrigation conditions including different irrigation techniques furrow irrigation sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and irrigation strategies full irrigation deficit irrigation etc according to the wf accounting framework hoekstra et al 2011 the wf of crop production in bid was calculated daily on a 5 grid scale following the soil water balance model zhuo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the initial value of soil water was assumed to be the green water consumed by crops on the first day green and blue wfs are supported by precipitation and irrigation respectively the green and blue components from evaporation e and transpiration t were estimated by tracking green and blue soil water balances daily eqs 3 and 4 combined with yield the crop wf components were obtained eqs 5 and 6 simulated yearly yields for maize and wheat were scaled to fit the yearly statistics of the entire irrigation district 1 y b hi 2 b wp t et 0 3 s green t s

swat distributed hydrological model and the soil and meteorological data they reported were set in the aquacrop model for this study then the one at a time method was used to adjust the main crop parameters so that the results of s1 practice control group full irrigation water furrow irrigation and no mulching were basically close to the results of typical years evaluated by gao et al 2021b with an error of 10 as shown in fig 3 the aquacrop and swat models have different operating mechanisms and the data used have certain errors in different scales grids and regions resulting in the inconsistency of the absolute value of the crop wf the calibration and validation process reported by gao et al 2021b is detailed in the appendix according to the simulation 50 deficit irrigation results in at least 85 yield reduction under the same irrigation schedule therefore it is no longer considered in this study 2 4 evaluation of water saving potential the variations of crop wf under 18 tillage practices were compared and the minimum value of crop wf was determined to be the crop wf benchmark and the corresponding tillage practice the optimal technical condition based on the confirmed crop wf benchmark the gross wsp is equal to the difference between the irrigation water of the current and optimal tillage practices eq 7 the actual wsp is calculated as follows eqs 8 and 9

wfb wf b c wf b c wf g c y s 9 awsp g wf g c wfb wf g c wf b c wf g c y s where awsp b m³ is the actual blue wsp of the current tillage practice awsp g m³ is the actual green wsp of current tillage practice wf b c m3 t 1 and wf g c m3 t 1 are the crop blue wf and green wf of the current tillage practice respectively wfb m3 t 1 is the crop wf benchmark under optimal tillage practice and s ha is the effective irrigation area it should be noted that although blue and green wf benchmark in the crop wf benchmark can be distinguished according to the wf components of the best tillage practice precipitation and irrigation amount in different regions and time have discrepancy when there is a lot of precipitation precipitation should be used as much as possible to reduce the use of blue water therefore in order to propose a universal method only the total crop wf benchmark can be set mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 at the same time specific local meteorological conditions and tillage measures have an impact on the amount of blue and green water resources absorbed by crops so it is reasonable to allocate the wf benchmark according to the proportion of blue and green wf in local actual production 2 5 data the gis polygon data for the bid was obtained by digitizing the map of the bid the plan and crop yield of bid are provided by its bureau bid baojixia irrigation district 2019 monthly rainfall temperature and et0 used in the aquacrop model were obtained from the cru ts3 24 databases harris et al 2014 ceda 2018 the mean annual atmospheric co2 concentration was obtained from the mauna loa observatory in hawaii noaa 2018 soil water content data were obtained from the study performed by gao et al 2021a the main crop parameters table 2 were derived from the studies performed by zhuo et al 2014 ni et al 2015 ni 2015 and raes et al 2017 consistent with gao et al 2021b 2013 2008 and 2014 were selected as the dry normal and wet years respectively 3 results 3 1 crop water footprints under tillage practice scenarios fig 4 shows the changes in wf components green wf and blue wf from t or e and yield per unit area of maize in six tillage practice scenarios three irrigation strategies and two mulching practices under furrow irrigation generally the trends of wf components and yield of each tillage practice in typical years were basically the same only exists the absolute value difference caused by meteorological factors and agricultural measures considering the dry year 2013 for analysis green wf from t and e accounted for the highest proportion in wf components ranging from 49 to 85 and 8 41 respectively followed by blue wf from t 6 14 and e 1 2 respectively under the practices of no mulching s1 s3 s5 the variation trend of each wf component was consistent compared with s1 the yield per unit area in s3 and s5 decreased by 18 and 70 respectively leading to increased wf components under deficient irrigation under mulching practices s2 s4 and s6 the yield level of 20 deficit irrigation s4 could be almost reached in the case of full irrigation s2 while the yield decreased by 8 under 40 deficit irrigation s6 compared with s2 resulting in a slightly higher wf mulching can effectively reduce the parts of blue wf and green wf provided by e that belong to non productive ineffective e as it can reduce ineffective e by 79 87 and 97 under full irrigation and 20 and 40 deficit irrigation respectively moreover the adjustment of irrigation techniques only made a slight difference considering other conditions irrigation strategy typical year mulching practice as constant mainly due to the short growth period of maize and the strong climate factors during this growth upon adjusting the irrigation strategy only and holding all other factors constant the proportion of green wf increases as irrigation water decreases for instance the proportions of green wf were 85 89 and 93 for s1 s3 and s5 in 2013 respectively this was mainly attributed to the absorption of deep soil moisture promoted by the shortage of water similarly owing to the reduction of ineffective e when mulching the proportion of green wf in s2 s4 and s6 increased by 4 2 and 2 compared to s1 s3 and s5 respectively the variations of irrigation techniques have different impacts on wheat wf in typical years fig 5 merely changing the irrigation technique such as s2 s8 s14 in the same typical year has little impact on yield and the wfs of all practices are basically similar in mulching practice under no mulching the influence of irrigation technique change on wf is most obvious under 40 deficit irrigation s5 s11 and s17 the wf under sprinkler irrigation was highest because water sprayed into the air generated greater water loss and the effects of meteorological factors lead to the lowest yield simultaneously compared with no mulching mulching could significantly reduce ineffective e by 79 96 in furrow irrigation 80 97 in sprinkler irrigation and 74 98 in drip irrigation for wheat production decreasing irrigation water and considering mulching practice can promote the utilization of green water 3 2 water footprint benchmarking fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the optimal tillage practice when the minimum wf wf benchmark was achieved on each grid maize wf was lowest in 96 of the grids under furrow and full irrigation with mulching in 2013 in 75 of the grids under furrow irrigation with 20 deficit irrigation and mulching in 2008 and in 79 of the grids under furrow irrigation and 20 deficit irrigation with mulching in 2014 because the change in irrigation technique made a very small difference in the wf of maize production furrow irrigation could be replaced by the other two irrigation techniques owing to the different meteorological factors agricultural management and nonlinear relation between water consumption and yield the maize production under the 20 deficit irrigation with mulching received the minimum wf and achieved optimal balance of water consumption and yield in typical years for wheat production the wf was lowest in 79 of the grids under furrow irrigation and 20 deficit irrigation with mulching in 2013 in 68 of the grids under sprinkler irrigation with 40 of the deficit irrigation and mulching in 2008 and in 89 of the grids under furrow irrigation with 20 of the deficit irrigation and mulching in 2014 to ensure production the wf under 20 deficit irrigation with mulching was the lowest similarly the change in irrigation technique had little influence on the wf of wheat production under mulching therefore the wheat wf under 20 deficit irrigation with mulching was deemed as the wf benchmark that can be realized under the condition of guaranteeing yield at the same time considering the investment cost of irrigation management the irrigation technique was determined to be furrow irrigation 3 3 evaluation of water saving potential fig 7 shows the variations in the crop wf of 18 tillage practices and the corresponding irrigation water in typical years in other words the water uses of different practices are compared from the perspectives of gross wsp and actual wsp considering s4 as the reference for maize production fig 7a the wfs are relatively close to each other and yield little water saving under mulching practice s2 s4 and s6 bid could save up to 28 m3 t 1 wf distributed according to the blue and green wf ratio in each practice that is 0 69 million m3 blue water throughout the irrigated area could be saved in 2013 in addition it could save up to 7 53 million m3 green water and 0 57 million m3 blue water in 2008 and 20 17 million m3 green water and 1 61 million m3 blue water in 2014 for wheat production fig 7b in the case of mulching s2 s4 s6 the maximum wsp was achieved in 2014 10 65 million m3 blue water and 45 84 million m3 green water a large amount of water can be saved under no mulching when the wf is reduced to s4 like maize production in 2008 from full irrigation to 20 and 40 deficit irrigation s1 s3 and s5 33 36 million m3 72 9 million m3 277 68 million m3 green water and 6 58 million m3 12 75 million m3 36 52 million m3 blue water could be saved throughout bid respectively under the same conditions in typical years each tillage practice can yield maximum water saving under 40 deficit irrigation mainly because of the high degree of deficit irrigation which causes significant decline in the yield and consequently a sharp increase in wf and wsp the wsps of each tillage practice in detailed is listed in the appendix table a1 from the perspective of irrigation water use such as wheat production in 2014 227 mm of irrigation water was needed to achieve yield under full irrigation and furrow irrigation under no mulching s1 while 205 mm of irrigation water was required under mulching in other words mulching practice can reduce the required irrigation water by 10 in the case of no mulching because of the difference in soil surface wetness caused by the irrigation technique to realize the yield of s1 the water required for sprinkler irrigation was 9 more than that required for furrow irrigation and the water required for drip irrigation was 7 less than that for furrow irrigation generally for maize and wheat production in bid under certain irrigation technique s2 s8 and s14 practices i e full irrigation and mulching had the highest yield and the lowest wf however in terms of wsp s5 s11 and s17 i e 40 deficit irrigation under no mulching exhibited the highest wsp reaching 3 2 billion m³ green water and 262 million m³ blue water mostly but at the cost of at least 57 reduction in yield s6 s12 and s18 i e 40 deficit irrigation and mulching require the least irrigation water which can save 6 13 and 5 8 of wf for maize and wheat respectively at the cost of 3 10 and 16 20 reduction in yield therefore the tillage practice of 20 deficit irrigation with mulching i e s4 s10 and s16 can not only ensure crop yield and achieve the lowest wf but save 20 blue water and 8 12 green water thus becoming the optimal balanced practice of crop yield and water use in bid 4 discussion pardo et al 2020 analyzed the influence of different regulated deficit irrigation on barley production in spain and concluded that optimized regulated deficit irrigation methodology can effectively reduce the wf of barley and the wf was lowest when the irrigation water used was 80 net irrigation requirement this is consistent with this study s conclusion that the crop wf of 20 deficit irrigation was the lowest zhuo and hoekstra 2017 analyzed the variations of winter wheat wf in xiaotangshan station in beijing under different management practices similarly they found that from full irrigation to deficit irrigation the change in crop wf was small but as the blue wf decreased the green wf increased in addition the wf was highest under drip irrigation with no mulching the current analysis showed that among different irrigation strategies 20 deficit irrigation can ensure yield and save water which is the most reasonable irrigation strategy mulching practice referring to the plastic film in the current analysis can effectively reduce the ineffective e of soil moisture and keep proper soil surface temperature at the same time it can keep moisture improve soil physical and chemical action effectively promote crop growth and increase crop yield making it the most convenient and effective and low cost measure however the plastic film recycle after use should be considered thereby avoiding plastic pollution in the soil and affect the follow up sowing and crop yield and quality the change in irrigation technique has little influence on maize wf the wf of wheat production shows relatively low sensitivity to the irrigation technique under mulching but shows obvious difference under no mulching this shows that depending on changing irrigation techniques to save water is not fully applicable in all conditions proper water saving technology should be explored according the actual local production condition mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 found that the global wf benchmarks of wheat and maize for the 10th production percentile were 592 m3 t 1 and 503 m3 t 1 respectively compared to the wf benchmarks established in this study 426 m3 t 1 322 m3 t 1 and 431 m3 t 1 for maize and 616 m3 t 1 543 m3 t 1 and 597 m3 t 1 for wheat in the dry normal and wet years respectively the bid have a lower value this is mainly because mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 are the global average bid as a production base has more advanced productivity and higher yield per unit area this also indicates that the wf benchmark of crop production should be formulated based on specific regions and productivity the study results also showed that crops in different typical years had diverse benchmarks even under the same crop wf benchmark the water consumed by different irrigation techniques and irrigation strategies was not same and the wsps differed therefore the appropriate crop wf benchmark should be established based on the actual hydrological conditions and irrigation conditions in an irrigation district and consider the most economic and reasonable ways of implementing the benchmark in addition under guaranteed yield the crop wfs of certain water saving practices fluctuates slightly but the fluctuation of irrigation water decreases from full to 40 deficit irrigation which may lead to the emergence of irrigation paradox grafton et al 2018 farmers use the saved water from deficit irrigation to expand production for additional yield which defeats the purpose of this form of irrigation therefore while promoting water saving actions the total water consumption in irrigated areas should be controlled and a water consumption cap should be set in the past wsp was discussed with the goal of controlling blue water and realizing the maximum utilization of green water this study provides reference for distinguishing the sources of wsp by quantifying the green wf of crop production the utilization efficiency of green water resources can be effectively evaluated and a specific reference index can be provided for the maximum utilization of green water resources blue and green water have different physical mechanisms opportunity costs and environmental costs blue water is a mobile resource while green water is stored in the unsaturated layer of soil and mainly provides water for crop production it has almost no opportunity cost therefore promoting efficient utilization of green water resources could effectively reduce blue water use therefore opportunity cost loss and environmental effects such as soil erosion caused by excessive irrigation can be reduced siebert and döll 2010 in this study the wsp of green wf in the bid was highest in the wet year reaching 3 2 billion m3 evidently reducing the crop wf to the benchmark at a relatively large spatial scale can yield extensive wsp for green water resources along with the increase in blue water resource shortage considering green water resources in the evaluation system the level of water resource availability can improve effectively given the continuous construction of water saving agriculture and ecological irrigated areas gov 2022 irrigated areas have scientific and reasonable wsp evaluation systems and using appropriate water saving methods and tillage to implement optimal water management is inevitable irrigation areas should not only have water saving engineering measures but need to be accompanied by suitable irrigation technology and schedule only by constantly realizing reasonable allocation of water resources and exerting optimal benefits of different types of water resources can irrigation areas maintain efficient and sustainable development of food production and water use 5 conclusions clarification of the wsp and its sources according to the effect of various tillage practices to crop yield and wf is necessary it provides reference for determining the suitable production mode to realize reasonable crop wf benchmark in an irrigation area considering the actual production conditions and guidelines for a reasonable irrigation strategy to promote the utilization of green water resources and effectively save blue water resources the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 under the determined irrigation technique full irrigation with no mulching and 20 deficit irrigation with mulching can almost achieve the yield under full irrigation with mulching 20 deficit irrigation with no mulching results in at least 16 yield reduction on average 40 deficit irrigation with mulching at most 20 yield reduction and no mulching at least 57 yield reduction 2 under mulching and certain irrigation techniques the crop wf fluctuated slightly when the irrigation strategy gradually decreased from full irrigation to 20 and 40 deficient irrigation but the proportion of green wf gradually increased 3 the tillage practice of 20 deficit irrigation with furrow irrigation and mulching has no yield reduction and the lowest wf and can save 20 of blue water resources and 8 12 green wf in the bid which is the optimal balance point of maize and wheat yield and water use two main limitations of the analysis should be noted in terms of practical implementations firstly the wf benchmark is generated according to modeling for different tillage scenarios with uncertainties normally around 30 as propagated by errors in input data zhuo et al 2014 secondly it should be in caution that the wsp is based on the wf benchmarks which indicates the best tillage with the smallest wf however realizing green and blue wsp depends on the smart combination of measures including the practice of water saving technology applying organic fertilizer carrying out deep and medium tillage of soil selecting excellent varieties and improving irrigation efficiency

8969,the water footprint wf of crop production is a measure of the volumes of blue water irrigation water and green water effective precipitation consumed during crop growth setting the wf benchmarks of crop production in an irrigation district exploring the optimal tillage practices and clearly specifying blue and green water saving potentials wsps are essential for efficient utilization and reasonable allocation of agricultural water resources however related studies disregarded the wf benchmark setting according to tillage practices and the corresponding wsps at the irrigation district scale meanwhile the evaluation of wsp is limited to blue water considering summer maize and winter wheat grown in baojixia irrigation district bid of shaanxi province in china as the study case this study aims to evaluate the gross irrigation wsp actual blue and green wsps based on crop wf simulation and wf benchmark setting for the best tillage practice eighteen water saving tillage practice scenarios were set considering three irrigation techniques three irrigation strategies and two mulching practices results show that crop responses to different tillage practices differ maize wf has low sensitivity whereas wheat wf shows a significant difference following a change in irrigation techniques in the practice under 40 deficit irrigation with no mulching there is the highest actual wsps but at the cost of at least 57 reduction in crop yield whereas the practice of 20 deficit irrigation furrow irrigation and mulching has no yield reduction and relatively low wf which can save 20 blue water and 8 12 green water in the bid which is the optimal balance point between the yield and water consumption of the two crops from the perspective of crop wf this study quantified the agricultural wsps of different water resources and formulated a method for evaluating agricultural wsps based on set wf benchmarks to provide reference for building a water saving culture and sustainable development graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation techniques irrigation strategies water footprint benchmarking water saving potential data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is performed on 28 of the arable land produces 46 of the food globally and accounts for 70 of freshwater withdrawal fao 2011 grafton et al 2018 nagaraj et al 2020 irrigation is an important way of enhancing crop production and closing the yield gap particularly in arid regions with severe water scarcity mueller et al 2012 rosa et al 2018 2020 given the gradual increase in population and consumption food and water security are under serious threat however according to davis et al 2017 the current global food production has neither maximized yield nor minimized water use in this context how to realize the larger crop yield with less water become an essential key point to solve the problem of food and water security therefore the accurate evaluation of water saving potential wsp under varies practices and well defined the best tillage practices in agricultural production is a foundation work to promoting sustainable agricultural development gross wsp refers to the difference between gross irrigation water before and after the implementation of water saving irrigation practices that is the decrease in water required or intook cui and liu 2015 it is generated by irrigation quota s reduction and the improvement of irrigation efficiency mainly reflecting the decrease of blue water required adjusting irrigation schemes and optimizing plantation structures can effectively reduce irrigation water use under the premise of guaranteed yield and profitat different spatial scales hu et al 2010 zhang and guo 2016 uygan et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 solgi et al 2022 li et al 2022 yin et al 2022 meanwhile considering the spatio temporal variability of hydrogeological elements and the reuse of return flow the concept of actual wsp which refers to the wsp from the perspective of water consumption was gradually proposed the gross wsp focuses on only irrigation water supply requirement reductions whereas the actual wsp shows the reduction potentials of crop evapotranspiration which consists of not only the irrigation water consumption but also the appropriation of rainwater during the crop growing period peng et al 2009 raeisi et al 2019 wu et al 2019 huang et al 2020 and wei et al 2022 found that crop evapotranspiration et can be decreased significantly by improving the irrigation and management technology past related studies quantified the crop wsp from the perspective of total crop et and did not distinguish the sources of wsp green water resources rainfall that is stored in unsaturated soil and utilized in crop production falkenmark 1997 are the main source of water for crop production and for maintenance of the natural ecological system schyns et al 2019 limitless consumption of green water resources owing to human activities will damage the ecosystem therefore based on the past total crop et considering green wsp in the evaluation of wsp is essential to assessing water resource shortage and food security the water footprint wf of crop production provides an effective tool for quantifying and distinguishing actual wsp and its sources including blue wf consumption of irrigation water and green wf consumption of effective precipitation hoekstra 2003 hoekstra et al 2011 crop wf benchmark hoekstra et al 2011 refers to a target for wf reduction and is an important parameter for evaluating crop productivity and wsp presently there are two ways of determining the crop wf benchmark one is a statistical analysis method based on yield accumulation mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 wang et al 2019 gao et al 2020 the other one is based on the optimal tillage technical analysis method which has limited application chukalla et al 2015 2017 zhuo and hoekstra 2017 however their evaluation was at field scale and there was no clear indication of the wf benchmark under the optimal tillage practice for a certain area to provide a water saving standard and practice for farmers to fill the abovementioned research gaps this study has two main improvements as following firstly the current analysis makes up the lack of green wsp in traditional wsp evaluation by providing a method for evaluating gross irrigation wsp actual blue and green wsps according to the crop wf simulation and wf benchmark secondly this is the first study to the best our knowledge setting for crop wf benchmark under the best tillage practice at regional scale rather than field scales meanwhile the determined method of crop wf benchmark based on the optimal tillage technical analysis is explored the framework of current study shown as fig 1 the summer maize and winter wheat production in the baojixia irrigation district bid of shaanxi province in china were selected for this study firstly crop yield and wf components variations of crop production of the whole district under 18 tillage practices in typical years dry normal wet were simulated based on aquacrop model then the wf benchmark at grid scales was established from the perspective of the currently available optimal tillage practice lastly the gross wsp actual blue and green wsps of each practice were analyzed according to the wsp evaluation method based on the crop wf benchmark therefore the reasonable wf benchmark and optimal water saving practice was determined thereby providing reference for a crop production practice that promotes the efficient utilization of green water resources and realize reasonable allocation of blue water resources bid fig 2 is located in western guanzhong 34 30 n 108 30 e which is the largest irrigation area in shaanxi province it belongs to the sub humid area of continental monsoon climate bid accounted for 1 18 of the provincial cultivated land and produced 1 7 of the food bid baojixia irrigation district 2019 gao et al 2021a wheat and maize are grown in rotation however water resources are extremely scarce the blue water scarcity ranges between 3 38 and 4 0 and is unevenly distributed within the year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 2 method and data 2 1 tillage practice scenario set up the wfs of maize and wheat production under 18 tillage practice scenarios table 1 in bid were quantified using aquacrop model by setting three irrigation strategies full irrigation 20 deficit irrigation 40 deficit irrigation three irrigation techniques furrow irrigation sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and two mulching practices no mulching and mulching 2 2 estimation of crop water footprint aquacrop is a water driven model of crop growth that mainly reveals the response mechanism of crop yield to water use steduto et al 2009 it was proposed by fao in 2009 and has become an effective tool for optimizing the cropping and irrigation systems as well as guiding agricultural management decisions because of the small number of parameters required convenient operation and accurate and reliable simulation results in this model crop et was divided into two parts non productive water use soil evaporation in mm and productive water use crop transpiration in mm crop yield y t ha 1 was obtained from biomass b kg m 2 and harvest index hi eq 1 the biomass was obtained from the normalized biomass water productivity of the crop wp kg m 2 and the ratio of t to the reference evapotranspiration et0 eq 2 raes et al 2017 zhuo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the model simulates the process of crop growth under irrigation conditions including different irrigation techniques furrow irrigation sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and irrigation strategies full irrigation deficit irrigation etc according to the wf accounting framework hoekstra et al 2011 the wf of crop production in bid was calculated daily on a 5 grid scale following the soil water balance model zhuo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the initial value of soil water was assumed to be the green water consumed by crops on the first day green and blue wfs are supported by precipitation and irrigation respectively the green and blue components from evaporation e and transpiration t were estimated by tracking green and blue soil water balances daily eqs 3 and 4 combined with yield the crop wf components were obtained eqs 5 and 6 simulated yearly yields for maize and wheat were scaled to fit the yearly statistics of the entire irrigation district 1 y b hi 2 b wp t et 0 3 s green t s

swat distributed hydrological model and the soil and meteorological data they reported were set in the aquacrop model for this study then the one at a time method was used to adjust the main crop parameters so that the results of s1 practice control group full irrigation water furrow irrigation and no mulching were basically close to the results of typical years evaluated by gao et al 2021b with an error of 10 as shown in fig 3 the aquacrop and swat models have different operating mechanisms and the data used have certain errors in different scales grids and regions resulting in the inconsistency of the absolute value of the crop wf the calibration and validation process reported by gao et al 2021b is detailed in the appendix according to the simulation 50 deficit irrigation results in at least 85 yield reduction under the same irrigation schedule therefore it is no longer considered in this study 2 4 evaluation of water saving potential the variations of crop wf under 18 tillage practices were compared and the minimum value of crop wf was determined to be the crop wf benchmark and the corresponding tillage practice the optimal technical condition based on the confirmed crop wf benchmark the gross wsp is equal to the difference between the irrigation water of the current and optimal tillage practices eq 7 the actual wsp is calculated as follows eqs 8 and 9 7 gwsp irr c irr b where gwsp m³ is gross wsp irr c m³ is the irrigation water under current tillage practice and irr b m³ is the irrigation water under the optimal tillage practice 8 awsp b wf b c wfb wf b c wf b c wf g c y s 9 awsp g wf g c wfb wf g c wf b c wf g c y s where awsp b m³ is the actual blue wsp of the current tillage practice awsp g m³ is the actual green wsp of current tillage practice wf b c m3 t 1 and wf g c m3 t 1 are the crop blue wf and green wf of the current tillage practice respectively wfb m3 t 1 is the crop wf benchmark under optimal tillage practice and s ha is the effective irrigation area it should be noted that although blue and green wf benchmark in the crop wf benchmark can be distinguished according to the wf components of the best tillage practice precipitation and irrigation amount in different regions and time have discrepancy when there is a lot of precipitation precipitation should be used as much as possible to reduce the use of blue water therefore in order to propose a universal method only the total crop wf benchmark can be set mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 at the same time specific local meteorological conditions and tillage measures have an impact on the amount of blue and green water resources absorbed by crops so it is reasonable to allocate the wf benchmark according to the proportion of blue and green wf in local actual production 2 5 data the gis polygon data for the bid was obtained by digitizing the map of the bid the plan and crop yield of bid are provided by its bureau bid baojixia irrigation district 2019 monthly rainfall temperature and et0 used in the aquacrop model were obtained from the cru ts3 24 databases harris et al 2014 ceda 2018 the mean annual atmospheric co2 concentration was obtained from the mauna loa observatory in hawaii noaa 2018 soil water content data were obtained from the study performed by gao et al 2021a the main crop parameters table 2 were derived from the studies performed by zhuo et al 2014 ni et al 2015 ni 2015 and raes et al 2017 consistent with gao et al 2021b 2013 2008 and 2014 were selected as the dry normal and wet years respectively 3 results 3 1 crop water footprints under tillage practice scenarios fig 4 shows the changes in wf components green wf and blue wf from t or e and yield per unit area of maize in six tillage practice scenarios three irrigation strategies and two mulching practices under furrow irrigation generally the trends of wf components and yield of each tillage practice in typical years were basically the same only exists the absolute value difference caused by meteorological factors and agricultural measures considering the dry year 2013 for analysis green wf from t and e accounted for the highest proportion in wf components ranging from 49 to 85 and 8 41 respectively followed by blue wf from t 6 14 and e 1 2 respectively under the practices of no mulching s1 s3 s5 the variation trend of each wf component was consistent compared with s1 the yield per unit area in s3 and s5 decreased by 18 and 70 respectively leading to increased wf components under deficient irrigation under mulching practices s2 s4 and s6 the yield level of 20 deficit irrigation s4 could be almost reached in the case of full irrigation s2 while the yield decreased by 8 under 40 deficit irrigation s6 compared with s2 resulting in a slightly higher wf mulching can effectively reduce the parts of blue wf and green wf provided by e that belong to non productive ineffective e as it can reduce ineffective e by 79 87 and 97 under full irrigation and 20 and 40 deficit irrigation respectively moreover the adjustment of irrigation techniques only made a slight difference considering other conditions irrigation strategy typical year mulching practice as constant mainly due to the short growth period of maize and the strong climate factors during this growth upon adjusting the irrigation strategy only and holding all other factors constant the proportion of green wf increases as irrigation water decreases for instance the proportions of green wf were 85 89 and 93 for s1 s3 and s5 in 2013 respectively this was mainly attributed to the absorption of deep soil moisture promoted by the shortage of water similarly owing to the reduction of ineffective e when mulching the proportion of green wf in s2 s4 and s6 increased by 4 2 and 2 compared to s1 s3 and s5 respectively the variations of irrigation techniques have different impacts on wheat wf in typical years fig 5 merely changing the irrigation technique such as s2 s8 s14 in the same typical year has little impact on yield and the wfs of all practices are basically similar in mulching practice under no mulching the influence of irrigation technique change on wf is most obvious under 40 deficit irrigation s5 s11 and s17 the wf under sprinkler irrigation was highest because water sprayed into the air generated greater water loss and the effects of meteorological factors lead to the lowest yield simultaneously compared with no mulching mulching could significantly reduce ineffective e by 79 96 in furrow irrigation 80 97 in sprinkler irrigation and 74 98 in drip irrigation for wheat production decreasing irrigation water and considering mulching practice can promote the utilization of green water 3 2 water footprint benchmarking fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the optimal tillage practice when the minimum wf wf benchmark was achieved on each grid maize wf was lowest in 96 of the grids under furrow and full irrigation with mulching in 2013 in 75 of the grids under furrow irrigation with 20 deficit irrigation and mulching in 2008 and in 79 of the grids under furrow irrigation and 20 deficit irrigation with mulching in 2014 because the change in irrigation technique made a very small difference in the wf of maize production furrow irrigation could be replaced by the other two irrigation techniques owing to the different meteorological factors agricultural management and nonlinear relation between water consumption and yield the maize production under the 20 deficit irrigation with mulching received the minimum wf and achieved optimal balance of water consumption and yield in typical years for wheat production the wf was lowest in 79 of the grids under furrow irrigation and 20 deficit irrigation with mulching in 2013 in 68 of the grids under sprinkler irrigation with 40 of the deficit irrigation and mulching in 2008 and in 89 of the grids under furrow irrigation with 20 of the deficit irrigation and mulching in 2014 to ensure production the wf under 20 deficit irrigation with mulching was the lowest similarly the change in irrigation technique had little influence on the wf of wheat production under mulching therefore the wheat wf under 20 deficit irrigation with mulching was deemed as the wf benchmark that can be realized under the condition of guaranteeing yield at the same time considering the investment cost of irrigation management the irrigation technique was determined to be furrow irrigation 3 3 evaluation of water saving potential fig 7 shows the variations in the crop wf of 18 tillage practices and the corresponding irrigation water in typical years in other words the water uses of different practices are compared from the perspectives of gross wsp and actual wsp considering s4 as the reference for maize production fig 7a the wfs are relatively close to each other and yield little water saving under mulching practice s2 s4 and s6 bid could save up to 28 m3 t 1 wf distributed according to the blue and green wf ratio in each practice that is 0 69 million m3 blue water throughout the irrigated area could be saved in 2013 in addition it could save up to 7 53 million m3 green water and 0 57 million m3 blue water in 2008 and 20 17 million m3 green water and 1 61 million m3 blue water in 2014 for wheat production fig 7b in the case of mulching s2 s4 s6 the maximum wsp was achieved in 2014 10 65 million m3 blue water and 45 84 million m3 green water a large amount of water can be saved under no mulching when the wf is reduced to s4 like maize production in 2008 from full irrigation to 20 and 40 deficit irrigation s1 s3 and s5 33 36 million m3 72 9 million m3 277 68 million m3 green water and 6 58 million m3 12 75 million m3 36 52 million m3 blue water could be saved throughout bid respectively under the same conditions in typical years each tillage practice can yield maximum water saving under 40 deficit irrigation mainly because of the high degree of deficit irrigation which causes significant decline in the yield and consequently a sharp increase in wf and wsp the wsps of each tillage practice in detailed is listed in the appendix table a1 from the perspective of irrigation water use such as wheat production in 2014 227 mm of irrigation water was needed to achieve yield under full irrigation and furrow irrigation under no mulching s1 while 205 mm of irrigation water was required under mulching in other words mulching practice can reduce the required irrigation water by 10 in the case of no mulching because of the difference in soil surface wetness caused by the irrigation technique to realize the yield of s1 the water required for sprinkler irrigation was 9 more than that required for furrow irrigation and the water required for drip irrigation was 7 less than that for furrow irrigation generally for maize and wheat production in bid under certain irrigation technique s2 s8 and s14 practices i e full irrigation and mulching had the highest yield and the lowest wf however in terms of wsp s5 s11 and s17 i e 40 deficit irrigation under no mulching exhibited the highest wsp reaching 3 2 billion m³ green water and 262 million m³ blue water mostly but at the cost of at least 57 reduction in yield s6 s12 and s18 i e 40 deficit irrigation and mulching require the least irrigation water which can save 6 13 and 5 8 of wf for maize and wheat respectively at the cost of 3 10 and 16 20 reduction in yield therefore the tillage practice of 20 deficit irrigation with mulching i e s4 s10 and s16 can not only ensure crop yield and achieve the lowest wf but save 20 blue water and 8 12 green water thus becoming the optimal balanced practice of crop yield and water use in bid 4 discussion pardo et al 2020 analyzed the influence of different regulated deficit irrigation on barley production in spain and concluded that optimized regulated deficit irrigation methodology can effectively reduce the wf of barley and the wf was lowest when the irrigation water used was 80 net irrigation requirement this is consistent with this study s conclusion that the crop wf of 20 deficit irrigation was the lowest zhuo and hoekstra 2017 analyzed the variations of winter wheat wf in xiaotangshan station in beijing under different management practices similarly they found that from full irrigation to deficit irrigation the change in crop wf was small but as the blue wf decreased the green wf increased in addition the wf was highest under drip irrigation with no mulching the current analysis showed that among different irrigation strategies 20 deficit irrigation can ensure yield and save water which is the most reasonable irrigation strategy mulching practice referring to the plastic film in the current analysis can effectively reduce the ineffective e of soil moisture and keep proper soil surface temperature at the same time it can keep moisture improve soil physical and chemical action effectively promote crop growth and increase crop yield making it the most convenient and effective and low cost measure however the plastic film recycle after use should be considered thereby avoiding plastic pollution in the soil and affect the follow up sowing and crop yield and quality the change in irrigation technique has little influence on maize wf the wf of wheat production shows relatively low sensitivity to the irrigation technique under mulching but shows obvious difference under no mulching this shows that depending on changing irrigation techniques to save water is not fully applicable in all conditions proper water saving technology should be explored according the actual local production condition mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 found that the global wf benchmarks of wheat and maize for the 10th production percentile were 592 m3 t 1 and 503 m3 t 1 respectively compared to the wf benchmarks established in this study 426 m3 t 1 322 m3 t 1 and 431 m3 t 1 for maize and 616 m3 t 1 543 m3 t 1 and 597 m3 t 1 for wheat in the dry normal and wet years respectively the bid have a lower value this is mainly because mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 are the global average bid as a production base has more advanced productivity and higher yield per unit area this also indicates that the wf benchmark of crop production should be formulated based on specific regions and productivity the study results also showed that crops in different typical years had diverse benchmarks even under the same crop wf benchmark the water consumed by different irrigation techniques and irrigation strategies was not same and the wsps differed therefore the appropriate crop wf benchmark should be established based on the actual hydrological conditions and irrigation conditions in an irrigation district and consider the most economic and reasonable ways of implementing the benchmark in addition under guaranteed yield the crop wfs of certain water saving practices fluctuates slightly but the fluctuation of irrigation water decreases from full to 40 deficit irrigation which may lead to the emergence of irrigation paradox grafton et al 2018 farmers use the saved water from deficit irrigation to expand production for additional yield which defeats the purpose of this form of irrigation therefore while promoting water saving actions the total water consumption in irrigated areas should be controlled and a water consumption cap should be set in the past wsp was discussed with the goal of controlling blue water and realizing the maximum utilization of green water this study provides reference for distinguishing the sources of wsp by quantifying the green wf of crop production the utilization efficiency of green water resources can be effectively evaluated and a specific reference index can be provided for the maximum utilization of green water resources blue and green water have different physical mechanisms opportunity costs and environmental costs blue water is a mobile resource while green water is stored in the unsaturated layer of soil and mainly provides water for crop production it has almost no opportunity cost therefore promoting efficient utilization of green water resources could effectively reduce blue water use therefore opportunity cost loss and environmental effects such as soil erosion caused by excessive irrigation can be reduced siebert and döll 2010 in this study the wsp of green wf in the bid was highest in the wet year reaching 3 2 billion m3 evidently reducing the crop wf to the benchmark at a relatively large spatial scale can yield extensive wsp for green water resources along with the increase in blue water resource shortage considering green water resources in the evaluation system the level of water resource availability can improve effectively given the continuous construction of water saving agriculture and ecological irrigated areas gov 2022 irrigated areas have scientific and reasonable wsp evaluation systems and using appropriate water saving methods and tillage to implement optimal water management is inevitable irrigation areas should not only have water saving engineering measures but need to be accompanied by suitable irrigation technology and schedule only by constantly realizing reasonable allocation of water resources and exerting optimal benefits of different types of water resources can irrigation areas maintain efficient and sustainable development of food production and water use 5 conclusions clarification of the wsp and its sources according to the effect of various tillage practices to crop yield and wf is necessary it provides reference for determining the suitable production mode to realize reasonable crop wf benchmark in an irrigation area considering the actual production conditions and guidelines for a reasonable irrigation strategy to promote the utilization of green water resources and effectively save blue water resources the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 under the determined irrigation technique full irrigation with no mulching and 20 deficit irrigation with mulching can almost achieve the yield under full irrigation with mulching 20 deficit irrigation with no mulching results in at least 16 yield reduction on average 40 deficit irrigation with mulching at most 20 yield reduction and no mulching at least 57 yield reduction 2 under mulching and certain irrigation techniques the crop wf fluctuated slightly when the irrigation strategy gradually decreased from full irrigation to 20 and 40 deficient irrigation but the proportion of green wf gradually increased 3 the tillage practice of 20 deficit irrigation with furrow irrigation and mulching has no yield reduction and the lowest wf and can save 20 of blue water resources and 8 12 green wf in the bid which is the optimal balance point of maize and wheat yield and water use two main limitations of the analysis should be noted in terms of practical implementations firstly the wf benchmark is generated according to modeling for different tillage scenarios with uncertainties normally around 30 as propagated by errors in input data zhuo et al 2014 secondly it should be in caution that the wsp is based on the wf benchmarks which indicates the best tillage with the smallest wf however realizing green and blue wsp depends on the smart combination of measures including the practice of water saving technology applying organic fertilizer carrying out deep and medium tillage of soil selecting excellent varieties and improving irrigation efficiency
