8490,study region this study was conducted in dire dawa city of ethiopia where flood hazard occurs on regular basis study focus the study was conducted with the aim of mapping flood hazard and exploring local flood risk management strategies as to flood mapping flo 2d hydrodynamic model was employed to identify flood prone villages flo 2d was chosen for its versatility to use different data sources to identify local flood management strategies household survey was conducted on 232 households located in flood prone areas new hydrological insights for the region the final result of flood hazard map identified about 1163 buildings located inside high medium and low flood hazard zones the validity of the flo 2d model versus ground truth was statistically tasted and showed a strong positive correlation flood smell cloud direction extreme weather and gunshot were identified as the locally used flood early warning strategies even if the local flood risk management strategies have helped to reduce the level of vulnerability at normal condition the gap is observed when extreme events are recorded it is highly recommended that the flood hazard map developed for the city and existing flood management strategies are properly utilized for future flood risk planning of dire dawa city and its watershed keywords adaptation dire dawa flood hazard flo 2d flood mapping mitigation 1 introduction among all types of natural hazards threatening the world flood is probably the most devastating wide spread and frequent sanyal and lu 2004 vanneuville et al 2011 karagiozi et al 2011 flood is overtaking other natural hazards both in frequency of occurrence and damaging capacity all over the world the world disaster data base wddb report shows that in africa floods occurred 621 times while drought happened 102 times between the years 2000 2016 with 12 176 deaths and no direct death reports respectively during the same period flood occurred 27 times and drought happened 7 times in ethiopia with reported deaths of 1534 and 0 zero direct or immediate death respectively world disaster data base wddb 2016 in future complemented with global climate change and human activities flood is predicted to be more frequent and disastrous nijland 2005 ipcc 2007 dihn et al 2011 even though flooding is a global issue its distribution across the globe varies in type frequency of occurrence and impacts karagiozi et al 2011 asia and africa were reported to be highly affected by flood damages compared to other continents revilla romero et al 2015 ayala 2002 karagiozi et al 2011 this is underpinned by higher frequency and magnitude of the flood events and lack of flood related policy and appropriate local management strategies that are based on flood hazard and risk mapping in these continents flood is unavoidable but manageable natural hazards paul and routray 2010a 2010b it can be managed using structural and non structural methods thampapillai and musgrave 1985 brody et al 2009 this study emphasizes two ways of flood management strategies flood mapping and early warning system the work of flood risk management starts from identification and estimation of current and possible areas of higher hazard potential margins forkuo 2011 plate 2002 sanyal and lu 2004 flood mapping determines inundation extent by using water depth and velocity alaghmand et al 2010 flo 2d is a suitable model to estimate the possible range of flow properties velocity and depth and predict the possible area of inundation o brien 2011 the model was successfully adopted in several countries where there is good record of adequate hydrologic and hydraulic data more importantly flo 2d is known for its versatility to use various variables o brien 2011 as a result the application of the model yields great opportunity to use interchangeable data from different sources such as meteorological hydrological and physical data sources such as digital elevation model dem soil and land use land cover dire dawa has got a long history of flood hazard dating back to the inception of the city historical information revealed that the first damaging flood hazard was recorded in 1945 since then the hazard has been occurring in dire dawa at different time intervals more importantly the flood hazard event of 2006 is worth mentioning some studies were undertaken in the city to identify flood vulnerable villages of dire dawa city yonas tadesse alemu 2015 alemayehu 2007 however their findings did not well address the future simulation and forecasting of possible flood inundation areas in the city flo 2d model is widely used for predicting inundation areas for effective flood risk management planning oberianetal 2011 this study employed flo 2d model to use the model s versatility opportunity whereby various options of data can be used to fill the data scarcity gap of dire dawa city the place with ungauged meteorological stations early warning is another major component of disaster risk reduction un 2015 people in a flood affected localities adopt different measures to minimize the effect of flooding using preventive and adaptive measures paul and routray 2010a 2010b though indigenous early warning systems have been helping to rescue lives and properties of traditional and modern community its contribution is narrowly acknowledged in the literature haque and zaman 1993 rasid and mallik 1995 rashid 2000 paul and routray 2010a 2010b likewise though people of dire dawa city have been employing different early warning systems to cope up with the regularly occurring floods the experience and effort from this system has no institutional backup rather than promoting indigenous early warning systems flood control strategy of the city has been limited to structural measures which are no more effective therefore it is fair to know how peoples of dire dawa employ indigenous knowledge and survived during hard times of regularly occurring flood in nutshell developing flood hazard map and exploring local flood risk management strategies aiming to improve future flood risk planning and management for dire dawa city are the hubs of this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in dire dawa city ethiopia located between 9 26 n and 9 45 n latitude and 41 41 e and 42 07 e longitude dire dawa city is located in the ethiopian rift valley with an altitude of 1000 1200 m above sea level and surrounded by mountainous districts of oromia regional states the city is dissected by five large and small rivers dechatu goro melkajabdu laga hare and butuji rivers all rivers draining the city made their origin from the surrounding highlands of kersa haramaya and meta districts fig 1 2 2 data collection and analysis this study employed collection of both primary and secondary data from their respective sources the primary data used for this study refers to the first hand information collected from sample households these data were used to understand the locally existing flood early warning and adaptation strategies the study also used various types of secondary data the secondary data were collected from different websites organizations and stakeholders these data include 30 m resolution dem soil map topographic map land use map and reports of the city which were utilized to develop flood hazard map of the city with the help of flo 2d model and mapper software mapper is the primary post processing program that views the result of flo 2d flood simulation in order to identify the indigenous coping strategies household survey was conducted in all villages identified as flood prone areas to this end appropriate sampling procedures and methods were employed in the first place flood prone villages were purposely selected based on the flood map developed from secondary data all the identified flood prone villages were considered for further sampling procedure then sample households from each purposively selected village were selected using systematic random sampling accordingly the first household of each village were selected randomly and the subsequent households were selected at a fixed interval of every 10th households finally from 1163 households that fall inside flood hazard zones a sample size of 20 232 households were picked for household survey sampling only the household heads were interviewed directly to represent their corresponding family members the analysis of household survey employed descriptive statistics percentage and frequencies in the form of table and graphs the results of qualitative data obtained through key informant interview and personal observation were descriptively narrated the result of secondary data sources are presented with graduate color map with help of gis and mapper software 2 3 modeling to meet the intended objective of dire dawa city flood hazard mapping the study employed different modeling procedures in integrated manner these include climate modeling hydrological hydraulic and flood modeling as presented hereunder 2 3 1 climate modeling extreme rainfall events are a primary cause for flood hazards worldwide lan fen 2012 the climate modeling is derived from statistical analysis of extreme events the ipcc 2007 fourth assessment report has indicated that the probability of having extreme events may become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change therefore modeling the extreme values resulting from rainfall is of paramount importance for effective planning and management of flood and other climatic hazards however as it demands intensive and quality precipitation data climate modeling is not an easy task it is data intensive because it needs long time series data in terms of quality it needs a minimum of hourly data to simulate future scenarios the climate modeling procedure in this study involved the following steps selection of meteorological stations four meteorological stations dire dawa dangago kersa and haramaya within the dire dawa watershed were selected because the rainfall data from these stations significantly contribute for dire dawa city flooding flo 2d model demands an input of extreme values of rainfall distribution and rainfall intensities to satisfy this condition among four meteorological stations falling in the watershed a station that exerts the highest rainfall intensity was considered to simulate the probability of flood occurrence to identify extreme events of rainfall and intensity the study employed the analysis of time series rainfall data obtained from dire dawa 1953 2014 dangago 1986 2014 and haramaya 1960 2013 meteorological stations due to limited availability of time series rainfall data kersa meteorological station was not considered for this study disaggregation of rainfall data the availability of rainfall records obtained from these meteorological stations was limited to daily time basis as a result the daily rainfall disaggregation model was adopted at first step to achieve hourly based precipitation statistical work was used for conversion purposes accordingly stepwise disaggregation of the daily rainfall to 12 6 3 and 1 h was employed by two alternative downscaling methods the short time intensity disaggregation method connolly et al 1998 de paola francesco et al 2014 was employed to generate the simulation of smaller time windows which is 1 h for this case likewise the random cascade based disaggregation method olsson 1998 and güntner et al 2001 was used for simulation of larger time windows i e 3 h 6 h and 12 h larger window time disaggregation was done with the help of cra clima rain software the easy fit software was used for downscaling to 1 hour simulation idf curve development following disaggregation process this research employed general extreme values theory to generate possible occurrence of the extreme rainfalls from the extreme value results idf curve was developed for return periods of 10 30 50 100 and 300 years to be used for the consumption of flo 2d and rainfall intensity calculation after the maximum values are generated the fitting of the probability distribution was checked by using gumbel s evt i which is commonly used for idf curve preparation 1 gumbel s evt i f x exp x β α exp x β α α x following the maximum value identification the precipitation depths is calculated for a given return period as x t x kt s where x is mean of the data s is the standard deviation and kt is the frequency factor kt values are calculated for different return periods using k t 6 π the validity of the idf curve of each station was tested in two ways the first criterion was checking the self similarity of n values to qualify this the values of n parameter for each return period are expected to be self similar i e uniform value the other test was done by checking the r2 values of each return period in this case the values of each r2 should be between the ranges of 0 98 0 99 idf curve that qualify the two tests at a time was considered for further application intensity estimation rainfall intensity is calculated as the average rainfall depth hr that falls per time increment i hr d with d rainfall duration measured in millimeter per hour de paola francesco et al 2014 the annual extremes are then calculated for various time windows the rainfall curve corresponding to a specific return period is calculated by fitting a suitable probability model to the extreme rainfall data here a bi parameter gumbel probability distribution of gev family distributions has been chosen to describe the extreme rainfall data maione and moisello 2003 the rainfall intensity hr for a given return period and duration d can be calculated from a bi parameter power law de paola francesco et al 2014 2 hr d t a t dn where t is a return period a and n are the parameters of the rainfall curve which can be estimated by a simple linear regression analysis in the bi logarithmic scale namely log hr versus log d this is used to identify the station that generates the highest intensity accordingly idf of dire dawa meteorological station which generates the maximum intensity was considered for flood simulation 2 3 2 hydrological modeling hydrologic models are used to estimate the amounts of stream flow generated by individual extreme events of precipitation or combination of various series time events the hydrological model computes the extreme values by taking into consideration a series time of precipitation data topography soil type and land use land cover conditions these factors help to generate soil curve number and hydrograph soil curve number the land use land cover was combined with the soil hydrological group to compute the soil curve number the quantification of soil curve number was calculated based on the information obtained from ethiopian soil map description and soil curve standard table land use land cover descriptions of dire dawa city watershed was matched with descriptions and curve number values derived from the standard tables jalayer et al 2015 the analysis of curve number values is not only dependent on the land use land cover types but also on the hydrological group of the soils soils have been classified into four hydrologic soil groups hsg a b c and d listed in order of decreasing infiltration rates the study conducted by belete et al 2013 classified hydrological soil group of ethiopia in to a b c and d accordingly values of soil curve were checked with corresponding hydrological soil group of ethiopia as the flood hazard simulation is to forecast the maximum discharge of the maximum return period this study simulation considered scn iii of 300 years return period this helps to develop long lasting and sustainable flood mitigation and adaptation strategies all types of soil curve numbers were computed using the u s army corp of engineering usace 2008 formulas 3 c n i i i 1 n c n i a i i 1 n a i i 1 n a i where cn weighted curve number ii cni curve number from 1 to any no n 4 c n i 4 2 c n i i 10 0 058 c n i i ai area with curve number cni a the total area of the watershed 5 c n i i i 23 c n i i 10 0 13 c n i i hydrograph development hydrograph is used to generate and estimate peak discharge of the catchments hydrograph is derived from physical characteristics of the catchment the required physical characteristics for generation of hydrograph include slope area of the catchment and length of the longest stream catchment areas the percentage of slope rise and channel length were generated from dem in the gis environment finally dire dawa watershed was split in two dechatu and goro catchments for analysis purpose furthermore other hydrological parameters such as time of concentration tc accumulation time ta and lag time tl needed to develop hydrograph are calculated based on the formula developed by simas 1996 time of concentration tc is the time required for runoff to travel from the most distant hydraulic point located in the upstream of the watershed to the outlet located at the extreme dawn stream time of concentration is generated based on the formula 6 t a 0 5 t p t l where ta accumulation time tp rainfall event duration h and tl lag time h lag time represents the time consumed between the occurrence of rainfall and the occurrence of peak discharge it is computed by the formula 7 t l 0 342 l 0 8 i b 1000 c n 9 0 7 land use system governs a lot of hydrological elements such as time of concentration and lag time land use information helps to determine the soil curve number the land use map of the city and surrounding district was used for this purpose 2 3 3 hydraulic modeling hydraulic model was used to compute stream flow conditions such as flow velocity flow depth and the size of possible inundation flo 2d is important software basically used for this purpose the application of flood simulation has followed the following procedures initially dem was used to create the areas of interest of the watershed boundary for this purpose a 30 meter dem file was imported into the software in the form of ascii grid file the ascii file was used for easy conversion of xyz grid file in global mapper software grid computation was done from the ascii file the number of grid element and acceptable computation time range was calculated based on the standard range of 15 and 150 m haltas et al 2016 accordingly the grid size creation for this simulation was defined to be 30 m the following criterion of flo 2d manual was used in the selection of the grid size 8 0 3 m s q max a elem 3 m s where q max is the maximum discharge estimated at the grid element and a elem is grid area to assign the representative elevation of each grid element grid interpolation is done in the model in addition a cumulative of 10 30 50 100 and 300 year return period of climate modeling and hydrological model result of hydrograph and soil curve number were used for flo 2d flood hazard simulation the result of the simulation is post processed in the mapper software from the final results of the numerical model results maximum flow depth and maximum flow velocity were created the combined end product of maximum velocity and water depth helped to generate hazard map of the city the hazard maps were classified as high medium and low zones based on a widely adopted criterion developed by garcia and lopez 2005 accordingly areas with h depth in m 1 5 and v x h 1 5 m s is classified as high hazard zone if 0 5 h 1 5 and v x h 1 5 m s the zone is classified as medium hazard zones lastly areas with 0 1 h 0 5 and v x h 0 5 m s are classified as low hazard zone the result of each category was assigned with graduate color depending on the value of the hazard level for example in this study red indicates a high level of hazard while yellow and green represent medium and low hazard zones respectively the overall methodology of the study is shown in fig 2 2 4 model validation as a part of scientific work model calibration and validation is recommended for every work of flood hazard modeling however data availability hinders calibration in data scarce region where there is no well established meteorological station and hydrologic data bases alternatively verification of inundation area can be used to verify the model using property damage data base resident survey data and remnants of trees and other objects affected by flood during extreme events huxley and kuch 2016 validation is the process of establishing evidence that provides reasonable information that the output of the software is good enough to represent the facts on the ground to the acceptable level the model validation of this study employed ground control points gcp collection and interview from residents both were used to identify the maximum flood inundation registered during the past flood events because of the vast coverage of the city the validation was limited to few villages where flood hazard repeatedly affects accordingly four villages of the city 05 06 07 and 09 were considered for this purpose the reliability of the flo 2d result versus ground distance measure was tested using paired t test using spss statistical package for social sciences 9 t d μ d s d n where d mean difference μd standard error n number of sample and sd standard deviation 3 results 3 1 flood hazard mapping in dire dawa city 3 1 1 idf curve intensity duration frequency idf is the graphical representations of the amount of water that falls within a given period of time dupont et al 2000 these graphs are the base for estimation of the extreme discharge moreover idf is used to determine the average length of time between events of a given extreme discharges the reliability of idf curve is affected by availability of precipitation data therefore checking validity of idf curve is mandatory to generate possible discharge coverage based on the criterion of self similarity and r2 values of each return period out of the four stations only two of them dire dawa and haramaya stations are qualified for the idf curve validity test fig 3 3 1 2 catchments physiographic information the physiographic characteristics of the two basins required to calculate the discharge are presented under table 1 the physical characteristics of the basins shows that catchment 1 having less area lesser principal stream length and quick time of concentration generates the possible maximum discharge and large inundation areas 3 1 3 hydrograph based discharge estimation hydrograph is a graph showing the rate of discharge versus time at specific point in a river for specific time events the work of flood hazard mapping demands the possible maximum discharge of the two meteorological stations haramaya and dire dawa and corresponding catchments of the two catchments the one which generate maximum discharge is used for flood modeling purposes based on the comparison the hydrograph of catchment 1 of dire dawa station which generates maximum discharge up to 1200 q m3 s at 300 year return periods is considered for flood hazard simulation purpose fig 4 a 3 1 4 flow depth the maximum flow depth map is presented for dechatu river the result of flow depths shows that the depth reaches up to 4 2 m in the residential area located at the southern parts of the city village 06 and 3 7 m around some central parts of village 09 fig 5 3 1 5 flow velocity flow velocities become as high as 7 m s just at downstream of the southern parts and some inner villages of the city in areas where the slope of the city is flat the velocity slows down to less than 0 5 m s fig 6 3 1 6 hazard map hazard mapping and prediction of inundation is the primary step for flood mitigation and adaptation it is used to define areas which are at risk of flooding under extreme precipitation based on flow depth and velocity the hazard map of dechtu river was developed using flo 2d software as shown in fig 7 the hazard map shows that about 146 buildings covering 15 330 m2 areas are located in the high hazard zone the other 245 and 772 buildings with areas of 25 725 m2 and 81 060 m2 fall inside the medium and less hazard zones respectively 3 2 model validation the work of validation was done using ground measurement from past flood affected points to the nearest banks of the river this was used to check the compatibility of the software result with actual existing truth on the ground the identifications of maximum flood affected points were done with the reference to 2006 flood hazard margins the 2006 flood margin was chosen for its highest degree of effect and recentness to be recalled by the communities the margins of the flood affected points and damaged remnants were identified by interviewing the communities for accuracy assessments 13 ground control points gcp were collected during field survey the gcp were marked with global positioning system gps tool and integrated to the inundation maps table 2 for statistical test the row data collected from the field was compiled with the help of spss and generated the following result mean 0 307 correlation 0 999 std deviation 4 423 std error mean 1 226 p value 0 806 at 95 confidence interval of difference the correlation of the software result and ground measurement 0 999 indicates that the two results are highly correlated as the correlation value of 0 999 is close to 1 the results have strong positive relationship for more visualization the hazard map is overlaid with gps based collected data of flood affected areas accordingly the result shows that the presentation of flo 2d software output and the edge of flood affected ground truth point data are fitting to each other showing that the information is accurate to present boundaries of the possible flood inundations fig 8 3 3 local flood management strategies 3 3 1 demographic characteristics of respondents age and education are risk sensitive demographic characteristics the age distribution of the sample data shows that respondents of all age classes were represented the age analysis result shows that the distribution is skewed to the two extreme age classes of old 50 and young 18 35 years table 3 shows that population above 50 years of age and the young 18 35 years represented 39 1 and 36 4 respectively this shows that flood hazard zone is mostly occupied by retired and young people of low income households likewise education is another characteristic of flood prone area population the education profile shows that 40 9 of sample respondents are illiterate people and 29 1 have primary level education the rest 22 7 and 7 3 were educated at secondary and tertiary levels respectively in terms of education flood hazard zones are predominantly inhabited by illiterate and less educated households 3 3 2 local early warning systems the survey result shows that flood adaptation mechanism of the study area population mainly employs early warning based copying strategies performed at individual and community level beside to individual experience the people of dire dawa developed community level early warning strategies that has been serving as a means of evacuation during occurrence of extreme flood events the community level early warning strategies are summarized in table 5 3 3 3 local flood management strategies flood management strategies are aimed at how to reduce the risk of flood events for the people and properties which are located in flood prone areas in the study area flood risk management strategies are broadly classified as mitigation and adaptation strategies table 6 4 discussion 4 1 implication of flood hazard mapping for flood management strategy flood is the major natural hazard threatening dire dawa city and its watershed sustainable flood management researchers emphasize that flood mapping is the first step to combat effects of flooding forkuo 2011 plate 2002 sanyal and lu 2004 flo 2d involves the use of maximum velocity and depth to create flood hazard map of the study area fig 7 the presentation of flo 2d model identified villages subjected to different levels of flood hazard zones accordingly villages such as 03 06 05 07 and 09 located close to dechatu river fall inside flood hazard zones of different levels among flood prone areas major parts of village 06 05 and 09 are located inside high hazard zones these villages are the oldest and presently located in the most inner part of the city the majority of this finding is similar to related studies that identified village 09 06 05 and 03 of dire dawa city as a most flood affected villages yonas tadesse alemu 2015 as far as village 07 is concerned the findings of these two studies contradict with each other this is because of the methods employed and parameters considered the previous study employed hec ras hydraulic model considering flood depth to delineate flood hazards whereas the current study employed flo 2d hydraulic model that integrate maximum velocity and flow depth to delineate flood hazard map as a result this study identified additional village located inside flood hazard zones the flood map analysis of the present study revealed that about 146 buildings occupying an area of 15 330 m2 are located in the high hazard zone the other 245 and 772 buildings occupying area of 25 725 m2 and 81 060 m2 fall inside the medium and less hazard zones respectively furthermore the flood hazard map shows that villages located inside high hazard zones experience maximum flow velocity and depth that ranges up to 7 m s and 4 m respectively this implies that flood induced damage on property and loss of human lives are more severe in these residential areas exposed to higher flood depth and velocity as parts of flood management strategy flood prone areas deserve peculiar attention for planning and conservation strategies therefore villages that fall inside the high hazard zone should be planned for other economic and environmental activities other than for settlement purposes similarly portions of villages that fall inside medium and less hazard zones are recommended for different schemes of mitigation strategies the analysis of flood hazard map also shows that the hazard map covers a distance of 60 400 m from the river center at different sites of dechatu river the result of this finding contradicts with the 50 m river buffer zones proposed by 2006 integrated development master plan of dire dawa city the variation is resulted from hypothetical demarcation by the master plan study and the 2d model based demarcation by the present study implying that the two dimensional models are more accurate in identifying water discharge and flood inundation areas this shows that the traditional ways of buffer zone demarcation proposed by master plan of the city has not considered the detailed analysis of flood plain area flood characteristics topography and water depth conditions at different river cross sections and therefore needs improvement the remnants of flood protection wall built during italian occupation 1935 1941 and the information obtained from the elders confirms that the italians had delineated up to 500 m buffer along the southern parts of dechatu river however large areas of these areas are currently exploited for residence and other communal activities such as schools bus stations and industries the key interviewed respondents reported that these sites are flooded many times following the occurrence of heavy rainfall the un report shows that at least 15 000 dwellers are living in high flood risk areas in the city of dire dawa un habitat 2009 looking at the location material makeup and nature of the houses most of buildings located in high hazard zone of the study area belong to illegal settlements and slum houses this implies that poor people who are unable to afford the actual cost of land occupied the flood prone areas the interviewed people reported that most of the houses close to the river banks are illegal settlements that are mushrooming during night times on top of this the evidence from personal observation key informant interview and past flood damage report shows that flood hazard in these areas were very disastrous this was mainly because of poor river buffer planning high population density poor material makeup and old nature of the houses to this end resettling people from the high hazard zone can minimize the flood induced risks the current study also tried to emphasize the household distribution of flood prone area population from demographic education and socio economic perspectives the demographic distribution of flood hazard zone population of the area is characterized by older age 50 and younger age 18 35 years table 3 the adult age category who have produced some asset and able to afford cost of their family are less settled in flood hazard zones in contrast the retired people who have no option to generate additional income and the young who did not gained adequate asset are occupying flood hazard zones as the costs of the areas are less expensive from education context populations occupying the flood prone areas are illiterate and less educated society in nutshell the demographic socio economic and education analyses of the study area shows that flood prone population are economically and socially marginalized groups flood hazard map plays a significant role in determining suitable flood protection measures of a given area mani et al 2014 mollaei et al 2016 in the study area attempt to flood hazard management is not a new phenomenon following the devastating flood of 2006 the city government is allocating huge budget to eliminate flood induced risks human causalities and property damage using structural methods accordingly 6 km high and several kilometers long retailing walls have been constructed along dechatu and goro rivers despite of this flood management effort flood continues to present the greatest threat to live and properties of the city dwellers the sampled households reported that the supposed flood protection wall itself has been the victim of extreme flooding this shows that lack of appropriate delineation of inundations and mapping of flood hazard zones that govern the construction of structural methods has significantly affected the effectiveness of ongoing flood management strategy flood map identifies the territory of flooding that guides where flood defense mechanisms should take place this study developed flood hazard map of dire dawa city to supplement future planned flood management activities it is therefore recommended that permanent retaining walls and other engineering based defense mechanisms should be constructed out of the inundated areas where the maximum flood level touches this study through flood mapping has identified large number of buildings and households located in high medium and low hazard zones this helps the city government ngos and other concerned organs to identify the areas where to start flood intervention activities 4 2 implication of local knowledge and action in flood management strategy flood management strategies are aimed at how to reduce the risk of flood events for the people and properties which are located in flood prone areas flood early warning is a space specific process that varies with place and time different studies identified different countries experience of flood forecasting systems in pakistan wind movement cloud color and direction and animal behavior were used as flood forecast strategies fakhruddin et al 2015 paul and routray 2010a 2010b shape and position of the moon at different months was also used by communities of khetran society to forecast flood hazards khetran et al 2012 similar studies conducted in zimbabwe found out that cloud color position of the moon and height of birds nests are among the locally developed flood forecasting systems mapara 2009 bongo et al 2017 in dire dawa area as well people have been using their stored experience and indigenous knowledge to rescue their life and property before and during the time of extreme events the local flood management strategies of study area broadly classified in to adaptation and early warning strategies 4 2 1 local knowledge and action in flood adaptation strategies the people of dire dawa developed different local adaptation strategies such as using flood inundation areas for market places temporary move from houses diverting flood direction using sandbag around houses and climbing roof of houses the survey result shows that temporary move during extreme flood events is the most acquainted strategy table 6 people in flood prone areas evacuate their families and properties to safe places before the occurrence of flood event likewise some households use sandbag to rise an existing level of places through which flood enters the property other respondents reported that they climb top of their roof to safeguard their life they indicated that during evening times when it is difficult to determine the water level they climb the roof of their house until flood gets slow in velocity and decreases in volume moreover the communities of dire dawa city use the large area of flood inundation for market purposes the most commonly known open markets called ashewa and taiwan are conducted in flood inundation areas of dechatu river some of the finding of this study such as temporary move and climbing roof of houses agree with the findings of gwimbi 2007 and mavhura et al 2013 however using the vacant space of inundation areas for market purpose is the unique experience limited to dire dawa city population 4 2 2 local early warning knowledge and flood management strategies early warning is used to forecast the event of flood before the incident takes place from their experience people of a given locality know the type of hazards threatening their locality and can predict how and when the event occurs following less efficiency of structural protection works early warning becomes more central to the risk management approach unisdr 2005 the role of early warning is more important in cities of the developing countries like dire dawa where there are limited scientific weather forecasting systems in response to regular flood hazards the people of dire dawa city have developed different experiences of flood hazard forecasting at individual and community levels even though they are not in a position to totally avoid the flood induced risks they have been exercising their best knowledge of typical early warning and adaptations to live in harmony with flood the compiled result of the survey data shows that the locally available flood forecast is categorized into individual and community level warning systems individual flood early warning of the study area comprises smell of flood cloud color and direction weather condition and special months of a season table 4 flood smell is a flood forecast method using human smelling sense organ this forecast was effective to warn when the flood comes from the upper catchments in the absence of rainfall in the dawn streams flood smell is formed when the flowing flood water dilutes a dry soil where rainfall did not occur respondents indicated that whenever they experience the flood smell with no rain in dire dawa it is certain that the flood reach the city in 30 min they reported that as soon as they sense the smell of flood they order their family to leave out the house and to arrange the properties forecasting looking at cloud color and direction is the other commonly practiced early warning system among the people of dire dawa city cloud direction shows the source of the air masses while cloud color predicts the amount of rainfall the respondents reported that they forecast the daily condition of their weather from their past experience simply by observing the direction and color of clouds dire dawa city has been experiencing flood hazard since the establishment of the city because of this the people of the city are familiar with the flood inducing clouds they forecast the changing situation of the weather that is going to happen within a half day to few hours by observing the cloud and wind pattern they make necessary preparation before the event takes place as most of the flood prone populations are low income communities they have no radio or television to listen the national level broadcasting of weather related news but certainly they predict what their local daily weather condition looks like some respondents reported that the extreme fluctuation of weather is their experience for heavy rainfall forecast their experience in this regard shows that during the rainy months sometimes a sudden extreme hotness takes place this hotness is special that forbid the use of night clothes following the occurrence of extreme hotness they expect that a heavy rain that induce flood hazard follows soon in the coming days therefore people warn themselves so that the whole family should not sleep together and sleep by shift at least one person in the family has to follow the situation even in the night time to alarm the family incase heavy rain takes place extreme coldness also used as a flood forecast mechanism but coldness is used to forecast the weather condition of upper catchment some times in the eve of heavy rainfall to take place in the upper catchment the downstream people feel extreme coldness in that case the downstream people understand that upper catchment is receiving heavy rainfall following that they start to inquire about upper catchment information of rainfall the occurrence of rainfall is season specific dire dawa city and surrounding regions experience a bimodal behavior of rainfall seasons the first round which extends from june to august is the normal summer rainfall season the second season is from march to may from their experience the indigenous populations have identified months when flood threatening rainfalls are expected accordingly june july and august are identified as flooding months table 4 in addition to individual experience through continuous experience and exposure to events communities have developed their own early warning system that fits to their socio cultural conditions this enables them to live in harmony with their local environment for generations united nations environment programme unep 2008 the community level flood early warning system works in disseminating flood information and action to be taken gunshot voice call from neighbor telephone call from upper catchment and ambulance services are identified as community level flood early warning systems table 5 sometimes flood early warning comes from upper catchment where flood inducing rainfall takes place the upper catchment information comes from surrounding highlands located at a distance of 20 30 km away from the city center from their experience the upper catchments population knows the kind of rainfall that threatens the life of downstream residents whenever they realize the rain is heavy and think lead to damage they provide information to their families and relatives living in the downstream through telephone about 17 3 of the sampled populations were communicated by upper catchment friends and benefiting from this information table 5 in the study area militaries shot gun as a means of flood early warning the military camp is located at 5 km distance outside of the city center on the way flood is coming to downstream the site of their camp is at strategic place to see where the flood from different streams joining together before entering to the city taking their own observation about the flood condition they keep shooting chain of bullets to alert the society the survey report shows that 42 7 of respondents are the beneficiary of early warning strategy coming from the gunshot in many cases the information of early warning comes from house to house dissemination of information by neighbors this is more practiced during evening time the neighbors are responsible to communicate their fellow neighbors for evacuation the significant number of respondents 21 8 are benefiting from this kind of early warning strategies ambulance service was another means of early warning system ambulance provides dual services at the first stage ambulance rounding the village gives warning about the condition of rainfall secondly it delivers assistance for the victims during the evacuation unlike many countries ethiopia does not have any policy and institution that specifically deal with flood people have been living in the city using their own knowledge of flood forecast and evacuation strategies some of the locally available experiences of flood forecast and early warning strategies of dire dawa city such as wind direction and cloud color overlap with the findings of previous studies found in different parts of the world however it is worth mentioning the peculiar individual and community level early warning and dissemination strategies limited to dire dawa city the individual knowledge of early warning system such as flood smell telephone call from upper catchments and extreme weather changes are complemented with community level flood information dissemination system such as gunshot neighborhood assistance and ambulance services have been serving as effective flood management strategy to rescue the life and property of the society it is believed that these findings will improve flood management strategies of similar places facing flood problem and further enrich the limited literatures observed on topics focusing on local flood management strategies moreover having a lot of strength in rescuing life and property of the society these strategies are limited to withstand risks when extreme events take place for further betterment and effectiveness these strategies deserve institutional and policy backup that enhance the quality of the strategies and capacity of the communities 5 conclusions and recommendation this study has mapped flood hazard and explored local flood risk management strategies for dire dawa city regarding the flood mapping the study applied hydrodynamic modeling with the help of flo 2d the result of flo 2d produced hazard maps based on maximum flow depth and resultant velocity the results reveal that flow depths can reach up to 4 m in the residential areas of dechatu and koka villages villages 05 and 06 moreover the velocities are as fast as 7 m s around the inner cities of villages 05 06 and 07 the result of the hazard map also shows that large number of households falls inside the hazard map of different levels accordingly 146 buildings were located inside the high hazard zones the other 245 and 772 buildings were located inside medium and less hazards zones respectively furthermore the location of hazard map shows that inner cities of village 05 and 06 are among the most vulnerable villages located in high hazard zones to this end the study suggested that the construction of retailing wall and other engineering structures should be located outside of the flood inundated areas the study also explored the local flood management strategies in dire dawa city though there are no organized policies and institutions working on flood management of the city people have survived in their environment since the inception of the city people have been responding to the flood risk with their locally developed flood forecasting mitigation and adaptation strategies except for damages which are beyond the capacity of the community people have been successfully managing the flood risk and survived in their environment had it not been for the help of these local management strategies the city would have been left void of people and settlements in most cases indigenous flood management strategies are highly effective in normal flood conditions however these strategies are limited to withstand the consequences of extreme events beyond normal occurrence it is highly recommended that the flood hazard map developed for the city is properly utilized for future flood risk planning and management moreover integrated flood risk management strategies such as establishing trans boundary flood management institution and integrated watershed management should be adopted in dire dawa city and its watershed to manage flood risks in sustainable manner in a nutshell the locally available flood risk management strategies should be complimented by science based flood forecasting and mapping system in future flood risk management strategy of the city and its watershed conflict of interest we

8490,study region this study was conducted in dire dawa city of ethiopia where flood hazard occurs on regular basis study focus the study was conducted with the aim of mapping flood hazard and exploring local flood risk management strategies as to flood mapping flo 2d hydrodynamic model was employed to identify flood prone villages flo 2d was chosen for its versatility to use different data sources to identify local flood management strategies household survey was conducted on 232 households located in flood prone areas new hydrological insights for the region the final result of flood hazard map identified about 1163 buildings located inside high medium and low flood hazard zones the validity of the flo 2d model versus ground truth was statistically tasted and showed a strong positive correlation flood smell cloud direction extreme weather and gunshot were identified as the locally used flood early warning strategies even if the local flood risk management strategies have helped to reduce the level of vulnerability at normal condition the gap is observed when extreme events are recorded it is highly recommended that the flood hazard map developed for the city and existing flood management strategies are properly utilized for future flood risk planning of dire dawa city and its watershed keywords adaptation dire dawa flood hazard flo 2d flood mapping mitigation 1 introduction among all types of natural hazards threatening the world flood is probably the most devastating wide spread and frequent sanyal and lu 2004 vanneuville et al 2011 karagiozi et al 2011 flood is overtaking other natural hazards both in frequency of occurrence and damaging capacity all over the world the world disaster data base wddb report shows that in africa floods occurred 621 times while drought happened 102 times between the years 2000 2016 with 12 176 deaths and no direct death reports respectively during the same period flood occurred 27 times and drought happened 7 times in ethiopia with reported deaths of 1534 and 0 zero direct or immediate death respectively world disaster data base wddb 2016 in future complemented with global climate change and human activities flood is predicted to be more frequent and disastrous nijland 2005 ipcc 2007 dihn et al 2011 even though flooding is a global issue its distribution across the globe varies in type frequency of occurrence and impacts karagiozi et al 2011 asia and africa were reported to be highly affected by flood damages compared to other continents revilla romero et al 2015 ayala 2002 karagiozi et al 2011 this is underpinned by higher frequency and magnitude of the flood events and lack of flood related policy and appropriate local management strategies that are based on flood hazard and risk mapping in these continents flood is unavoidable but manageable natural hazards paul and routray 2010a 2010b it can be managed using structural and non structural methods thampapillai and musgrave 1985 brody et al 2009 this study emphasizes two ways of flood management strategies flood mapping and early warning system the work of flood risk management starts from identification and estimation of current and possible areas of higher hazard potential margins forkuo 2011 plate 2002 sanyal and lu 2004 flood mapping determines inundation extent by using water depth and velocity alaghmand et al 2010 flo 2d is a suitable model to estimate the possible range of flow properties velocity and depth and predict the possible area of inundation o brien 2011 the model was successfully adopted in several countries where there is good record of adequate hydrologic and hydraulic data more importantly flo 2d is known for its versatility to use various variables o brien 2011 as a result the application of the model yields great opportunity to use interchangeable data from different sources such as meteorological hydrological and physical data sources such as digital elevation model dem soil and land use land cover dire dawa has got a long history of flood hazard dating back to the inception of the city historical information revealed that the first damaging flood hazard was recorded in 1945 since then the hazard has been occurring in dire dawa at different time intervals more importantly the flood hazard event of 2006 is worth mentioning some studies were undertaken in the city to identify flood vulnerable villages of dire dawa city yonas tadesse alemu 2015 alemayehu 2007 however their findings did not well address the future simulation and forecasting of possible flood inundation areas in the city flo 2d model is widely used for predicting inundation areas for effective flood risk management planning oberianetal 2011 this study employed flo 2d model to use the model s versatility opportunity whereby various options of data can be used to fill the data scarcity gap of dire dawa city the place with ungauged meteorological stations early warning is another major component of disaster risk reduction un 2015 people in a flood affected localities adopt different measures to minimize the effect of flooding using preventive and adaptive measures paul and routray 2010a 2010b though indigenous early warning systems have been helping to rescue lives and properties of traditional and modern community its contribution is narrowly acknowledged in the literature haque and zaman 1993 rasid and mallik 1995 rashid 2000 paul and routray 2010a 2010b likewise though people of dire dawa city have been employing different early warning systems to cope up with the regularly occurring floods the experience and effort from this system has no institutional backup rather than promoting indigenous early warning systems flood control strategy of the city has been limited to structural measures which are no more effective therefore it is fair to know how peoples of dire dawa employ indigenous knowledge and survived during hard times of regularly occurring flood in nutshell developing flood hazard map and exploring local flood risk management strategies aiming to improve future flood risk planning and management for dire dawa city are the hubs of this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in dire dawa city ethiopia located between 9 26 n and 9 45 n latitude and 41 41 e and 42 07 e longitude dire dawa city is located in the ethiopian rift valley with an altitude of 1000 1200 m above sea level and surrounded by mountainous districts of oromia regional states the city is dissected by five large and small rivers dechatu goro melkajabdu laga hare and butuji rivers all rivers draining the city made their origin from the surrounding highlands of kersa haramaya and meta districts fig 1 2 2 data collection and analysis this study employed collection of both primary and secondary data from their respective sources the primary data used for this study refers to the first hand information collected from sample households these data were used to understand the locally existing flood early warning and adaptation strategies the study also used various types of secondary data the secondary data were collected from different websites organizations and stakeholders these data include 30 m resolution dem soil map topographic map land use map and reports of the city which were utilized to develop flood hazard map of the city with the help of flo 2d model and mapper software mapper is the primary post processing program that views the result of flo 2d flood simulation in order to identify the indigenous coping strategies household survey was conducted in all villages identified as flood prone areas to this end appropriate sampling procedures and methods were employed in the first place flood prone villages were purposely selected based on the flood map developed from secondary data all the identified flood prone villages were considered for further sampling procedure then sample households from each purposively selected village were selected using systematic random sampling accordingly the first household of each village were selected randomly and the subsequent households were selected at a fixed interval of every 10th households finally from 1163 households that fall inside flood hazard zones a sample size of 20 232 households were picked for household survey sampling only the household heads were interviewed directly to represent their corresponding family members the analysis of household survey employed descriptive statistics percentage and frequencies in the form of table and graphs the results of qualitative data obtained through key informant interview and personal observation were descriptively narrated the result of secondary data sources are presented with graduate color map with help of gis and mapper software 2 3 modeling to meet the intended objective of dire dawa city flood hazard mapping the study employed different modeling procedures in integrated manner these include climate modeling hydrological hydraulic and flood modeling as presented hereunder 2 3 1 climate modeling extreme rainfall events are a primary cause for flood hazards worldwide lan fen 2012 the climate modeling is derived from statistical analysis of extreme events the ipcc 2007 fourth assessment report has indicated that the probability of having extreme events may become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change therefore modeling the extreme values resulting from rainfall is of paramount importance for effective planning and management of flood and other climatic hazards however as it demands intensive and quality precipitation data climate modeling is not an easy task it is data intensive because it needs long time series data in terms of quality it needs a minimum of hourly data to simulate future scenarios the climate modeling procedure in this study involved the following steps selection of meteorological stations four meteorological stations dire dawa dangago kersa and haramaya within the dire dawa watershed were selected because the rainfall data from these stations significantly contribute for dire dawa city flooding flo 2d model demands an input of extreme values of rainfall distribution and rainfall intensities to satisfy this condition among four meteorological stations falling in the watershed a station that exerts the highest rainfall intensity was considered to simulate the probability of flood occurrence to identify extreme events of rainfall and intensity the study employed the analysis of time series rainfall data obtained from dire dawa 1953 2014 dangago 1986 2014 and haramaya 1960 2013 meteorological stations due to limited availability of time series rainfall data kersa meteorological station was not considered for this study disaggregation of rainfall data the availability of rainfall records obtained from these meteorological stations was limited to daily time basis as a result the daily rainfall disaggregation model was adopted at first step to achieve hourly based precipitation statistical work was used for conversion purposes accordingly stepwise disaggregation of the daily rainfall to 12 6 3 and 1 h was employed by two alternative downscaling methods the short time intensity disaggregation method connolly et al 1998 de paola francesco et al 2014 was employed to generate the simulation of smaller time windows which is 1 h for this case likewise the random cascade based disaggregation method olsson 1998 and güntner et al 2001 was used for simulation of larger time windows i e 3 h 6 h and 12 h larger window time disaggregation was done with the help of cra clima rain software the easy fit software was used for downscaling to 1 hour simulation idf curve development following disaggregation process this research employed general extreme values theory to generate possible occurrence of the extreme rainfalls from the extreme value results idf curve was developed for return periods of 10 30 50 100 and 300 years to be used for the consumption of flo 2d and rainfall intensity calculation after the maximum values are generated the fitting of the probability distribution was checked by using gumbel s evt i which is commonly used for idf curve preparation 1 gumbel s evt i f x exp x β α exp x β α α x following the maximum value identification the precipitation depths is calculated for a given return period as x t x kt s where x is mean of the data s is the standard deviation and kt is the frequency factor kt values are calculated for different return periods using k t 6 π the validity of the idf curve of each station was tested in two ways the first criterion was checking the self similarity of n values to qualify this the values of n parameter for each return period are expected to be self similar i e uniform value the other test was done by checking the r2 values of each return period in this case the values of each r2 should be between the ranges of 0 98 0 99 idf curve that qualify the two tests at a time was considered for further application intensity estimation rainfall intensity is calculated as the average rainfall depth hr that falls per time increment i hr d with d rainfall duration measured in millimeter per hour de paola francesco et al 2014 the annual extremes are then calculated for various time windows the rainfall curve corresponding to a specific return period is calculated by fitting a suitable probability model to the extreme rainfall data here a bi parameter gumbel probability distribution of gev family distributions has been chosen to describe the extreme rainfall data maione and moisello 2003 the rainfall intensity hr for a given return period and duration d can be calculated from a bi parameter power law de paola francesco et al 2014 2 hr d t a t dn where t is a return period a and n are the parameters of the rainfall curve which can be estimated by a simple linear regression analysis in the bi logarithmic scale namely log hr versus log d this is used to identify the station that generates the highest intensity accordingly idf of dire dawa meteorological station which generates the maximum intensity was considered for flood simulation 2 3 2 hydrological modeling hydrologic models are used to estimate the amounts of stream flow generated by individual extreme events of precipitation or combination of various series time events the hydrological model computes the extreme values by taking into consideration a series time of precipitation data topography soil type and land use land cover conditions these factors help to generate soil curve number and hydrograph soil curve number the land use land cover was combined with the soil hydrological group to compute the soil curve number the quantification of soil curve number was calculated based on the information obtained from ethiopian soil map description and soil curve standard table land use land cover descriptions of dire dawa city watershed was matched with descriptions and curve number values derived from the standard tables jalayer et al 2015 the analysis of curve number values is not only dependent on the land use land cover types but also on the hydrological group of the soils soils have been classified into four hydrologic soil groups hsg a b c and d listed in order of decreasing infiltration rates the study conducted by belete et al 2013 classified hydrological soil group of ethiopia in to a b c and d accordingly values of soil curve were checked with corresponding hydrological soil group of ethiopia as the flood hazard simulation is to forecast the maximum discharge of the maximum return period this study simulation considered scn iii of 300 years return period this helps to develop long lasting and sustainable flood mitigation and adaptation strategies all types of soil curve numbers were computed using the u s army corp of engineering usace 2008 formulas 3 c n i i i 1 n c n i a i i 1 n a i i 1 n a i where cn weighted curve number ii cni curve number from 1 to any no n 4 c n i 4 2 c n i i 10 0 058 c n i i ai area with curve number cni a the total area of the watershed 5 c n i i i 23 c n i i 10 0 13 c n i i hydrograph development hydrograph is used to generate and estimate peak discharge of the catchments hydrograph is derived from physical characteristics of the catchment the required physical characteristics for generation of hydrograph include slope area of the catchment and length of the longest stream catchment areas the percentage of slope rise and channel length were generated from dem in the gis environment finally dire dawa watershed was split in two dechatu and goro catchments for analysis purpose furthermore other hydrological parameters such as time of concentration tc accumulation time ta and lag time tl needed to develop hydrograph are calculated based on the formula developed by simas 1996 time of concentration tc is the time required for runoff to travel from the most distant hydraulic point located in the upstream of the watershed to the outlet located at the extreme dawn stream time of concentration is generated based on the formula 6 t a 0 5 t p t l where ta accumulation time tp rainfall event duration h and tl lag time h lag time represents the time consumed between the occurrence of rainfall and the occurrence of peak discharge it is computed by the formula 7 t l 0 342 l 0 8 i b 1000 c n 9 0 7 land use system governs a lot of hydrological elements such as time of concentration and lag time land use information helps to determine the soil curve number the land use map of the city and surrounding district was used for this purpose 2 3 3 hydraulic modeling hydraulic model was used to compute stream flow conditions such as flow velocity flow depth and the size of possible inundation flo 2d is important software basically used for this purpose the application of flood simulation has followed the following procedures initially dem was used to create the areas of interest of the watershed boundary for this purpose a 30 meter dem file was imported into the software in the form of ascii grid file the ascii file was used for easy conversion of xyz grid file in global mapper software grid computation was done from the ascii file the number of grid element and acceptable computation time range was calculated based on the standard range of 15 and 150 m haltas et al 2016 accordingly the grid size creation for this simulation was defined to be 30 m the following criterion of flo 2d manual was used in the selection of the grid size 8 0 3 m s q max a elem 3 m s where q max is the maximum discharge estimated at the grid element and a elem is grid area to assign the representative elevation of each grid element grid interpolation is done in the model in addition a cumulative of 10 30 50 100 and 300 year return period of climate modeling and hydrological model result of hydrograph and soil curve number were used for flo 2d flood hazard simulation the result of the simulation is post processed in the mapper software from the final results of the numerical model results maximum flow depth and maximum flow velocity were created the combined end product of maximum velocity and water depth helped to generate hazard map of the city the hazard maps were classified as high medium and low zones based on a widely adopted criterion developed by garcia and lopez 2005 accordingly areas with h depth in m 1 5 and v x h 1 5 m s is classified as high hazard zone if 0 5 h 1 5 and v x h 1 5 m s the zone is classified as medium hazard zones lastly areas with 0 1 h 0 5 and v x h 0 5 m s are classified as low hazard zone the result of each category was assigned with graduate color depending on the value of the hazard level for example in this study red indicates a high level of hazard while yellow and green represent medium and low hazard zones respectively the overall methodology of the study is shown in fig 2 2 4 model validation as a part of scientific work model calibration and validation is recommended for every work of flood hazard modeling however data availability hinders calibration in data scarce region where there is no well established meteorological station and hydrologic data bases alternatively verification of inundation area can be used to verify the model using property damage data base resident survey data and remnants of trees and other objects affected by flood during extreme events huxley and kuch 2016 validation is the process of establishing evidence that provides reasonable information that the output of the software is good enough to represent the facts on the ground to the acceptable level the model validation of this study employed ground control points gcp collection and interview from residents both were used to identify the maximum flood inundation registered during the past flood events because of the vast coverage of the city the validation was limited to few villages where flood hazard repeatedly affects accordingly four villages of the city 05 06 07 and 09 were considered for this purpose the reliability of the flo 2d result versus ground distance measure was tested using paired t test using spss statistical package for social sciences 9 t d μ d s d n where d mean difference μd standard error n number of sample and sd standard deviation 3 results 3 1 flood hazard mapping in dire dawa city 3 1 1 idf curve intensity duration frequency idf is the graphical representations of the amount of water that falls within a given period of time dupont et al 2000 these graphs are the base for estimation of the extreme discharge moreover idf is used to determine the average length of time between events of a given extreme discharges the reliability of idf curve is affected by availability of precipitation data therefore checking validity of idf curve is mandatory to generate possible discharge coverage based on the criterion of self similarity and r2 values of each return period out of the four stations only two of them dire dawa and haramaya stations are qualified for the idf curve validity test fig 3 3 1 2 catchments physiographic information the physiographic characteristics of the two basins required to calculate the discharge are presented under table 1 the physical characteristics of the basins shows that catchment 1 having less area lesser principal stream length and quick time of concentration generates the possible maximum discharge and large inundation areas 3 1 3 hydrograph based discharge estimation hydrograph is a graph showing the rate of discharge versus time at specific point in a river for specific time events the work of flood hazard mapping demands the possible maximum discharge of the two meteorological stations haramaya and dire dawa and corresponding catchments of the two catchments the one which generate maximum discharge is used for flood modeling purposes based on the comparison the hydrograph of catchment 1 of dire dawa station which generates maximum discharge up to 1200 q m3 s at 300 year return periods is considered for flood hazard simulation purpose fig 4 a 3 1 4 flow depth the maximum flow depth map is presented for dechatu river the result of flow depths shows that the depth reaches up to 4 2 m in the residential area located at the southern parts of the city village 06 and 3 7 m around some central parts of village 09 fig 5 3 1 5 flow velocity flow velocities become as high as 7 m s just at downstream of the southern parts and some inner villages of the city in areas where the slope of the city is flat the velocity slows down to less than 0 5 m s fig 6 3 1 6 hazard map hazard mapping and prediction of inundation is the primary step for flood mitigation and adaptation it is used to define areas which are at risk of flooding under extreme precipitation based on flow depth and velocity the hazard map of dechtu river was developed using flo 2d software as shown in fig 7 the hazard map shows that about 146 buildings covering 15 330 m2 areas are located in the high hazard zone the other 245 and 772 buildings with areas of 25 725 m2 and 81 060 m2 fall inside the medium and less hazard zones respectively 3 2 model validation the work of validation was done using ground measurement from past flood affected points to the nearest banks of the river this was used to check the compatibility of the software result with actual existing truth on the ground the identifications of maximum flood affected points were done with the reference to 2006 flood hazard margins the 2006 flood margin was chosen for its highest degree of effect and recentness to be recalled by the communities the margins of the flood affected points and damaged remnants were identified by interviewing the communities for accuracy assessments 13 ground control points gcp were collected during field survey the gcp were marked with global positioning system gps tool and integrated to the inundation maps table 2 for statistical test the row data collected from the field was compiled with the help of spss and generated the following result mean 0 307 correlation 0 999 std deviation 4 423 std error mean 1 226 p value 0 806 at 95 confidence interval of difference the correlation of the software result and ground measurement 0 999 indicates that the two results are highly correlated as the correlation value of 0 999 is close to 1 the results have strong positive relationship for more visualization the hazard map is overlaid with gps based collected data of flood affected areas accordingly the result shows that the presentation of flo 2d software output and the edge of flood affected ground truth point data are fitting to each other showing that the information is accurate to present boundaries of the possible flood inundations fig 8 3 3 local flood management strategies 3 3 1 demographic characteristics of respondents age and education are risk sensitive demographic characteristics the age distribution of the sample data shows that respondents of all age classes were represented the age analysis result shows that the distribution is skewed to the two extreme age classes of old 50 and young 18 35 years table 3 shows that population above 50 years of age and the young 18 35 years represented 39 1 and 36 4 respectively this shows that flood hazard zone is mostly occupied by retired and young people of low income households likewise education is another characteristic of flood prone area population the education profile shows that 40 9 of sample respondents are illiterate people and 29 1 have primary level education the rest 22 7 and 7 3 were educated at secondary and tertiary levels respectively in terms of education flood hazard zones are predominantly inhabited by illiterate and less educated households 3 3 2 local early warning systems the survey result shows that flood adaptation mechanism of the study area population mainly employs early warning based copying strategies performed at individual and community level beside to individual experience the people of dire dawa developed community level early warning strategies that has been serving as a means of evacuation during occurrence of extreme flood events the community level early warning strategies are summarized in table 5 3 3 3 local flood management strategies flood management strategies are aimed at how to reduce the risk of flood events for the people and properties which are located in flood prone areas in the study area flood risk management strategies are broadly classified as mitigation and adaptation strategies table 6 4 discussion 4 1 implication of flood hazard mapping for flood management strategy flood is the major natural hazard threatening dire dawa city and its watershed sustainable flood management researchers emphasize that flood mapping is the first step to combat effects of flooding forkuo 2011 plate 2002 sanyal and lu 2004 flo 2d involves the use of maximum velocity and depth to create flood hazard map of the study area fig 7 the presentation of flo 2d model identified villages subjected to different levels of flood hazard zones accordingly villages such as 03 06 05 07 and 09 located close to dechatu river fall inside flood hazard zones of different levels among flood prone areas major parts of village 06 05 and 09 are located inside high hazard zones these villages are the oldest and presently located in the most inner part of the city the majority of this finding is similar to related studies that identified village 09 06 05 and 03 of dire dawa city as a most flood affected villages yonas tadesse alemu 2015 as far as village 07 is concerned the findings of these two studies contradict with each other this is because of the methods employed and parameters considered the previous study employed hec ras hydraulic model considering flood depth to delineate flood hazards whereas the current study employed flo 2d hydraulic model that integrate maximum velocity and flow depth to delineate flood hazard map as a result this study identified additional village located inside flood hazard zones the flood map analysis of the present study revealed that about 146 buildings occupying an area of 15 330 m2 are located in the high hazard zone the other 245 and 772 buildings occupying area of 25 725 m2 and 81 060 m2 fall inside the medium and less hazard zones respectively furthermore the flood hazard map shows that villages located inside high hazard zones experience maximum flow velocity and depth that ranges up to 7 m s and 4 m respectively this implies that flood induced damage on property and loss of human lives are more severe in these residential areas exposed to higher flood depth and velocity as parts of flood management strategy flood prone areas deserve peculiar attention for planning and conservation strategies therefore villages that fall inside the high hazard zone should be planned for other economic and environmental activities other than for settlement purposes similarly portions of villages that fall inside medium and less hazard zones are recommended for different schemes of mitigation strategies the analysis of flood hazard map also shows that the hazard map covers a distance of 60 400 m from the river center at different sites of dechatu river the result of this finding contradicts with the 50 m river buffer zones proposed by 2006 integrated development master plan of dire dawa city the variation is resulted from hypothetical demarcation by the master plan study and the 2d model based demarcation by the present study implying that the two dimensional models are more accurate in identifying water discharge and flood inundation areas this shows that the traditional ways of buffer zone demarcation proposed by master plan of the city has not considered the detailed analysis of flood plain area flood characteristics topography and water depth conditions at different river cross sections and therefore needs improvement the remnants of flood protection wall built during italian occupation 1935 1941 and the information obtained from the elders confirms that the italians had delineated up to 500 m buffer along the southern parts of dechatu river however large areas of these areas are currently exploited for residence and other communal activities such as schools bus stations and industries the key interviewed respondents reported that these sites are flooded many times following the occurrence of heavy rainfall the un report shows that at least 15 000 dwellers are living in high flood risk areas in the city of dire dawa un habitat 2009 looking at the location material makeup and nature of the houses most of buildings located in high hazard zone of the study area belong to illegal settlements and slum houses this implies that poor people who are unable to afford the actual cost of land occupied the flood prone areas the interviewed people reported that most of the houses close to the river banks are illegal settlements that are mushrooming during night times on top of this the evidence from personal observation key informant interview and past flood damage report shows that flood hazard in these areas were very disastrous this was mainly because of poor river buffer planning high population density poor material makeup and old nature of the houses to this end resettling people from the high hazard zone can minimize the flood induced risks the current study also tried to emphasize the household distribution of flood prone area population from demographic education and socio economic perspectives the demographic distribution of flood hazard zone population of the area is characterized by older age 50 and younger age 18 35 years table 3 the adult age category who have produced some asset and able to afford cost of their family are less settled in flood hazard zones in contrast the retired people who have no option to generate additional income and the young who did not gained adequate asset are occupying flood hazard zones as the costs of the areas are less expensive from education context populations occupying the flood prone areas are illiterate and less educated society in nutshell the demographic socio economic and education analyses of the study area shows that flood prone population are economically and socially marginalized groups flood hazard map plays a significant role in determining suitable flood protection measures of a given area mani et al 2014 mollaei et al 2016 in the study area attempt to flood hazard management is not a new phenomenon following the devastating flood of 2006 the city government is allocating huge budget to eliminate flood induced risks human causalities and property damage using structural methods accordingly 6 km high and several kilometers long retailing walls have been constructed along dechatu and goro rivers despite of this flood management effort flood continues to present the greatest threat to live and properties of the city dwellers the sampled households reported that the supposed flood protection wall itself has been the victim of extreme flooding this shows that lack of appropriate delineation of inundations and mapping of flood hazard zones that govern the construction of structural methods has significantly affected the effectiveness of ongoing flood management strategy flood map identifies the territory of flooding that guides where flood defense mechanisms should take place this study developed flood hazard map of dire dawa city to supplement future planned flood management activities it is therefore recommended that permanent retaining walls and other engineering based defense mechanisms should be constructed out of the inundated areas where the maximum flood level touches this study through flood mapping has identified large number of buildings and households located in high medium and low hazard zones this helps the city government ngos and other concerned organs to identify the areas where to start flood intervention activities 4 2 implication of local knowledge and action in flood management strategy flood management strategies are aimed at how to reduce the risk of flood events for the people and properties which are located in flood prone areas flood early warning is a space specific process that varies with place and time different studies identified different countries experience of flood forecasting systems in pakistan wind movement cloud color and direction and animal behavior were used as flood forecast strategies fakhruddin et al 2015 paul and routray 2010a 2010b shape and position of the moon at different months was also used by communities of khetran society to forecast flood hazards khetran et al 2012 similar studies conducted in zimbabwe found out that cloud color position of the moon and height of birds nests are among the locally developed flood forecasting systems mapara 2009 bongo et al 2017 in dire dawa area as well people have been using their stored experience and indigenous knowledge to rescue their life and property before and during the time of extreme events the local flood management strategies of study area broadly classified in to adaptation and early warning strategies 4 2 1 local knowledge and action in flood adaptation strategies the people of dire dawa developed different local adaptation strategies such as using flood inundation areas for market places temporary move from houses diverting flood direction using sandbag around houses and climbing roof of houses the survey result shows that temporary move during extreme flood events is the most acquainted strategy table 6 people in flood prone areas evacuate their families and properties to safe places before the occurrence of flood event likewise some households use sandbag to rise an existing level of places through which flood enters the property other respondents reported that they climb top of their roof to safeguard their life they indicated that during evening times when it is difficult to determine the water level they climb the roof of their house until flood gets slow in velocity and decreases in volume moreover the communities of dire dawa city use the large area of flood inundation for market purposes the most commonly known open markets called ashewa and taiwan are conducted in flood inundation areas of dechatu river some of the finding of this study such as temporary move and climbing roof of houses agree with the findings of gwimbi 2007 and mavhura et al 2013 however using the vacant space of inundation areas for market purpose is the unique experience limited to dire dawa city population 4 2 2 local early warning knowledge and flood management strategies early warning is used to forecast the event of flood before the incident takes place from their experience people of a given locality know the type of hazards threatening their locality and can predict how and when the event occurs following less efficiency of structural protection works early warning becomes more central to the risk management approach unisdr 2005 the role of early warning is more important in cities of the developing countries like dire dawa where there are limited scientific weather forecasting systems in response to regular flood hazards the people of dire dawa city have developed different experiences of flood hazard forecasting at individual and community levels even though they are not in a position to totally avoid the flood induced risks they have been exercising their best knowledge of typical early warning and adaptations to live in harmony with flood the compiled result of the survey data shows that the locally available flood forecast is categorized into individual and community level warning systems individual flood early warning of the study area comprises smell of flood cloud color and direction weather condition and special months of a season table 4 flood smell is a flood forecast method using human smelling sense organ this forecast was effective to warn when the flood comes from the upper catchments in the absence of rainfall in the dawn streams flood smell is formed when the flowing flood water dilutes a dry soil where rainfall did not occur respondents indicated that whenever they experience the flood smell with no rain in dire dawa it is certain that the flood reach the city in 30 min they reported that as soon as they sense the smell of flood they order their family to leave out the house and to arrange the properties forecasting looking at cloud color and direction is the other commonly practiced early warning system among the people of dire dawa city cloud direction shows the source of the air masses while cloud color predicts the amount of rainfall the respondents reported that they forecast the daily condition of their weather from their past experience simply by observing the direction and color of clouds dire dawa city has been experiencing flood hazard since the establishment of the city because of this the people of the city are familiar with the flood inducing clouds they forecast the changing situation of the weather that is going to happen within a half day to few hours by observing the cloud and wind pattern they make necessary preparation before the event takes place as most of the flood prone populations are low income communities they have no radio or television to listen the national level broadcasting of weather related news but certainly they predict what their local daily weather condition looks like some respondents reported that the extreme fluctuation of weather is their experience for heavy rainfall forecast their experience in this regard shows that during the rainy months sometimes a sudden extreme hotness takes place this hotness is special that forbid the use of night clothes following the occurrence of extreme hotness they expect that a heavy rain that induce flood hazard follows soon in the coming days therefore people warn themselves so that the whole family should not sleep together and sleep by shift at least one person in the family has to follow the situation even in the night time to alarm the family incase heavy rain takes place extreme coldness also used as a flood forecast mechanism but coldness is used to forecast the weather condition of upper catchment some times in the eve of heavy rainfall to take place in the upper catchment the downstream people feel extreme coldness in that case the downstream people understand that upper catchment is receiving heavy rainfall following that they start to inquire about upper catchment information of rainfall the occurrence of rainfall is season specific dire dawa city and surrounding regions experience a bimodal behavior of rainfall seasons the first round which extends from june to august is the normal summer rainfall season the second season is from march to may from their experience the indigenous populations have identified months when flood threatening rainfalls are expected accordingly june july and august are identified as flooding months table 4 in addition to individual experience through continuous experience and exposure to events communities have developed their own early warning system that fits to their socio cultural conditions this enables them to live in harmony with their local environment for generations united nations environment programme unep 2008 the community level flood early warning system works in disseminating flood information and action to be taken gunshot voice call from neighbor telephone call from upper catchment and ambulance services are identified as community level flood early warning systems table 5 sometimes flood early warning comes from upper catchment where flood inducing rainfall takes place the upper catchment information comes from surrounding highlands located at a distance of 20 30 km away from the city center from their experience the upper catchments population knows the kind of rainfall that threatens the life of downstream residents whenever they realize the rain is heavy and think lead to damage they provide information to their families and relatives living in the downstream through telephone about 17 3 of the sampled populations were communicated by upper catchment friends and benefiting from this information table 5 in the study area militaries shot gun as a means of flood early warning the military camp is located at 5 km distance outside of the city center on the way flood is coming to downstream the site of their camp is at strategic place to see where the flood from different streams joining together before entering to the city taking their own observation about the flood condition they keep shooting chain of bullets to alert the society the survey report shows that 42 7 of respondents are the beneficiary of early warning strategy coming from the gunshot in many cases the information of early warning comes from house to house dissemination of information by neighbors this is more practiced during evening time the neighbors are responsible to communicate their fellow neighbors for evacuation the significant number of respondents 21 8 are benefiting from this kind of early warning strategies ambulance service was another means of early warning system ambulance provides dual services at the first stage ambulance rounding the village gives warning about the condition of rainfall secondly it delivers assistance for the victims during the evacuation unlike many countries ethiopia does not have any policy and institution that specifically deal with flood people have been living in the city using their own knowledge of flood forecast and evacuation strategies some of the locally available experiences of flood forecast and early warning strategies of dire dawa city such as wind direction and cloud color overlap with the findings of previous studies found in different parts of the world however it is worth mentioning the peculiar individual and community level early warning and dissemination strategies limited to dire dawa city the individual knowledge of early warning system such as flood smell telephone call from upper catchments and extreme weather changes are complemented with community level flood information dissemination system such as gunshot neighborhood assistance and ambulance services have been serving as effective flood management strategy to rescue the life and property of the society it is believed that these findings will improve flood management strategies of similar places facing flood problem and further enrich the limited literatures observed on topics focusing on local flood management strategies moreover having a lot of strength in rescuing life and property of the society these strategies are limited to withstand risks when extreme events take place for further betterment and effectiveness these strategies deserve institutional and policy backup that enhance the quality of the strategies and capacity of the communities 5 conclusions and recommendation this study has mapped flood hazard and explored local flood risk management strategies for dire dawa city regarding the flood mapping the study applied hydrodynamic modeling with the help of flo 2d the result of flo 2d produced hazard maps based on maximum flow depth and resultant velocity the results reveal that flow depths can reach up to 4 m in the residential areas of dechatu and koka villages villages 05 and 06 moreover the velocities are as fast as 7 m s around the inner cities of villages 05 06 and 07 the result of the hazard map also shows that large number of households falls inside the hazard map of different levels accordingly 146 buildings were located inside the high hazard zones the other 245 and 772 buildings were located inside medium and less hazards zones respectively furthermore the location of hazard map shows that inner cities of village 05 and 06 are among the most vulnerable villages located in high hazard zones to this end the study suggested that the construction of retailing wall and other engineering structures should be located outside of the flood inundated areas the study also explored the local flood management strategies in dire dawa city though there are no organized policies and institutions working on flood management of the city people have survived in their environment since the inception of the city people have been responding to the flood risk with their locally developed flood forecasting mitigation and adaptation strategies except for damages which are beyond the capacity of the community people have been successfully managing the flood risk and survived in their environment had it not been for the help of these local management strategies the city would have been left void of people and settlements in most cases indigenous flood management strategies are highly effective in normal flood conditions however these strategies are limited to withstand the consequences of extreme events beyond normal occurrence it is highly recommended that the flood hazard map developed for the city is properly utilized for future flood risk planning and management moreover integrated flood risk management strategies such as establishing trans boundary flood management institution and integrated watershed management should be adopted in dire dawa city and its watershed to manage flood risks in sustainable manner in a nutshell the locally available flood risk management strategies should be complimented by science based flood forecasting and mapping system in future flood risk management strategy of the city and its watershed conflict of interest we

aquifer system of the city and the related geochemistry of the aquifer in the area it is relevant for the prevention of flourosis through management of drinking water which is a difficult task requires favorable conditions combining knowledge motivation prioritization discipline and technical and organizational support 2 study area lake hawassa catchment is part of the main ethiopian rift containing lake hawassa 1680 m above sea level m a s l the lake catchment lies between latitude 6 48 45 7 14 49 n and longitude38 16 34 38 43 26 e hawassa city is found in the catchment adjacent to the lake where the lake got its name the average altitude of the city is 1697 m a s l the city is one of the fast growing in the country with the development of basic infrastructure and different industries ceramics brewery textile and garment there are nine sub cities within the administrative area of the city where tulahewela sub city has the largest areal coverage however there were only seven well points located within this sub city the rift system is one of the largest structural features of the earth s crust extending for a distance of 6000 km from mozambique to syria equivalent to 1 6th of the earth s circumference in ethiopia the rift system extends over 1000 km in the ne direction it covers 150 000km2 and it can be divided into two broad units the main ethiopian rift mer 50 90 n and 37030 400e and the afar depression table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collection and organization the main data used for the assessment of hydraulic properties of formations were well pump test data well drilling completion reports borehole depth data water quality data location and geologic map of the formations well location data collected during fieldwork location information and gps coordinates northing and easting of all wells are collected in order to crosscheck with the existing design pumping test data pumping test data of the wells with constant pumping rate for the whole 24 h is recorded for sample wells one important thing to cross check was the location of communal and private wells measuring their exact depth water level and the pumping test data of 25 wells for the year 1998 up to 2014 the wells are erratically distributed over the area which is within utm location covering from 440 465 m zewd village at the lakeshore to 448 915 m eastern corner and 770917 m garareqata at the south to 782781 m at the north tip the maximum and minimum elevation of well point is 1768 m a s l at ttc and 1669 m a s l respectively the boreholes depth included in this study ranges from 25 m zewdvillage well to 200 m gara riqata1 well 4 results and discussion 4 1 geological and hydro geological setting the researcher assessed the aquifer type and water bearing formations of borehole sites the main water bearing geological formation in the groundwater system is classified along with the respective water bearing thickness table 2 as it is depicted in the table igneous and weathered formations weathered basalt ignimbrite pumice rhyolite and scoracious were found to be the main water bearing strata such igneous rocks encountered in prevalent geothermal environments especially the very recent one were good indicators of volcanism which could serve as heat source for geothermal system to exist these formation having nature of igneous rock in the shallow strata of the water bearing aquifer have significant contribution for the fluoride ion concentration the fractured and complex hydro geological nature of the upper formation can also indicated that there could be contamination risk in the area from surface sources as well especially in the western part the industrial area such surface source contamination risks could be prevalent on top of this it is found that the aquifer system lacks clay layer that can serve as natural barriers to protect groundwater from such imminent fluoride sources the industry zone is pumice and highly fractured basalt these areas are highly exposed for industrial waste hence if it is damped as in the chalalak wetland the pollutant chemicals can easily join the fractured aquifer system which is the cause for fluoride rich water these water bearing formations weathered pumice scoria fractured basalt and sand of different types possess large pores however pumice and the fractured basalts strata that are common relatively in the shallower formations are devoid of primary openings they possess secondary openings in the form of fractures and joints these features aid in facilitating the infiltration of surface water through it the pores and fractures in late rites and fractures and joints in basalts which can act as reservoirs of groundwater hence the fractured nature of the formation associated with the shallowness of the water bearing formations and the local situation i e being waste disposal area there will be a great possibility of surface pollution in to the aquifer on the other hand the far southern part gara riqata where relatively the deepest wells in this study area were located the water striking point were also found deeper and the major aquifers formed of course medium and fine grained sand the fine grain sand is dominant in the layer from 184 m to 196 m from the surface where the water bearing formation is located the top non water bearing strata from top 18 m to 166 m is found to be dominated by weather pumice igneous rock which is of high source of fluoride however as the water comes from only sandy formations it is of good quality with respect to its f and tds concentration table 3 in general pumice and highly fractured and weathered scoracious formation dominates the water bearing strata 52 m 84 m and fine to course grained sand is the main water source in depth beyond 100 m thus lack of confining rocks and or clay layer in the medium strata indicates that groundwater occurs in unconfined conditions in the weathered basalts 4 2 fluoride ion and tds of the aquifer the analysis result of the fluoride level and total dissolved solids indicated that the fluoride ion concentration values range from 0 65 mg l to 11 mg l whereas the total dissolved solids ranges from 170 to 725 mg l the two water quality parameters result showed that the respective concentration values are somewhat higher at the shallower depths less than 60 m table 3 the values in the shallower wells it is found that they didn t satisfy the standard set for drinking water fig 1 for most of the cases the tabulated result showed that the ground water from shallow aquifers were retch in fluoride ion this could be associated with the geologic formation the inherent property of the water bearing strata and the physical environment i e the external temperature and geothermal nature of the area as it is discussed in the previous section the dominant water bearing formation of these areas are weathered pumice igneous rocks and volcanic rocks and accompanied by high temperature hence these rocks along with the high temperature ensure chemical reaction for the formation of the fluoride ion the groundwater sampled from wells in such formations showed high fluoride ion concentration up to 11 mg l this depicts that the major sources of fluoride ion pollution in the study area could be the inherent property of the water bearing formation on top of that the evaporation due to high temperature in the area could possibly increase the concentration of the fluoride ion in the shallow aquifer for instance in areas like hawassa flour factory there is high fluoride concentration of 11 9 8 and 8 7 mg l respectively these wells are located in shallow water bearing stratum where the weathered pumice igneous rock are dominant which is rich source of fluoride though shallow aquifers containing recent infiltration of rainwater have low fluoride content fluoride concentration of shallow aquifers increases as a consequence of temperature enhanced fluorite caf2 solubility and hydrogen fluoride hf gas dissolution due to hydrothermal activation caused in active volcanic areas as that of the study area generally deeper aquifers have better water quality therefore the water from the deep aquifer 60 m is of good quality which fulfills the ethiopian standard 3 mm l in general and those wells of 80 m depth fulfill who standards even securely by looking into the other conditions like climate and feeding habits of the consumers appendix table s10 using spss statistical analysis is conducted to see the significance of the observed parameters for both parameters at α 0 001 and 95 confidence interval i e it is strongly significant fitting non linear model tables 3 5 and figs 6 and 7 the result clearly shows the deeper the well depth the better is the fluoride and tds concentration as it is depicted from the water quality of the garariqata the top non water bearing formation is dominated by weathered pumice rock which is the major source of fluoride rich water however since the depth of the well the water bearing strata which is dominated by fine sand is below such formation it was possible to get good quality of water in terms of fluoride and tds concentration indeed water rock interactions commonly occur during the evolution of a basin especially at deep burial strata under the condition where the ground water is rich in carbonates and or bicarbonates the dissolution of fluoride ion could possibly happen during the water mineral fluorite interaction as a major source of the ion in the ground water as expressed in reaction eqs a and b a caf2 na2co3 caco3 2f 2na b caf2 2nahco3 caco3 2na 2f h2o co2 in the above reactions the bicarbonate rich water in a weathered rock formation accelerates the dissolution of caf2 to release fluoride into the groundwater with time minerals rich in calcite caco3 also favor the dissociation of fluoride from fluoride rich minerals as expressed in reaction c and d c caco3 h 2f caf2 hco3 d caf2 ca 2 f certain sensitive factors behind high fluoride concentration in groundwater include crystalline rocks especially granites of alkaline nature with calcium deficiency the fluoride content of groundwater during mineral dissolution is governed by the solubility of caf2 whereas the solubility of calcite and fluorite controls the dissolution of ca2 in groundwater among all fluoride rich minerals fluorite is the most abundant and occurs in almost all rocks and detrimental minerals which are true for the water bearing formations in the study area most of the rocks in the study area are weathered which reveals the occurrence of hydrolysis dissociation and dissolution hence the above explained chemical reaction process could possibly associated with the high fluoride ion dissolution and pollution of the groundwater in the study area the fluoride ion concentration special distribution analysis showed that the northwestern part of the study area which is near to the lakeshore and relatively of shallow water bearing formation was beyond the allowable standard set for drinking water fig 2 whereas the southern side of the study areas garariqata shows very low concentration of both fluoride 0 65 mg l and tds 170 mg l this is the area which has been identified as major groundwater recharge zone by hcwssse 2010 because of its low electric conductivity and high ph values the eastern side has moderately low concentration while the northern corner and the lakeshore areas exhibit high concentrations of both parameters hence the study area can be sub divided in to three on the basis of fluoride and tds concentration high fluoride and tds area north part hawassa caldera and the lake shore low fluoride and tds area east and south and medium fluoride and tds area eastern and south eastern part of the hawassa city the ground water in the medium and high areas is not suitable for drinking water because of fluoride concentration as a result currently the ground water of those areas is used for sanitation swimming pools and gardening purposes alone with respect to the depth of wells the general trend shows a decrease of fluoride ion concentration with depth as clearly indicated from the result where shallower aquifer has elevated concentrations of fluoride and deeper aquifers have very low fluoride consequently in areas where the calcium ion concentration is high due to the prevailing geochemical processes it may play a critical role in determining the fluoride content of the ground water as reported by the ohio epa division of drinking and ground waters ddagw technical series 2012 fluoride levels have shown to decline as water travels from the surface through the soil zone and into ground water with very similar fashion the tds values range from 170 mg l gara riqata to 700 mg l hawassa flour tables 2 and 3 and fig 3 all the tds values are in the potable range of water quality standard values 1000 mg l being the deeper formations more suitable however with the existing information it was not possible to assess the spatial variability of the suitability of groundwater for agriculture and industrial use rather only the general trend in terms of groundwater suitability for drinking water is presented in this study to evaluate the relationship between well depth and fluoride ion concentration well depth and tds and fluoride ion with tds linear correlation analyses were conducted figs 6 and 7 table 6 in the statistical analysis the independent variable is borehole depth and dependent variable is fluoride ion this means it is possible to estimate fluoride concentration at different depths using the model with 78 percent accurate variation relation since water is a solvent and which is capable of dissolving and interacting with organic and inorganic components of soils the minerals that make up unconsolidated deposits e g sand and gravel and with various types of bedrock dissolution of minerals within the soil sediment and bedrock is a slow process that can take days years or eons depending on the solubility of the materials these materials contribute to the amount of total dissolved solids tds that are present in all groundwater major dissolved constituents of groundwater include the cations positively charged ions sodium potassium calcium magnesium and silica and the anions negatively charged ions bicarbonate sulfate chloride and nitrate fig 4 the independent variable is borehole depth and dependent variable is tds the model enables the estimation of the tds value at the required depth with 68 percent relation the resulting regression analysis indicated that there is an inverse or negative correlation between both fluoride ion concentration and tds with borehole depth the proportion of variation explained by the exponential model is strong that the model explained 78 percent and 68 of the variation in f and tds respectively at α 0 001 this indicates water extracted from deeper aquifers is of good quality table 7 fig 5 4 3 conclusion in general the output of the study indicated that shallow hand dug wells in hawassa city are highly exposed to the chemical reaction which could result in fluorine dissolution high temperature and ease surface source contamination in most part of the fluoride and tds affected areas water bearing formation was dominated by crystallized rocks igneous rocks highly weathered pumice volcanic ash fractured and weathered basalt weathered rhyolite scoria and other igneous rock formations areas which have such formations rich source of fluoride and high temperature geothermal energy which facilitate the dissolution of the fluoride ion are highly exposed to fluoride contamination so that using the water for drinking purpose has high health risk however there areas like gara riqata which have aquifer layers below 160 m are characterized as safe sources of fluoride ion and tds thus the water is free of fluoride problem therefore drilling to the deeper 50 m depth in the aquifer system beyond where such caf2 rich sources especially in areas of high geothermal energy and or blinding such thickness of the aquifer could alleviate the problem of fluoride contamination either drilling to the deeper depth 60 m or blinding the aquifer system where such caf2 rich sources accumulate could alleviate the problem of fluoride contamination in the area appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org 10 1016 j ejrh 2018 09 003 appendix a

over 40 of deep and shallow wells are contaminated with up to 36 mg l sometimes 62 mg l of fluoride which is significantly higher than the who guideline of 1 5 mg l rango et al 2014 that can give rise to a number of adverse effects natural groundwater quality is mostly affected by total dissolved solids gases and pollutants and is controlled by presence of soluble or reactive minerals in aquifers ewtc 2008 increased exploitation of groundwater reserves coupled with a lack of information on declining water quality water tables level extraction estimates and aquifer properties is of great concern from a sustainability standpoint as rock chemistry and geological process like weathering of rocks which promotes the availability of fluoride ions in the groundwater rafique et al 2008 needs to be characterized in the study area existing methods for defluoridation of drinking water involve expensive and high technology or are slow inefficient and unhygienic yadav et al 2008 rango et al 2014 also there is a gap concerning documentation of past experience evaluating the existing performance of the spatial aquifer system chemical properties and introduction of quality improvement techniques study area therefore this study is aimed to identify the major water bearing geological formations of the hawassa city the spatial variation and distribution of fluoride ion and tds in the aquifer system of the city and the related geochemistry of the aquifer in the area it is relevant for the prevention of flourosis through management of drinking water which is a difficult task requires favorable conditions combining knowledge motivation prioritization discipline and technical and organizational support 2 study area lake hawassa catchment is part of the main ethiopian rift containing lake hawassa 1680 m above sea level m a s l the lake catchment lies between latitude 6 48 45 7 14 49 n and longitude38 16 34 38 43 26 e hawassa city is found in the catchment adjacent to the lake where the lake got its name the average altitude of the city is 1697 m a s l the city is one of the fast growing in the country with the development of basic infrastructure and different industries ceramics brewery textile and garment there are nine sub cities within the administrative area of the city where tulahewela sub city has the largest areal coverage however there were only seven well points located within this sub city the rift system is one of the largest structural features of the earth s crust extending for a distance of 6000 km from mozambique to syria equivalent to 1 6th of the earth s circumference in ethiopia the rift system extends over 1000 km in the ne direction it covers 150 000km2 and it can be divided into two broad units the main ethiopian rift mer 50

pump test data well drilling completion reports borehole depth data water quality data location and geologic map of the formations well location data collected during fieldwork location information and gps coordinates northing and easting of all wells are collected in order to crosscheck with the existing design pumping test data pumping test data of the wells with constant pumping rate for the whole 24 h is recorded for sample wells one important thing to cross check was the location of communal and private wells measuring their exact depth water level and the pumping test data of 25 wells for the year 1998 up to 2014 the wells are erratically distributed over the area which is within utm location covering from 440 465 m zewd village at the lakeshore to 448 915 m eastern corner and 770917 m garareqata at the south to 782781 m at the north tip the maximum and minimum elevation of well point is 1768 m a s l at ttc and 1669 m a s l respectively the boreholes depth included in this study ranges from 25 m zewdvillage well to 200 m gara riqata1 well 4 results and discussion 4 1 geological and hydro geological setting the researcher assessed the aquifer type and water bearing formations of borehole sites the main water bearing geological formation in the groundwater system is classified along with the respective water bearing thickness table 2 as it is depicted in the table igneous and weathered formations weathered basalt ignimbrite pumice rhyolite and scoracious were found to be the main water bearing strata such igneous rocks encountered in prevalent geothermal environments especially the very recent one were good indicators of volcanism which could serve as heat source for geothermal system to exist these formation having nature of igneous rock in the shallow strata of the water bearing aquifer have significant contribution for the fluoride ion concentration the fractured and complex hydro geological nature of the upper formation can also indicated that there could be contamination risk in the area from surface sources as well especially in the western part the industrial area such surface source contamination risks could be prevalent on top of this it is found that the aquifer system lacks clay layer that can serve as natural barriers to protect groundwater from such imminent fluoride sources the industry zone is pumice and highly fractured basalt these areas are highly exposed for industrial waste hence if it is damped as in the chalalak wetland the pollutant chemicals can easily join the fractured aquifer system which is the cause for fluoride rich water these water bearing formations weathered pumice scoria fractured basalt and sand of different types possess large pores however pumice and the fractured basalts strata that are common relatively in the shallower formations are devoid of primary openings they possess secondary openings in the form of fractures and joints these features aid in facilitating the infiltration of surface water through it the pores and fractures in late rites and fractures and joints in basalts which can act as reservoirs of groundwater hence the fractured nature of the formation associated with the shallowness of the water bearing formations and the local situation i e being waste disposal area there will be a great possibility of surface pollution in to the aquifer on the other hand the far southern part gara riqata where relatively the deepest wells in this study area were located the water striking point were also found deeper and the major aquifers formed of course medium and fine grained sand the fine grain sand is dominant in the layer from 184 m to 196 m from the surface where the water bearing formation is located the top non water bearing strata from top 18 m to 166 m is found to be dominated by weather pumice igneous rock which is of high source of fluoride however as the water comes from only sandy formations it is of good quality with respect to its f and tds concentration table 3 in general pumice and highly fractured and weathered scoracious formation dominates the water bearing strata 52 m 84 m and fine to course grained sand is the main water source in depth beyond 100 m thus lack of confining rocks and or clay layer in the medium strata indicates that groundwater occurs in unconfined conditions in the weathered basalts 4 2 fluoride ion and tds of the aquifer the analysis result of the fluoride level and total dissolved solids indicated that the fluoride ion concentration values range from 0 65 mg l to 11 mg l whereas the total dissolved solids ranges from 170 to 725 mg l the two water quality parameters result showed that the respective concentration values are somewhat higher at the shallower depths less than 60 m table 3 the values in the shallower wells it is found that they didn t satisfy the standard set for drinking water fig 1 for most of the cases the tabulated result showed that the ground water from shallow aquifers were retch in fluoride ion this could be associated with the geologic formation the inherent property of the water bearing strata and the physical environment i e the external temperature and geothermal nature of the area as it is discussed in the previous section the dominant water bearing formation of these areas are weathered pumice igneous rocks and volcanic rocks and accompanied by high temperature hence these rocks along with the high temperature ensure chemical reaction for the formation of the fluoride ion the groundwater sampled from wells in such formations showed high fluoride ion concentration up to 11 mg l this depicts that the major sources of fluoride ion pollution in the study area could be the inherent property of the water bearing formation on top of that the evaporation due to high temperature in the area could possibly increase the concentration of the fluoride ion in the shallow aquifer for instance in areas like hawassa flour factory there is high fluoride concentration of 11 9 8 and 8 7 mg l respectively these wells are located in shallow water bearing stratum where the weathered pumice igneous rock are dominant which is rich source of fluoride though shallow aquifers containing recent infiltration of rainwater have low fluoride content fluoride concentration of shallow aquifers increases as a consequence of temperature enhanced fluorite caf2 solubility and hydrogen fluoride hf gas dissolution due to hydrothermal activation caused in active volcanic areas as that of the study area generally deeper aquifers have better water quality therefore the water from the deep aquifer 60 m is of good quality which fulfills the ethiopian standard 3 mm l in general and those wells of 80 m depth fulfill who standards even securely by looking into the other conditions like climate and feeding habits of the consumers appendix table s10 using spss statistical analysis is conducted to see the significance of the observed parameters for both parameters at α 0 001 and 95 confidence interval i e it is strongly significant fitting non linear model tables 3 5 and figs 6 and 7 the result clearly shows the deeper the well depth the better is the fluoride and tds concentration as it is depicted from the water quality of the garariqata the top non water bearing formation is dominated by weathered pumice rock which is the major source of fluoride rich water however since the depth of the well the water bearing strata which is dominated by fine sand is below such formation it was possible to get good quality of water in terms of fluoride and tds concentration indeed water rock interactions commonly occur during the evolution of a basin especially at deep burial strata under the condition where the ground water is rich in carbonates and or bicarbonates the dissolution of fluoride ion could possibly happen during the water mineral fluorite interaction as a major source of the ion in the ground water as expressed in reaction eqs a and b a caf2 na2co3 caco3 2f 2na b caf2 2nahco3 caco3 2na 2f h2o co2 in the above reactions the bicarbonate rich water in a weathered rock formation accelerates the dissolution of caf2 to release fluoride into the groundwater with time minerals rich in calcite caco3 also favor the dissociation of fluoride from fluoride rich minerals as expressed in reaction c and d c caco3 h 2f caf2 hco3 d caf2 ca 2 f certain sensitive factors behind high fluoride concentration in groundwater include crystalline rocks especially granites of alkaline nature with calcium deficiency the fluoride content of groundwater during mineral dissolution is governed by the solubility of caf2 whereas the solubility of calcite and fluorite controls the dissolution of ca2 in groundwater among all fluoride rich minerals fluorite is the most abundant and occurs in almost all rocks and detrimental minerals which are true for the water bearing formations in the study area most of the rocks in the study area are weathered which reveals the occurrence of hydrolysis dissociation and dissolution hence the above explained chemical reaction process could possibly associated with the high fluoride ion dissolution and pollution of the groundwater in the study area the fluoride ion concentration special distribution analysis showed that the northwestern part of the study area which is near to the lakeshore and relatively of shallow water bearing formation was beyond the allowable standard set for drinking water fig 2 whereas the southern side of the study areas garariqata shows very low concentration of both fluoride 0 65 mg l and tds 170 mg l this is the area which has been identified as major groundwater recharge zone by hcwssse 2010 because of its low electric conductivity and high ph values the eastern side has moderately low concentration while the northern corner and the lakeshore areas exhibit high concentrations of both parameters hence the study area can be sub divided in to three on the basis of fluoride and tds concentration high fluoride and tds area north part hawassa caldera and the lake shore low fluoride and tds area east and south and medium fluoride and tds area eastern and south eastern part of the hawassa city the ground water in the medium and high areas is not suitable for drinking water because of fluoride concentration as a result currently the ground water of those areas is used for sanitation swimming pools and gardening purposes alone with respect to the depth of wells the general trend shows a decrease of fluoride ion concentration with depth as clearly indicated from the result where shallower aquifer has elevated concentrations of fluoride and deeper aquifers have very low fluoride consequently in areas where the calcium ion concentration is high due to the prevailing geochemical processes it may play a critical role in determining the fluoride content of the ground water as reported by the ohio epa division of drinking and ground waters ddagw technical series 2012 fluoride levels have shown to decline as water travels from the surface through the soil zone and into ground water with very similar fashion the tds values range from 170 mg l gara riqata to 700 mg l hawassa flour tables 2 and 3 and fig 3 all the tds values are in the potable range of water quality standard values 1000 mg l being the deeper formations more suitable however with the existing information it was not possible to assess the spatial variability of the suitability of groundwater for agriculture and industrial use rather only the general trend in terms of groundwater suitability for drinking water is presented in this study to evaluate the relationship between well depth and fluoride ion concentration well depth and tds and fluoride ion with tds linear correlation analyses were conducted figs 6 and 7 table 6 in the statistical analysis the independent variable is borehole depth and dependent variable is fluoride ion this means it is possible to estimate fluoride concentration at different depths using the model with 78 percent accurate variation relation since water is a solvent and which is capable of dissolving and interacting with organic and inorganic components of soils the minerals that make up unconsolidated deposits e g sand and gravel and with various types of bedrock dissolution of minerals within the soil sediment and bedrock is a slow process that can take days years or eons depending on the solubility of the materials these materials contribute to the amount of total dissolved solids tds that are present in all groundwater major dissolved constituents of groundwater include the cations positively charged ions sodium potassium calcium magnesium and silica and the anions negatively charged ions bicarbonate sulfate chloride and nitrate fig 4 the independent variable is borehole depth and dependent variable is tds the model enables the estimation of the tds value at the required depth with 68 percent relation the resulting regression analysis indicated that there is an inverse or negative correlation between both fluoride ion concentration and tds with borehole depth the proportion of variation explained by the exponential model is strong that the model explained 78 percent and 68 of the variation in f and tds respectively at α 0 001 this indicates water extracted from deeper aquifers is of good quality table 7 fig 5 4 3 conclusion in general the output of the study indicated that shallow hand dug wells in hawassa city are highly exposed to the chemical reaction which could result in fluorine dissolution high temperature and ease surface source contamination in most part of the fluoride and tds affected areas water bearing formation was dominated by crystallized rocks igneous rocks highly weathered pumice volcanic ash fractured and weathered basalt weathered rhyolite scoria and other igneous rock formations areas which have such formations rich source of fluoride and high temperature geothermal energy which facilitate the dissolution of the fluoride ion are highly exposed to fluoride contamination so that using the water for drinking purpose has high health risk however there areas like gara riqata which have aquifer layers below 160 m are characterized as safe sources of fluoride ion and tds thus the water is free of fluoride problem therefore drilling to the deeper 50 m depth in the aquifer system beyond where such caf2 rich sources especially in areas of high geothermal energy and or blinding such thickness of the aquifer could alleviate the problem of fluoride contamination either drilling to the deeper depth 60 m or blinding the aquifer system where such caf2 rich sources accumulate could alleviate the problem of fluoride contamination in the area appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org 10 1016 j ejrh 2018 09 003 appendix a

8492,study region finger lakes region new york usa study focus the relationship between stream temperature and daily respiration and reaeration rates was investigated from may 2015 may 2016 for two sites one in the headwaters and the other near the mouth of a net heterotrophic stream daily respiration and reaeration rates were calculated by applying the night time slope method to open channel diel oxygen concentrations during baseflow conditions new hydrological insights for the region reference values for activation energy ea are presented that could be applicable to lower order streams

downstream location where er in the headwaters was less sensitive to temperature ea for both sites fell within the expected theoretical range for heterotrophic respiration in aquatic ecosystems temperature reaeration rate coefficients ranged from 1 011 to 1 020 at the headwaters and from 1 005 to 1 009 downstream suggesting that daily reaeration rates at the headwaters were more sensitive to temperature than the downstream location where reaeration was likely controlled by stream discharge and driven by turbulence keywords stream metabolism dissolved oxygen arrhenius kinetics gas transfer coefficient aquatic respiration baseflow lotic ecosystems nighttime slope method 1 introduction temperature is an indisputable control on ecosystem metabolism and therefore oxygen and carbon dioxide fluxes however there is much debate over the nature of the temperature dependence of metabolic processes and whether researchers are appropriately correcting for its effects temperature adjustment coefficients are often applied to estimates of ecosystem respiration gross primary production and reaeration rates without justification and can vary substantially between ecosystems demars et al 2015 gonzález pinzón et al 2016 aquatic ecosystems may be more sensitive to changes in temperature than terrestrial ecosystems yvon durocher et al 2012 in order to improve climate and carbon cycle models and better understand carbon climate feedbacks it is important to characterize the response of aquatic ecosystem respiration rates on increasing temperatures associated with climate change mahecha et al 2010 jankowski et al 2014 odum 1956 pioneered the open channel diel oxygen method to calculate net daily metabolism from dissolved oxygen do measurements taken in flowing waters the following mass

gross primary production gpp and the dark grey area is the ecosystem respiration er over a 24 hour period the lower graph fig 1 b shows the corresponding diurnal do odum noted that the measured in stream dissolved oxygen concentration could also be impacted by groundwater accrual however the groundwater term is usually taken to be negligible and discarded from the mass balance nighttime is

interface when the do in a water column falls below saturation it is recharged by the atmosphere oxygen gas is lost to the atmosphere when do is above saturation i e supersaturated which is typically the case during the daytime reaeration can be modeled by fick s first law of diffusion 6 d m d o a d t d m d c d o d z where mdo is the mass of dissolved oxygen dm is the molecular diffusivity of do

1 and a v is the air water interface surface area per unit volume of air and water in streams with a relatively smooth surface area klo2 h ko2 where h is the average channel depth m it is critical to note that a smooth surface area is assumed in the mass balance model eqs 1 and 2 since atmospheric exchange is an essential component in estimating the metabolic mass balance of streams it is important to have accurate reaeration rate coefficients or gas transfer velocity measurements with the resolution of daily timescales unfortunately the gas transfer velocity is difficult to measure directly most field based efforts utilize a tracer gas which is injected at an upstream location and measured some distance downstream on a reach that is not gaining significant volumes of water from tributaries or groundwater seepage any downstream mass losses of the tracer gas are assumed to have been degassed to the atmosphere there are a number of problems with this method to quantify gas exchange first the mixing length for a reach must be appropriately defined there are theoretical equations e g wallis and manson 2004 to predict mixing length but optimal lateral and vertical mixing cannot be guaranteed in practice young and huryn 1999 second for gases with low solubilities up to 99 of the gas can quickly escape to the atmosphere which may introduce high levels of uncertainty to gas exchange proxies low solubility tracer gases are of particular concern when a potent greenhouse gas such as sf6 is utilized benson et al 2014 third reaeration may be underestimated when dispersion is neglected which is a classic assumption in the majority of tracer studies knapp et al 2015 fourth most tracer gas measurements are implemented during low flow conditions empirical relationships are usually derived for gas transfer velocity at a specific site based on the tracer injection made during low flow these equations are then applied to higher flow conditions and often not corrected for differences in temperature melching and flores 1999 riley and dodds 2013 finally gas tracer experiments are costly and labor intensive which makes it difficult to directly measure gas exchange rates for a representative range of flow conditions morse et al 2007 in this study the graphical nighttime slope method was applied to estimate reaeration 2 1 the nighttime slope method following the assumption of constant nighttime respiration and reaeration r and ko2 can be solved graphically by plotting d c d o d t against d i e c d o s c d o using the nighttime slope method hornberger and kelly 1975 for regular do measurements collected at a single station with sampling interval δ ti 1 ti an eulerian flow scenario can be applied such that 8a t i t i 1 d c d o t i t i 1 k o 2 c d o s c

initial respiration at sunset which is held constant throughout the night using the euler approximation for d c d o d t the application of the nighttime slope method to the idealized do curve from fig 1b would yield a solution to eq 8b of ko2 42 day 1 and ro 28 mg o2 consumed l 1 d 1 as illustrated in fig 2 this method is applicable for non polluted rivers and streams where the do deficit d increases by at least 1 mg l 1 throughout the night thyssen et al 1987 aristegi et al 2009 studied oxygen reaeration in 21 streams in northern spain after calculating reaeration using three approaches hornberger and kelly s nighttime method the observed lag time between solar noon and the peak do concentration e g the delta method chapra and di toro 1991 and ten empirical equations they concluded that the nighttime slope method was the most robust and reliable for producing realistic estimates for stream metabolism 2 2 temperature effects on stream metabolism oxygen is more soluble in freshwater at cooler temperatures as described by weiss s 1970 oxygen solubility temperature function given in eq 5 yet the rate of atmospheric oxygen absorption at the air water interface increases with increasing temperatures due to decreases in viscosity density and surface tension elmore and west 1961 through a series of controlled and high precision laboratory analyses elmore and west found that the rate of oxygen reaeration increases at a rate of 2 41 per c so the relation between the reaeration coefficient at any temperature and the reaeration coefficient at a standard temperature of 20 c k o 2 20 o can be described by the simplified arrhenius formula 9 k o 2 k o 2 20 o θ t 20 o c where θ 1 0241 elmore and west s temperature correction coefficient of 1 0241 is assumed to be constant and frequently applied to empirical equations to standardize the reaeration rate coefficient to 20 c e g o connor and dobbins 1956 churchill et al 1962 owens et al 1964 bennett and rathburn 1972 this constant has also been applied to recent studies to correct for the temperature dependence of reaeration on stream metabolism e g beaulieu et al 2013 birkel et al 2013 riley and dodds 2013 butcher and covington 1995 proposed using a van t hoff arrhenius relation similar to eq 9 to correct each term in the oxygen mass balance and suggested the following 10 d c d o d t k o 2 c d o s c d o θ a t 20 o c p t θ p t 20 o c r θ r t 20 o c with temperature coefficients θa θp and θr for reaeration photosynthesis and respiration respectively butcher and covington 1995 recommended typical temperature correction coefficients that were identified by bowie et al 1985 with θa 1 02 θp 1 066 and θr 1 08 wang et al 2003 suggested applying these same temperature coefficients for streams with significant diurnal temperature fluctuations in their metabolism modeling work correa gonzález et al 2014 followed suit by applying butcher and covington s 1995 temperature correction coefficients to model do dynamics for a stream that had a mean diel temperature variation of 5 c per day over the course of five days but were unable to capture maximum daily do using the temperature coefficients and eq 10 demars and manson 2013 returned to dobbins classic film penetration model 1956 to test whether a constant temperature correction coefficient was a valid assumption for reaeration rates under a range of turbulence regimes and found that θa ranged from 1 005 to 1 042 for temperatures between 0 c and 35 c additionally they noted that changes in turbulence had a greater impact on θa than temperature therefore the application of a turbulence correction factor may be appropriate for streams with self aerated flows e g white water rapids eq 4 the linearized arrhenius function describes the temperature dependence on kinetic processes more precisely than the simplified version given in eqs 9 and 10 and can also be used to determine the activation energy and temperature reaeration coefficient using eq 3 demars and manson 2013 nguyen et al 2015 gonzález pinzón et al 2016 suggested that it is incorrect to adjust for fast cycling diel temperature fluctuations using a steady state model such as the q10 or van t hoff arrhenius functions after taking both day and nighttime respiration measurements in a headwater stream by injecting the bioreactive tracer resazurin they concluded that there was not a significant difference between day and nighttime respiration rates and that applying a correction factor for diel temperature fluctuations for kinetic processes may be misleading 2 3 objectives carbon dioxide evasion from inland waters especially headwater streams has been shown to be a significant component of the carbon cycle potentially on the same order of magnitude as volcanic outgassing e g butman and raymond 2011 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 naturally headwater streams all first and second order streams can comprise over two thirds of riverine systems and therefore dominate the total stream length of a river network leopold et al 1964 over the past decade the frequency of direct measurements of in stream co2 concentrations and co2 outgassing have increased however it is still necessary to indirectly estimate co2 emissions from ecosystem respiration and reaeration using the oxygen mass balance to calculate metabolic parameters when directly measured co2 data is unavailable especially when assessing the contribution of inland waters to regional or even global carbon budgets prior to using the oxygen mass balance and van t hoff arrhenius temperature correction coefficients to determine metabolic rates in aquatic systems it is necessary to first characterize the activation energies associated with the kinetic processes for the particular site of interest when not determining activation energies or its associated parameters e g q10 and the temperature coefficient directly the next best option is to use published data from another site on the same stream demars et al 2015 suggest that researchers at least survey the literature and apply activation energies that have been published for comparable sites this is also common protocol when upscaling ecosystem respiration gross primary production or reaeration from stream reach to watershed regional or even global scales is the activation energy at one location representative of the entire stream it is also important to consider correcting for temperature since holding reaeration and respiration constant over a diel period can lead to unrealistic parameter estimations especially for shallow streams butcher and covington 1995 respiration and gas exchange are critical components of the stream carbon budget and therefore over or under estimation could impact estimations of stream gross primary productivity as well as instream processing of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon the objectives of this study were as follows 1 apply the nighttime slope method to two sites on the same stream one in the headwaters and the other near the mouth to calculate and compare daily respiration and reaeration rates 2 determine whether a constant annual activation energy for the two sites could be assumed by applying the linearized arrhenius function eq 4 to daily respiration and reaeration rates calculated from the nighttime slope method 3 evaluate the temperature sensitivity for daily respiration and reaeration rates and assess whether temperature sensitivity differs between the two sites it was hypothesized that daily respiration at the upstream site would be greater than that of the downstream site because of the greater benthic surface area to water volume ratio at the upstream location and that reaeration rates at the downstream site would be greater compared to upstream due to more turbulent flow downstream however the two locations were expected to have activation energies and temperature sensitivities that would not differ significantly and fall within the theoretical range for heterotrophic respiration in aquatic ecosystems additionally both sites were expected to have activation energies that remained constant throughout the year i e daily respiration and reaeration rates should exhibit a strong temperature dependence via the linearized arrhenius function as shown by perkins et al 2012 if both sites have equivalent and constant annual activation energies then that activation energy could be applied to additional streams in the region for making temperature adjustments to metabolic processes when conducting oxygen mass balances and or upscaling carbon budget calculations lastly it was hypothesized that the temperature coefficients at the two sites would not differ significantly and that daily respiration would be more sensitive to temperature compared to that of reaeration rates as suggested by bowie et al s 1985 temperature coefficients 3 methodology 3 1 site description and data

differences between the two sites are illustrated in fig 4 como has a silty substrate with an abundance of macrophytes while freese has a rocky substrate with few macrophytes the finger lakes drainage systems including fall creek have been impacted by pleistocene glaciation the catchment is underlain by devonian bedrock and consists primarily of siltstones and shales the usgs gauging station has a total drainage area of 326 km2 there are two weather stations within the fall creek watershed shown in fig 3 stream discharge and gauge height river stage data were downloaded from the usgs website for the fall creek station for the period of interest may 2015 may 2016 at 15 minute recording intervals discrete and continuous 15 minute increments water quality measurements were collected intermittently using multi parameter sondes ysi models 600 xlm and 6920 vs at both freese and como from may 2015 may 2016 for a total of 160 days of data coverage at freese and 178 days of coverage at como measured water quality parameters included temperature ph specific conductance and dissolved oxygen do one day of coverage indicates that at least one full suite of water quality measurements was collected per day continuous measurements of water quality parameters were collected for 124 full days at freese and 158 full days at como one full day of continuous coverage indicates that 96 sets of water quality measurements were collected over a 24 hour period the ysi 6920 vs sonde was linked to a handheld with display ysi 650 mds for discrete measurements this sonde was equipped with a reliable optical sensor rox designed for drift free long term do measurements in harsh environments two ysi 600 xlm sondes with rapid pulse oxygen sensors were deployed during the summer months june september for continuous monitoring at both sites from october 2015 may 2016 one 600 xlm sonde was deployed at one of the field sites while the 6920 vs sonde was utilized for continuous monitoring at the other each of these sondes was rotated from one site for a 1 to 2 week deployment to the next for the following deployment period all water quality sensors were cleaned and calibrated bi weekly in accordance with the ysi environmental 6 series probes care and maintenance protocols ysi 2012 the rapid pulse do sensors were calibrated with the rox sensor prior to each long term deployment and recalibrated against the rox at the end of each deployment to adjust for drift bales and nardi 2007 in addition to monitoring water quality channel hydraulic geometric features e g cross sectional depth and width and discharge were directly measured from june october 2015 on a weekly to bi weekly basis at freese measured discharge was 1 05 27 2 m3 s 1 average channel width was 11 6 21 4 m and average depth was 0 12 0 96 at como measured discharge was 1 0 1 9 m3 s 1 average channel width was 4 7 6 7 m and average depth was 0 12 0 39 m for june october 2015 channel hydraulic geometric features were related to discharge as demonstrated by leopold and maddock 1953 because the total drainage area for the freese site is close to that of the usgs gauge 324 km2 326 km2 1 the discharge at freese was assumed to be approximately equal to the discharge recorded at the gauge station the usgs gauge height was also similar to the average measured depth at freese hgauge hfreese 1 02 channel width was best predicted by discharge via a logarithmic function for freese rather than through a power function as leopold and maddock 1953 had proposed to model discharge for como qcomo a proportional relationship between the comparative drainage area for como and the usgs gauge was applied such that 11 q c o m o q g a u g e a d c o m o a d g a u g e where adcomo is the drainage area for como and adgauge is the drainage area for the usgs station yielding a proportion of 0 09 like freese the measured channel width for como was related to its discharge through a logarithmic function this was also the case for average channel depth at como the directly measured discharge at como was strongly correlated to the discharge calculated in eq 11 r2 0 87 n 13 3 2 defining baseflow the nighttime slope method for determining respiration dependency on temperature was only applied to do data collected during baseflow conditions to separate the baseflow component of discharge from runoff a hydrograph separation approach using daily average specific conductance sc and streamflow measurements was utilized miller et al 2014 2015 the baseflow end member the sc for lowest flow and highest observed sc and the runoff end member the sc for the highest flow and lowest observed sc were determined daily baseflow qbf was then calculated using the following conductivity mass balance pinder and jones 1969 12 q b f q s c s c r o s c b f s c r o where q is the daily average discharge sc is the daily average specific conductance scro is the runoff specific conductance end member and scbf is the baseflow specific conductance end member the baseflow runoff end member analysis for freese and como are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the daily average sc data was determined using the combined discrete and continuous sonde measurements taken at both sites for days with only one sc measurement the value was assumed to be representative of the average discharge for that date miller et al 2015 the daily average discharge data for freese and como are the averaged 15 minute discharge at each site obtained via the methods described in previous section since sc data were not available for the entire recording period a regression curve was fit to describe sc as a function of q r2 0 60 for freese fig 5 r2 0 77 for como fig 6 to model baseflow for may 2015 16 for freese scbf was 0 563 ms cm 1 and the scro was 0 257 ms cm 1 fig 5 for como scbf was 0 330 ms cm 1 and scro was 0 166 ms cm 1 fig 6 though there is a clearly defined runoff end member in figs 5 and 6 the presence of high sc concentrations observed between january and may when much of the runoff for fall creek is derived from snowmelt is suggestive of increased salinity from road salts as ascertained by shaw et al 2012 while this conductivity mass balance cmb may not be appropriate for fall creek in the context of assessing impacts of climate and land use change on fall creek s hydrological budget the cmb was used in this study to isolate days for which most of the stream discharge is composed of baseflow e g qbf q 0 6 3 3 characterizing respiration and reaeration the nighttime slope method nsm for determining daily respiration and reaeration rates was applied to monitoring dates for freese and como which contained a full set of nighttime water quality measurements from sunset to sunrise met the qualifications for baseflow defined in the previous section did not receive significant precipitation and for which there was no ice coverage on the water surface the nsm was modified from its original form for the summer months when the maximum do deficit i e minimum do concentration was reached well before sunrise in these cases instead of being applied to data collected throughout the entire nighttime the nsm was applied to do data from sunset up through the time of the minimum do concentration a linear trend was fit to the nsm plots the respiration ordinal intercept and reaeration rate coefficient slope were extracted from each measurement date for dates where the nsm yielded an r2 0 5 the respiration was normalized from a concentration to a mass flux density mg o2 consumed m 2 d 1 by multiplying by average channel depth then the natural log of the normalized respiration was plotted against standardized temperature eq 4 for the average nighttime water temperature to test whether an arrhenius temperature dependence on respiration and reaeration was a valid assumption and to check that the nsm provided realistic estimates for both parameters the reaeration rate coefficients ko2 derived from the nsm provide the surface water atmosphere mixing rates for the average nighttime water temperature on each measurement date in order to determine whether there was a relationship between ko2 and discharge ko2 was referenced to a standard temperature so that the values could be appropriately compared as discussed previously the standard reference temperature for reaeration is 20 c which is somewhat inconvenient considering the common standardized reference temperature for respiration is 15 c in the literature for consistency with past works 20 c was maintained as the standard temperature for reaeration and 15 c for respiration throughout this study 4 results daily average discharge for fall creek from the usgs gauging station and the freese daily baseflow hydrograph generated from the cmb are shown in fig 7 there were ultimately 46 sampling dates for freese and 46 dates for como that met the criteria previously specified for the nighttime slope method combined 64 unique sampling dates were represented with a 44 overlap in dates between sites on average nighttime water temperatures at como 0 1 23 7 c were 0 45 c cooler p 0 01 n 46 than at freese 0 1 24 5 c examples of the linear regressions obtained using the nsm and the diurnal do data are shown in figs 8 and 9 for freese and como respectively the seasonal distribution of daily water temperature t diurnal change in water temperature tmax tmin stream discharge q reaeration rate coefficients ko2 and daily respiration r are provided in table 1 for each sampling location the seasonal mean along with one standard deviation unit are given for each parameter the daily respiration and reaeration rates were calculated directly from the nsm and are not corrected for temperature the results from a paired t test α 0 01 given in table 2 for the 28 overlapping sampling dates show that the diurnal difference in water temperature upstream at como and downstream at freese did not differ significantly while the mean water temperature daily respiration and reaeration rates did differ significantly respiration rates calculated from the nsm follow a strong arrhenius temperature dependence as displayed in fig 10 with an ro at 15 c of 11 5 g o2 consumed m 2 and coefficient of determination of 0 94 for freese and an ro of 3 46 g o2 m 2 with a coefficient of determination of 0 88 for como the activation energies for respiration at freese and como were 0 67 ev and 0 61 ev respectively which correspond to a temperature correction coefficient θr 1 096 for freese and θr 1 087 for como with the corresponding correction factor applied to the uncorrected daily respiration rates for each site n 46 mean seasonal data shown in table 1 for both the minimum and maximum daily temperatures the mean corrected respiration rates at the minimum daily temperature differed significantly from the mean corrected respiration rates at the maximum daily temperature for both sites p 0 001 the mean respiration rates corrected to 15 c for freese were 49 81 15 54 mg o2 l 1 for the minimum daily water temperature compared to 36 55 mg o2 l 1 for the maximum daily water temperature the mean uncorrected respiration rate using the nsm for freese was 44 17 38 64 mg o2 l 1 which differs from the temperature corrected values by 13 17 for como the mean respiration rates corrected to 15 c were 18 62 5 08 mg o2 l 1 for the minimum daily water temperature compared to 13 73 mg o2 l 1 for the maximum daily water temperature these rates differ by 11 18 compared to the mean uncorrected respiration rate from the nsm for como of 16 78 10 51 mg o2 l 1 reaeration rate coefficients calculated from the nsm are presented as a function of discharge in fig 11 for freese and fig 12 for como nsm ko2 in figs 11 and 12 are normalized to 20 c using dobbins θa which provided regression coefficients of 0 71 and 0 16 for freese and como respectively dobbins θa ranged from 1 005 to 1 009 for freese and from 1 011 to 1 020 for como elmore and west s θa of 1 0241 yielded an r2 of 0 66 when fit to the freese temperature adjusted data and an r2 of 0 15 for como there was a strong correlation between ko2 and discharge for freese with the highest non temperature adjusted reaeration rates occurring in the summer ko2max 56 d 1 and lowest in the winter ko2min 5 6 d 1 the highest reaeration rates during baseflow for como also took place in summer ko2max 14 7 d 1 with the lowest in the winter ko2min 2 4 d 1 however there was not a distinct relation between ko2 and discharge at como on average reaeration rates were 4 7 times higher and more variable at freese ko2avg 12 5 12 3 d 1 than at como ko2avg 5 63 2 61 d 1 5 discussion 5 1 respiration there was a strong temperature dependence on respiration that could be described by arrhenius kinetics for both como and freese respiration at freese required an ea of 0 67 ev as compared to 0 61 ev at como while it requires more energy for respiration to occur at freese the respiration mass flux of o2 at freese was nearly 3 4 times greater on an area basis than that of como the activation energies for both sites were within the theoretical range of 0 6 0 7 ev for heterotrophic respiration in aquatic ecosystems gillooly et al 2001 demars et al 2011 perkins et al 2012 yvon durocher et al 2012 jankowski et al 2014 while yvon durocher et al 2012 expected ro and ea to vary seasonally due to the availability of reduced carbon substrates and changes in net primary production this was not the case for fall creek a constant site specific ro and ea described respiration kinetics at both freese and como over the course of one year this suggests that benthic heterotrophic communities vary from site to site within a stream but do not change substantially at each site seasonally however because of the effect of el niño the mild 2015 16 new york winter may have been a special case the average winter temperature in new york december february 2015 16 was 1 2 c which is 3 5 c warmer than the 1981 2010 normal winter temperature and 6 3 c warmer than the previous 2014 15 winter nrcc 2018 perkins et al 2012 found that the core biochemistry that drives respiration kinetics may be conserved across diverse taxa suggesting there is an intrinsic sensitivity of metabolic respiration based on the size of an organism e g gillooly et al 2001 this implies that the sensitivity of respiration on temperature as quantified by the ea will not change with changes in temperature or even necessarily with changes in the types of organisms that make up a community conversely if the bulk of stream respiration takes place within the hyporheic zone and therefore does not fluctuate significantly on a daily timescale gonzález pinzón et al 2016 then it could be reasoned that the temperature changes would be attenuated on a seasonal timescale so the hyporheic community would remain relatively static the within season variability in respiration combined with the temperature sensitivity observed in this study suggests that the hyporheic community may not be the primary contributor to stream respiration since daily respiration rates are less variable in the headwaters at como than downstream at freese it can be reasoned that the hyporheic community would be a larger contributor to overall respiration in the headwaters than further downstream this key difference between the two sites may also account for the observed differences in ea the increased groundwater connectivity of headwater systems is a likely factor for the lower required activation energy for respiration at como compared to freese the activation energy describes temperature sensitivity according to eq 3 therefore the higher the required ea is for a kinetic process the more sensitive that process is to changes in temperature this suggests that the downstream locations e g freese may be more sensitive to temperature and therefore climate changes than that of the upstream headwaters e g como land use alterations such as urbanization and the resulting burial of headwaters has been shown to decrease carbon quality and gpp pennino et al 2014 como may be representative of headwaters in temperate regions fed by both groundwater and overland flow if that is the case then urban stream burial may reduce the upstream temperature sensitivity buffer provided for ecosystem respiration provided by headwaters and increase downstream temperature sensitivity to metabolic processes making inland aquatic ecosystems more vulnerable to climate change ea is also indicative of the type of ecosystem in which respiration is taking place lower activation energies 0 32 ev are characteristic of terrestrial ecosystems while higher activation energies 0 65 ev are characteristic of aquatic ecosystems yvon durocher et al 2012 an abundance of aquatic plants at a given site may decrease ea as illustrated in fig 4 como has a greater volume of aquatic vegetation than that of freese which supports the lower observed ea at como it is of note that a maximum dissolved oxygen deficit is often achieved before sunrise figs 8 and 9 this maximum deficit tends to occur much earlier in the night during winter fig 8 as compared to summer fig 9 while respiration rates do increase with increasing temperature respiration is also supply limited platenius 1940 in winter the carbon supply is limited so the maximum do deficit is achieved much earlier than it is during the summer similarly under warm conditions as carbon compounds are metabolized more quickly the respiration rate will decrease before the end of the night there are a couple of points for como in fig 10 that deviate from the respiration temperature trend line and show maximum respiration rates occurring at approximately 21 c this suggests that there will not necessarily be more respiration at higher temperatures even if respiration is initially occurring at more rapid rates as there may be supply limitations that must be considered when modeling respiration the 3 4 times higher respiration flux observed at freese drainage area 324 km2 compared to como drainage area 29 km2 was likely because freese has a larger drainage area and is therefore more greatly impacted by upstream activities and material transport for example freese is approximately 13 km downstream from the dryden freeville waste water treatment plant outfall which may influence the quality and quantity of carbon transported downstream this is speculative and further investigations on carbon quality and quantity at each site would need to take place in order to draw conclusions on the drivers of the observed differences in respiration at each site 5 2 reaeration fig 4 also displays the differences in baseflow conditions for freese and como freese has a rocky substrate compared to the sand silts and flat rocks that line como s sediment floor shallow channel depths combined with a large contact area for friction provided by the benthic rocks facilitates mixing and turbulence even during low flow regimes this supports the high reaeration rates observed at freese the reaeration at como was on average half that of freese as shown in fig 4 the water surface at como tended to be flat and calm with only mild ripples occurring in the november image as compared to the rough water surface characteristic of freese based on their appearance como s ripples were likely wind driven in streams turbulence from wind shear at the water s surface yields a shallower effective mixing depth and lower gas transfer rates than that of turbulence derived from benthic boundary layer friction lorke and peeters 2006 zappa et al 2007 alin et al 2011 the bountiful vegetation at como may have also played a role in suppressing air water gas exchange the sizeable difference in reaeration rates at both sites along the same stream is not likely unique to fall creek there are numerous waterfalls and gorges in new york s finger lakes region and fall creek is representative of other streams in the watershed it would be expected that locations with steep shallow channels and or rocky substrates would have reaeration rates similar to that of freese while reaeration rates at locations with primarily laminar flow and sandy or silty substrates would be similar to that of como the narrow range of discharge and ko2 calculated using the nsm during baseflow for como made it difficult to discern a trend between flow and reaeration reaeration at freese on the other hand was highly correlated with discharge in general the temperature coefficient θa was not constant throughout a range of temperatures as expected if eq 3 was applicable schneiter and grenney 1983 even if arrhenius kinetics describe reaeration under specific flow conditions the application of the simplified arrhenius form eq 4 does not appropriately describe arrhenius kinetics if a constant temperature coefficient is assumed schneiter and grenney 1983 sheridan et al 2012 although water temperature does not vary nearly as much as air temperature it is by no means constant on seasonal or even daily time scales under their laboratory experiments elmore and west 1961 found that the reaeration rate increased geometrically with increasing temperature producing a constant θa of 1 0241 for use in eq 9 a form of the simplified arrhenius in this case a constant temperature coefficient is applied to arrhenius kinetics which does not make sense physically elmore and west do not mention arrhenius by name in their manuscript and may have chosen eq 9 simply to describe their laboratory observations even so their θa has been interpreted as a temperature correction for use in the do mass balance to describe reaeration under simplified arrhenius kinetics by other researchers e g butcher and covington 1995 butcher and covington s suggested temperature corrections have additionally been applied to respiration and photosynthesis under the assumption of a constant θ for all temperatures in numerous reaeration and metabolism studies e g mcbride and chapra 2005 kent et al 2006 birkel et al 2013 riley and dodds 2013 correa gonzález et al 2014 dobbins θa proposed by demars and manson 2013 is a function of both temperature and turbulence for sites characterized by turbulent flow such as freese the effect of temperature on reaeration is smaller 1 005 θa 1 009 than that of sites characterized by sluggish or laminar flow like como 1 011 θa 1 020 even at como elmore and west s θa of 1 0241 would over predict the sensitivity of reaeration rates to temperature at 20 c the θa calculated from the linearized arrhenius for q 1 3 m3 s 2 at freese was 1 0081 which is within the range of temperature coefficients predicted by dobbins 1956 film penetration theory correcting for temperature by arbitrarily using elmore and west s θa may overestimate reaeration during low temperatures or for turbulent flow regimes additionally reaeration rates may be underestimated for temperatures 20 c in the case of overestimating reaeration for lower temperatures respiration rates would also be overestimated while the reverse would be the case for underestimating reaeration for higher temperatures if respiration rates were determined entirely on the basis of eq 10 and an empirical equation with an inappropriate θa an arrhenius plot for respiration e g fig 10 would likely have a shallower slope influenced by the assumed temperature dependence based on the chosen θa providing unrealistic activation energies for respiration in aquatic ecosystems 6 conclusion the nighttime slope method was a viable technique for predicting respiration and reaeration rates in a northeastern u s stream resulting respiration rates from the nsm displayed a strong temperature dependence that could be described by arrhenius kinetics constant activation energies and reference respiration to 15 c throughout a year determined from an arrhenius plot suggests that seasonality may not influence basal respiration kinetics and heterotrophic communities may not vary substantially on seasonal time scales within each site differences in activation energies between downstream and upstream sites implies that each site supports a distinctive community composition of heterotrophs it is important to characterize respiration and reaeration rates which can be accomplished via the nsm for unpolluted streams prior to assigning a temperature correction coefficient for respiration temperature sensitivity can be determined from the activation energy which is between 0 6 and 0 7 ev for aquatic ecosystems heavily vegetated stream reaches may fall at the lower end of this range however the ro for any site is not so easy to approximate and may be determined from an arrhenius plot or by measuring respiration at 15 c for reaeration the temperature coefficient may be determined by demars and manson s 2013 approximation of dobbins theoretical θa since reaeration is a function of both temperature and turbulence applying elmore and west s θa without physical justification may overestimate reaeration and respiration in turbulent streams and at temperatures lower than 20 c the sizeable difference in the temperature sensitivity between two sites located on the same stream shows that reach scale respiration and reaeration rates may be a function of landscape position since first order streams drain approximately 70 of a watershed estimations of watershed to regional scale reaeration rates may need to use weighted parameters that more heavily weigh values associated with low order streams than high order stream parameters specifically ea the findings from this study provide reference values for ea that could be applicable to lower order streams in temperate climates receiving significant inputs from surface and subsurface flows caution should be used when selecting temperature coefficients for calculating metabolism land use alterations such as the burial of headwaters that results from urbanization may make metabolic processes in temperate streams more sensitive to temperature and increase ecosystem vulnerability to climate change funding this research was supported by the national science foundation integrated graduate education and research

8492,study region finger lakes region new york usa study focus the relationship between stream temperature and daily respiration and reaeration rates was investigated from may 2015 may 2016 for two

diel oxygen concentrations during baseflow conditions new hydrological insights for the region reference values for activation energy ea are presented that could be applicable to lower order streams

respiration er exhibited a strong arrhenius temperature dependence with daily respiration rates of 0 5 9 5 g o2 m 2 d 1 ea 0 61 ev in the headwaters and 1 8 30 3 g o2 m 2 d 1 ea 0 67 ev at the downstream location where er in the headwaters was less sensitive to temperature ea for both sites fell within the expected theoretical range for heterotrophic respiration in aquatic ecosystems temperature reaeration rate coefficients ranged from 1 011 to 1 020 at the headwaters and from 1 005 to 1 009 downstream suggesting that daily reaeration rates at the headwaters were more sensitive to temperature than the downstream location where reaeration was likely controlled by stream discharge and driven by turbulence keywords stream metabolism dissolved oxygen arrhenius kinetics gas transfer

gonzález pinzón et al 2016 aquatic ecosystems may be more sensitive to changes in temperature than terrestrial ecosystems yvon durocher et al 2012 in order to improve climate and carbon cycle models and better understand carbon climate feedbacks it is important to characterize the response of aquatic ecosystem respiration rates on increasing temperatures associated with climate change mahecha et

note that a smooth surface area is assumed in the mass balance model eqs 1 and 2 since atmospheric exchange is an essential component in estimating the metabolic mass balance of streams it is important to have accurate reaeration rate coefficients or gas transfer velocity measurements with the resolution of daily timescales unfortunately the gas transfer velocity is difficult to measure directly most field based efforts utilize a tracer gas which is injected at an upstream location and measured some distance downstream on a reach that is not gaining significant volumes of water from tributaries or groundwater seepage any downstream mass losses of the tracer gas are assumed to have been degassed to the atmosphere there are a number of problems with this method to quantify gas exchange first the mixing length for a reach must be appropriately defined there are theoretical equations e g wallis and manson 2004 to predict mixing length but optimal lateral and vertical mixing cannot be guaranteed in practice young and huryn 1999 second for gases with low solubilities up to 99 of the gas can quickly escape to the atmosphere which may introduce high levels of uncertainty to gas exchange proxies low solubility tracer gases are of particular concern when a potent greenhouse gas such as sf6 is utilized benson et al 2014 third reaeration may be underestimated when dispersion is neglected which is a classic assumption in the majority of tracer studies knapp et al 2015 fourth most tracer gas measurements are implemented during low flow conditions empirical relationships are usually derived for gas transfer velocity at a specific site based on the tracer injection made during low flow these equations are then applied to higher flow conditions and often not corrected for differences in temperature melching and flores 1999 riley and dodds 2013 finally gas tracer experiments are costly and labor intensive which makes it difficult to directly measure gas exchange rates

increases by at least 1 mg l 1 throughout the night thyssen et al 1987 aristegi et al 2009 studied oxygen reaeration in 21 streams in northern spain after calculating reaeration using three approaches hornberger and kelly s nighttime method the observed lag time between solar noon and the peak do concentration e g the delta method chapra and di toro 1991 and ten empirical equations they concluded that the nighttime slope method was the most robust and reliable for producing realistic estimates for stream metabolism 2 2 temperature effects on stream metabolism oxygen is more soluble in freshwater at cooler temperatures as described by weiss s 1970 oxygen solubility temperature function given in eq 5 yet the rate of atmospheric oxygen absorption at the air water interface increases with increasing temperatures due to decreases in viscosity density and surface tension elmore and west 1961 through a series of controlled and high precision laboratory analyses elmore and west found that the rate of oxygen reaeration increases at a rate of 2 41 per c so the relation between the reaeration coefficient at any temperature and the reaeration coefficient at a standard temperature of 20 c k o 2 20 o can be described by the simplified arrhenius formula 9 k o 2 k o 2 20 o θ t 20 o c where θ 1 0241 elmore and west s temperature correction coefficient of 1 0241 is assumed to be constant and frequently applied to empirical equations to standardize the reaeration rate coefficient to 20 c e g o connor and dobbins 1956 churchill et al 1962 owens et al 1964 bennett and rathburn 1972 this constant has also been applied to recent studies to correct for the temperature dependence of reaeration on stream metabolism e g beaulieu et al 2013 birkel et al 2013 riley and dodds 2013 butcher and covington 1995 proposed using a van t hoff arrhenius relation similar to eq 9 to correct each term in the oxygen mass balance and suggested the following 10 d c d o d t k o 2 c d o s c d o θ a t 20 o c p t θ p t 20 o c r θ r t 20 o c with temperature coefficients θa θp and θr for reaeration photosynthesis and respiration respectively butcher and covington 1995 recommended typical temperature correction coefficients that were identified by bowie et al 1985 with θa 1 02 θp 1 066 and θr 1 08 wang et al 2003 suggested applying these same temperature coefficients for streams with significant diurnal temperature fluctuations in their metabolism modeling work correa gonzález et al 2014 followed suit by applying butcher and covington s 1995 temperature correction coefficients to model do dynamics for a stream that had a mean diel temperature variation of 5 c per day over the course of five days but were unable to capture maximum daily do using the temperature coefficients and eq 10 demars and manson 2013 returned to dobbins classic film penetration model 1956 to test whether a constant temperature correction coefficient was a valid assumption for reaeration rates under a range of turbulence regimes and found that θa ranged from 1 005 to 1 042 for temperatures between 0 c and 35 c additionally they noted that changes in turbulence had a greater impact on θa than temperature therefore the application of a turbulence correction factor may be appropriate for streams with self aerated flows e g white water rapids eq 4 the linearized arrhenius function describes the temperature dependence on kinetic processes more precisely than the simplified version given in eqs 9 and 10 and can also be used to determine the activation energy and temperature reaeration coefficient using eq 3 demars and manson 2013 nguyen et al 2015 gonzález pinzón et al 2016 suggested that it is incorrect to adjust for fast cycling diel temperature fluctuations using a steady state model such as the q10 or van t hoff arrhenius functions after taking both day and nighttime respiration measurements in a headwater stream by injecting the bioreactive tracer resazurin they concluded that there was not a significant difference between day and nighttime respiration rates and that applying a correction factor for diel temperature fluctuations for kinetic processes may be misleading 2 3 objectives carbon dioxide evasion from inland waters especially headwater streams has been shown to be a significant component of the carbon cycle potentially on the same order of magnitude as volcanic outgassing e g butman and raymond 2011 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 naturally headwater streams all first and second order streams can comprise over two thirds of riverine systems and therefore dominate the total stream length of a river network leopold et al 1964 over the past decade the frequency of direct measurements of in stream co2 concentrations and co2 outgassing have increased however it is still necessary to indirectly estimate co2 emissions from ecosystem respiration and reaeration using the oxygen mass balance to calculate metabolic parameters when directly measured co2 data is unavailable especially when assessing the contribution of inland waters to regional or even global carbon budgets prior to using the oxygen mass balance and van t hoff arrhenius temperature correction coefficients to determine metabolic rates in aquatic systems it is necessary to first characterize the activation energies associated with the kinetic processes for the particular site of interest when not determining activation energies or its associated parameters e g q10 and the temperature coefficient directly the next best option is to use published data from another site on the same stream demars et al 2015 suggest that researchers at least survey the literature and apply activation energies that have been published for comparable sites this is also common protocol when upscaling ecosystem respiration gross primary production or reaeration from stream reach to watershed regional or even global scales is the activation energy at one location representative of the entire stream it is also important to consider correcting for temperature since holding reaeration and respiration constant over a diel period can lead to unrealistic parameter estimations especially for shallow streams butcher and covington 1995 respiration and gas exchange are critical components of the stream carbon budget and therefore over or under estimation could impact estimations of stream gross primary productivity as well as instream processing of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon the objectives of this study were as follows 1 apply the nighttime slope method to two sites on the same stream one in the headwaters and the other near the mouth to calculate and compare daily respiration and reaeration rates 2 determine whether a constant annual activation energy for the two sites could be assumed by applying the linearized arrhenius function eq 4 to daily respiration and reaeration rates calculated from the nighttime slope method 3 evaluate the temperature sensitivity for daily respiration and reaeration rates and assess whether temperature sensitivity differs between the two sites it was hypothesized that daily respiration at the upstream site would be greater than that of the downstream site because of the greater benthic surface area to water volume ratio at the upstream location and that reaeration rates at the downstream site would be greater compared to upstream due to more turbulent flow downstream however the two locations were expected to have activation energies and temperature sensitivities that would not differ significantly and fall within the theoretical range for heterotrophic respiration in aquatic ecosystems additionally both sites were expected to have activation energies that remained constant throughout the year i e daily respiration and reaeration rates should exhibit a strong temperature dependence via the linearized arrhenius function as shown by perkins et al 2012 if both sites have equivalent and constant annual activation energies then that activation energy could be applied to additional streams in the region for making temperature adjustments to metabolic processes when conducting oxygen mass balances and or upscaling carbon budget calculations lastly it was hypothesized that the temperature coefficients at the two sites would not differ significantly and that daily respiration would be more sensitive to temperature compared to that of reaeration rates as suggested by bowie et al s 1985 temperature coefficients 3 methodology 3 1 site description and data collection fall creek is a 331 km2 watershed in the finger lakes region of upstate new york draining 48 2 agricultural 39 7 forested 10 7 urban land it is the largest of the 34 cayuga lake watersheds and is representative of the overall land uses which are 52 agricultural 34 forested 12 urban and 2 other rural uses such as cleared land haith et al 2012 this closely matches the land uses for the entire finger lakes region which covers 4970 km2 with 43 agricultural 31 forested 6 urban land and 16 open water wetlands halfman 2016 fall creek s headwaters begin near lake como northwest of cortland ny and it drains into cayuga lake in ithaca ny one study site was located three kilometers downstream of lake como outlet which will be referred to as como while the other study site was located at freese road bridge three kilometers upstream of the usgs fall creek gauging station 04234000 this site will be referred to as freese these sites are shown on the map in fig 3 como has a drainage area of 29 3 km2 with a slope of 0 0077 along the main channel usgs streamstats freese has a drainage area of 324 km2 with an average channel slope of 0 0027 usgs streamstats seasonal differences between the two sites are illustrated in fig 4 como has a silty substrate with an abundance of macrophytes while freese has a rocky substrate with few macrophytes the finger lakes drainage systems including fall creek have been impacted by pleistocene glaciation the catchment is underlain by devonian bedrock and consists primarily of siltstones and shales the usgs gauging station has a total drainage area of 326 km2 there are two weather stations within the fall creek watershed shown in fig 3 stream discharge and gauge height river stage data were downloaded from the usgs website for the fall creek station for the period of interest may 2015 may 2016 at 15 minute recording intervals discrete and continuous 15 minute increments water quality measurements were collected intermittently using multi parameter sondes ysi models 600 xlm and 6920 vs at both freese and como from may 2015 may 2016 for a total of 160 days of data coverage at freese and 178 days of coverage at como measured water quality parameters included temperature ph specific conductance and dissolved oxygen do one day of coverage indicates that at least one full suite of water quality measurements was collected per day continuous measurements of water quality parameters were collected for 124 full days at freese and 158 full days at como one full day of continuous coverage indicates that 96 sets of water quality measurements were collected over a 24 hour period the ysi 6920 vs sonde was linked to a handheld with display ysi 650 mds for discrete measurements this sonde was equipped with a reliable optical sensor rox designed for drift free long term do measurements in harsh environments two ysi 600 xlm sondes with rapid pulse oxygen sensors were deployed during the summer months june september for continuous monitoring at both sites from october 2015 may 2016 one 600 xlm sonde was deployed at one of the field sites while the 6920 vs sonde was utilized for continuous monitoring at the other each of these sondes was rotated from one site for a 1 to 2 week deployment to the next for the following deployment period all water quality sensors were cleaned and calibrated bi weekly in accordance with the ysi environmental 6 series probes care and maintenance protocols ysi 2012 the rapid pulse do sensors were calibrated with the rox sensor prior to each long term deployment and recalibrated against the rox at the end of each deployment to adjust for drift bales and nardi 2007 in addition to monitoring water quality channel hydraulic geometric features e g cross sectional depth and width and discharge were directly measured from june october 2015 on a weekly to bi weekly basis at freese measured discharge was 1 05 27 2 m3 s 1 average channel width was 11 6 21 4 m and average depth was 0 12 0 96 at como measured discharge was 1 0 1 9 m3 s 1 average channel width was 4 7 6 7 m and average depth was 0 12 0 39 m for june october 2015 channel hydraulic geometric features were related to discharge as demonstrated by leopold and maddock 1953 because the total drainage area for the freese site is close to that of the usgs gauge 324 km2 326 km2 1 the discharge at freese was assumed to be approximately equal to the discharge recorded at the gauge station the usgs gauge height was also similar to the average measured depth at freese hgauge hfreese 1 02 channel width was best predicted by discharge via a logarithmic function for freese rather than through a power function as leopold and maddock 1953 had proposed to model discharge for como qcomo a proportional relationship between the comparative drainage area for como and the usgs gauge was applied such that 11 q c o m o q g a u g e a d c o m o a d g a u g e where adcomo is the drainage area for como and adgauge is the drainage area for the usgs station yielding a proportion of 0 09 like freese the measured channel width for como was related to its discharge through a logarithmic function this was also the case for average channel depth at como the directly measured discharge at como was strongly correlated to the discharge calculated in eq 11 r2 0 87 n 13 3 2 defining baseflow the nighttime slope method for determining respiration dependency on temperature was only applied to do data collected during baseflow conditions to separate the baseflow component of discharge from runoff a hydrograph separation approach using daily average specific conductance sc and streamflow measurements was utilized miller et al 2014 2015 the baseflow end member the sc for lowest flow and highest observed sc and the runoff end member the sc for the highest flow and lowest observed sc were determined daily baseflow qbf was then calculated using the following conductivity mass balance pinder and jones 1969 12 q b f q s c s c r o s c b f s c r o where q is the daily average discharge sc is the daily average specific conductance scro is the runoff specific conductance end member and scbf is the baseflow specific conductance end member the baseflow runoff end member analysis for freese and como are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the daily average sc data was determined using the combined discrete and continuous sonde measurements taken at both sites for days with only one sc measurement the value was assumed to be representative of the average discharge for that date miller et al 2015 the daily average discharge data for freese and como are the averaged 15 minute discharge at each site obtained via the methods described in previous section since sc data were not available for the entire recording period a regression curve was fit to describe sc as a function of q r2 0 60 for freese fig 5 r2 0 77 for como fig 6 to model baseflow for may 2015 16 for freese scbf was 0 563 ms cm 1 and the scro was 0 257 ms cm 1 fig 5 for como scbf was 0 330 ms cm 1 and scro was 0 166 ms cm 1 fig 6 though there is a clearly defined runoff end member in figs 5 and 6 the presence of high sc concentrations observed between january and may when much of the runoff for fall creek is derived from snowmelt is suggestive of increased salinity from road salts as ascertained by shaw et al 2012 while this conductivity mass balance cmb may not be appropriate for fall creek in the context of assessing impacts of climate and land use change on fall creek s hydrological budget the cmb was used in this study to isolate days for which most of the stream discharge is composed of baseflow e g qbf q 0 6 3 3 characterizing respiration and reaeration the nighttime slope method nsm for determining daily respiration and reaeration rates was applied to monitoring dates for freese and como which contained a full set of nighttime water quality measurements from sunset to sunrise met the qualifications for baseflow defined in the previous section did not receive significant precipitation and for which there was no ice coverage on the water surface the nsm was modified from its original form for the summer months when the maximum do deficit i e minimum do concentration was reached well before sunrise in these cases instead of being applied to data collected throughout the entire nighttime the nsm was applied to do data from sunset up through the time of the minimum do concentration a linear trend was fit to the nsm plots the respiration ordinal intercept and reaeration rate coefficient slope were extracted from each measurement date for dates where the nsm yielded an r2 0 5 the respiration was normalized from a concentration to a mass flux density mg o2 consumed m 2 d 1 by multiplying by average channel depth then the natural log of the normalized respiration was plotted against standardized temperature eq 4 for the average nighttime water temperature to test whether an arrhenius temperature dependence on respiration and reaeration was a valid assumption and to check that the nsm provided realistic estimates for both parameters the reaeration rate coefficients ko2 derived from the nsm provide the surface water atmosphere mixing rates for the average nighttime water temperature on each measurement date in order to determine whether there was a relationship between ko2 and discharge ko2 was referenced to a standard temperature so that the values could be appropriately compared as discussed previously the standard reference temperature for reaeration is 20 c which is somewhat inconvenient considering the common standardized reference temperature for respiration is 15 c in the literature for consistency with past works 20 c was maintained as the standard temperature for reaeration and 15 c for respiration throughout this study 4 results daily average discharge for fall creek from the usgs gauging station and the freese daily baseflow hydrograph generated from the cmb are shown in fig 7 there were ultimately 46 sampling dates for freese and 46 dates for como that met the criteria previously specified for the nighttime slope method combined 64 unique sampling dates were represented with a 44 overlap in dates between sites on average nighttime water temperatures at como 0 1 23 7 c were 0 45 c cooler p 0 01 n 46 than at freese 0 1 24 5 c examples of the linear regressions obtained using the nsm and the diurnal do data are shown in figs 8 and 9 for freese and como respectively the seasonal distribution of daily water temperature t diurnal change in water temperature tmax tmin stream discharge q reaeration rate coefficients ko2 and daily respiration r are provided in table 1 for each sampling location the seasonal mean along with one standard deviation unit are given for each parameter the daily respiration and reaeration rates were calculated directly from the nsm and are not corrected for temperature the results from a paired t test α 0 01 given in table 2 for the 28 overlapping sampling dates show that the diurnal difference in water temperature upstream at como and downstream at freese did not differ significantly while the mean water temperature daily respiration and reaeration rates did differ significantly respiration rates calculated from the nsm follow a strong arrhenius temperature dependence as displayed in fig 10 with an ro at 15 c of 11 5 g o2 consumed m 2 and coefficient of determination of 0 94 for freese and an ro of 3 46 g o2 m 2 with a coefficient of determination of 0 88 for como the activation energies for respiration at freese and como were 0 67 ev and 0 61 ev respectively which correspond to a temperature correction coefficient θr 1 096 for freese and θr 1 087 for como with the corresponding correction factor applied to the uncorrected daily respiration rates for each site n 46 mean seasonal data shown in table 1 for both the minimum and maximum daily temperatures the mean corrected respiration rates at the minimum daily temperature differed significantly from the mean corrected respiration rates at the maximum daily temperature for both sites p 0 001 the mean respiration rates corrected to 15 c for freese were 49 81 15 54 mg o2 l 1 for the minimum daily water temperature compared to 36 55 mg o2 l 1 for the maximum daily water temperature the mean uncorrected respiration rate using the nsm for freese was 44 17 38 64 mg o2 l 1 which differs from the temperature corrected values by 13 17 for como the mean respiration rates corrected to 15 c were 18 62 5 08 mg o2 l 1 for the minimum daily water temperature compared to 13 73 mg o2 l 1 for the maximum daily water temperature these rates differ by 11 18 compared to the mean uncorrected respiration rate from the nsm for como of 16 78 10 51 mg o2 l 1 reaeration rate coefficients calculated from the nsm are presented as a function of discharge in fig 11 for freese and fig 12 for como nsm ko2 in figs 11 and 12 are normalized to 20 c using dobbins θa which provided regression coefficients of 0 71 and 0 16 for freese and como respectively dobbins θa ranged from 1 005 to 1 009 for freese and from 1 011 to 1 020 for como elmore and west s θa of 1 0241 yielded an r2 of 0 66 when fit to the freese temperature adjusted data and an r2 of 0 15 for como there was a strong correlation between ko2 and discharge for freese with the highest non temperature adjusted reaeration rates occurring in the summer ko2max 56 d 1 and lowest in the winter ko2min 5 6 d 1 the highest reaeration rates during baseflow for como also took place in summer ko2max 14 7 d 1 with the lowest in the winter ko2min 2 4 d 1 however there was not a distinct relation between ko2 and discharge at como on average reaeration rates were 4 7 times higher and more variable at freese ko2avg 12 5 12 3 d 1 than at como ko2avg 5 63 2 61 d 1 5 discussion 5 1 respiration there was a strong temperature dependence on respiration that could be described by arrhenius kinetics for both como and freese respiration at freese required an ea of 0 67 ev as compared to 0 61 ev at como while it requires more energy for respiration to occur at freese the respiration mass flux of o2 at freese was nearly 3 4 times greater on an area basis than that of como the activation energies for both sites were within the theoretical range of 0 6 0 7 ev for heterotrophic respiration in aquatic ecosystems gillooly et al 2001 demars et al 2011 perkins et al 2012 yvon durocher et al 2012 jankowski et al 2014 while yvon durocher et al 2012 expected ro and ea to vary seasonally due to the availability of reduced carbon substrates and changes in net primary production this was not the case for fall creek a constant site specific ro and ea described respiration kinetics at both freese and como over the course of one year this suggests that benthic heterotrophic communities vary from site to site within a stream but do not change substantially at each site seasonally however because of the effect of el niño the mild 2015 16 new york winter may have been a special case the average winter temperature in new york december february 2015 16 was 1 2 c which is 3 5 c warmer than the 1981 2010 normal winter temperature and 6 3 c warmer than the previous 2014 15 winter nrcc 2018 perkins et al 2012 found that the core biochemistry that drives respiration kinetics may be conserved across diverse taxa suggesting there is an intrinsic sensitivity of metabolic respiration based on the size of an organism e g gillooly et al 2001 this implies that the sensitivity of respiration on temperature as quantified by the ea will not change with changes in temperature or even necessarily with changes in the types of organisms that make up a community conversely if the bulk of stream respiration takes place within the hyporheic zone and therefore does not fluctuate significantly on a daily timescale gonzález pinzón et al 2016 then it could be reasoned that the temperature changes would be attenuated on a seasonal timescale so the hyporheic community would remain relatively static the within season variability in respiration combined with the temperature sensitivity observed in this study suggests that the hyporheic community may not be the primary contributor to stream respiration since daily respiration rates are less variable in the headwaters at como than downstream at freese it can be reasoned that the hyporheic community would be a larger contributor to overall respiration in the headwaters than further downstream this key difference between the two sites may also account for the observed differences in ea the increased groundwater connectivity of headwater systems is a likely factor for the lower required activation energy for respiration at como compared to freese the activation energy describes temperature sensitivity according to eq 3 therefore the higher the required ea is for a kinetic process the more sensitive that process is to changes in temperature this suggests that the downstream locations e g freese may be more sensitive to temperature and therefore climate changes than that of the upstream headwaters e g como land use alterations such as urbanization and the resulting burial of headwaters has been shown to decrease carbon quality and gpp pennino et al 2014 como may be representative of headwaters in temperate regions fed by both groundwater and overland flow if that is the case then urban stream burial may reduce the upstream temperature sensitivity buffer provided for ecosystem respiration provided by headwaters and increase downstream temperature sensitivity to metabolic processes making inland aquatic ecosystems more vulnerable to climate change ea is also indicative of the type of ecosystem in which respiration is taking place lower activation energies 0 32 ev are characteristic of terrestrial ecosystems while higher activation energies 0 65 ev are characteristic of aquatic ecosystems yvon durocher et al 2012 an abundance of aquatic plants at a given site may decrease ea as illustrated in fig 4 como has a greater volume of aquatic vegetation than that of freese which supports the lower observed ea at como it is of note that a maximum dissolved oxygen deficit is often achieved before sunrise figs 8 and 9 this maximum deficit tends to occur much earlier in the night during winter fig 8 as compared to summer fig 9 while respiration rates do increase with increasing temperature respiration is also supply limited platenius 1940 in winter the carbon supply is limited so the maximum do deficit is achieved much earlier than it is during the summer similarly under warm conditions as carbon compounds are metabolized more quickly the respiration rate will decrease before the end of the night there are a couple of points for como in fig 10 that deviate from the respiration temperature trend line and show maximum respiration rates occurring at approximately 21 c this suggests that there will not necessarily be more respiration at higher temperatures even if respiration is initially occurring at more rapid rates as there may be supply limitations that must be considered when modeling respiration the 3 4 times higher respiration flux observed at freese drainage area 324 km2 compared to como drainage area 29 km2 was likely because freese has a larger drainage area and is therefore more greatly impacted by upstream activities and material transport for example freese is approximately 13 km downstream from the dryden freeville waste water treatment plant outfall which may influence the quality and quantity of carbon transported downstream this is speculative and further investigations on carbon quality and quantity at each site would need to take place in order to draw conclusions on the drivers of the observed differences in respiration at each site 5 2 reaeration fig 4 also displays the differences in baseflow conditions for freese and como freese has a rocky substrate compared to the sand silts and flat rocks that line como s sediment floor shallow channel depths combined with a large contact area for friction provided by the benthic rocks facilitates mixing and turbulence even during low flow regimes this supports the high reaeration rates observed at freese the reaeration at como was on average half that of freese as shown in fig 4 the water surface at como tended to be flat and calm with only mild ripples occurring in the november image as compared to the rough water surface characteristic of freese based on their appearance como s ripples were likely wind driven in streams turbulence from wind shear at the water s surface yields a shallower effective mixing depth and lower gas transfer rates than that of turbulence derived from benthic boundary layer friction lorke and peeters 2006 zappa et al 2007 alin et al 2011 the bountiful vegetation at como may have also played a role in suppressing air water gas exchange the sizeable difference in reaeration rates at both sites along the same stream is not likely unique to fall creek there are numerous waterfalls and gorges in new york s finger lakes region and fall creek is representative of other streams in the watershed it would be expected that locations with steep shallow channels and or rocky substrates would have reaeration rates similar to that of freese while reaeration rates at locations with primarily laminar flow and sandy or silty substrates would be similar to that of como the narrow range of discharge and ko2 calculated using the nsm during baseflow for como made it difficult to discern a trend between flow and reaeration reaeration at freese on the other hand was highly correlated with discharge in general the temperature coefficient θa was not constant throughout a range of temperatures as expected if eq 3 was applicable schneiter and grenney 1983 even if arrhenius kinetics describe reaeration under specific flow conditions the application of the simplified arrhenius form eq 4 does not appropriately describe arrhenius kinetics if a constant temperature coefficient is assumed schneiter and grenney 1983 sheridan et al 2012 although water temperature does not vary nearly as much as air temperature it is by no means constant on seasonal or even daily time scales under their laboratory experiments elmore and west 1961 found that the reaeration rate increased geometrically with increasing temperature producing a constant θa of 1 0241 for use in eq 9 a form of the simplified arrhenius in this case a constant temperature coefficient is applied to arrhenius kinetics which does not make sense physically elmore and west do not mention arrhenius by name in their manuscript and may have chosen eq 9 simply to describe their laboratory observations even so their θa has been interpreted as a temperature correction for use in the do mass balance to describe reaeration under simplified arrhenius kinetics by other researchers e g butcher and covington 1995 butcher and covington s suggested temperature corrections have additionally been applied to respiration and photosynthesis under the assumption of a constant θ for all temperatures in numerous reaeration and metabolism studies e g mcbride and chapra 2005 kent et al 2006 birkel et al 2013 riley and dodds 2013 correa gonzález et al 2014 dobbins θa proposed by demars and manson 2013 is a function of both temperature and turbulence for sites characterized by turbulent flow such as freese the effect of temperature on reaeration is smaller 1 005 θa 1 009 than that of sites characterized by sluggish or laminar flow like como 1 011 θa 1 020 even at como elmore and west s θa of 1 0241 would over predict the sensitivity of reaeration rates to temperature at 20 c the θa calculated from the linearized arrhenius for q 1 3 m3 s 2 at freese was 1 0081 which is within the range of temperature coefficients predicted by dobbins 1956 film penetration theory correcting for temperature by arbitrarily using elmore and west s θa may overestimate reaeration during low temperatures or for turbulent flow regimes additionally reaeration rates may be underestimated for temperatures 20 c in the case of overestimating reaeration for lower temperatures respiration rates would also be overestimated while the reverse would be the case for underestimating reaeration for higher temperatures if respiration rates were determined entirely on the basis of eq 10 and an empirical equation with an inappropriate θa an arrhenius plot for respiration e g fig 10 would likely have a shallower slope influenced by the assumed temperature dependence based on the chosen θa providing unrealistic activation energies for respiration in aquatic ecosystems 6 conclusion the nighttime slope method was a viable technique for predicting respiration and reaeration rates in a northeastern u s stream resulting respiration rates from the nsm displayed a strong temperature dependence that could be described by arrhenius kinetics constant activation energies and reference respiration to 15 c throughout a year determined from an arrhenius plot suggests that seasonality may not influence basal respiration kinetics and heterotrophic communities may not vary substantially on seasonal time scales within each site differences in activation energies between downstream and upstream sites implies that each site supports a distinctive community composition of heterotrophs it is important to characterize respiration and reaeration rates which can be accomplished via the nsm for unpolluted streams prior to assigning a temperature correction coefficient for respiration temperature sensitivity can be determined from the activation energy which is between 0 6 and 0 7 ev for aquatic ecosystems heavily vegetated stream reaches may fall at the lower end of this range however the ro for any site is not so easy to approximate and may be determined from an arrhenius plot or by measuring respiration at 15 c for reaeration the temperature coefficient may be determined by demars and manson s 2013 approximation of dobbins theoretical θa since reaeration is a function of both temperature and turbulence applying elmore and west s θa without physical justification may overestimate reaeration and respiration in turbulent streams and at temperatures lower than 20 c the sizeable difference in the temperature sensitivity between two sites located on the same stream shows that reach scale respiration and reaeration rates may be a function of landscape position since first order streams drain approximately 70 of a watershed estimations of watershed to regional scale reaeration rates may need to use weighted parameters that more heavily weigh values associated with low order streams than high order stream parameters specifically ea the findings from this study provide reference values for ea that could be applicable to lower order streams in temperate climates receiving significant inputs from surface and subsurface flows caution should be used when selecting temperature coefficients for calculating metabolism land use alterations such as the burial of headwaters that results from urbanization may make metabolic processes in temperate streams more sensitive to temperature and increase ecosystem vulnerability to climate change funding this research was supported by the national science foundation integrated graduate education and research

of precipitation data products with different spatial and temporal resolutions are available however the accuracy of these products may vary greatly and the variations may themselves differ in different river basins such differences have direct implications on the use of these datasets in hydrological modelling here using a hydrological model we investigated the effects of four precipitation datasets in situ gauge precipitation with and without interpolation persiann cdr and chirps on streamflow simulations in the irrawaddy basin in myanmar new hydrological insights for the study region we identified considerable differences in streamflow simulation with the use of different precipitation inputs the four datasets showed varied annual and seasonal precipitation values over the basin although the gauge density within the study area is very low streamflow simulations forced with interpolated gauge data outperformed the models forced with other datasets however simulations forced with chirps and persiann cdr also showed good results in most cases in terms of nash efficiency and r2 but mostly with high biases in calibration the four precipitation inputs resulted in varied best fitted parameter values and ranges all the above observations indicate that the selection of suitable precipitation input s is necessary for an accurate investigation of the hydrological responses of any given basin keywords irrawaddy river basin spatial and temporal variabilities of precipitation streamflow simulation 1 introduction precipitation is the fundamental input variable for the hydrological modelling of river basins the accuracy of hydrological model outcomes largely depends on the quality of the precipitation data used one major challenge in hydrological modelling is to accurately represent the spatial and temporal variations in precipitation over a river basin mostly areal precipitation over a basin is estimated from in situ gauge measurements however available gauged precipitation data are mostly inadequate to accurately represent the heterogeneity of precipitation in many river basins miao et al 2015 nowadays radar and satellite based remotely sensed precipitation data are being widely used as alternative sources of precipitation inputs for hydrological simulations there are a number of precipitation products available which vary in spatial coverage i e global and regional and temporal scales hourly daily and monthly these gridded precipitation data are available for various spatial resolutions varying from 0 05 0 05 to 1 1 sources of these data include interpolated from in situ measurements aphrodite cpc unified reanalysis products era interim ncep cfsr jra 55 and remote sensing based products chirps persiann cmorph gridsat trmm gsmap v5 6 and sm2rain ascat many studies have investigated the impacts of different precipitation inputs on hydrological modelling andreassian et al 2001 bárdossy and das 2006 lopez et al 2015 masih et al 2011 miao et al 2015 moon et al 2004 moulin et al 2008 price et al 2014 segond et al 2007 thiemig et al 2013 tuo et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 for instance beck et al 2017 evaluated 22 precipitation products globally of which 13 were evaluated by comparing them to daily in situ gauge data and the rest were evaluated in terms of streamflow simulation using the hbv model the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model seibert and vis 2012 their results have demonstrated significant biases among the precipitation products tested among the non gauge corrected precipitation datasets chirp v2 0 and mswep ng v1 2 and v2 0 produced the most accurate long term mean due to the high resolution climatic datasets used it was also noticed that gauge corrected precipitation datasets the cpc unified and mswep versions performed best in mid latitude regions where dense monitoring networks exist in contrast their worst performance was observed in arid regions due to highly localized and varied convective rainfall other studies have also indicated that all precipitation products are not equally good or bad for all regions for example satellite based datasets are generally unable to accurately represent precipitation in high altitude regions beck et al 2017 furthermore massari et al 2017 s results show the relatively high performance of satellite rainfall products 3b42rt and cmorph in northern and southern america southern europe southern africa and southern and eastern asia in the same study era interim data was seen to perform reasonably well in the northern hemisphere while sm2rain showed very good performance in the southern hemisphere whether a precipitation product is reliable or not depends also on the purpose of its use toté et al 2015 for example a precipitation product that adequately captures drought events may fail to simulate flood events and vice versa in toté et al 2015 s study chirps data showed the best model performance during the cyclone season while rfe showed better performance in lower rainfall 10 days rainfall situations than chirps and tarcat did shrestha et al 2017 have concluded that chg datasets chirp and chirps can be used for precipitation based drought monitoring in the koshi basin in nepal the present study evaluates the impacts of four precipitation datasets on streamflow simulation at the irrawaddy river basin in myanmar for streamflow simulation we used the most widely used hydrological model swat soil water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 out of the four precipitation datasets used two sets are derived from the available in situ measurements with and without interpolation while the other two are satellite based products the reason for using two datasets from the same in situ gauge measurements is governed by the way precipitation input is handled in swat in its default setting swat assigns one precipitation gauging station to each sub basin which is closest to basin s centroid irrespective of the number of gauge stations available this means that the same gauging stations may be assigned to more than one sub basin while some gauging stations may not be assigned to any as a result the precipitation input to the model varies when the number of sub basins varies one way to avoid this issue is to spatially interpolate the gauge observations over the basin using a fixed grid and then to assign interpolated values to each sub basin the two remote sensing based products used in this study are persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and chirps funk et al 2015 persiann cdr is an abbreviation for precipitation estimation from remote sensing information using artificial neural network climate data record and chirps stands for climate hazard group infrared precipitation with station data the main reason for choosing these two products was their successes reported in recent studies ashouri et al 2016 casse and gosset 2015 ceccherini et al 2015 guo et al 2015 le and pricope 2017 shrestha et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 simulations with persiann cdr datasets have shown reasonably good performance in streamflow prediction at two river basins the yangtze and the upper yellow river basins in the tibetan plateau liu et al 2017 based on different extreme precipitation indices persiann cdr data is capable in reproducing daily precipitation extremes of similar spatial and temporal patterns to those produced by east asia ea ground based gridded daily precipitation datasets miao et al 2015 the chirps product has shown good agreement with ground based rain gauge data all over cyprus katsanos et al 2016 hassels 2015 compared several open access satellite based precipitation products for the nile river basin and recommends chirps as one of the best products available for hydrological studies in that region streamflow simulations with chirps data have provided satisfactory results for alpine catchments as well tuo et al 2016 compared to the rest of the world there are only a handful of studies that have been carried out to date to investigate the impacts of rainfall inputs on hydrological simulations in southeast asia especially where ground observations are particularly sparse and limited for example vu et al 2012 found that aphrodite performed better in daily streamflow simulation than trmm persiann gpcp and chchn2 in the dak bla river basin vietnam tan et al 2017 evaluated three long term gridded climatic products aphrodite persiann cdr and ncep cfsr for streamflow simulation in two river basins the kelantan and johor river basins in malaysia their study has shown that hydrological simulations driven by aphrodite and persiann cdr tend to underestimate extreme precipitation and streamflow while models driven by ncep cfsr are likely to overestimate the same hydrological variables no such studies on the evaluation of rainfall products over the irrawaddy basin in myanmar are to be found in the literature till date 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area myanmar is the second largest country in southeast asia bordered by india and bangladesh in the west laos and thailand in the east and china in the north and northeast in the south it forms a coastline along the bay of bengal and the andaman sea irrawaddy also known as ayeyarwaddy is the largest river basin in myanmar about 91 of the basin is located in myanmar while the rest is in chinese 5 and indian 4 territories the total drainage area of the basin is approximately 410 000 km2 the irrawaddy river 2100 km is the most important commercial waterway in myanmar it drains into the andaman sea forming one of the largest delta systems in south east asia fig 1 a the basin has diverse topographic features ranging from high mountainous terrain in its northern part to low lying delta systems in the south in the middle there are plateaus 500 m above mean sea level msl and floodplains green forests and crop cultivations cover more than 60 of the basin area in general myanmar has a tropical monsoon climate due to the varied topography of the basin its mean annual precipitation varies drastically from 500 mm to 4000 mm the lowest and highest precipitation have been observed in the central plateaus and the northern high mountainous regions respectively the average annual temperature of the basin varies from 19 to 31 c myanmar experiences five weather seasons pre monsoon mid april to mid may main monsoon mid may to mid october post monsoon mid october to end november dry and cold end november to mid march and the hot season mid march to mid april qian and lee 2000 however in the seasonal analysis that was performed in this study we redistributed the seasons into three major phases the monsoon season may to october the cold season november to february and the hot season march to april 2 2 data for catchment delineation a 90 m 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission digital topographic data srtm jarvis et al 2008 in the swat model s configuration land cover soil and slope data are required to define hydrological response units hrus hrus are the primary computational units of the model land cover information at 300 m 300 m resolution for the year 2009 was obtained from the european space agency which indicated that forests 36 different croplands 31 and shrublands 29 the predominant in the study area a soil map at 7 km 7 km resolution was obtained from food and agriculture organization fao 2003 in which acrisols cambisols and gleysols are the dominant types in the study basin the slope is derived from dem in hru definition tool topographic slope classification followed the fao 2003 slope class definitions undulating land 0 8 slope hilly areas 8 30 slope and mountainous areas 30 slope here we used observed daily temperature minimum and maximum data at the weather stations for the period of 2001 to 2010 shown in the fig 1 b furthermore temperature data from 1990 to 2000 used in previous studies was also utilized in this study monthly wind speed and relative humidity data of 5 stations hkamti homalin mawlaik kalewa and monywa were also used in the simulations observed daily streamflow data are available for 9 locations fig 1 b from 1991 to 2010 based on the data availability 8 locations described in table 1 were selected for this study spatially varied four precipitation datasets were used table 2 gauge precipitation data interpolated gauge data and two satellite based and station corrected precipitation products persiann cdr and chirps daily observed precipitation data of the weather stations fig 1 b was used for the period of 2001 to 2010 furthermore precipitation data from 1990 to 2000 used in previous studies were also utilized in the present study due to limited time period available for model calibration and validation missing data in this dataset has been filled with the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite data yatagai et al 2012 in this study we used the inverse distance elevation weighted idew method to interpolate daily precipitation data from 19 gauges over a 25 5 km 25 5 km grid among the various interpolation methods discussed in literature idew method considers the combined effects of distance and elevation on the spatial variability of precipitation masih et al 2011 this interpolation and aggregation over sub basins were carried out using the tool hykit which was developed for grid based interpolation of hydrological variables maskey 2013 the corresponding parameter values were defined using the jackknife cross validation approach quenouille 1956 in this method the data from all stations excluding the current validation station were used for interpolation then the interpolated precipitation at current station is compared with corresponding grid cell the resulting interpolated precipitation values of grid cells were then averaged over the sub basins 2 3 model setup and calibration in the catchment delineation a drainage area threshold of 750 km2 was used as the stream definition based upon the threshold and manually introduced outlet locations total study area 371 558 km2 was delineated into 32 sub basins fig 1 b to differentiate hrus a threshold value of 5 was used for each land use soil and slope data larger thresholds were found to eliminate any smaller definable areas of land use soil and slope categories on the other hand finer thresholds would require more computing resources her et al 2015 based on the defined thresholds 747 hrus were created covering the entire study area among the methods available in swat soil conservation services curve number scs cn method was used to simulate surface runoff and the variable storage method was adopted for routing the flow through channel networks potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the hargreaves method neitsch et al 2011 which requires less input parameters compared to other available methods in swat model the swat model was calibrated using monthly simulated streamflow at 8 locations fig 1 b and table 1 model calibration and validation was carried out for the 1991 2000 and 2002 2010 time periods respectively the first year of simulations 1990 and 2001 were used as warm up period to initialize the model state variables such as soil moisture and groundwater sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 in swat calibration and uncertainty programme swat cup abbaspour 2015 was used for automatic model calibration and validation a number of successful applications of sufi 2 can be found in literature ex abbaspour et al 2015 2007 2004 masih et al 2011 and shrestha et al 2013 model parameters and their initial ranges for calibration were selected following the suggestions made in the aforementioned studies table 3 modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse abbaspour 2015 was used as the objective function to optimize the model calibration which has proven better performance than nse as the objective function particularly in low flow legates and mccabe 1999 pushpalatha et al 2012 model was calibrated using different numbers of iterations each with 500 simulations after each iteration the calibration program suggests a new set of parameter ranges for the next iteration however final parameter ranges for the subsequent iteration were obtained by considering their physically realistic upper and lower limits the iteration process was terminated when no significant improvement in the model performance was observed between two successive iterations once a gauging station is calibrated relevant parameters were fixed for all the sub basins drain to that gauging station then the initial parameter ranges were set for the subsequent downstream gauging station for calibration this procedure was repeated for each of the discharge locations starting from upstream and continued to downstream of the basin the calibrated parameter ranges were used for the validation period with 500 simulations this method was repeated for the model simulations with the four different precipitation datasets although mnse was used as the objective function model performances were assessed using most commonly used three indicators nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias we have adopted criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 to classify the model performance as very good 0 75 nse 1 good 0 65 nse n 0 75 satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 and unsatisfactory nse 0 5 2 4 uncertainty assessment uncertainties in streamflow prediction can be introduced from different sources such as input data the model parameters and the model structure abbaspour 2015 pechlivanidis et al 2011 sufi 2 is a commonly used tool for auto calibration and uncertainty assessment for the swat model in sufi 2 the total uncertainty in the model result streamflow is estimated in terms of parameter uncertainty based on a deterministic set of input forcing data e g precipitation and temperature it uses two measures called r factor and p factor to express the total uncertainty the r factor is defined as the ratio of the average width of the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu band to the standard deviation of observed data the 95ppu band is derived from the model outputs based on randomly generated model parameter sets the p factor which ranges from 0 to 1 represents the fraction of observation data points contained within 95ppu ideally the p factor should be 0 95 to represent 95 of the total uncertainty however it is rarely the case in practice the p factor is usually less than 0 95 meaning that the parameter uncertainty with the estimated r factor is unable to fully represent the total uncertainty given the precipitation as primary forcing data in the swat model as in any hydrological model it may represent a major source of uncertainty however we did not have quantitative information to present uncertainty in each of the four precipitation products used in this study moreover our approach here was to evaluate the ability of these products to simulate streamflows using a hydrological model the ability of each product was assessed in terms of the model performance indicators such as nse r2 and pbias and the total uncertainty measures r factor and p factor as mentioned above 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of precipitation datasets monthly precipitation patterns of the four datasets fig 2 show that persiann cdr and igp data yield the lowest and highest precipitation respectively throughout the 10 year period 2001 to 2010 considered monthly precipitation of persiann cdr and chirps was lower than the igp in each year particularly during the months from june to august the difference between gp and igp is marginal about 32 mm year which is mostly attributed to the fact that the two datasets are generated from the same observed rain gauge data the total precipitation of chirps was relatively less than igp data 170 mm year whereas persiann cdr showed the highest difference in total precipitation 235 mm year variations in average annual precipitations over the sub basins are presented in fig 3 precipitation based on igp data varied from 1000 mm in the middle to 3400 mm in the northern part of the basin with a standard deviation of 622 mm the highest variation was observed with gp data 750 mm to 4400 mm with a standard deviation of 994 mm persiann cdr precipitation varied from 1000 mm to 2700 mm with a standard deviation of 357 mm and chirps precipitation varied between 800 mm to 3000 mm with a standard deviation of 560 mm persiann cdr and chirps differed notably from igp in the most upstream sub basin areas but those differences become smaller towards the most downstream areas fig 4 shows the variations among the four datasets across the three main seasons hot monsoon and cold considered spatial variations of the four precipitation products are different for each season the most upstream parts of the basin sub basins 1 2 and 3 receive higher precipitation than other sub basins during all seasons during the hot season gp igp and chirps precipitation values decrease towards the southern parts of the basin while persiann cdr data shows higher precipitation in the north western and western parts of the basin during the monsoon season all the sub basins receive more than 700 mm of precipitation in all the datasets used during the same period sub basins 1 2 and 3 receive more than 3500 mm precipitation which is also the highest for the entire irrawaddy basin these computed precipitations of the basins mainly rely on hkamti sub basin 1 and putao sub basins 2 and 3 stations compared to igp data persiann cdr and chirps data show less precipitation within the north eastern and north western parts of the basin during the cold season spatial variations in the total precipitation resulting from the igp dataset are the least in all the sub basins considered the highest variability can be observed in chirps precipitation over the basin in terms of basin wide seasonal precipitation the highest precipitations during the hot 120 mm monsoon 1927 mm and cold 60 mm seasons are observed in persiann cdr igp and chirps respectively similarly the lowest precipitation during the same seasons can be observed from igp 70 mm persiann cdr 1635 mm and gp 49 mm respectively persiann cdr shows the lowest average annual rainfall over all the sub basins these results are consistent with findings of miao et al 2015 they found that compared to the ground based east asia ea precipitation product persiann cdr slightly underestimated the extreme rainfall events over china global products persiann cdr and chirps produce less rainfall amount compared to observed data particularly in the high altitude regions of the basin le and pricope 2017 also showed that the chirps dataset provides less accurate results for high altitude regions of the nzoia basin in kenya however other studies on chirps which are also based in complex topographic regions funk et al 2015 katsanos et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 do not mention any lapses in the model performances in general the four datasets show considerably varied precipitation across the basin fig 3 and fig 4 given that precipitation is considered to be the primary forcing data for hydrological model simulation such differences in precipitation inputs are expected to cause variations in the outcomes of the hydrological simulations 3 2 evaluation of simulated streamflows the comparison of the observed and model simulated streamflows indicates that models based on observed precipitation gp and igp outperform those based on global data sources persiann cdr and chirps in both calibration 1991 2000 and validation 2002 2010 fig 5 table 4 and supplementary information s1 models that utilize gp data slightly overestimate extreme events whereas simulations with persiann cdr and chirps perform relatively poorly during the high flow periods particularly for the year 2002 high flows were overestimated at the katha sagaing monywa and nyuang u stations simulated streamflow with the gp dataset at the hkamti and homalin stations showed better agreement with observed streamflow than with the other precipitation datasets these two stations represent sub basins 1 and 7 respectively each containing a rainfall gauging station during the low flow period simulations with all four datasets showed similar levels of accuracies however at the katha and sagaing stations simulated streamflows with persiann cdr and chirps were lower than the observed flow values models forced with chirps inputs adequately reproduced the observed streamflow at homalin kalewa monywa nyaung u and pyay table 4 presents the statistical performance indicators nse r2 and pbias of the hydrological simulations streamflow at eight gauging locations for the calibration and validation periods the highest nse and r2 and lowest pbias among the four cases have been highlighted for the calibration r2 varied within 0 8 to 0 96 while the nse and pbias varied from 0 28 to 0 95 and 49 8 to 5 8 respectively all the models produced better results at hkamti homalin kalewa and monywa gauging stations in the chindwin river basin than at the katha and sagaing stations located in the upper irrawaddy basin according to the model evaluation criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 see section 2 3 performances of the models driven by gp and igp were very good in both calibration and validation at all stations except the simulation with gp data at the katha station that showed only good performance persiann cdr driven simulations showed varied performances at different stations for example the lowest nse 0 28 and the highest pbias 49 8 were obtained at the sagaing station while the highest nse 0 89 and the lowest pbias 1 8 were observed at the monywa station similarly simulations with chirps showed satisfactory results at the sagaing and hkamti stations whereas the model performances at the other stations were very good in both calibration and validation fig 6 compares the observed monthly streamflow versus the streamflow simulations forced by igp and chirps at eight gauging stations correlation coefficient values r2 for the simulations forced with igp and chirps are more than 0 84 and 0 81 respectively simulations with igp have showed a good agreement with observed data with the exception of overestimated streamflow values at the katha station in contrast models forced with chirps tended to underestimate the streamflow at the hkamti katha and sagaing stations these relatively low values for streamflow simulation forced by chirps can be attributed to the under estimation of precipitation by chirps in the high altitude regions of the basin persiann cdr had the lowest total precipitation compared to the other datasets thus the simulations driven with persiann cdr data tended to underestimate high streamflows and demonstrate weaker model performance in terms of nse and pbias during the monsoon season both persiann cdr and chirps yielded less precipitation over the eastern and northern parts of the basin thus simulations with those datasets significantly underestimate the high flows at hkamti katha and sagaing stations than at the other stations during the hot and cold seasons all the models showed reasonable agreements with the observed streamflow however r2 values were greater than 0 8 at all the gauging stations for both the calibration and validation periods despite overestimating the high flows at all the gauging stations simulations forced with the gp dataset satisfactorily reproduced the observed flow in the entire study area although the average rain gauge density of irrawaddy basin is approximately 20 000 km2 per station which is very low compared to the minimum requirement stated in the wmo guidelines 5 750 km2 per station for interior plains the models driven by igp managed to reproduce the measured streamflow at all the stations this indicates that the interpolation of gauge data may lead to an improved representation of precipitation over the basin in most cases persiann cdr and chirps also showed good agreement with observed streamflow in terms of nse and r2 however their biases were higher than the biases of simulations forced with igp in general chirps driven simulations performed better than simulations forced with persiann cdr therefore the chirps product can be utilized as an alternative source of rainfall inputs for hydrological studies in the irrawaddy basin tuo et al 2016 have also suggested chirps data as a favorable choice for data scarce alpine regions apart from that le and pricope 2017 concluded that the use of chirps data with the swat model significantly improved the streamflow volume estimation but not the satisfactory efficiency criteria for the nzoia basin kenya further as discussed by faridzad et al 2018 despite having limitations and uncertainties the bias corrected persiann cdr data provides valuable information for hydrological simulation in remote and high altitude areas 3 3 uncertainty in runoff simulation during the model calibration 14 selected hydrological parameters were adjusted and converged to different optimal intervals to reproduce streamflows at eight gauging stations while noting that sensitivities of the parameters can be basin specific five globally sensitive hydrological parameters have been selected to discuss these results fig 7 curve number cn2 corresponds to the land use type and largely affects surface runoff generation the four precipitation inputs used in this study led to different best fit cn2 values a cn2 varies 7 to 7 and ranges for the simulations with gp fitted parameter values significantly deviated from those obtained through simulations with the other three precipitation inputs hence a common pattern for fitted parameters could not be identified for all sub basins gw qmn is an important parameter related to base flow during low flow periods groundwater contribution to streamflow can be significant there is an apparent variability in these fitted parameters for most of the sub basins where the highest variability for this parameter v gwqmn from 81 to 874 was observed in the sub basins corresponding to the katha station compared to cn2 the variability of the fitted gw qmn for the four models at each sub basin was high the base flow recession factor alpha bf can vary between 0 and 1 the sub basins corresponding to the hkamti homalin and nyaung u stations resulted in nearly equal best fit alpha bf for all precipitation datasets sol awc is related to the available water content in the soil the best fitted parameters i e relative changes of existing value of sol awc varied from 0 49 to 0 23 fitted parameter values for esco which is relevant for soil evaporation varies between default swat limits 0 1 for the precipitation inputs considered all the fitted parameters are tabulated in supplementary information s1 prediction uncertainties p factor and r factor of streamflow simulations are presented for the four precipitation products table 5 in calibration igp data driven simulations captured more than 53 of the observations at all the stations within the 95ppu band and together with a r factor average band width from 0 34 to 0 69 igp driven simulations also showed more consistent prediction uncertainties for both calibration and validation periods than did the other three precipitation products simulations with persiann cdr and chirps showed the considerably higher variability of p factors compared to those with gp and igp for example in calibration the p factor variations are 0 2 to 0 79 for persiann cdr and 0 13 to 0 69 for chirps overall the average p factors among the eight gauging stations are pretty low 0 62 0 71 0 52 and 0 43 for gp igp persiann cdr and chirps respectively this shows that the uncertainty measures estimated based on parameter uncertainty parameter ranges were unable to capture all sources of uncertainty it implies that a considerable amount of uncertainty cannot be attributed to parameter uncertainty and comes notably from precipitation 4 conclusion this study investigated the dependency between different precipitation data sources and the reliability of the resulting modelled streamflows for the irrawaddy basin in myanmar four precipitation data sets used are in situ gauge data without interpolation and with interpolation persiann cdr and chirps we analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of the four precipitation datasets and their impacts on streamflow simulation in the irrawaddy basin the four precipitation datasets are different in magnitude and spatial and temporal distributions over the study area the global data sources persiann cdr and chirps yielded lower annual and seasonal precipitation compared to the in situ gauge data interpolated gauge data showed the highest basin average precipitation during the monsoon season may oct whereas persiann cdr and chirps showed the highest precipitations during the hot season mar apr and cold season nov feb respectively contradictory results were observed in the mountainous regions of the irrawaddy basin where persiann cdr and chirps data deviated notably from the interpolated gauge data during the monsoon period simulations with observed data showed an overestimation of streamflow while models with global products persiann cdr and chirps tended to underestimate the same compared to the minimum rain gauge density guidelines provided by wmo 5750 km2 per station for interior plains the rain gauge density over the study area is very low 20 000 km2 per station on an average despite the low density of rain gauges in general simulations with interpolated gauge precipitation data showed a good agreement with observed streamflow data for all the stations in the basin a majority of the stations also showed good results in simulations forced with chirps and persiann cdr in terms of nse and r2 however with higher biases it is to be noted that the in situ gauge data used here is available only for 20 years because the chirps and persiann cdr products have longer periods of records more than 35 years they can be valuable assets for data poor river basins for hydrological applications requiring long data records another potential application of these global data is to develop a merged product combining gauged data and one or more global data products different precipitation inputs lead to different best fitted parameter values and ranges for the different sub catchments overall we found that different precipitation datasets have considerable

8493,study region the irrawaddy river basin myanmar study focus precipitation is the most important input variable to numerically simulate the hydrological responses of a river basin nowadays a number of precipitation data products with different spatial and temporal resolutions are available however the accuracy of these products may vary greatly and the variations may themselves differ in different river basins such differences have direct implications on the use of these datasets in hydrological modelling here using a hydrological model we investigated the effects of four precipitation datasets in situ gauge precipitation with and without interpolation persiann cdr and chirps on streamflow simulations in the irrawaddy basin in myanmar new hydrological insights for the study region we identified considerable differences in streamflow simulation with the use of different precipitation inputs the four datasets showed varied annual and seasonal precipitation values over the basin although the gauge density within the study area is very low streamflow simulations forced with interpolated gauge data outperformed the models forced with other datasets however simulations forced with chirps and persiann cdr also showed good results in most cases in terms of nash efficiency and r2 but mostly with high biases in calibration the four precipitation inputs resulted in varied best fitted parameter values and ranges all the above observations indicate that the selection of suitable precipitation input s is necessary for an accurate investigation of the hydrological responses of any given basin keywords irrawaddy river basin spatial and temporal variabilities of precipitation streamflow simulation 1 introduction precipitation is the fundamental input variable for the hydrological modelling of river basins the accuracy of hydrological model outcomes largely depends on the quality of the precipitation data used one major challenge in hydrological modelling is to accurately represent the spatial and temporal variations in precipitation over a river basin mostly areal precipitation over a basin is estimated from in situ gauge measurements however available gauged precipitation data are mostly inadequate to accurately represent the heterogeneity of precipitation in many river basins miao et al 2015 nowadays radar and satellite based remotely sensed precipitation data are being widely used as alternative sources of precipitation inputs for hydrological simulations there are a number of precipitation products available which vary in spatial coverage i e global and regional and temporal scales hourly daily and monthly these gridded precipitation data are available for various spatial resolutions varying from 0 05 0 05 to 1 1 sources of these data include interpolated from in situ measurements aphrodite cpc unified reanalysis products era interim ncep cfsr jra 55 and remote sensing based products chirps persiann cmorph

precipitation products globally of which 13 were evaluated by comparing them to daily in situ gauge data and the rest were evaluated in terms of streamflow simulation using the hbv model the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model seibert and vis 2012 their results have demonstrated significant biases among the precipitation products tested among the non gauge corrected precipitation datasets chirp v2 0 and mswep ng v1 2 and v2 0 produced the most accurate long term mean due to the high resolution climatic datasets used it was also noticed that gauge corrected precipitation datasets the cpc unified and mswep versions performed best in mid latitude regions where dense monitoring networks exist in contrast their worst performance was observed in arid regions due to highly localized and varied convective rainfall other studies have also indicated that all precipitation products are not equally good or bad for all regions for example satellite based datasets are generally unable to accurately represent precipitation in high altitude regions beck et al 2017 furthermore massari et al 2017 s results show the relatively high performance of satellite rainfall products 3b42rt and cmorph in northern and southern america southern europe southern africa and southern and eastern asia in the same study era interim data was seen to perform reasonably well in the northern hemisphere while sm2rain showed very good performance in the southern hemisphere whether a precipitation product is reliable or not depends also on the purpose of its use toté et al 2015 for example a precipitation product that adequately captures drought events may fail to simulate flood events and vice versa in toté et al 2015 s study chirps data showed the best model performance during the cyclone season while rfe showed better performance in lower rainfall 10 days rainfall situations than chirps and tarcat did shrestha et al 2017 have concluded that chg datasets chirp and chirps can be used for precipitation based drought monitoring in the koshi basin in nepal the present study evaluates the impacts of four precipitation datasets on streamflow simulation at the irrawaddy river basin in myanmar for streamflow simulation we used the most widely used hydrological model swat soil water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 out of the four precipitation datasets used two sets are derived from the available in situ measurements with and without interpolation while the other two are satellite based products the reason for using two datasets from the same in situ gauge measurements is governed by the way precipitation input is handled in swat in its default setting swat assigns one precipitation gauging station to each sub basin which is closest to basin s centroid irrespective of the number of gauge stations available this means that the same gauging stations may be assigned to more than one sub basin while some gauging stations may not be assigned to any as a result the precipitation input to the model varies when the number of sub basins varies one way to avoid this issue is to spatially interpolate the gauge observations over the basin using a fixed grid and then to assign interpolated values to each sub basin the two remote sensing based products used in this study are persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and chirps funk et al 2015 persiann cdr is an abbreviation for precipitation estimation from remote sensing information using artificial neural network climate data record and chirps stands for climate hazard group infrared precipitation with station data the main reason for choosing these two products was their successes reported in recent studies ashouri et al 2016 casse and gosset 2015 ceccherini et al 2015 guo et al 2015 le and pricope 2017 shrestha et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 simulations with persiann cdr datasets have shown reasonably good performance in streamflow prediction at two river basins the yangtze and the upper yellow river basins in the tibetan plateau liu et al 2017 based on different extreme precipitation indices persiann cdr data is capable in reproducing daily precipitation extremes of similar spatial and temporal patterns to those produced by east asia ea ground based gridded daily precipitation datasets miao et al 2015 the chirps product has shown good agreement with ground based rain gauge data all over cyprus katsanos et al 2016 hassels 2015 compared several open access satellite based precipitation products for the nile river basin and recommends chirps as one of the best products available for hydrological studies in that region streamflow simulations with chirps data have provided satisfactory results for alpine catchments as well tuo et al 2016 compared to the rest of the world there are only a handful of studies that have been carried out to date to investigate the impacts of rainfall inputs on hydrological simulations in southeast asia especially where ground observations are particularly sparse and limited for example vu et al 2012 found that aphrodite performed better in daily streamflow simulation than trmm persiann gpcp and chchn2 in the dak bla river basin vietnam tan et al 2017 evaluated three long term gridded climatic products aphrodite persiann cdr and ncep cfsr for streamflow simulation in two river basins the kelantan and johor river basins in malaysia their study has shown that hydrological simulations driven by aphrodite and persiann cdr tend to underestimate extreme precipitation and streamflow while models driven by ncep cfsr are likely to overestimate the same hydrological variables no such studies on the evaluation of rainfall products over the irrawaddy basin in myanmar are to be found in the literature till date 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area myanmar is the second largest country in southeast asia bordered by india and bangladesh in the west laos and thailand in the east and china in the north and northeast in the south it forms a coastline along the bay of bengal and the andaman sea irrawaddy also known as ayeyarwaddy is the largest river basin in myanmar about 91 of the basin is located in myanmar while the rest is in chinese 5 and indian 4 territories the total drainage area of the basin is approximately 410 000 km2 the irrawaddy river 2100 km is the most important commercial waterway in myanmar it drains into the andaman sea forming one of the largest delta systems in south east asia fig 1 a the basin has diverse topographic features ranging from high mountainous terrain in its northern part to low lying delta systems in the south in the middle there are plateaus 500 m above mean sea level msl and floodplains green forests and crop cultivations cover more than 60 of the basin area in general myanmar has a tropical monsoon climate due to the varied topography of the basin its mean annual precipitation varies drastically from 500 mm to 4000 mm the lowest and highest precipitation have been observed in the central plateaus and the northern high mountainous regions respectively the average annual temperature of the basin varies from 19 to 31 c myanmar experiences five weather seasons pre monsoon mid april to mid may main monsoon mid may to mid october post monsoon mid october to end november dry and cold end november to mid march and the hot season mid march to mid april qian and lee 2000 however in the seasonal analysis that was performed in this study we redistributed the seasons into three major phases the monsoon season may to october the cold season november to february and the hot season march to april 2 2 data for catchment delineation a 90 m 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission digital topographic data srtm jarvis et al 2008 in the swat model s configuration land cover soil and slope data are required to define hydrological response units hrus hrus are the primary computational units of the model land cover information at 300 m 300 m resolution for the year 2009 was obtained from the european space agency which indicated that forests 36 different croplands 31 and shrublands 29 the predominant in the study area a soil map at 7 km 7 km resolution was obtained from food and agriculture organization fao 2003 in which acrisols cambisols and gleysols are the dominant types in the study basin the slope is derived from dem in hru definition tool topographic slope classification followed the fao 2003 slope class definitions undulating land 0 8 slope hilly areas 8 30 slope and mountainous areas 30 slope here we used observed daily temperature minimum and maximum data at the weather stations for the period of 2001 to 2010 shown in the fig 1 b furthermore temperature data from 1990 to 2000 used in previous studies was also utilized in this study monthly wind speed and relative humidity data of 5 stations hkamti homalin mawlaik kalewa and monywa were also used in the simulations observed daily streamflow data are available for 9 locations fig 1 b from 1991 to 2010 based on the data availability 8 locations described in table 1 were selected for this study spatially varied four precipitation datasets were used table 2 gauge precipitation data interpolated gauge data and two satellite based and station corrected precipitation products persiann cdr and chirps daily observed precipitation data of the weather stations fig 1 b was used for the period of 2001 to 2010 furthermore precipitation data from 1990 to 2000 used in previous studies were also utilized in the present study due to limited time period available for model calibration and validation missing data in this dataset has been filled with the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite data yatagai et al 2012 in this study we used the inverse distance elevation weighted idew method to interpolate daily precipitation data from 19 gauges over a 25 5 km 25 5 km grid among the various interpolation methods discussed in literature idew method considers the combined effects of distance and elevation on the spatial variability of precipitation masih et al 2011 this interpolation and aggregation over sub basins were carried out using the tool hykit which was developed for grid based interpolation of hydrological variables maskey 2013 the corresponding parameter values were defined using the jackknife cross validation approach quenouille 1956 in this method the data from all stations excluding the current validation station were used for interpolation then the interpolated precipitation at current station is compared with corresponding grid cell the resulting interpolated precipitation values of grid cells were then averaged over the sub basins 2 3 model setup and calibration in the catchment delineation a drainage area threshold of 750 km2 was used as the stream definition based upon the threshold and manually introduced outlet locations total study area 371 558 km2 was delineated into 32 sub basins fig 1 b to differentiate hrus a threshold value of 5 was used for each land use soil and slope data larger thresholds were found to eliminate any smaller definable areas of land use soil and slope categories on the other hand finer thresholds would require more computing resources her et al 2015 based on the defined thresholds 747 hrus were created covering the entire study area among the methods available in swat soil conservation services curve number scs cn method was used to simulate surface runoff and the variable storage method was adopted for routing the flow through channel networks potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the hargreaves method neitsch et al 2011 which requires less input parameters compared to other available methods in swat model the swat model was calibrated using monthly simulated streamflow at 8 locations fig 1 b and table 1 model calibration and validation was carried out for the 1991 2000 and 2002 2010 time periods respectively the first year of simulations 1990 and 2001 were used as warm up period to initialize the model state variables such as soil moisture and groundwater sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 in swat calibration and uncertainty programme swat cup abbaspour 2015 was used for automatic model calibration and validation a number of successful applications of sufi 2 can be found in literature ex abbaspour et al 2015 2007 2004 masih et al 2011 and shrestha et al 2013 model parameters and their initial ranges for calibration were selected following the suggestions made in the aforementioned studies table 3 modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse abbaspour 2015 was used as the objective function to optimize the model calibration which has proven better performance than nse as the objective function particularly in low flow legates and mccabe 1999 pushpalatha et al 2012 model was calibrated using different numbers of iterations each with 500 simulations after each iteration the calibration program suggests a new set of parameter ranges for the next iteration however final parameter ranges for the subsequent iteration were obtained by considering their physically realistic upper and lower limits the iteration process was terminated when no significant improvement in the model performance was observed between two successive iterations once a gauging station is calibrated relevant parameters were fixed for all the sub basins drain to that gauging station then the initial parameter ranges were set for the subsequent downstream gauging station for calibration this procedure was repeated for each of the discharge locations starting from upstream and continued to downstream of the basin the calibrated parameter ranges were used for the validation period with 500 simulations this method was repeated for the model simulations with the four different precipitation datasets although mnse was used as the objective function model performances were assessed using most commonly used three indicators nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias we have adopted criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 to classify the model performance as very good 0 75 nse 1 good 0 65 nse n 0 75 satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 and unsatisfactory nse 0 5 2 4 uncertainty assessment uncertainties in streamflow prediction can be introduced from different sources such as input data the model parameters and the model structure abbaspour 2015 pechlivanidis et al 2011 sufi 2 is a commonly used tool for auto calibration and uncertainty assessment for the swat model in sufi 2 the total uncertainty in the model result streamflow is estimated in terms of parameter uncertainty based on a deterministic set of input forcing data e g precipitation and temperature it uses two measures called r factor and p factor to express the total uncertainty the r factor is defined as the ratio of the average width of the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu band to the standard deviation of observed data the 95ppu band is derived from the model outputs based on randomly generated model parameter sets the p factor which ranges from 0 to 1 represents the fraction of observation data points contained within 95ppu ideally the p factor should be 0 95 to represent 95 of the total uncertainty however it is rarely the case in practice the p factor is usually less than 0 95 meaning that the parameter uncertainty with the estimated r factor is unable to fully represent the total uncertainty given the precipitation as primary forcing data in the swat model as in any hydrological model it may represent a major source of uncertainty however we did not have quantitative information to present uncertainty in each of the four precipitation products used in this study moreover our approach here was to evaluate the ability of these products to simulate streamflows using a hydrological model the ability of each product was assessed in terms of the model performance indicators such as nse r2 and pbias and the total uncertainty measures r factor and p factor as mentioned above 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of precipitation datasets monthly precipitation patterns of the four datasets fig 2 show that persiann cdr and igp data yield the lowest and highest precipitation respectively throughout the 10 year period 2001 to 2010 considered monthly precipitation of persiann cdr and chirps was lower than the igp in each year particularly during the months from june to august the difference between gp and igp is marginal about 32 mm year which is mostly attributed to the fact that the two datasets are generated from the same observed rain gauge data the total precipitation of chirps was relatively less than igp data 170 mm year whereas persiann cdr showed the highest difference in total precipitation 235 mm year variations in average annual precipitations over the sub basins are presented in fig 3 precipitation based on igp data varied from 1000 mm in the middle to 3400 mm in the northern part of the basin with a standard deviation of 622 mm the highest variation was observed with gp data 750 mm to 4400 mm with a standard deviation of 994 mm persiann cdr precipitation varied from 1000 mm to 2700 mm with a standard deviation of 357 mm and chirps precipitation varied between 800 mm to 3000 mm with a standard deviation of 560 mm persiann cdr and chirps differed notably from igp in the most upstream sub basin areas but those differences become smaller towards the most downstream areas fig 4 shows the variations among the four datasets across the three main seasons hot monsoon and cold considered spatial variations of the four precipitation products are different for each season the most upstream parts of the basin sub basins 1 2 and 3 receive higher precipitation than other sub basins during all seasons during the hot season gp igp and chirps precipitation values decrease towards the southern parts of the basin while persiann cdr data shows higher precipitation in the north western and western parts of the basin during the monsoon season all the sub basins receive more than 700 mm of precipitation in all the datasets used during the same period sub basins 1 2 and 3 receive more than 3500 mm precipitation which is also the highest for the entire irrawaddy basin these computed precipitations of the basins mainly rely on hkamti sub basin 1 and putao sub basins 2 and 3 stations compared to igp data persiann cdr and chirps data show less precipitation within the north eastern and north western parts of the basin during the cold season spatial variations in the total precipitation resulting from the igp dataset are the least in all the sub basins considered the highest variability can be observed in chirps precipitation over the basin in terms of basin wide seasonal precipitation the highest precipitations during the hot 120 mm monsoon 1927 mm and cold 60 mm seasons are observed in persiann cdr igp and chirps respectively similarly the lowest precipitation during the same seasons can be observed from igp 70 mm persiann cdr 1635 mm and gp 49 mm respectively persiann cdr shows the lowest average annual rainfall over all the sub basins these results are consistent with findings of miao et al 2015 they found that compared to the ground based east asia ea precipitation product persiann cdr slightly underestimated the extreme rainfall events over china global products persiann cdr and chirps produce less rainfall amount compared to observed data particularly in the high altitude regions of the basin le and pricope 2017 also showed that the chirps dataset provides less accurate results for high altitude regions of the nzoia basin in kenya however other studies on chirps which are also based in complex topographic regions funk et al 2015 katsanos et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 do not mention any lapses in the model performances in general the four datasets show considerably varied precipitation across the basin fig 3 and fig 4 given that precipitation is considered to be the primary forcing data for hydrological model simulation such differences in precipitation inputs are expected to cause variations in the outcomes of the hydrological simulations 3 2 evaluation of simulated streamflows the comparison of the observed and model simulated streamflows indicates that models based on observed precipitation gp and igp outperform those based on global data sources persiann cdr and chirps in both calibration 1991 2000 and validation 2002 2010 fig 5 table 4 and supplementary information s1 models that utilize gp data slightly overestimate extreme events whereas simulations with persiann cdr and chirps perform relatively poorly during the high flow periods particularly for the year 2002 high flows were overestimated at the katha sagaing monywa and nyuang u stations simulated streamflow with the gp dataset at the hkamti and homalin stations showed better agreement with observed streamflow than with the other precipitation datasets these two stations represent sub basins 1 and 7 respectively each containing a rainfall gauging station during the low flow period simulations with all four datasets showed similar levels of accuracies however at the katha and sagaing stations simulated streamflows with persiann cdr and chirps were lower than the observed flow values models forced with chirps inputs adequately reproduced the observed streamflow at homalin kalewa monywa nyaung u and pyay table 4 presents the statistical performance indicators nse r2 and pbias of the hydrological simulations streamflow at eight gauging locations for the calibration and validation periods the highest nse and r2 and lowest pbias among the four cases have been highlighted for the calibration r2 varied within 0 8 to 0 96 while the nse and pbias varied from 0 28 to 0 95 and 49 8 to 5 8 respectively all the models produced better results at hkamti homalin kalewa and monywa gauging stations in the chindwin river basin than at the katha and sagaing stations located in the upper irrawaddy basin according to the model evaluation criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 see section 2 3 performances of the models driven by gp and igp were very good in both calibration and validation at all stations except the simulation with gp data at the katha station that showed only good performance persiann cdr driven simulations showed varied performances at different stations for example the lowest nse 0 28 and the highest pbias 49 8 were obtained at the sagaing station while the highest nse 0 89 and the lowest pbias 1 8 were observed at the monywa station similarly simulations with chirps showed satisfactory results at the sagaing and hkamti stations whereas the model performances at the other stations were very good in both calibration and validation fig 6 compares the observed monthly streamflow versus the streamflow simulations forced by igp and chirps at eight gauging stations correlation coefficient values r2 for the simulations forced with igp and chirps are more than 0 84 and 0 81 respectively simulations with igp have showed a good agreement with observed data with the exception of overestimated streamflow values at the katha station in contrast models forced with chirps tended to underestimate the streamflow at the hkamti katha and sagaing stations these relatively low values for streamflow simulation forced by chirps can be attributed to the under estimation of precipitation by chirps in the high altitude regions of the basin persiann cdr had the lowest total precipitation compared to the other datasets thus the simulations driven with persiann cdr data tended to underestimate high streamflows and demonstrate weaker model performance in terms of nse and pbias during the monsoon season both persiann cdr and chirps yielded less precipitation over the eastern and northern parts of the basin thus simulations with those datasets significantly underestimate the high flows at hkamti katha and sagaing stations than at the other stations during the hot and cold seasons all the models showed reasonable agreements with the observed streamflow however r2 values were greater than 0 8 at all the gauging stations for both the calibration and validation periods despite overestimating the high flows at all the gauging stations simulations forced with the gp dataset satisfactorily reproduced the observed flow in the entire study area although the average rain gauge density of irrawaddy basin is approximately 20 000 km2 per station which is very low compared to the minimum requirement stated in the wmo guidelines 5 750 km2 per station for interior plains the models driven by igp managed to reproduce the measured streamflow at all the stations this indicates that the interpolation of gauge data may lead to an improved representation of precipitation over the basin in most cases persiann cdr and chirps also showed good agreement with observed streamflow in terms of nse and r2 however their biases were higher than the biases of simulations forced with igp in general chirps driven simulations performed better than simulations forced with persiann cdr therefore the chirps product can be utilized as an alternative source of rainfall inputs for hydrological studies in the irrawaddy basin tuo et al 2016 have also suggested chirps data as a favorable choice for data scarce alpine regions apart from that le and pricope 2017 concluded that the use of chirps data with the swat model significantly improved the streamflow volume estimation but not the satisfactory efficiency criteria for the nzoia basin kenya further as discussed by faridzad et al 2018 despite having limitations and uncertainties the bias corrected persiann cdr data provides valuable information for hydrological simulation in remote and high altitude areas 3 3 uncertainty in runoff simulation during the model calibration 14 selected hydrological parameters were adjusted and converged to different optimal intervals to reproduce streamflows at eight gauging stations while noting that sensitivities of the parameters can be basin specific five globally sensitive hydrological parameters have been selected to discuss these results fig 7 curve number cn2 corresponds to the land use type and largely affects surface runoff generation the four precipitation inputs used in this study led to different best fit cn2 values a cn2 varies 7 to 7 and ranges for the simulations with gp fitted parameter values significantly deviated from those obtained through simulations with the other three precipitation inputs hence a common pattern for fitted parameters could not be identified for all sub basins gw qmn is an important parameter related to base flow during low flow periods groundwater contribution to streamflow can be significant there is an apparent variability in these fitted parameters for most of the sub basins where the highest variability for this parameter v gwqmn from 81 to 874 was observed in the sub basins corresponding to the katha station compared to cn2 the variability of the fitted gw qmn for the four models at each sub basin was high the base flow recession factor alpha bf can vary between 0 and 1 the sub basins corresponding to the hkamti homalin and nyaung u stations resulted in nearly equal best fit alpha bf for all precipitation datasets sol awc is related to the available water content in the soil the best fitted parameters i e relative changes of existing value of sol awc varied from 0 49 to 0 23 fitted parameter values for esco which is relevant for soil evaporation varies between default swat limits 0 1 for the precipitation inputs considered all the fitted parameters are tabulated in supplementary information s1 prediction uncertainties p factor and r factor of streamflow simulations are presented for the four precipitation products table 5 in calibration igp data driven simulations captured more than 53 of the observations at all the stations within the 95ppu band and together with a r factor average band width from 0 34 to 0 69 igp driven simulations also showed more consistent prediction uncertainties for both calibration and validation periods than did the other three precipitation products simulations with persiann cdr and chirps showed the considerably higher variability of p factors compared to those with gp and igp for example in calibration the p factor variations are 0 2 to 0 79 for persiann cdr and 0 13 to 0 69 for chirps overall the average p factors among the eight gauging stations are pretty low 0 62 0 71 0 52 and 0 43 for gp igp persiann cdr and chirps respectively this shows that the uncertainty measures estimated based on parameter uncertainty parameter ranges were unable to capture all sources of uncertainty it implies that a considerable amount of uncertainty cannot be attributed to parameter uncertainty and comes notably from precipitation 4 conclusion this study investigated the dependency between different precipitation data sources and the reliability of the resulting modelled streamflows for the irrawaddy basin in myanmar four precipitation data sets used are in situ gauge data without interpolation and with interpolation persiann cdr and chirps we analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of the four precipitation datasets and their impacts on streamflow simulation in the irrawaddy basin the four precipitation datasets are different in magnitude and spatial and temporal distributions over the study area the global data sources persiann cdr and chirps yielded lower annual and seasonal precipitation compared to the in situ gauge data interpolated gauge data showed the highest basin average precipitation during the monsoon season may oct whereas persiann cdr and chirps showed the highest precipitations during the hot season mar apr and cold season nov feb respectively contradictory results were observed in the mountainous regions of the irrawaddy basin where persiann cdr and chirps data deviated notably from the interpolated gauge data during the monsoon period simulations with observed data showed an overestimation of streamflow while models with global products persiann cdr and chirps tended to underestimate the same compared to the minimum rain gauge density guidelines provided by wmo 5750 km2 per station for interior plains the rain gauge density over the study area is very low 20 000 km2 per station on an average despite the low density of rain gauges in general simulations with interpolated gauge precipitation data showed a good agreement with observed streamflow data for all the stations in the basin a majority of the stations also showed good results in simulations forced with chirps and persiann cdr in terms of nse and r2 however with higher biases it is to be noted that the in situ gauge data used here is available only for 20 years because the chirps and persiann cdr products have longer periods of records more than 35 years they can be valuable assets for data poor river basins for hydrological applications requiring long data records another potential application of these global data is to develop a merged product combining gauged data and one or more global data products different precipitation inputs lead to different best fitted parameter values and ranges for the different sub catchments overall we found that different precipitation datasets have considerable

8494,study region karkheh dam reservoir kdr located in western iran study focus to date there has been no research in the kdr that investigates the interconnections among thermal stratification ths water quality and nutrients based on field measurements this study explored the temporal trend of ths in the kdr and its interrelationship with water quality parameters based on data measured from 2005 2006 new hydrological insights for the region the results showed that a noticeable ths in the kdr starts in late april and continues until early december the strongest ths occurs during late summer when the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom layers in the reservoir exceeds 18 c as a result of external forces that generally intensify in december vertical water circulation occurs and by january and february there is a minimal temperature gradient between the surface and bottom layers during ths dissolved oxygen do is strongly confined by the metalimnion and does not penetrate into the hypolimnion however even during late december to february there is a large difference between do concentration in the surface and bottom layers which indicates limited mixing ammonium increasing and nitrate decreasing with depth was observed likely due to denitrification in the bottom layers and nitrification in the surface layers respectively the results of the present study provide new information on the spatio temporal variation of water quality in large reservoirs which is important for stakeholders with concerns related to lake and reservoir eutrophication and water quality issues keywords ammonium stratification reservoir water quality overturn 1 introduction it is important for reservoir managers to deal with water quality issues as well as unpredictable demands for water because of anthropogenic manipulation of in and out flows reservoirs experience large fluctuations in water levels and their hydrology is more complex and variable than natural lakes ford 1990 nowlin et al 2004 however reservoirs have received less attention than natural lakes and additional research is needed to enable effective and sustainable management of reservoir water quality and demand this is particularly important for deep and monomictic reservoirs such as the karkheh dam reservoir kdr in iran which is influenced by thermal stratification ths during most months of the year ths occurs in reservoirs due to the thermal gradient between the bottom and surface layers and divides reservoirs into three distinct layers i e epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion previous research on the kdr investigated its water quality using statistical and mathematical models karamouz et al 2008 etemad shahidi et al 2009 noori et al 2015 nikoo et al 2017 noori et al 2018 however no research has investigated the interconnections among vertical variation of ths water quality and nutrients based on field measurements ths has a significant role in the water quality status wqs of reservoirs as it influences many physiochemical and biological processes zhang et al 2016 development of ths prevents the penetration of dissolved oxygen do into deeper layers of the reservoir which causes deterioration of wqs gelda et al 2000 elçi 2008 one of the main consequences of do depletion in deep reservoir layers is a change in the balance of nutrients such as ammonium nh4 n and nitrate no3 n ammonium acts as the substrate for nitrification as the process uses oxygen and can result in do depletion berounsky and nixon 1990 loss of do prevents the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and ammonium begins to accumulate in the hypolimnion do depletion establishes an anoxic environment at the bottom of reservoirs that accelerates denitrification when nitrate is present a process that reduces nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and dinitrogen josette et al 1999 wall et al 2005 richardson et al 2009 xiong et al 2017 ammonium or nitrate may both be converted into nitrite which is highly toxic and dangerous to fish and humans forman et al 1985 bartsch et al 1989 coss et al 2004 high ammonium and nitrate concentrations may react with chlorine forming toxic byproducts such as chloramines polak 2004 ammonium and nitrate may also result in eutrophication and harmful algal blooms that negatively affect wqs and aquatic life paerl et al 2011 najar and khan 2012 smith et al 2016 gardner et al 2017 najar et al 2017 based on the above issues the main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the time of occurrence duration and severity of ths using observed depth water temperature profiles in the kdr 2 investigate the effects of ths on water quality parameters wqps such as do ammonium and nitrate and 3 determine the interconnections between depth and variation of these water quality parameters in the kdr 2 study area and methods the kdr is located in western iran at 48 7 8ʹ e longitude and 32 29 6ʹn latitude fig 1 considering its mid latitude location and depth 127 m the kdr can be classified as a warm monomictic lake hutchinson and löffler 1956 lewis 1983 that is susceptible to the presence of ths imberger and patterson 1989 wetzel 2001 the main inflow to the reservoir the karkheh river originates in the central and southwest regions of the zagros mountains in the west and northwest regions of iran the kdr is the largest artificial lake in iran with a volume exceeding 5 billion m3 and is used to supply water to irrigate agricultural lands to control destructive floods and to produce hydropower more details about the kdr and its basin are provided in table 1 the water quality data used in this study were collected by the iran water and power resources development company iwprdc in 2005 2006 samples were taken close to the dam structure at 5 m intervals down to 50 m depth water temperature and do were measured in situ with portable instruments while samples for ammonium and nitrate were transferred to the laboratory for analysis based on guidelines by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 depth profiles of water temperature do ammonium and nitrate were investigated during different months of the year in order to study water quality variation in the kdr 3 results 3 1 thermal stratification fig 2 shows the

information regarding the starting time of ths however simulated results of ths in the kdr using the ce qual w2 model a laterally averaged two dimensional model cole and buchak 1995 indicated that ths gradually begins to form in the middle of march noori et al 2018 and by early may there is a significant difference in temperature between the surface and bottom layers fig 2 after this the ambient temperature gradually increases and affects the surface water temperature warm water with lower density remains at the surface layer and does not mix with the deeper and denser cold water by july the reservoir is clearly divided into three distinct layers i e epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion the epilimnion thickness is about 10 m and the metalimnion reaches up to 30 m in september ths reaches its peak when the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom layers in the reservoir exceeds 18 c in early december a reduction in air temperature and increasing inflow and wind strength results in a decreasing temperature gradient between the surface and bottom layers and an increase in the depth of epilimnion which gradually reduces the depth of metalimnion fig 2 indicates that the epilimnion attains a thickness of approximately 20 m during december note that the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom layers is still substantial about 7 5 c even in early december in january and february as a result of the intensification of the cold season and precipitation ths is attenuated and then ends as there is a minimal temperature gradient between the surface and bottom layers in the kdr less than 3 c fig 2 ths in reservoirs is highly affected by different factors such as depth fluctuations resulting from human exploitation of water and climate change effects wetzel 2001 therefore the timing and duration of ths in the kdr presented here reflects the current situation of excessive water withdrawal and drought in the study area and may be somewhat different from other years 3 2 dissolved oxygen fig 3 shows the depth variation of do during the sampling period during may to early december ths prevents the penetration of do from the epilimnion into the hypolimnion and the do concentration in the bottom layers of the reservoir is lower than 4 mg l even during december to february fig 1 a period where ths is attenuated and then ends as there is a minimal temperature gradient i e less than 3 c between the surface and bottom layers there is a considerable difference between do concentration in the epilimnion and hypolimnion do concentration is about 2 mg l in the deep layers of the kdr in late december and january while the minimum levels during the other months are higher between 3 to 5 mg l the kdr is very deep and the hypolimnion volume is reasonably large which makes it difficult for the do to reach the bottom layers based on this it can be concluded that mixing processes are weak in this reservoir so that small amounts of do likely penetrate to the bottom of kdr 3 3 ammonium and nitrate variation of ammonium levels with depth is shown in fig 4 generally ammonium concentrations are at a minimum at the surface layer where do is plentiful and increase with depth during nearly all months of the year in the hypolimnion where nitrification takes place slowly due to do depletion there is an accumulation of ammonium this is particularly noticeable in september and october when the greatest differences in ammonium concentrations between the epilimnion and hypolimnion occur 0 04 to 0 7 mg l the difference in ammonium concentrations between these layers is particularly low during february when short mixing likely causes some do penetration into deeper layers and may consequently accelerate the nitrification process at the bottom layers of kdr according to fig 5 the depth trend of nitrate concentration is somewhat opposite to that of ammonium although like ammonium the greatest difference in nitrate levels between the epilimnion and hypolimnion 7 2 mg l occurs in october high amounts of do in the surface layers may cause ammonium to oxidize to nitrate nitrification and consequently the highest nitrate concentrations are found in the surface layers during most months in the hypolimnion due to do depletion nitrification is likely to be hindered and denitrification can proceed rapidly which reduces nitrate levels 3 4 water quality parameters depth temporal variations investigation of temporal trends of wqps can provide important information about their general behavior during the year in this regard the range in temporal variation of each wqp at different depths of the kdr was calculated for the sampling period and results are illustrated in fig 6 the large variation in ambient temperature during the year in the karkheh basin is strongly reflected in the high variation of surface water temperature 17 c due to the great depth of the kdr and the strong influence of ths the bottom layers experience a minimum variation of water temperature about 4 c during the year the trend is reversed for ammonium with surface and bottom layers experiencing minimum and maximum variations of ammonium concentration over the year respectively according to fig 6 maximum temporal variation of do and nitrate occur in the metalimnion while minimum variation is seen in the surface and bottom layers respectively low variation of nitrate concentrations is found in the bottom layers where the rate of nitrification and denitrification processes is likely a function of low do concentration david et al 2006 beaulieu et al 2014 4 discussion the results show that a strong ths is present in the reservoir during late may until early december and then disappears until the following spring this behavior is normal for a reservoir such as the kdr located at a low altitude in a mid latitude region in other words based on hutchinson and löffler 1956 classification system the kdr is a monomictic lake that stratifies then mixes once a year ths strongly influences many physiochemical and biological processes in reservoirs zhang et al 2016 it should be properly managed by mechanical aeration systems to prevent deterioration of wqs strong ths reduces do penetration from the epilimnion into the hypolimnion in the kdr even during late december to february when the ths is mostly absent there is a considerable difference between do concentration in the epilimnion and hypolimnion which is consistent with weak vertical mixing of water this difference may also be a result of nutrient release from the bottom due to brief mixing in the kdr noori et al 2015 generally as organic matter settles at the bottom of the reservoir do is consumed and the hypolimnion becomes anoxic beutel 2003 studies have reported that heavy rainfall events which mainly occur in the late fall and early winter in the study area could add nutrient loads of up to 400 and 80 of the average annual input of p and n in reservoirs respectively rueda et al 2007 huang et al 2014 therefore the weak mixing causes limited do to penetrate to the bottom of kdr compared to full mixing and does not compensate for oxygen consumed by organic material sedimentation heavy rainfall events also contribute to do depletion by adding nutrients to kdr the severe do depletion in the bottom layers is very important for water resources managers of the kdr who allocate the water for different purposes water withdrawal for drinking and agricultural purposes should therefore not be performed from the lower dewatering gates where the wqs is very poor however during october to february the reduced intensity of incoming solar radiation and ambient temperature cause a change of saturation concentration of do therefore the result is an increasing trend in do concentration in the epilimnion suggesting that the surface water would be the best location for water withdrawals during most of the year vertical distribution of water temperature and especially do concentration strongly influence ammonium and nitrate in the kdr generally do is abundant in the surface layer of kdr where there is direct contact with the atmosphere meanwhile the bottom layers in the kdr show do depletion due to strong ths during most months of the year and little mixing therefore nitrification and denitrification may significantly influence the ammonium and nitrate concentration in the surface and bottom layers respectively so that the depth trend of ammonium and nitrate are opposite to each other figs 4 and 5 in the hypolimnion where nitrification can slowly occur due to do depletion there is an accumulation of ammonium fig 4 also anoxic conditions in the bottom layers increase the ammonium concentration by releasing this pollutant from the sediments beutel 2003 in fact anoxic conditions provide a good environment for ammonium accumulation in the hypolimnion by preventing the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate leading to the release of ammonium from the bottom sediments priscu et al 1986 wall et al 2005 richardson et al 2009 xiong et al 2017 meanwhile in the surface layers where nitrification can take place there is an accumulation of nitrate fig 5 the important role of denitrification on nitrate removal in the reservoir hypolimnion was reported by garnier et al 2000 and david et al 2006 and may explain the decreasing trend of nitrate from surface to bottom layers in the kdr during december when there is severe do depletion in the hypolimnion it is important to note that other water quality characteristics such as water temperature ph and total suspended solids tss also affect the concentration of ammonium and nitrate in water bodies water environment federation 1998 kim et al 2006 in addition mixing in deep layers as well as nutrient consumption by algae in surface layers may contribute to the accumulation or decline of ammonium and nitrate in reservoirs noori et al 2015 concluded that diffuse transport of nutrients from the bottom sediments increases nutrient concentrations in the kdr hypolimnion and therefore the trend of ammonium and nitrate in the kdr are not influenced solely by do variation for example in december there is an obvious difference in do concentrations between the hypolimnion and epilimnion that do not appear to affect the depth variation of ammonium however the authors believe that further studies should be carried out to accurately determine the effects of nitrification denitrification microbial community and environmental factors such as temperature ph and do on the depth variation of nutrients in deep reservoirs such as the kdr it should be noted that the water quality data used in this study were collected by the iwprdc in 2005 2006 during the last decade the study area has faced negative effects of climate change in terms of drought which could influence ths and depth variation of water quality in the reservoir climate change directly affects ths in water bodies e g reservoirs via changes in air temperature and precipitation although mutual interactions between climate change and reservoir response are poorly understood edlund et al 2017 however physical changes resulting from climate drivers in reservoirs indicate that surface water temperature has increased butcher et al 2015 this causes longer periods of stronger ths which along with chemical and biochemical changes may promote hypolimnetic anoxia the release of problem causing pollutants from bottom sediments including nutrients and heavy metals and an increase in algal blooms coates et al 2006 foley et al 2012 butcher et al 2015 as such it is likely that the ths and actual water quality status in the kdr may be worse than presented here using the collected data from 2005 2006 5 conclusions stratification can significantly influence wqs in reservoirs this study investigated the temporal trend of ths in the kdr and its interrelationship with wqps based on data measured by the iwpdc in 2005 2006 findings revealed a strong thermal stability in the kdr during late may until early december followed by weak mixing until the early spring ths reduced do penetration from the surface into the deep layers as a likely result of nutrient release from the bottom due to weak mixing in the kdr the deep layers might experience do depletion even during late december to february when the ths is mostly gone depth profiles of nitrate revealed higher concentrations of this pollutant in the surface due to nitrification than deep layers due to denitrification meanwhile deep layers showed an accumulation of ammonium where anoxic conditions promoted ammonium concentration by preventing the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and the release of ammonium from the bottom sediments note the study area has faced negative effects of climate change in terms of drought which could influence ths and depth variation of water quality in the kdr meanwhile the conclusions drawn from this study were based on the water quality data collected by the iwprdc in 2005 2006 therefore it is likely that the ths and actual water quality status in the kdr may be worse than presented here author contributions roohollah noori planned the research with the co authors performed the analysis and wrote the paper with the co authors the co authors

8494,study region karkheh dam reservoir kdr located in western iran study focus to date there has been no research in the kdr that investigates the interconnections among thermal stratification ths water quality and nutrients based on field measurements this study explored the temporal trend of ths in the kdr and its interrelationship with water quality parameters based on data measured from 2005 2006 new hydrological insights for the region the results showed that a noticeable ths in the kdr starts in late april and continues until early december the strongest ths occurs during late summer when the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom layers in the reservoir exceeds 18 c as a result of external forces that generally intensify in december vertical water circulation occurs and by january and february there is a minimal temperature gradient between the surface and bottom layers during ths dissolved oxygen do is strongly confined by the metalimnion and does not penetrate into the hypolimnion however even during late december to february there is a large difference between do concentration in the surface and bottom layers which indicates limited mixing ammonium increasing and nitrate decreasing with depth was observed likely due to denitrification in the bottom layers and nitrification in the surface layers respectively the results of the present study provide new information on the spatio temporal variation of water quality in large reservoirs which is important for stakeholders with concerns related to lake and reservoir eutrophication and water quality issues keywords ammonium stratification reservoir water quality overturn 1 introduction it is important for reservoir managers to deal with water quality issues as well as unpredictable demands for water because of anthropogenic manipulation of in and out flows reservoirs experience large fluctuations in water levels and their hydrology is more complex and variable than natural lakes ford 1990 nowlin et al 2004 however reservoirs have received less attention than natural lakes and additional research is needed to enable effective and sustainable management of reservoir water quality and demand this is particularly important for deep and monomictic reservoirs such as the karkheh dam reservoir kdr in iran which is influenced by thermal stratification ths during most months of the year ths occurs in reservoirs due to the thermal gradient between the bottom and surface layers and divides reservoirs into three distinct layers i e epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion previous research on the kdr investigated its water quality using statistical and mathematical models karamouz et al 2008 etemad shahidi et al 2009 noori et al 2015 nikoo et al 2017 noori et al 2018 however no research has investigated the interconnections among vertical variation of ths water quality and nutrients based on field measurements ths has a significant role in the water quality status wqs of reservoirs as it influences many physiochemical and biological processes zhang et al 2016 development of ths prevents the penetration of dissolved oxygen do into deeper layers of the reservoir which causes deterioration of wqs gelda et al 2000 elçi 2008 one of the main consequences of do depletion in deep reservoir layers is a change in the balance of nutrients such as ammonium nh4 n and nitrate no3 n ammonium acts as the substrate for nitrification as the process uses oxygen and can result in do depletion berounsky and nixon 1990 loss of do prevents the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and ammonium begins to accumulate in the hypolimnion do depletion establishes an anoxic environment at the bottom of reservoirs that accelerates denitrification when nitrate is present a process that reduces nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and dinitrogen josette et al 1999 wall et al 2005 richardson et al 2009 xiong et al 2017 ammonium or nitrate may both be converted into nitrite which is highly toxic and dangerous to fish and humans forman et al 1985 bartsch et al 1989 coss et al 2004 high ammonium and nitrate concentrations may react with chlorine forming toxic byproducts such as chloramines polak 2004 ammonium and nitrate may also result in eutrophication and harmful algal blooms that negatively affect wqs and aquatic life paerl et al 2011 najar and khan 2012 smith et al 2016 gardner et al 2017 najar et al 2017 based on the above issues the main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the time of occurrence duration and severity of ths using observed depth water temperature profiles in the kdr 2 investigate the effects of ths on water quality parameters wqps such as do ammonium and nitrate and 3 determine the interconnections between depth and variation of these water quality parameters in the kdr 2 study area and methods the kdr is located in western iran at 48 7 8ʹ e longitude and 32 29 6ʹn latitude fig 1 considering its mid latitude location and depth 127 m the kdr can be classified as a warm monomictic lake hutchinson and löffler 1956 lewis 1983 that is susceptible to the presence of ths imberger and patterson 1989 wetzel 2001 the main inflow to the reservoir the karkheh river originates in the central and southwest regions of the zagros mountains in the west and northwest regions of iran the kdr is the largest artificial lake in iran with a volume exceeding 5 billion m3 and is used to supply water to irrigate agricultural lands to control destructive floods and to produce hydropower more details about the kdr and its basin are provided in table 1 the water quality data used in this study were collected by the iran water and power resources development company iwprdc in 2005 2006 samples were taken close to the dam structure at 5 m intervals down to 50 m depth water temperature and do were measured in situ with portable instruments while samples for ammonium and nitrate were transferred to the laboratory for analysis based on guidelines by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 depth profiles of water
