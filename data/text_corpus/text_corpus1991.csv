9955,california s weather is characterized by extreme droughts and floods this has resulted in overdraft of groundwater aquifers as growers turn to this source of water for irrigation during droughts california produces 99 of all walnuts in the us walnut growers are under extreme pressure to optimize crop water use water use estimates at the field scale are crucial for growers to refine irrigation scheduling decisions in this study two single source remote sensing based energy balance models pysebal python based surface energy balance algorithm for land and sebs surface energy balance system algorithm for estimating evapotranspiration eta were evaluated against in situ eta measurements from surface renewal in two young walnut orchards in california s sacramento valley strong correlations were obtained between the rs based estimates and in situ measurements for both pysebal and sebs from 2017 to 2020 with r2 above 0 87 rmse ranging from 0 79 to 1 05 mm and nse ranging from 0 79 to 0 88 sebs out performed pysebal on estimating time series daily eta for walnut at the field scale during the mid season characterized by high wind speed and high temperatures pysebal and sebs both underestimated eta while the two models slightly overestimated eta during the early growing season and post harvest period these results indicate the need for future research to focus on improving the performance of pysebal and sebs when simulating time series eta under advection and sparse vegetation conditions to provide more accurate eta for both in season and off season irrigation water management comparisons of historical kc and rs based kc were evaluated and rs based kc matched better with the actual water use requirements of developing 2nd to 4th leaf young walnuts orchards we observed substantial spatiotemporal variability of rs based kc in wo young walnut orchards at the capex and kauffman sites for instance kc values for the north and south halves of the capex orchard were above 1 2 and 0 9 1 1 respectively kc values for the north and south halves at the kauffman site were in a range of 0 6 0 71 and 0 82 0 94 respectively in other words conventional irrigation management based on multiplying historical kc and reference evapotranspiration is inadequate for site specific walnut irrigation management due to spatial and temporal variability in kc eta and kc mapping from two single source models were similar in the spatial patterns and provided an overall visual characterization of the spatial variability in crop water use overall rs based eta models using freely accessible satellite images and open source algorithms could be used as an alternative to expensive in situ measurements for enhancing site specific young walnut irrigation management

erratic weather patterns and with finite water resources and competition from other non agricultural water users water scarcity in agriculture has become a limiting factor in most arid regions in the world bastiaanssen et al 2005 california s central valley as one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world has a very diversified agricultural system ranging from livestock to field crops and specialty crops growers in california continue to reckon with water scarcity and multi year droughts resulting in groundwater overdraft water stressed california is a powerhouse in nut production it produces 80 43 and 28 of the world s almonds pistachios and walnuts respectively with an economic impact of 6 09 1 94 and 1 29 billion dollars in cash receipts respectively california department of food and agriculture cdfa 2019 due to increasing consumer demand for walnuts acreage has significantly increased in california over the past ten years to 440 000 acres 178 062 ha of which 365 000 acres 147 710 ha are bearing usda nass 2020 this mean that there is a large number of young or nonbearing orchards approximately 75 000 acres 30 351 ha young orchards with open canopies require different irrigation management compared to mature orchards with closed canopies walnut production is water intensive it takes approximately 25 mm of water to produce 0 064 metric tons international nut and dried fruit council inc 2020 to adapt to constrained water supplies california walnut farmers will need to optimize irrigation water management to improve crop water productivity letey 2007 the adoption of advanced management practices such as site specific irrigation management is becoming a popular way to achieve sustainability of irrigated agriculture kisekka et al 2021 thorp 2020 bhatti et al 2020 chandel et al 2020 representing a nexus of the water energy and carbon cycles et is of great importance due to its key role in agricultural water management zhao et al 2019 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 bahman abadi and kaviani 2020 hu et al 2018 site specific irrigation management is based on the premise of knowing the accurate spatial and temporal distribution of actual et eta in california the california irrigation management information system cimis provides reference et eto in conjunction with kc values generated from experimental studies to generate potential et etc for specific crops which helps farmers and irrigation managers develop water budgets for informing irrigation scheduling decisions irrigation timing rate snyder and sheradin 1993 growers in california are familiar with cimis s eto which has been in service for decades however neither eto nor etc is actual et and these generalized estimates do not provide you the feedback on how specific parts of the field respond to the irrigation applications in situ techniques such as weighing lysimeters the bowen ratio energy balance method eddy covariance systems surface renewal method soil water balance and scintillometer are used for estimating or measuring crop eta at plant and field scale over homogenous terrain however these methods have limitations when dealing with larger fields or regional scales because of their inability to simulate the heterogeneity inherent in land surfaces meteorological conditions soil characteristics and water content also the instrumentation required for most of these methods are prohibitively costly and not readily available to most growers wagle et al 2017a bhattarai et al 2016 drexler et al 2004 over the past two decades many remote sensing based methods using free satellite images were developed to simulate eta ranging from empirical models to process based models such as the surface energy balance models wang et al 2007 kustas and norman 1999 kalma et al 2008 mu et al 2011 glenn et al 2010 numerous studies have proved that rs based models are good choices for generating reasonable eta maps for different site specific conditions at different scales with acceptable uncertainty xue et al 2020 tasumi and kimura 2013 despite differences in theory and complexity of these models they use surface parameters such as vegetation indices empirical models directly use them to generate et while more physically based models use these indices to calculate canopy properties as input parameters these and other models also rely on bulk estimates of land surface temperature however site specific data are not always readily available in most cases and physically based models generally are robust generalizable and are generally considered more suitable for estimating spatiotemporal variations in eta li et al 2017 wagle et al 2017b being one of the most widely used approaches in physically based et modeling surface energy balance models can be categorized into single source bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 allen et al 2007a b roerink et al 2000 and two source models anderson et al 1997 norman et al 1995 2003 mecikalski et al 1999 single source models consider vegetation and soil as one source to calculate heat fluxes while two source models split the simulation of evaporation from vegetation and soil kustas et al 2019 compared to single source models two source models have limitations as they require more data and complex parameterization which do not necessarily provide better et estimations french et al 2015 acharya 2020 there are four commonly used single source models including surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebal s variant mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a b surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and simplified surface energy balance sseb senay et al 2007 sebal iteratively calculates sensible heat flux by manually selecting the hot and cold pixel with extreme temperatures and vegetation conditions within a satellite image it has been validated under a variety of conditions with a typical accuracy of 85 at field scale on a daily basis and increasing to 95 on a seasonal basis thus it has long been identified as the most suitable rs based model for estimating eta without pre knowledge of the field conditions bastiaanssen et al 2005 nyolei et al 2019 sawadogo et al 2020 however the accuracy of eta estimation in sebal is greatly affected by selecting hot and cold pixels manually which is also time consuming and subjective recently semi automated and automated anchor pixel selection procedures were developed with acceptable error and uncertainty to identify hot cold pixels based on surface parameters of extreme conditions which mitigate the weakness of manual selection jaafar and ahmad 2020 bhattarai et al 2017 pysebal a python version of the sebal model is embedded with an automation pixel selection procedure and is currently under continuous development by the ihe delft institute for water education unesco ihe 2018 metric was developed on the foundation of the sebal model thus many similar assumptions exist in these two models except for differences in how they pick anchor pixels how they upscale instantaneous eta to daily eta and the fact that metric requires hourly meteorological data while sebal does not based on excess resistance based energy balance sebs calculates the surface energy components for each pixel independently which is different from the conceptual method adopted in sebal and metric sseb model does not require meteorological data and has the simplest calculations among these one source models to simulate energy budgets which makes it a suitable tool for places without access to weather data sseb model has been validated showing a strong correlation with the sebal and metric based eta estimations senay et al 2013 most of these widely used single source models have been validated on field crops and mature nut trees however studies on their performance in estimating eta of young nut orchards is limited temporal variation of eta for developing young nut trees is different from mature nut trees due to differences in the canopy development thus evaluating the performance of these models in estimation of eta of developing young walnut orchards is urgently needed under the trend of changing agricultural land use from annual to nut crops in california long time series of eta with high spatial resolution a pixel resolution less than or equal to 30 m collected at 100 m and resampled to 30 m are essential for precision irrigation management coureault et al 2004 sanchez et al 2017 compared to other free satellite data landsat provides the longest most continuous measurements of relevant bands for agricultural water management and its data integrated with rs based models have been validated at various scales from field to catchment to regional whitfield et al 2010 evett et al 2012 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi can be calculated at 30 m resolution and land surface temperature relevant for et calculations is acquired at different spatial resolutions thermal band in 120 m 60 and 100 m for landsat 5 7 and 8 respectively and resampled to 30 m the 16 day revisit interval of landsat 8 combined with landsat 7 could achieve an 8 day revisit frequency after post processing applying time integration methods this spatiotemporal resolution eta product could generate time series of daily eta maps at the field scale which can be used to inform and enhance the efficiency of site specific irrigation management protocols based on free satellite imagery and advanced computing technology remote sensing based energy balance models provide eta estimates at high spatial and temporal resolutions their ability to cover various scales from field to regional at low cost enables them to complement the limited ground based observation networks positioning these remote sensing based approaches as most promising and practical for commercialization in precision irrigation management liou and kar 2014 senkondo et al 2019 recent open source collaboration efforts such as openet https openetdata org are enabling accessibility of remotely sensed eta to a wide range of stakeholders as well as commercial companies that have leveraged existing energy balance models to serve remotely sensed eta estimates directly to growers e g https www irriwatch com en and https agralogics com for different crops under site specific field conditions the selection of the appropriate rs based model is a prerequisite for accurately evaluating daily eta for precision irrigation management comparison of different models for estimating crop eta helps users including researchers and irrigation managers to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using different models in their application for irrigation management li et al 2015 2009 there is also a continuing need to compare the most widely used remote sensing eta models to ground based eta observations in this study we extend our previous research in evaluating the performance of remote sensing eta models against surface renewal technology in mature almonds tomatoes and maize xue et al 2020 this paper is focused on young walnuts another commonly grown and economically important nut crop in california due to the high correlation of eta estimations from metric and sseb with sebal this time pysebal and sebs were selected as two representative single source energy balance models to evaluate their performance against field measured eta from surface renewal shapland et al 2014 the objectives of this study were to 1 compare eta from pysebal and sebs to ground based measurements from surface renewal stations in young walnuts orchards from ages 2 5 years and 2 analyze energy balance components at satellite overpass from these two models to identify possible sources of model uncertainty and 3 evaluate the capability of these rs based models to generate spatial eta and kc maps at the orchard scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description in this section a brief overview of two models used in this study is provided pysebal and sebs both estimate instantaneous latent heat flux le as a residual of the surface energy balance eq 1 then using instantaneous eta daily eta is calculated for each pixel of the satellite image on the acquisition date 1 λ e r n h g where λe is the instantaneous latent heat flux w m2 r n is the instantaneous net radiation flux density at the surface w m2 h is the instantaneous sensible heat flux density w m2 and g is the instantaneous soil surface conduction heat flux density w m2 for specific algorithms in each model the reader is referred to xue et al 2020 in which we discuss similarities and differences between these two rs based et models 2 2 site description and ground based measurements california s central valley has a mediterranean climate with cool wet winters and hot dry summers and its high annual evaporative demand ranges from 889 to 1270 mm williams 2001 california produces 99 of all walnuts grown in the us usda 2020 english walnuts are a perennial nut tree crop and irrigation is used to meet crop water needs once an orchard is established fulton et al 2017 in this study two young walnut orchards planted in 2016 at two different large commercial farms capex and kauffman in the sacramento valley of california were involved in the study fig 1 site specific soil and crop information of these two orchards was obtained from usda nrcs s web soil survey wss and the growers table 1 and was used as input parameters in pysebal the soil at capex and kauffman orchards are arbuckle gravelly loam and anita clay series respectively this indicates a higher soil water holding capacity in kauffman than in capex the capex and kauffman orchards were grown with the chandler and tulare cultivars respectively the tulare cultivar has generally expressed more tree vigor than the chandler variety in varietal evaluations both orchards were grown on hybrid seedling paradox rootstock the kauffman orchard was intensively pruned using a central leader style during the establishment years from 2017 to 2020 while the capex orchard was established using a non pruning approach the daily eta of the orchards was monitored using an in field surface renewal station tule technologies stations www tuletechnologies com based on the residual of energy balance approach shapland et al 2014 tule stations were installed to provide weekly irrigation recommendations to growers at caepx site tule was installed since may 1st of 2017 and the kauffman site tule was installed since may 5th of 2017 data is transmitted through telemetry and growers can access it through the tule technologies website the station uses a highly sensitive thin fine wire thermocouple placed about 1 m above the crop canopies to capture the turbulent heat transfer in the orchard the tule surface renewal station directly measures h in the orchard tule technology uses infrared imagery from the goes system to simulate r n of the energy balance daily g value is assumed negligible when compared to r n l and λe 2 3 meteorological and satellite based data 2 3 1 meteorological data in this study daily and hourly meteorological data from a nearby cimis station gerber south cimis station number 222 location 40 029 122 156 including solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperature were obtained from the cimis website https cimis water ca gov for the instantaneous and daily eta estimation in pysebal and sebs this station is located mid way between capex and kauffman sites with an approximate distance of 10 km to each site fig 1 2 3 2 landsat images and digital elevation model data estimations of surface energy balance and ef are driven by a combination of satellite and elevation data the capex and kauffman sites are both located within the overlay area of two wrs scene paths and row of landsat images excluding scenes with significant cloud cover over the aoi a total of 83 clear sky landsat 8 operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor oli tirs images 35 44path 32row images and 48 45path 32row images for two walnut fields were obtained from the usgs earth resources observation and science center http eros usgs gov for the 2017 2020 walnut growing seasons landsat oli bands 2 7 data and tris level 1 bands 10 11 were used in this study with 30 30 m and 60 60 m resolution respectively the specific landsat 8 imagery used in this study are presented in fig 2 with detailed information two digital elevation model dem maps at 30 m spatial resolution covering two walnut orchards were used in this study to perform surface temperature corrections based on the elevation and slope which are retrieved from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second data in order to optimize the computational time of pysebal these two dem maps were clipped in qgis into a smaller rectangular size that includes both the aoi and a small buffer zone around the study area sites based on empirical equations dem meteorological and soil data and landsat imagery were processed with atmospheric corrections automatically performed in pysebal and sebs model running both in a python environment 2 4 model evaluation against surface renewal eta and etc based on cimis eto and experimental kc comparisons between time series daily eta from two rs based single source eta models and tule station measurements were respectively conducted throughout the simulation period rather than only comparing the daily et a on satellite acquisition dates to reconstruct the time series of daily eta rs based daily eta maps mm d from pysebal and sebs were interpolated between two adjacent satellite overpasses using the eto from the nearest cimis weather station no 222 and the linear interpolated ef map in sebs or kc map in pysebal which were all post processed in a time integration module embedded in pysebal in this study we also calculated the potential et etc based on california s local walnut kc at different stages fulton et al 2017 and cimis daily et0 which are commonly used by california s farmers as an indicator of daily crop water use to guide irrigation scheduling when there is no access to the monitored daily eta allen et al 1998 it s worth noting that these two young orchards were changing rapidly with respect to tree canopy size from 2017 to 2020 in 2017 they were in their second leaf second year and were smaller non bearing trees by 2020 they were larger nut bearing trees approaching that representative of a mature walnut orchard young trees grow rapidly and the kc and crop water use between young and mature walnut canopy can be substantially different from each other fulton et al 2014 thus the kc or etc for a young walnut canopy should be adjusted to account for this dynamic this adjustment may be based upon tree age or by estimating canopy shading using digital images or direct measurements of light interception with a ceptometer simplified methods for use by growers have been suggested by fulton et al 2020 at https www sacvalleyorchards com blog young orchards from the university of california agriculture natural resources in this study the kc and etc adjustments were made using the simpler age based approach which growers are more likely to employ due to ease of use the estimated time series daily eta values from two rs based et models tule ground based eta measurements and kc based cimis etc estimates were each compared from 2017 to 2020 at these two walnut orchards this operational protocol provided a way to evaluate the performance of rs based et models for estimating the daily et a s temporal variation when compared to the in situ surface renewal measurements and the more traditional kc eto approach we evaluated model performance at each validation orchard using different statistical goodness of fit measures including the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse readers are recommended to refer to legates and mccabe 1999 for detailed information about these and other goodness of fit measures typically used in hydrology model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimates to surface renewal measurements comparisons of the estimated daily eta from two rs based models with tule based et measurements are shown in fig 3 although we acknowledge there is measurement uncertainty with surface renewal method used by tule technology the extensively good validation record of surface renewal method and the successful application of tule sensors made its eta estimates a reasonable reference in this study fulton et al 2017 krintz et al 2016 montazar et al 2020 zaccaria et al 2017 xue et al 2020 among three goodness of fit indices rmse was considered as the most relevant index as the goal of model performance evaluation was to achieve high accuracy of daily eta estimations our model validation using daily eta measurements from tule surface renewal stations at two walnut orchards indicates that pysebal and sebs capture the spatial and temporal variation of daily eta reasonably well the performance of pysebal and sebs was good with reasonably low rmse ranging from 0 79 mm d to 1 05 mm d nse ranged from 0 79 to 0 88 and r2 from 0 874 to 0 885 throughout the simulation period may 4th of 2017 to october 16th 2020 for capex site may 6th 2017 to october 16th 2020 for kauffman site fig 4 shows the time series daily eta for the two walnut orchards from the interpolated estimations of pysebal and sebs tule measurements and cimis based etc estimations the continuous cimis based daily etc commonly used by california s walnut growers as the reference for irrigation scheduling fulton et al 1991 matched reasonably well with rs based eta estimations and tule based eta measurements for both sites in 2019 and 2020 fourth 4th year leaf and fifth fifth year leaf orchard as the trees approached maturity in terms of canopy size and light interception in contrast cimis based etc did not match well enough with rs and tule based eta during 2017 2018 second leaf to the third leaf period when tree size and canopy light interception were changing substantially this is attributed to the use of very simple age based empirical factors for converting kc from mature walnut trees to young walnut trees in this study with this approach ground based measurement data of fractional canopy cover is very limited it is also noteworthy that there is a more accurate method for adjusting kc based on canopy fraction recommended by fao and also suggested by fulton et al 2020 this method is more accurate than the simple age based approach because of light interception s being the most important factor influencing kc in orchards williams and ayars 2005 however because this fao method requires the assessment of canopy light interception as the trees grow to adjust kc and etc it is less likely to be adopted by growers available landsat based methods of estimating canopy fraction have been applied in expanding irrigation applications such as uc anr s cropmanage https cropmanage ucanr edu such easy to use applications enhance the grower s irrigation toolbox where available fractional light interception for young trees should be used to adjust kc during the early walnut season in april to may cimis based etc had much lower values than those provided by ground based eta measurements or rs based estimates although slight water stress in the early growing season helps with walnut root development water stress will slow the rate of shoot growth and increase the time years for an orchard to reach its full production potential in 2017 cimis based etc was significantly lower than rs and tule based eta for the kauffman site this partly reflects the fact that the empirical age based factors for young walnut orchards were developed previously in a non pruning walnut orchard system fulton 2021 it also reflects the integration of the relatively vigorously growing tulare variety higher soil water capacity and the central leader pruning practice used to simulate tree vigor in this orchard it may also indicate the rs and tule based methods more accurately account for the effects of ground cover between the tree rows the integration of eto from cimis with age based empirical walnut kc values provides a simple scientific method for reasonably estimating irrigation needs for young developing orchards which is certainly better than operating with no adjustment at all however rs and tule based eta provides viable alternatives to quantify eta for orchard specific settings including crop varieties soil properties date of sowing climatic conditions and cultural practices besides using one kc value to irrigate an entire walnut orchard is inefficient given spatial variability in kc and eta such management can result in low water use efficiency due to excessive irrigation application on some parts of the orchard and under irrigating others which can also cause a reduction in yield thus using rs based eta showed its potential to improve site specific irrigation management compared to the traditional cimis based etc method however adopting more accurate rs based eta estimations in practices depends on upgrading irrigation systems to provide enough control and flexibility to irrigate according to the spatio temporal variability in eta compared to the average value of tule based eta pysebal and sebs based eta estimates were 10 1 higher and 2 5 lower during the walnut s growth season april 1st to november 15th and were 3 1 and 3 2 higher during the dormant season november 15th to next year s march 31st for capex site for the kauffman site pysebal and sebs s estimates were 4 7 and 3 7 lower during the growing season and were 30 lower and 13 higher during the dormant season when compared to tule estimates overestimations of time series of daily eta from pysebal were detected during the walnut s growing season in fig 4 when compared to tule based eta which were likely caused by three potential error sources first the warmer cold wet pixels were selected within the well watered farmland on satellite overpass dates as originally assumed in sebal a cold anchor pixel is from a water body and a selection of cold pixels from well irrigated farmland will set a warmer temperature threshold for the cold limits and thus increase the le for all the pixels in the aoi the second reason is the assumption of ef s being constant over a daily eta estimation in pysebal on satellite overpass dates which can be acceptable as a reasonable assumption in humid regions with dry surface conditions rather than in well irrigated fields in arid and semi arid regions such as our study area reduced crop stomatal conductance in the often hot and dry conditions in the afternoon will cause a reduction of eta the advection of h existing in a well irrigated farmland in arid region will normally increase eta while severe horizontal advection from synoptic weather events or land land breezes originating from adjacent non irrigated fields could reduce the crop stomatal conductance and may result in a decrease of eta different crops may respond differently to the severity of advection zermeño gonzalez and hipps 1997 mkhwanazi et al 2015a b similar conclusions about the overestimation of et from sebal on well irrigated farmland in arid and semi arid regions and its sources of uncertainty have been reported in several publications long et al 2011 tasumi et al 2005 hoedjes et al 2008 stewart 1996 irmak et al 2012 the third uncertainty source may be the cloudy days that may have occurred between two cloud free eta maps which will result in higher linear interpolation values leading to overestimated daily eta values for any cloudy periods besides underestimations of pysebal or sebs based eta values were observed on the following satellite overpass dates 30 june 2017 23 july 2017 25 september 2017 03 july 2018 04 august 2018 20 june 2019 capex site 14 june 2017 30 june 2017 16 july 2017 25 september 2017 21 april 2018 24 june 2018 04 june 2019 22 july 2019 29 july 2019 07 august 2019 14 august 2019 23 august 2019 15 september 2019 24 september 2019 24 july 2020 31 july 2020 09 august 2020 26 september 2020 kauffman site during these days high wind speeds and warm air temperatures signal the existence of strong horizontal advection in the field de bruin et al 2005 brakke et al 1978 which could potentially increase the daily eta by significant margins however neither pysebal nor sebs consider the effect of advection in upscaling instantaneous eta to daily eta the wind speed as an input parameter in these two models based on instantaneous measurement at the satellite overpass time often increases in the afternoon due to enhanced vertical mixing and thus can bring an increase of advection which leads to an increase of daily eta in proportion to rn fig 5 the constant ef assumed in both pysebal and sebs will underestimate daily eta in that case which is often found in well irrigated farmland in arid and semi arid regions this result of underestimating eta due to possible advection in walnut fields is reported in many previous studies raziei and pereira 2013 liaqat et al 2015 patel et al 2006 some work has been conducted on the modification of pysebal and sebs to make them more accurate and suitable for eta estimation when advection occurs especially in irrigated farms in arid and semi arid regions pakparvar et al 2014 mkhwanazi et al 2015a another possibility of sebs s underestimation of daily eta during the walnut growth period in fig 4 b and c from june to july and in fig 4 f h from july to august could come from the use of an empirical algorithm used for calculating daily rn in the estimation of daily eta other researchers have reported similar findings on the uncertainty of sebs model sourced from the empirical equation of daily rn and the need to calibrate it in advance for better estimations of daily eta zhang et al 2013 timmermans et al 2013 during the dormant season fig 4 represents overestimations of time series eta from both pysebal and sebs at capex and kauffman sites which could be attributed to herbaceous vegetation cover growing between tree rows during this period pysebal and sebs are single source models suitable for homogeneous surfaces and have been shown to perform very well for full cover vegetation surfaces or completely closed canopies however orchard tree crops with sparse vegetation during the dormant season are expected to have lower surface roughness and h when compared to fully covered vegetation surfaces which could undermine the accuracy of etc estimates hatfield 1989 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 raupach 1994 there is some work worthy of mention here which specifically includes analyzing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of rs based et models under sparse cover conditions jamshidi et al 2019 huang and song 2012 barati et al 2011 wang et al 2020 meanwhile underestimations of daily eta from pysebal were also detected under rainy events especially in the winter and early spring fig 5 which was mostly due to its assumption of zero et for hot pixels as identification of extreme conditions in the image is necessary it is difficult to satisfy this assumption in the rainy season and a colder hot pixel could be selected in this case since the moisture status for the simulation area is homogeneous in the mixed images including the crops and natural environment teixeira 2010 wagle et al 2017a as winter rainfall is not sufficient to replenish deep soil moisture applying pre season irrigation during late january and early february is commonly adopted by walnut growers to avoid root rot diseases and to restore the deep soil moisture therefore the application and accuracy of irrigation events in the spring before the growing season cannot be overlooked goldhamer 1998 for growers who want to have a visual map of actual water use requirements over the entirety of their orchards rs based eta mapping provides an economic and labor saving alternative to the installation of multiple ground based in situ monitoring systems fig 6 represents the spatial variability of daily eta simulated from pysebal and sebs for the capex and kauffman sites and august 11th of 2018 was chosen as a representative satellite overpass date during the walnut growing season for eta mapping in general good agreements were observed between the two spatial patterns for the capex site eta had a higher value in the fine textured zone located in the north and southwest of the field but lower values in the southeastern sandy zone for the kauffman site its fine texture soil properties resulted in less spatial variation within the orchard but there were still slightly lower eta in the western zone than its eastern zone overall pysebal and sebs could both simulate time series daily eta with reasonable accuracy sebs performed better than pysebal on the time series daily eta estimations at capex but the performance was similar at the kauffman sites 3 2 remote sensing based crop coefficient maps from pysebal and sebs as presented and discussed in the section above time series of daily eta could be reproduced based on two remotely sensed et models using gap filling techniques between adjacent landsat images besides eta maps other products from the simulations are daily maps such as ndvi lai and kc in fig 7 comparisons of pixel based kc from kc maps on satellite overpass dates and the experimental kc values are presented during the walnut s growing season from april 1st to november 15th with young walnut orchards developing from the second leaf to the fifth leaf historical kc increased with tree age but by the fourth leaf stage kc is already the same as it is for mature walnut trees due to the limited available sky clear satellite images rs based kc are not available for every half month period in each year and kc values for the early and late stage april and november were collated from only a small amount of images the maximum of pysebal based kc reached 1 56 during late june this relatively high kc may be attributed to the irrigation event on the satellite overpass date at the kauffman site with a full coverage sprinkler system pysebal and sebs simulated higher kc values than the experimental kc in the early season from april to may later in the season from late september to early october experimental kc for third leaf and fourth leaf declined from 0 97 to 0 88 while rs based kc both showed greater decreases during these two periods when it comes to the walnut s postharvest period historical kc for the fourth leaf orchard declined greatly from 0 51 to 0 28 in early november while rs based kc values did not decline as much as historical kc fulton et al 2017 reported similar results about higher semi monthly kc of walnut measured from eddy covariance method in the northern sacramento valley than historical kc based on research conducted in the southern san joaquin valley during the early and late growth stages he emphasized that in the northern sacramento valley sample population 95 of semi monthly kc values varied greatly in a range of 0 57 1 06 from the canopy to canopy and from field to field during early november tasumi et al 2005 observed large ranges in kc for various field crops during early and late growth periods when the soil surfaces of the fields were nearly 100 barren and he suggested the necessities and advantages of applying rs based energy balance model to calculate kc and eta for individual fields especially for these periods and conditions kc within a walnut orchard can vary greatly from historical kc because of the different site specific weather soil texture variety rootstock pruning irrigation salinity fertility and other field management practices from the field conditions referred to in the literature to better understand the utility of kc maps in helping walnut growers fig 8 provides detailed information about kc mapping based on pysebal and sebs in this study and representative kc maps of each phenological stage during the year of 2018 and 2020 at the two sites even during the same phenological stage kc maps for the same orchard in different years can have very different values for instance at the capex orchard the minimum value of pysebal based kc on oct 3rd 2020 was 0 75 which is higher than the maximum kc values on oct 7th 2018 fig 8a considering this same color symbol in the legend to each sub figure is set with different value ranges to provide readers a more clear and distinct spatial distribution for each map the growing season of walnuts were divided into seven phenological stages including the bloom to leaf out stage stage 1 april 1st to 30th the shoot growth hull and shell sizing stage stage 2 may 1st to may 31st the shell hardening stage stage 3 june 1st to june 30th the nut filling stage stage 4 july 1st to september 15th the hull splitting stage stage 5 september 16th to october 7th the harvest stage stage 6 october 8th to 15th first crop was in 2019 lastly and the postharvest stage stage 7 october 16th to november 15th fig 8 pysebal and sebs based kc maps for same date and site showed a similar spatial distribution overall sebs based kc were relatively lower than pysebal based kc which is consistent with the comparison results of daily eta from these two rs based models within the same phenological stage simulated kc from rs based models showed great differences over time and space 56 sub figures provided an intuitive sense of kc varying greatly from capex site to kauffman and spatial heterogeneity of kc even within the same orchard for instance pixel based kc had a maximum of 0 79 in the kauffman site and a minimum of 0 76 in the capex site on june 24th of 2018 most of the northern half of orchard at capex during stage 2 had higher kc above 1 2 while the southern half of field mostly had a lower kc range from 0 9 to 1 1 in the same growth stage kc values for the north and south half of the kauffman site were in a range of 0 6 0 71 and 0 82 0 94 respectively as mentioned above large variations in kc for different walnut orchards can be caused by many factors such as weather soil irrigation method walnut variety and canopy structure as mentioned before differences in kc within an orchard could also be attributed to variations in distances from the edge or local variations in the soil horizon results indicate a need to apply site specific irrigation scheduling in walnut during each phenological stage based on their actual water requirement and canopy status in each orchard instead of taking the conventional cimis eto kc based etc as crop water use for the whole orchard additionally great variations in kc maps on two similar satellite overpass dates in 2018 and 2020 were detected throughout the growing season which also revealed the weakness of applying the traditional kc to guide irrigation management rs based et models could be a useful tool for mapping kc and eta for individual orchards which is helpful for making site specific irrigation management decisions the ability to capture spatiotemporal variations of eta and kc as well as the low cost advantages provided could definitely make rs based et models a promising tool in smart agriculture however it worth noting that applying rs based eta in irrigation scheduling requires an advanced irrigation system providing enough control and flexibility to irrigate based on the spatio temporal variability e g zone irrigation systems reported in kisekka et al 2021 4 conclusions in this study two single source remote sensing based energy balance models pysebal and sebs for estimating evapotranspiration et were evaluated against in situ eta measurements from surface renewal in two walnut orchards in california s sacramento valley results showed good agreement between rs based eta and ground measurements of eta from surface renewal for walnuts there were underestimations from both pysebal and sebs under advection conditions overestimations of time series daily eta from pysebal were observed and could be attributed to three potential error sources first the warmer cold wet pixels selection second the inherent assumption of constant ef for a daily eta estimation and third the possibility of cloudy days existing between two cloud free eta images overestimated eta amounts from pysebal and sebs were apparent during the dormant early season and postharvest periods besides pysebal underestimated eta when there were rainy events due to selecting colder hot dry pixels on the whole sebs provided better simulations of time series daily eta against ground based measurements during the walnut s growing and dormant seasons at capex with better goodness of fit results r2 improved from 0 87 to 0 88 and rmse from 0 79 to 0 88 mm the performance of the models at the kaufman site was similar further research should investigate ways to improve the performance of rs models for estimating daily eta e under advection and sparse vegetation conditions based on similar spatial patterns from pysebal and sebs based simulations rs based eta and kc mapping at different phenological stages could also provide growers an overview of spatial variability of water use and development of advanced water delivery techniques in their orchards compared to the traditional walnut crop water use estimation based on cimis and historical kc rs based eta and kc matches better with the crop s actual water use requirements which reveals further the necessity of rs based models to be popularized and applied in walnut orchards the latter point is especially true for young walnut orchards for their rapid development in the first one to five years our study detailed the rs based kc mapping and showed the possibility of kc varying with time between orchards and within the same orchard in conclusion the results of this study can be used by growers researchers and policymakers for estimating daily eta kc and improve site specific irrigation management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9955,california s weather is characterized by extreme droughts and floods this has resulted in overdraft of groundwater aquifers as growers turn to this source of water for irrigation during droughts california produces 99 of all walnuts in the us walnut growers are under extreme pressure to optimize crop water use water use estimates at the field scale are crucial for growers to refine irrigation scheduling decisions in this study two single source remote sensing based energy balance models pysebal python based surface energy balance algorithm for land and sebs surface energy balance system algorithm for estimating evapotranspiration eta were evaluated against in situ eta measurements from surface renewal in two young walnut orchards in california s sacramento valley strong correlations were obtained between the rs based estimates and in situ measurements for both pysebal and sebs from 2017 to 2020 with r2 above 0 87 rmse ranging from 0 79 to 1 05 mm and nse ranging from 0 79 to 0 88 sebs out performed pysebal on estimating time series daily eta for walnut at the field scale during the mid season characterized by high wind speed and high temperatures pysebal and sebs both underestimated eta while the two models slightly overestimated eta during the early growing season and post harvest period these results indicate the need for future research to focus on improving the performance of pysebal and sebs when simulating time series eta under advection and sparse vegetation conditions to provide more accurate eta for both in season and off season irrigation water management comparisons of historical kc and rs based kc were evaluated and rs based kc matched better with the actual water use requirements of developing 2nd to 4th leaf young walnuts orchards we observed substantial spatiotemporal variability of rs based kc in wo young walnut orchards at the capex and kauffman sites for instance kc values for the north and south halves of the capex orchard were above 1 2 and 0 9 1 1 respectively kc values for the north and south halves at the kauffman site were in a range of 0 6 0 71 and 0 82 0 94 respectively in other words conventional irrigation management based on multiplying historical kc and reference evapotranspiration is inadequate for site specific walnut irrigation management due to spatial and temporal variability in kc eta and kc mapping from two single source models were similar in the spatial patterns and provided an overall visual characterization of the spatial variability in crop water use overall rs based eta models using freely accessible satellite images and open source algorithms could be used as an alternative to expensive in situ measurements for enhancing site specific young walnut irrigation management

growers in california are familiar with cimis s eto which has been in service for decades however neither eto nor etc is actual et and these generalized estimates do not provide you the feedback on how specific parts of the field respond to the irrigation applications in situ techniques such as weighing lysimeters the bowen ratio energy balance method eddy covariance systems surface renewal method soil water balance and scintillometer are used for estimating or measuring crop eta at plant and field scale over homogenous terrain however these methods have limitations when dealing with larger fields or regional scales because of their inability to simulate the heterogeneity inherent in land surfaces meteorological conditions soil characteristics and water content also the instrumentation required for most of these methods are prohibitively costly and not readily available to most growers wagle et al 2017a bhattarai et al 2016 drexler et al 2004 over the past two decades many remote sensing based methods using free satellite images were developed to simulate eta ranging from empirical models to process based models such as the surface energy balance models wang et al 2007 kustas and norman 1999 kalma et al 2008 mu et al 2011 glenn et al 2010 numerous studies have proved that rs based models are good choices for generating reasonable eta maps for different site specific conditions at different scales with acceptable uncertainty xue et al 2020 tasumi and kimura 2013 despite differences in theory and complexity of these models they use surface parameters such as vegetation indices empirical models directly use them to generate et while more physically based models use these indices to calculate canopy properties as input parameters these and other models also rely on bulk estimates of land surface temperature however site specific data are not always readily available in most cases and physically based models generally are robust generalizable and are generally considered more suitable for estimating spatiotemporal variations in eta li et al 2017 wagle et al 2017b being one of the most widely used approaches in physically based et modeling surface energy balance models can be categorized into single source bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 allen et al 2007a b roerink et al 2000 and two source models anderson et al 1997 norman et al 1995 2003 mecikalski et al 1999 single source models consider vegetation and soil as one source to calculate heat fluxes while two source models split the simulation of evaporation from vegetation and soil kustas et al 2019 compared to single source models two source models have limitations as they require more data and complex parameterization which do not necessarily provide better et estimations french et al 2015 acharya 2020 there are four commonly used single source models including surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebal s variant mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a b surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and simplified surface energy balance sseb senay et al 2007 sebal iteratively calculates sensible heat flux by manually selecting the hot and cold pixel with extreme temperatures and vegetation conditions within a satellite image it has been validated under a variety of conditions with a typical accuracy of 85 at field scale on a daily basis and increasing to 95 on a seasonal basis thus it has long been identified as the most suitable rs based model for estimating eta without pre knowledge of the field conditions bastiaanssen et al 2005 nyolei et al 2019 sawadogo et al 2020 however the accuracy of eta estimation in sebal is greatly affected by selecting hot and cold pixels manually which is also time consuming and subjective recently semi automated and automated anchor pixel selection procedures were developed with acceptable error and uncertainty to identify hot cold pixels based on surface parameters of extreme conditions which mitigate the weakness of manual selection jaafar and ahmad 2020 bhattarai et al 2017 pysebal a python version of the sebal model is embedded with an automation pixel selection procedure and is currently under continuous development by the ihe delft institute for water education unesco ihe 2018 metric was developed on the foundation of the sebal model thus many similar assumptions exist in these two models except for differences in how they pick anchor pixels how they upscale instantaneous eta to daily eta and the fact that metric requires hourly meteorological data while sebal does not based on excess resistance based energy balance sebs calculates the surface energy components for each pixel independently which is different from the conceptual method adopted in sebal and metric sseb model does not require meteorological data and has the simplest calculations among these one source models to simulate energy budgets which makes it a suitable tool for places without access to weather data sseb model has been validated showing a strong correlation with the sebal and metric based eta estimations senay et al 2013 most of these widely used single source models have been validated on field crops and mature nut trees however studies on their performance in estimating eta of young nut orchards is limited temporal variation of eta for developing young nut trees is different from mature nut trees due to differences in the canopy development thus evaluating the performance of these models in estimation of eta of developing young walnut orchards is urgently needed under the trend of changing agricultural land use from annual to nut crops in california long time series of eta with high spatial resolution a pixel resolution less than or equal to 30 m collected at 100 m and resampled to 30 m are essential for precision irrigation management coureault et al 2004 sanchez et al 2017

satellite imagery and advanced computing technology remote sensing based energy balance models provide eta estimates at high spatial and temporal resolutions their ability to cover various scales from field to regional at low cost enables them to complement the limited ground based observation networks positioning these remote sensing based approaches as most promising and practical for

daily eta for precision irrigation management comparison of different models for estimating crop eta helps users including researchers and irrigation managers to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using different models in their application for irrigation management li et al 2015 2009 there is also a continuing need to compare the most widely used remote sensing eta models to ground based eta observations in this study we extend our previous research in evaluating the performance of remote sensing eta models against surface renewal technology in mature almonds tomatoes and maize xue et al 2020 this paper is focused on young walnuts another commonly grown and economically important nut crop in california due to the high correlation of eta estimations from metric and sseb with sebal this time pysebal and sebs were selected as two representative single source energy balance models to evaluate their performance against field measured eta from surface renewal shapland et al 2014 the objectives of this study were to 1 compare eta from pysebal and sebs to ground based measurements from surface renewal stations in young walnuts orchards from ages 2 5 years and 2 analyze energy balance components at satellite overpass from these two models to identify possible sources of model uncertainty and 3 evaluate the capability of these rs based models to generate spatial eta and kc maps at the orchard scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description in this section a brief overview of two models used in this study is provided pysebal and sebs both estimate

the instantaneous soil surface conduction heat flux density w m2 for specific algorithms in each model the reader is referred to xue et al 2020 in which we discuss similarities and differences between these two rs based et models 2 2 site description and ground based measurements california s central valley has a mediterranean climate with cool wet winters and hot dry summers and its high annual evaporative demand ranges from 889 to 1270 mm williams 2001 california produces 99 of all walnuts grown in the us usda 2020 english walnuts are a perennial nut tree crop and irrigation is used to meet crop water needs once an orchard is established fulton et al 2017 in this study two young walnut orchards planted in 2016 at two different large commercial farms capex and kauffman in the sacramento valley of california were involved in the study fig 1 site specific soil and crop information of these two orchards was obtained from usda nrcs s web soil survey wss and the growers table 1 and was used as input parameters in pysebal the soil at capex and kauffman orchards are arbuckle gravelly loam and anita clay series respectively this indicates a higher soil water holding capacity in kauffman than in capex the capex and kauffman orchards were grown with the chandler and tulare cultivars respectively the tulare cultivar has generally expressed more tree vigor than the chandler variety in varietal evaluations both orchards were grown on hybrid seedling paradox rootstock the kauffman orchard was intensively pruned using a central leader style during the establishment years from 2017 to 2020 while the capex orchard was established using a non pruning approach the daily eta of the orchards was monitored using an in field surface renewal station tule technologies stations www tuletechnologies com based on the residual of energy balance approach shapland et al 2014 tule stations were installed to provide weekly irrigation recommendations to growers at caepx site tule was installed since may 1st of 2017 and the kauffman site tule was installed since may 5th of 2017 data is transmitted through telemetry and growers can access it through the tule technologies website the station uses a highly sensitive thin fine wire thermocouple placed about 1 m above the crop canopies to capture the turbulent heat transfer in the orchard the tule surface renewal station directly measures h in the orchard tule technology uses infrared imagery from the goes system to simulate r n of the energy balance daily g value is assumed negligible when compared to r n l and λe 2 3 meteorological and satellite based data 2 3 1 meteorological data in this study daily and hourly meteorological data from a nearby cimis station gerber south cimis station number 222 location 40 029 122 156 including solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperature were obtained from the cimis website https cimis water ca gov for the instantaneous and daily eta estimation in pysebal and sebs this station is located mid way between capex and kauffman sites with an approximate distance of 10 km to each site fig 1 2 3 2 landsat images and digital elevation model data estimations of surface energy balance and ef are driven by a combination of satellite and elevation data the capex and kauffman sites are both located within the overlay area of two wrs scene paths and row of landsat images excluding scenes with significant cloud cover over the aoi a total of 83 clear sky landsat 8 operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor oli tirs images 35 44path 32row images and 48 45path 32row images for two walnut fields were obtained from the usgs earth resources observation and science center http eros usgs gov for the 2017 2020 walnut growing seasons landsat oli bands 2 7 data and tris level 1 bands 10 11 were used in this study with 30 30 m and 60 60 m resolution respectively the specific landsat 8 imagery used in this study are presented in fig 2 with detailed information two digital elevation model dem maps at 30 m spatial resolution covering two walnut orchards were used in this study to perform surface temperature corrections based on the elevation and slope which are retrieved from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second data in order to optimize the computational time of pysebal these two dem maps were clipped in qgis into a smaller rectangular size that includes both the aoi and a small buffer zone around the study area sites based on empirical equations dem meteorological and soil data and landsat imagery were processed with atmospheric corrections automatically performed in pysebal and sebs model running both in a python environment 2 4 model evaluation against surface renewal eta and etc based on cimis eto and experimental kc comparisons between time series daily eta from two rs based single source eta models and tule station measurements were respectively conducted throughout the simulation period rather than only comparing the daily et a on satellite acquisition dates to reconstruct the time series of daily eta rs based daily eta maps mm d from pysebal and sebs were interpolated between two adjacent satellite overpasses using the eto from the nearest cimis weather station no 222 and the linear interpolated ef map in sebs or kc map in pysebal which were all post processed in a time integration module embedded in pysebal in this study we also calculated the potential et etc based on california s local walnut kc at different stages fulton et al 2017 and cimis daily et0 which are commonly used by california s farmers as an indicator of daily crop water use to guide irrigation scheduling when there is no access to the monitored daily eta allen et al 1998 it s worth noting that these two young orchards were changing rapidly with respect to tree canopy size from 2017 to 2020 in 2017 they were in their second leaf second year and were smaller non bearing trees by 2020 they were larger nut bearing trees approaching that representative of a mature walnut orchard young trees grow rapidly and the kc and crop water use between young and mature walnut canopy can be substantially different from each other fulton et al 2014 thus the kc or etc for a young walnut canopy should be adjusted to account for this dynamic this adjustment may be based upon tree age or by estimating canopy shading using digital images or direct measurements of light interception with a ceptometer simplified methods for use by growers have been suggested by fulton et al 2020 at https www sacvalleyorchards com blog young orchards from the university of california agriculture natural resources in this study the kc and etc adjustments were made using the simpler age based approach which growers are more likely to employ due to ease of use the estimated time series daily eta values from two rs based et models tule ground based eta measurements and kc based cimis etc estimates were each compared from 2017 to 2020 at these two walnut orchards this operational protocol provided a way to evaluate the performance of rs based et models for estimating the daily et a s temporal variation when compared to the in situ surface renewal measurements and the more traditional kc eto approach we evaluated model performance at each validation orchard using different statistical goodness of fit measures including the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse readers are recommended to refer to legates and mccabe 1999 for detailed information about these and other goodness of fit measures typically used in hydrology model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimates to surface renewal measurements comparisons of the estimated daily eta from two rs based models with tule based et measurements are shown in fig 3 although we acknowledge there is measurement uncertainty with surface renewal method used by tule technology the extensively good validation record of surface renewal method and the successful application of tule sensors made its eta estimates a reasonable reference in this study fulton et al 2017 krintz et al 2016 montazar et al 2020 zaccaria et al 2017 xue et al 2020 among three goodness of fit indices rmse was considered as the most relevant index as the goal of model performance evaluation was to achieve high accuracy of daily eta estimations our model validation using daily eta measurements from tule surface renewal stations at two walnut orchards indicates that pysebal and sebs capture the spatial and temporal variation of daily eta reasonably well the performance of pysebal and sebs was good with reasonably low rmse ranging from 0 79 mm d to 1 05 mm d nse ranged from 0 79 to 0 88 and r2 from 0 874 to 0 885 throughout the simulation period may 4th of 2017 to october 16th 2020 for capex site may 6th 2017 to october 16th 2020 for kauffman site fig 4 shows the time series daily eta for the two walnut orchards from the interpolated estimations of pysebal and sebs tule measurements and cimis based etc estimations the continuous cimis based daily etc commonly used by california s walnut growers as the reference for irrigation scheduling fulton et al 1991 matched reasonably well with rs based eta estimations and tule based eta measurements for both sites in 2019 and 2020 fourth 4th year leaf and fifth fifth year leaf orchard as the trees approached maturity in terms of canopy size and light interception in contrast cimis based etc did not match well enough with rs and tule based eta during 2017 2018 second leaf to the third leaf period when tree size and canopy light interception were changing substantially this is attributed to the use of very simple age based empirical factors for converting kc from mature walnut trees to young walnut trees in this study with this approach ground based measurement data of fractional canopy cover is very limited it is also noteworthy that there is a more accurate method for adjusting kc based on canopy fraction recommended by fao and also suggested by fulton et al 2020 this method is more accurate than the simple age based approach because of light interception s being the most important factor influencing kc in orchards williams and ayars 2005 however because this fao method requires the assessment of canopy light interception as the trees grow to adjust kc and etc it is less likely to be adopted by growers available landsat based methods of estimating canopy fraction have been applied in expanding irrigation applications such as uc anr s cropmanage https cropmanage ucanr edu such easy to use applications enhance the grower s irrigation toolbox where available fractional light interception for young trees should be used to adjust kc during the early walnut season in april to may cimis based etc had much lower values than those provided by ground based eta measurements or rs based estimates although slight water stress in the early growing season helps with walnut root development water stress will slow the rate of shoot growth and increase the time years for an orchard to reach its full production potential in 2017 cimis based etc was significantly lower than rs and tule based eta for the kauffman site this partly reflects the fact that the empirical age based factors for young walnut orchards were developed previously in a non pruning walnut orchard system fulton 2021 it also reflects the integration of the relatively vigorously growing tulare variety higher soil water capacity and the central leader pruning practice used to simulate tree vigor in this orchard it may also indicate the rs and tule based methods more accurately account for the effects of ground cover between the tree rows the integration of eto from cimis with age based empirical walnut kc values provides a simple scientific method for reasonably estimating irrigation needs for young developing orchards which is certainly better than operating with no adjustment at all however rs and tule based eta provides viable alternatives to quantify eta for orchard specific settings including crop varieties soil properties date of sowing climatic conditions and cultural practices besides using one kc value to irrigate an entire walnut orchard is inefficient given spatial variability in kc and eta such management can result in low water use efficiency due to excessive irrigation application on some parts of the orchard and under irrigating others which can also cause a reduction in yield thus using rs based eta showed its potential to improve site specific irrigation management compared to the traditional cimis based etc method however adopting more accurate rs based eta estimations in practices depends on upgrading irrigation systems to provide enough control and flexibility to irrigate according to the spatio temporal variability in eta compared to the average value of tule based eta pysebal and sebs based eta estimates were 10 1 higher and 2 5 lower during the walnut s growth season april 1st to november 15th and were 3 1 and 3 2 higher during the dormant season november 15th to next year s march 31st for capex site for the kauffman site pysebal and sebs s estimates were 4 7 and 3 7 lower during the growing season and were 30 lower and 13 higher during the dormant season when compared to tule estimates overestimations of time series of daily eta from pysebal were detected during the walnut s growing season in fig 4 when compared to tule based eta which were likely caused by three potential error sources first the warmer cold wet pixels were selected within the well watered farmland on satellite overpass dates as originally assumed in sebal a cold anchor pixel is from a water body and a selection of cold pixels from well irrigated farmland will set a warmer temperature threshold for the cold limits and thus increase the le for all the pixels in the aoi the second reason is the assumption of ef s being constant over a daily eta estimation in pysebal on satellite overpass dates which can be acceptable as a reasonable assumption in humid regions with dry surface conditions rather than in well irrigated fields in arid and semi arid regions such as our study area reduced crop stomatal conductance in the often hot and dry conditions in the afternoon will cause a reduction of eta the advection of h existing in a well irrigated farmland in arid region will normally increase eta while severe horizontal advection from synoptic weather events or land land breezes originating from adjacent non irrigated fields could reduce the crop stomatal conductance and may result in a decrease of eta different crops may respond differently to the severity of advection zermeño gonzalez and hipps 1997 mkhwanazi et al 2015a b similar conclusions about the overestimation of et from sebal on well irrigated farmland in arid and semi arid regions and its sources of uncertainty have been reported in several publications long et al 2011 tasumi et al 2005 hoedjes et al 2008 stewart 1996 irmak et al 2012 the third uncertainty source may be the cloudy days that may have occurred between two cloud free eta maps which will result in higher linear interpolation values leading to overestimated daily eta values for any cloudy periods besides underestimations of pysebal or sebs based eta values were observed on the following satellite overpass dates 30 june 2017 23 july 2017 25 september 2017 03 july 2018 04 august 2018 20 june 2019 capex site 14 june 2017 30 june 2017 16 july 2017 25 september 2017 21 april 2018 24 june 2018 04 june 2019 22 july 2019 29 july 2019 07 august 2019 14 august 2019 23 august 2019 15 september 2019 24 september 2019 24 july 2020 31 july 2020 09 august 2020 26 september 2020 kauffman site during these days high wind speeds and warm air temperatures signal the existence of strong horizontal advection in the field de bruin et al 2005 brakke et al 1978 which could potentially increase the daily eta by significant margins however neither pysebal nor sebs consider the effect of advection in upscaling instantaneous eta to daily eta the wind speed as an input parameter in these two models based on instantaneous measurement at the satellite overpass time often increases in the afternoon due to enhanced vertical mixing and thus can bring an increase of advection which leads to an increase of daily eta in proportion to rn fig 5 the constant ef assumed in both pysebal and sebs will underestimate daily eta in that case which is often found in well irrigated farmland in arid and semi arid regions this result of underestimating eta due to possible advection in walnut fields is reported in many previous studies raziei and pereira 2013 liaqat et al 2015 patel et al 2006 some work has been conducted on the modification of pysebal and sebs to make them more accurate and suitable for eta estimation when advection occurs especially in irrigated farms in arid and semi arid regions pakparvar et al 2014 mkhwanazi et al 2015a another possibility of sebs s underestimation of daily eta during the walnut growth period in fig 4 b and c from june to july and in fig 4 f h from july to august could come from the use of an empirical algorithm used for calculating daily rn in the estimation of daily eta other researchers have reported similar findings on the uncertainty of sebs model sourced from the empirical equation of daily rn and the need to calibrate it in advance for better estimations of daily eta zhang et al 2013 timmermans et al 2013 during the dormant season fig 4 represents overestimations of time series eta from both pysebal and sebs at capex and kauffman sites which could be attributed to herbaceous vegetation cover growing between tree rows during this period pysebal and sebs are single source models suitable for homogeneous surfaces and have been shown to perform very well for full cover vegetation surfaces or completely closed canopies however orchard tree crops with sparse vegetation during the dormant season are expected to have lower surface roughness and h when compared to fully covered vegetation surfaces which could undermine the accuracy of etc estimates hatfield 1989 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 raupach 1994 there is some work worthy of mention here which specifically includes analyzing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of rs based et models under sparse cover conditions jamshidi et al 2019 huang and song 2012 barati et al 2011 wang et al 2020 meanwhile underestimations of daily eta from pysebal were also detected under rainy events especially in the winter and early spring fig 5 which was mostly due to its assumption of zero et for hot pixels as identification of extreme conditions in the image is necessary it is difficult to satisfy this assumption in the rainy season and a colder hot pixel could be selected in this case since the moisture status for the simulation area is homogeneous in the mixed images including the crops and natural environment teixeira 2010 wagle et al 2017a as winter rainfall is not sufficient to replenish deep soil moisture applying pre season irrigation during late january and early february is commonly adopted by walnut growers to avoid root rot diseases and to restore the deep soil moisture therefore the application and accuracy of irrigation events in the spring before the growing season cannot be overlooked goldhamer 1998 for growers who want to have a visual map of actual water use requirements over the entirety of their orchards rs based eta mapping provides an economic and labor saving alternative to the installation of multiple ground based in situ monitoring systems fig 6 represents the spatial variability of daily eta simulated from pysebal and sebs for the capex and kauffman sites and august 11th of 2018 was chosen as a representative satellite overpass date during the walnut growing season for eta mapping in general good agreements were observed between the two spatial patterns for the capex site eta had a higher value in the fine textured zone located in the north and southwest of the field but lower values in the southeastern sandy zone for the kauffman site its fine texture soil properties resulted in less spatial variation within the orchard but there were still slightly lower eta in the western zone than its eastern zone overall pysebal and sebs could both simulate time series daily eta with reasonable accuracy sebs performed better than pysebal on the time series daily eta estimations at capex but the performance was similar at the kauffman sites 3 2 remote sensing based crop coefficient maps from pysebal and sebs as presented and discussed in the section above time series of daily eta could be reproduced based on two remotely sensed et models using gap filling techniques between adjacent landsat images besides eta maps other products from the simulations are daily maps such as ndvi lai and kc in fig 7 comparisons of pixel based kc from kc maps on satellite overpass dates and the experimental kc values are presented during the walnut s growing season from april 1st to november 15th with young walnut orchards developing from the second leaf to the fifth leaf historical kc increased with tree age but by the fourth leaf stage kc is already the same as it is for mature walnut trees due to the limited available sky clear satellite images rs based kc are not available for every half month period in each year and kc values for the early and late stage april and november were collated from only a small amount of images the maximum of pysebal based kc reached 1 56 during late june this relatively high kc may be attributed to the irrigation event on the satellite overpass date at the kauffman site with a full coverage sprinkler system pysebal and sebs simulated higher kc values than the experimental kc in the early season from april to may later in the season from late september to early october experimental kc for third leaf and fourth leaf declined from 0 97 to 0 88 while rs based kc both showed greater decreases during these two periods when it comes to the walnut s postharvest period historical kc for the fourth leaf orchard declined greatly from 0 51 to 0 28 in early november while rs based kc values did not decline as much as historical kc fulton et al 2017 reported similar results about higher semi monthly kc of walnut measured from eddy covariance method in the northern sacramento valley than historical kc based on research conducted in the southern san joaquin valley during the early and late growth stages he emphasized that in the northern sacramento valley sample population 95 of semi monthly kc values varied greatly in a range of 0 57 1 06 from the canopy to canopy and from field to field during early november tasumi et al 2005 observed large ranges in kc for various field crops during early and late growth periods when the soil surfaces of the fields were nearly 100 barren and he suggested the necessities and advantages of applying rs based energy balance model to calculate kc and eta for individual fields especially for these periods and conditions kc within a walnut orchard can vary greatly from historical kc because of the different site specific weather soil texture variety rootstock pruning irrigation salinity fertility and other field management practices from the field conditions referred to in the literature to better understand the utility of kc maps in helping walnut growers fig 8 provides detailed information about kc mapping based on pysebal and sebs in this study and representative kc maps of each phenological stage during the year of 2018 and 2020 at the two sites even during the same phenological stage kc maps for the same orchard in different years can have very different values for instance at the capex orchard the minimum value of pysebal based kc on oct 3rd 2020 was 0 75 which is higher than the maximum kc values on oct 7th 2018 fig 8a considering this same color symbol in the legend to each sub figure is set with different value ranges to provide readers a more clear and distinct spatial distribution for each map the growing season of walnuts were divided into seven phenological stages including the bloom to leaf out stage stage 1 april 1st to 30th the shoot growth hull and shell sizing stage stage 2 may 1st to may 31st the shell hardening stage stage 3 june 1st to june 30th the nut filling stage stage 4 july 1st to september 15th the hull splitting stage stage 5 september 16th to october 7th the harvest stage stage 6 october 8th to 15th first crop was in 2019 lastly and the postharvest stage stage 7 october 16th to november 15th fig 8 pysebal and sebs based kc maps for same date and site showed a similar spatial distribution overall sebs based kc were relatively lower than pysebal based kc which is consistent with the comparison results of daily eta from these two rs based models within the same phenological stage simulated kc from rs based models showed great differences over time and space 56 sub figures provided an intuitive sense of kc varying greatly from capex site to kauffman and spatial heterogeneity of kc even within the same orchard for instance pixel based kc had a maximum of 0 79 in the kauffman site and a minimum of 0 76 in the capex site on june 24th of 2018 most of the northern half of orchard at capex during stage 2 had higher kc above 1 2 while the southern half of field mostly had a lower kc range from 0 9 to 1 1 in the same growth stage kc values for the north and south half of the kauffman site were in a range of 0 6 0 71 and 0 82 0 94 respectively as mentioned above large variations in kc for different walnut orchards can be caused by many factors such as weather soil irrigation method walnut variety and canopy structure as mentioned before differences in kc within an orchard could also be attributed to variations in distances from the edge or local variations in the soil horizon results indicate a need to apply site specific irrigation scheduling in walnut during each phenological stage based on their actual water requirement and canopy status in each orchard instead of taking the conventional cimis eto kc based etc as crop water use for the whole orchard additionally great variations in kc maps on two similar satellite overpass dates in 2018 and 2020 were detected throughout the growing season which also revealed the weakness of applying the traditional kc to guide irrigation management rs based et models could be a useful tool for mapping kc and eta for individual orchards which is helpful for making site specific irrigation management decisions the ability to capture spatiotemporal variations of eta and kc as well as the low cost advantages provided could definitely make rs based et models a promising tool in smart agriculture however it worth noting that applying rs based eta in irrigation scheduling requires an advanced irrigation system providing enough control and flexibility to irrigate based on the spatio temporal variability e g zone irrigation systems reported in kisekka et al 2021 4 conclusions in this study two single source remote sensing based energy balance models pysebal and sebs for estimating evapotranspiration et were evaluated against in situ eta measurements from surface renewal in two walnut orchards in california s sacramento valley results showed good agreement between rs based eta and ground measurements of eta from surface renewal for walnuts there were underestimations from both pysebal and sebs under advection conditions overestimations of time series daily eta from pysebal were observed and could be attributed to three potential error sources first the warmer cold wet pixels selection second the inherent assumption of constant ef for a daily eta estimation and third the possibility of cloudy days existing between two cloud free eta images overestimated eta amounts from pysebal and sebs were apparent during the dormant early season and postharvest periods besides pysebal underestimated eta when there were rainy events due to selecting colder hot dry pixels on the whole sebs provided better simulations of time series daily eta against ground based measurements during the walnut s growing and dormant seasons at capex with better goodness of fit results r2 improved from 0 87 to 0 88 and rmse from 0 79 to 0 88 mm the performance of the models at the kaufman site was similar further research should investigate ways to improve the performance of rs models for estimating daily eta e under advection and sparse vegetation conditions based on similar spatial patterns from pysebal and sebs based simulations rs based eta and kc mapping at different phenological stages could also provide growers an overview of spatial variability of water use and development of advanced water delivery techniques in their orchards compared to the traditional walnut crop water use estimation based on cimis and historical kc rs based eta and kc matches better with the crop s actual water use requirements which reveals further the necessity of rs based models to be popularized and applied in walnut orchards the latter point is especially true for young walnut orchards for their rapid development in the first one to five years our study detailed the rs based kc mapping and showed the possibility of kc varying with time between orchards and within the same orchard in conclusion the results of this study can be used by growers researchers and policymakers for estimating daily eta kc and improve site specific irrigation management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9956,the mismatching of grain production and consumption in space causes grain virtual water flow previous studies focused on the important role of virtual water trade in regional food security and its impact on water resource consumption while this study focuses on the impact of virtual water flow on the environment in this paper two indexes of gray water footprint and carbon footprint were selected by footprint evaluation method to study the influence of virtual water flow on regional environment the results show that the scale of grain virtual water flow gradually expanded and the amount of virtual water flow increased from 67 14 gm³ to 129 87 gm³ from 1997 to 2014 the gray water footprint at a national scale showed a fluctuating trend with obvious differences in temporal and spatial distribution in addition the total carbon footprint at the national scale increased from 290 2 mton in 1997 430 4 mton in 2014 basically showing a continuous increase trend provinces with larger gray water footprints are basically converted into import areas and the total national gray water footprint reduced 64 74 gm3 meanwhile the carbon footprint of the grain export region and import region changed significantly among the export areas such as the northeast region and the huang huai hai region the carbon footprint had an obvious downward trend on the other hand the carbon footprint of the import region in the south due to increasing of grain production to meet their own needs showed an increasing trend although virtual water flow reduced the gray water footprint and carbon footprint nationally it increased the local environmental pressure on the export area this study would be helpful in forming better water management policy and alleviating regional environment pressure keywords grain virtual water flow environment impact gray water footprint carbon footprint china 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country with a large population and faces important challenges such as water scarcity food security and environmental pollution however all agricultural production processes rely on water resources which will cause serious environmental problems food security is a dynamic multidimensional concept moragues faus et al 2017 namany et al 2020 ensuring food security includes both the supply part and the effective demand part konar et al 2011 rosa et al 2020 nowadays food trade plays an important role in ensuring food security in the middle east africa and other food deficit regions meissner et al 2002 antonelli et al 2017 ashraf et al 2020 along with the trade of grain between regions the flow of virtual water between regions is produced since 2002 the concept of virtual water has received extensive attention around the world and a growing number of virtual water trade studies have been conducted guan et al 2007 dalin et al 2012 carr et al 2013 han et al 2018 liu et al 2019 previous studies focused on the important role of virtual water trade on regional food security and its impact on water production efficiency for example if virtual water flow from an area with high water production efficiency to an area with low water production efficiency then the virtual water trade would have a water saving effect d odorico et al 2014 martinez melendez and bennett 2016 brindha 2017 chapagain et al 2006 estimated that virtual water trade has saved 352 km3 yr 1 in the importing countries by imported agricultural production moreover the impact of virtual water trade on countries with different economic development varies greatly and it has a greater effect on alleviating water pressure on wealthy importing countries while it has less impact on poor countries distefano and kelly 2017 huang et al 2011 showed that through food imports countries can overcome resource constraints and compensate for the temporary reduction in food supply sun et al 2016 assessed the impact of virtual water embodied in grain transfer on condition of regional water resources in mainland china and the results showed that virtual water flow changed the water distribution and had a significant effect on water resources in both import and export regions zhai et al 2019 developed a virtual water food nexus model and quantified the inter provincial transfer of water accompanied by food and identified the complicated interactions between different provinces in china however what has attracted people s attention is that virtual water trade may bring other neglected but important impacts sartori and schiavo 2015 concluded that the global virtual water trade was becoming more frequent but not necessarily stable dell angelo et al 2018 pointed out that the understanding of virtual water trade by water politics may overlook some hidden but important social consequences due to limited water resources uneven distribution and excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides china is faced with increasing water pressure and serious agricultural pollution zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 guo et al 2010 cao et al 2020 gray water footprint and carbon emissions are important indicators that characterize the impact of grain production on the environment yan et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 sun et al 2019 as the population and regional economic development gap widen the amount of grain transportation among regions has also increased in china resulting in grain virtual water flow gao et al 2020 with the expansion of grain trade the intensity of virtual water flow gradually increases while redistributing water resources and influencing the environment by grain production process d odorico et al 2019 sun et al 2018 therefore it is necessary and meaningful to analyze the impact of grain virtual water flow on the environment through the carbon footprint and gray water footprint agricultural production is a water intensive process accompanied by environmental pollution water resources and agricultural pollution pose appreciable challenge to grain security wan et al 2016 deng et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 compared with traditional engineering measures virtual water provides a new perspective to solve the current water resources problems in the process of agricultural production and consumption liu et al 2018 qian et al 2018 d odorico et al 2019 following the development of the concept of virtual water another important term water footprint was proposed in the early 2000s hoekstra 2003 water footprint is divided into three categories blue water footprint green water footprint and gray water footprint hoekstra et al 2011 blue water refers to surface water and groundwater which is used in agricultural irrigation green water refers to soil moisture stored in unsaturated zone which is mainly used in rain fed production savenije 2000 hoekstra et al 2011 yang et al 2013 obviously the division of blue and green water emphasize the different characteristics of the two components according to hoekstra et al 2011 gray water footprint is different from green and blue water footprint gray water footprint presents water requirements for diluting pollutants into water bodies to meet acceptable water quality standards which is mainly used to indicate the intensity of water pollution of the production process hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 another important environmental assessment indicator similar to this is carbon footprint carbon footprint has been widely regarded as a way that address the potential impact on environment by assessing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions wiedmann and minx 2008 yan et al 2015 chen et al 2021 valipour et al 2021 found greenhouse gas emissions are one of the main factors contributing to global warming some studies focus on the impact of virtual water transfer on the regional ecological environment dalin and rodríguez iturbe 2016 dalin et al 2017 liu et al 2018 for example liu et al 2018 indicated that the global food trade can save a lot of water resources and the use of nitrogen fertilizer and also greatly reduce the loss of nitrogen dalin and rodríguez iturbe 2016 reported food trade can either decrease or increase the overall impact of agriculture on the environment which is depending on whether the impact is greater in the export region dalin et al 2017 presented that about 11 of the non renewable groundwater that use for irrigation was transferred in current international food trade some countries produce and import food from rapidly depleted aquifers which highlights the risks of global food and water security oita et al 2016 calculated the nitrogen footprints for 188 countries and the results showed that china india the united states and brazil bore 46 of global emissions approximately a quarter of the global nitrogen footprint comes from commodities traded across borders their conclusion is that the demand of consumers in other regions has driven substantial local nitrogen pollution in summary although there have been some studies on the environmental impact of virtual water trade there are few reports on comprehensively quantifying the gray water footprint and carbon emissions of virtual water trade previous studies mostly focused on the impact of the grain production process on the environment based on the concept of virtual water this study selects two environmental analysis indicators gray water footprint and carbon footprint and puts forward a comprehensive environmental assessment perspective which can reflect the regional environment from both the process of grain production and consumption this study discusses the impact of current grain virtual water flow pattern on the redistribution of gray water footprint and carbon footprint between export and import regions and clarifies the different environmental effects of virtual water flow by the regional and national scales at last this study analyzes the driving factors of the difference in environmental effects caused by grain virtual water flow which would help to form better water resources management policies and alleviate regional environmental pressures 2 materials and methods 2 1 target area the study area of this study is mainland china located in eastern asia fig 1 according to data of the meteorological dataset during 1997 2015 the average annual temperature in china was about 11 2 c the lowest is about 8 6 c and the highest is about 12 1 c in north china and south china respectively and the annual average precipitation is 642 mm the lowest is about 179 mm and the highest is about 2075 mm in xinjiang and jiangxi in 2015 respectively cmdc 1997 2015 2 2 grain type selection and data resources based on grain planting structure and consumption habits the three most important cereal crop types in china are maize wheat and rice the study focuses on these three grains which are representing 32 of the total area of the country and 66 4 of its arable lands based on the mean values during 1998 2015 annual crop yield data for wheat rice and maize were obtained from the database of the national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 1998 2015 provincial and national grain yield are available annually together with the total grain sown area and the production of the main crops nbsc 1998 2015 due to the differences in regional geographic spatial distribution and climatic conditions the main crop planting structure and crop growth period differ significantly the agricultural water use data was obtained from the china water resources bulletin cwrb 1998 2015 the input of production factors is an important source of environmental pollution the data on the input of production factors in this paper mainly include fertilizers pesticides and plastic films were mainly from the china rural statistical yearbook crsy 1998 2015 and the china environmental statistics yearbook cesy 1998 2015 2 3 methods 1 calculation of virtual water according to the china statistical yearbook and white paper on food security in china china has basically achieved self sufficiency in grains with a self sufficiency rate of over 95 which has laid a solid material foundation for ensuring national food security promoting economic and social development and long term national stability yang 2019 sun et al 2019 csy 1997 2015 therefore this study did not consider the international grain trade and only calculated the grain transfer between provinces within china the difference in grain production and grain demand between provinces is the main driving force for inter regional grain trade the per capita possession of grain is a relatively fair method of grain distribution the first step in the calculation of grain virtual water flow is to divide each identity into export area and import area based on the social equity law this study uses the national per capita share of grain as the benchmark for personal grain consumption the difference between regional per capita share of grain and national per capita share of grain is used to define regional trade characteristics if the regional per capita share of grain is higher than the national it means that the regional grain production is higher than the demand so it is defined as an export area conversely if national per capita share of grain is lower than that of the nation it means that the grain production in the region cannot meet the grain demand which is defined as an import area after determining the export area and the import area it is necessary to further determine the route and quantity of grain transportation between provinces the adjacent areas generally have similar climatic conditions grain planting structure and eating habits meanwhile it would produce less transportation costs based on this rule of grain transfer therefore according to the similar characteristics of geographical location natural conditions and agricultural production this research divides 31 provincial level administrative areas into 8 regions as the primary unit of grain virtual water flow table 1 the export area in each region firstly meets the import area inside the region and when there is a surplus it will be transferred to the import area in the adjacent region based on the calculation results it is found that the export area and the import area are in a state of aggregation which basically conforms to the transportation path of this mode after determining the transportation route it is necessary to further calculate the transportation volume of each provincial administrative area and all of them are allocated in accordance with the social equity method that is the method of distribution of grain in the export area to the import area in an equal proportion if a region contains four provincial level administrative areas of which there is only one export region there will be two situations when the surplus of grain in the export province is greater than the deficit of the other three provinces it will be transferred directly according to the deficit while the grain surplus in the export area is less than the deficit in the other three provinces the proportion of the grain shortage in the remaining three import areas needs to be calculated first and then the grain of export area is transferred to the three import areas according to this ratio sun et al 2019 2 gray water footprint and carbon footprint of grain production this study selects gray water footprint and carbon footprint as indicators to evaluate the impact of grain production patterns and virtual water flow on the regional environment the gray water footprint is calculated according to hoekstra et al 2011 which is as follows 1 w f g i α a r i c n max c n n a t where w f g i is the gray water footprint in region i ar i is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied per unit area kg ha α is the leaching rate which is generally 10 c n max is the maximum allowable nitrogen concentration 10 mg l and c n n a t is the natural background nitrogen concentration hoekstra et al 2011 the carbon footprint cf t co2 was calculated by summarizing all the individual greenhouse gas emissions from different sources mainly including direct emissions and indirect emissions the carbon footprint is calculated as follows 2 c f c f m c f n 2 o c f c h 4 where c f m is the sum of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the agricultural input in t co2 c f n 2 o represents the direct n2o emissions by the application of n fertilizer in t co2 c f c h 4 is the ch4 emissions from rice planting in a single season in t co2 3 c f m i i e f i where i is the type of agricultural source or input i i is the amount of the ith agricultural source or input fertilizer in t plastic film and pesticide in t diesel oil in l or electricity in kw h ef i is the greenhouse gas emission factor of the ith source or input per unit volume or mass in t co2 4 c f n 2 o i n e f n 2 o 44 28 298 where i n is amount of n fertilizer applied in a single crop season t e f n 2 o is the default emission factor of n 2 o emission by applied n fertilizer t n2o n t 1 n fertilizer 44 28 is the molecular conversion factor of n2 to n2o 298 is the relative molecular potential of warming forcing in a 100 year horizon ipcc 2007 5 c f c h 4 e f d t r a 25 where ef d is an emission factor by daily which is in t ch 4 ha 1 day 1 t r is the growing period of rice a is the cultivated area ha and 25 is the relative molecular warming forcing of ch 4 in a 100 year horizon ipcc 2007 and ef d is calculated by the following equation 6 e f d e f c s f w s f p s f m s f s r where e f c is the reference line emission factor for paddy field without organic amendments s f w and s f p are scale factors that explain the difference in water regime during rice growth period and before transplanting respectively s f m a scaling factor to present the differences in type and quantity of organic amendment used for rice production and s f s r is a scaling factor for soil type rice cultivar and so on 3 analysis of the impact on environmental by virtual water flow the climatic conditions geographical location and living habits among the regions will cause significant differences in irrigation fertilizers and pesticides and so on these production input factors are necessary conditions for the production of grain and are also the main source of agricultural pollution therefore the virtual water flow has caused the redistribution of gray water footprint and carbon footprint to some extent this study explores the impact of grain virtual water flow on the environment through the process of grain production and consumption fig 2 in addition to analyzing the carbon footprint and gray water footprint generated by the grain production process in 31 provinces in mainland china this study also assessed the impact of the grain virtual water flow on the export area and the overall gray water footprint and carbon footprint of the country the impact on the export area is mainly manifested in that the export area needs to produce more grain to meet the needs of other import areas except meeting its own grain consumption the additional grain production would increase the environmental pressure of the export area therefore this study quantifies the environmental pressure of the grain production for trade in the export area meanwhile due to the difference between the gray water footprint per unit of grain production and the carbon footprint per unit of grain production in different regions the virtual water flow between the regions would have an overall impact on the gross gray water footprint and the total carbon footprint therefore this study also quantifies the impact of the current virtual water flow on the overall gray water footprint and carbon footprint of the country 3 results 3 1 the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of grain virtual water flow gray water footprint and carbon footprint during the study period the scale of china s grain virtual water flow gradually expanded and the amount of virtual water flow increased from 67 14 gm3 to 129 87 gm3 the import region and export region have undergone a great transformation during the study period for example jiangsu has become an import region in 2014 which was an important grain producing area in 1997 the main grain virtual water export provinces are distributed in north china and northeast china the export of grain virtual water in these areas is also gradually increasing the main grain virtual water import provinces are gradually shifting to the beijing tianjin hebei region and the southeast coastal region fig 3 this study selects gray water footprint as the first indicator to analyze the impact of virtual water flow on the environment the results indicated that the gray water footprint at a national scale showed a fluctuating trend from 1997 to 2014 with obvious differences in temporal and spatial distribution fig 4 in terms of areas with increased gray water footprint inner mongolia henan and heilongjiang have the most obvious increasing trends their gray water footprints increased by 1722 7 mm³ 1636 4 mm³ and 1616 2 mm³ from 1997 to 2014 respectively meanwhile henan was the province with the largest gray water footprint in 2014 7888 3 mm³ regarding the areas with reduced gray water footprint beijing shanghai and zhejiang have the most evident reducing trends with the decreasing rate of 66 3 63 7 and 46 5 respectively they are typical grain import areas and with less gray water footprint during the study period on the contrary shandong and jiangsu are provinces with larger gray water footprints and a decreasing trend among them shandong decreased from 6516 8 mm³ in 1997 4787 3 mm³ in 2014 and jiangsu decreased from 6572 7 mm³ to 5278 6 mm³ the difference is that shandong is an export area where the export ratio is gradually increasing while jiangsu is an area where the export ratio is gradually reducing and converted to an import area this study uses carbon footprint as another indicator for analyzing the impact of virtual water flow on the environment the results show that the total carbon footprint at the national scale increased from 290 2 mton in 1997 430 4 mton in 2014 basically showing a continuous increase trend fig 5 except for beijing shanghai and zhejiang the carbon footprint of other regions showed different increasing trends provinces with larger carbon footprint are similar to those with larger gray water footprint mainly including henan shandong hebei anhui jiangsu sichuan and heilongjiang henan is the province with the largest increase in carbon footprint from 20 8 mton in 1997 36 5 mton in 2014 gradually becoming the province with the largest total carbon footprint and gray water footprint inner mongolia and xinjiang are the provinces with the fastest increasing rate in carbon footprint with an average increasing rate of about 174 in 2014 compared to 1997 3 2 influence of virtual water flow on gray water footprint compared with the grain import area the export area undertook more grain production therefore this study mainly analyzes the changes in the gray water footprint of the trade part in the export area the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part generally showed a decreasing trend from 1997 to 2003 and a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 5378 9 mm³ in 2003 10784 4 mm³ in 2014 fig 6 from the perspective of differences in spatial distribution the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part of inner mongolia jilin heilongjiang henan and anhui accounted for a relatively large proportion and showed a clear increasing trend meanwhile these provinces were important grain virtual water export areas during the study period among them the overall gray water footprint of heilongjiang was less than henan shandong and other regions but the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part was larger than that of other export areas increasing from 1177 6 mm³ in 1997 2845 2 mm³ in 2014 henan was one of the provinces with the largest increasing of the gray water footprint of the virtual water export increasing from 257 8 mm³ in 1997 2143 1 mm³ in 2014 the gray water footprint of henan s virtual water export part in 2014 was second only to heilongjiang inner mongolia was also a province where the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part increased obviously from 578 7 mm³ in 1997 2040 3 mm³ in 2014 the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part in some export areas showed a decreasing trend such as jiangsu and shandong jiangsu was the province with the largest gray water footprint of the virtual water export part in 1997 with 1246 8 mm³ and it showed a decreasing trend year by year reducing to 19 5 mm³ in 2010 and then converted to an import area after 2011 3 3 influence of virtual water flow on carbon footprint similar to the gray water footprint this study mainly analyzes the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in the export area the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in the export area fluctuated in general from 1997 to 2003 and showed a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 23 6 mton in 2003 52 9 mton in 2014 and the proportion increased from 7 66 to 13 11 respectively fig 7 from the perspective of differences in spatial distribution the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in inner mongolia jilin heilongjiang and henan were relatively large and basically showed a trend of increasing year by year although heilongjiang s gross carbon footprint was not the largest it always was the province with the largest carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part among the export regions accounting for 6 75 26 64 of the total carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part from 1997 to 2014 henan s total carbon footprint was relatively high at the beginning of the study its contribution to the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part was not significant about 3 46 with the expansion of the scale of its grain production and the extent of virtual water export henan s carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part gradually increased in 2014 henan became one of the main contributors to carbon footprint of virtual water flow part with carbon footprint of 9 9 mton accounting for 18 74 jiangsu served as an export area from 1997 to 2010 and changed from an export area to an import area in 2011 2014 with the decrease of its grain export the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in jiangsu also showed a gradually decreasing trend from 4 3 mton in 1997 accounting for 71 to 0 08 mton in 2010 accounting for 0 17 the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in xinjiang showed a relatively obvious increasing trend from 1 1 mton accounting for 4 28 in 1997 4 9 mton accounting 9 26 in 2014 4 discussion 4 1 impact of virtual water flow on gray water footprint at a national scale the research results show that virtual water trade increases the gray water footprint and carbon footprint of grain export areas in addition the gray water footprint and carbon footprint of the export part showed a clear increasing trend and a large difference in spatial distribution in order to explore the impact of virtual water flow on the country s overall gray water footprint and carbon footprint and its driving factors this study discusses the differences in gray water footprint per unit of grain production and carbon footprint per unit of grain production between regions and further explores the reasons for the differences the country s gray water footprint per unit of grain production basically showed a decreasing trend from 0 15 m³ kg in 1997 0 11 m³ kg in 2014 fig 8 different from the spatial distribution of gross gray water footprint the gray water footprint per unit of grain production in most grain export areas showed a decreasing trend such as heilongjiang henan hebei and shandong the provinces with increasing gray water footprint per unit of grain production were zhejiang guangdong hainan and yunnan all of which were typical grain import areas shaanxi beijing and tianjin had larger gray water footprint per unit of grain production while heilongjiang jiangxi and qinghai had smaller gray water footprint per unit of grain production the differences in grain production structure and climatic conditions among different regions affect the ability of regional grain production take northeast region as an example for analysis as the most important grain production base in china the northeast region has relatively fertile soil which has certain advantages in grain production compared with other provinces the amount of fertilizer applied during grain production process is smaller the gray water footprint per unit grain production in northeast region is also smaller and with the development of agricultural technology gray water footprint in northeast region is still showing a trend of decreasing the reason for the large gray water footprint in northeast region is mainly due to the grain export heilongjiang has the lowest gray water footprint per unit of grain production with only 0 067 m³ kg the grain production and grain export were the highest during the study period but the nitrogen fertilizer per unit of grain production was only 0 015 m3 kg which was the smallest in the country therefore the smaller gray water footprint per unit of grain production in northeast region is mainly due to its own grain production advantages assuming the grain production and consumption in each region were balanced and self sufficient and there is no grain trade between regions the scale of grain production in the grain import area would be appropriately reduced on the contrary the scale of grain production in the grain export area would be expanded the analysis results show that the gray water footprint per unit of grain production in most grain export areas are lower than that in grain import areas if the import area expanded grain production it would produce more gray water footprint than that currently therefore the current virtual water flow pattern is more beneficial to the water environment at the national scale although the current grain virtual water flow brought a certain pressure to the environment of the export areas it would have different effects when analyzed nationwide in order to quantitatively analyze the impact of virtual water flow on the regional gray water footprint taking 2014 as an example the current virtual water flow reduced the overall gray water footprint with 8 53 gm³ fig 9 the gray water footprint per unit of grain production in most of the export areas were relatively small thereby all the export areas showed the potential to reduce the overall gray water footprint in 2014 while the grain export of heilongjiang was the largest the gray water footprint per unit of grain production was the lowest so it contributed greatly to the overall water environment of the country accounting for 53 46 of the overall reduction in the country the gray water footprint reduction potential of heilongjiang s virtual water export to guangdong beijing and zhejiang was 1 68 gm³ 0 67 gm³ and 0 65 gm³ respectively the potential to reduce gray water footprint from jilin to guangdong beijing and zhejiang was 0 72 gm³ 0 30 gm³ and 0 28 gm³ respectively meanwhile the virtual water flow between some regions would increase gray water footprint for example the potential of increasing gray water footprint from henan and inner mongolia to shanghai by virtual water export were 0 06 gm³ and 0 04 gm³ respectively most of the grain export areas are concentrated in the water scarce northern regions driven by the grain trade the grain production process in the northern areas produced more gray water footprint the results of the study show that the gray water footprint of the grain export area due to the export of grain was 6 60 gm³ accounting for 9 04 of the total gray water footprint in 1997 with the continuous expansion of the grain trade pattern the gray water footprint due to grain export increased to 10 78 gm³ in 2014 accounting for 14 73 of the total gray water footprint that year the impact on the export area is mainly manifested in the increased application of chemical fertilizers which brings a certain environmental pressure meanwhile the grain export area needs more water resources to dilute the pollution caused by the gray water footprint and make it meet the environmental standards on the other hand the increasing of gray water footprint may have impact on the water quality of grain export areas and increase the pressure on water use in conclusion the current virtual water flow is generally friendly to the gray water footprint regardless of the internal environmental pressure in the export area 4 2 impact of virtual water flow on carbon footprint at a national scale with the input of agricultural production materials the carbon footprint per unit area in 2014 showed a certain increase compared with 1997 the carbon footprint per unit area of most import areas increased more such as the carbon footprint of hainan increased by 216 7 carbon footprint of beijing increased by 114 6 although the carbon footprint per unit area of the export area also showed an increasing trend its increasing rate was slower compared with the import area for example shandong s carbon footprint increased by 27 5 and heilongjiang s carbon footprint increased by 30 1 in order to explore the impact of grain virtual water flow on carbon footprint at the national and regional scale this study analyzed the carbon footprint per unit of grain production among each region the results show that there was a significant spatial distribution difference between the carbon footprint per unit production and the total carbon footprint among regions the national carbon footprint per unit grain production showed a fluctuating trend during the study period basically maintaining between 0 58 and 0 72 kgce kg fig 10 the carbon footprint per unit of grain production in about half of the provinces showed an increasing trend while the remaining provinces showed a fluctuating trend the results show that hainan fujian and shanghai had the largest carbon footprint per unit of grain production the carbon footprint per unit grain production of hainan zhejiang fujian and guangdong increased significantly during the study period and these provinces are all typical grain import regions on the contrast the carbon footprint per unit of grain production in inner mongolia heilongjiang and tibet were relatively smaller among them inner mongolia and heilongjiang were the main grain export areas from this perspective virtual water basically transferred from areas with smaller carbon footprint per unit grain production to areas with a larger carbon footprint per unit grain production which is beneficial to the environment as a whole due to differences in the carbon footprint per unit of grain production among provinces the virtual water flow would have an impact on overall carbon footprint taking 2014 as an example due to the virtual water flow among regions china s total carbon footprint showed an environmentally friendly pattern and the total amount of reducing carbon footprint was 20 27 gton fig 11 among the export areas heilongjiang inner mongolia jilin jiangxi hebei shandong and xinjiang had the potential to reduce the overall carbon footprint by virtual water flow the remaining 4 export areas caused an increasing in carbon footprint when performing virtual water export as the largest virtual water export area heilongjiang had a relatively small carbon footprint per unit of grain production when the grain was transferred to relevant provinces it played a very important role in reducing china s overall carbon footprint and the potential of reducing carbon footprint was 19 63 gton accounting for 96 83 of the gross carbon footprint reduction the carbon footprint reduction potential of heilongjiang s virtual water export to beijing zhejiang shanghai and tianjin was 3 60 gton 2 25 gton 1 96 gton and 1 05 gton in 2014 respectively the potential to reduce carbon footprint in inner mongolia was second with 5 04 gton the obvious difference in carbon footprint reduction between the two provinces was determined by the carbon footprint per unit of grain production and the amount of grain export henan and anhui had larger carbon footprint per unit of grain production while exporting virtual water which caused an increase in the overall carbon footprint among them the potential of increasing carbon footprint of henan and anhui by virtual water export were 4 5 gton and 3 15 gton respectively for example the carbon footprint increasing potential of henan s virtual water export to zhejiang was 1 00gton while the potential of anhui s virtual water export to zhejiang was 0 63 gton 4 3 the control measures of virtual water flow between regions according to the concept of gray water footprint it is the amount of fresh water required to assimilate pollutants to meet specific water quality standards therefore there are certain requirements on the amount of available water resources that can be used in the region after meeting current consumption and production needs especially in the export area by analyzing the ratio of regional gray water footprint to the remaining available water resources regional available water resources minus total water consumption it could be found that the water environment problems in jiangsu henan and hebei were relatively prominent as far as henan is concerned with the continuous increasing rate of grain export the gray water footprint of henan also showed a clear increasing trend and its ratio of regional gray water footprint to the remaining available water resources showed a significant decline for example the ratio of the gray water footprint to its remaining available water resources was 19 5 in 1997 and its gray water footprint was 1 06 times than the remaining available water resources in 2014 indicating that the gray water footprint of this area was already larger than the local surplus available water resources there was no surplus water resources to dilute the pollution generated during the production process of grain to meet regional environmental standards meanwhile it also showed that as the main grain virtual water export area the virtual water flow increased the pressure on the regional water environment the main grain producing area is the main body of china agricultural production especially of grain producing fertilization is one of the methods that must be invested in the process of crop growth to increase production and it is also the main factor causing regional non point source pollution and greenhouse gas emissions studies have shown that agricultural fertilization is the main source of total phosphorus and total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen the total phosphorus emissions total nitrogen emissions and ammonia nitrogen emissions in the main grain production areas are higher than those of the other two types of areas fig 12 meanwhile most of the main grain production areas are the main virtual water output areas after meeting the grain consumption needs of the local the export regions have undertaken the task of satisfying other areas the spatial distribution of wastewater discharge in most areas is similar to that of total nitrogen total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen the proportion of grain sown area to total sown area basically showed an increasing trend from 54 97 in 1995 to 60 14 in 2015 the proportion of wheat and rice both showed a decreasing trend while rice decreased from 20 51 to 18 45 and wheat decreased from 19 26 to 14 74 fig 13a therefore the increasing of the grain sown area was mainly due to the substantial increase of maize which was increasing from 15 2 in 1997 to 26 95 in 2015 due to differences in regional climatic conditions geographic locations and physiological characteristics of grains the spatial distribution of grain cultivation differs significantly among different provinces fig 13b rice is mainly growing in the south region and northeast region on the time scale the rice planting area in the northeast region showed an increasing trend in 2015 compared to 1997 while the rice planting area in the main import areas such as guangdong and zhejiang showed a tendency to shrink wheat is mainly cultivated in the central region and the huang huai hai region and the wheat planting area in the northeast region has seriously declined maize is mainly distributed in the northeast central and southwest regions and the sown area as a whole shows an increasing trend the main environmental costs of agricultural production are associated with soil and water pollution from pesticide applications and fertilizer overuse as well as groundwater depletion land use change the differences in farming methods between different crops and the demand for fertilizers and pesticides are the main factors that have different environmental impacts grain virtual water flow presents a pattern that is beneficial to the environment on the whole but it increases environmental pressure in local areas therefore in order to reduce the pressure on the virtual water export area the crop planting structure can be adjusted nationally and the planting area of crops with less environmental impact in the export area can be increased to reduce the environmental pressure meanwhile the dietary structure can be changed on the consumer side and the virtual water flow can be combined with the market economy to jointly protect the environment 5 conclusion during the study period the scale of china s grain virtual water flow gradually expanded and the amount of virtual water flow increased from 67 14 gm³ to 129 87 gm³ the gray water footprint at a national scale showed a fluctuating trend with obvious differences in temporal and spatial distribution in addition the total carbon footprint at the national scale increased from 290 2 mton in 1997 430 4 mton in 2014 basically showing a continuous increase trend the import region and export region have undergone a great transformation during the study period the main grain virtual water export provinces are distributed in north china and northeast china the main grain virtual water import provinces are gradually shifting to the beijing tianjin hebei region and the southeast coastal region the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part generally showed a decreasing trend from 1997 to 2003 and a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 5378 9mm³ in 2003 10784 4 mm³ in 2014 the gray water footprint of most of the main grain producing regions showed a clear increasing trend provinces with larger gray water footprints are basically converted into import areas and the total national gray water footprint reduced to 64 74 gm³ under current grain virtual water flow the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in the export area fluctuated in general from 1997 to 2003 and showed a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 23 6 mton in 2003 52 9 mton in 2014 and the proportion increased from 7 66 to 13 11 among the export areas such as the northeast region and the huang huai hai region the carbon footprint has an obvious downward trend meanwhile the carbon footprint of the import region in the south due to increasing of grain production to meet their own needs is showing an increasing trend

9956,the mismatching of grain production and consumption in space causes grain virtual water flow previous studies focused on the important role of virtual water trade in regional food security and its impact on water resource consumption while this study focuses on the impact of virtual water flow on the environment in this paper two indexes of gray water footprint and carbon footprint were selected by footprint evaluation method to study the influence of virtual water flow on regional environment the results show that the scale of grain virtual water flow gradually expanded and the amount of virtual water flow increased from 67 14 gm³ to 129 87 gm³ from 1997 to 2014 the gray water footprint at a national scale showed a fluctuating trend with obvious differences in temporal and spatial distribution in addition the total carbon footprint at the national scale increased from 290 2 mton in 1997 430 4 mton in 2014 basically showing a continuous increase trend provinces with larger gray water footprints are basically converted into import areas and the total national gray water footprint reduced 64 74 gm3 meanwhile the carbon footprint of the grain export region and import region changed significantly among the export areas such as the northeast region and the huang huai hai region the carbon footprint had an obvious downward trend on the other hand the carbon footprint of the import region in the south due to increasing of grain production to meet their own needs showed an increasing trend although virtual water flow reduced the gray water footprint and carbon footprint nationally it increased the local environmental pressure on the export area this study would be helpful in forming better water management policy and alleviating regional environment pressure keywords grain virtual water flow environment impact gray water footprint carbon footprint china 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country with a large population and faces important challenges such as water scarcity food security and environmental pollution however all agricultural production processes rely on water resources which will cause serious environmental problems food security is a dynamic multidimensional concept moragues faus et al 2017 namany et al 2020 ensuring food security includes both the supply part and the effective demand part konar et al 2011 rosa et al 2020 nowadays food trade plays an important role in ensuring food security in the middle east africa and other food deficit regions meissner et al 2002 antonelli et al 2017 ashraf et al 2020 along with the trade of grain between regions the flow of virtual water between regions is produced since 2002 the concept of virtual water has received extensive attention around the world and a growing number of virtual water trade studies have been conducted guan et al 2007 dalin et al 2012 carr et al 2013 han et al 2018 liu et al 2019 previous studies focused on the important role of virtual water trade on regional food security and its impact on water production efficiency for example if virtual water flow from an area with high water production efficiency to an area with low water production efficiency then the virtual water trade would have a water saving effect d odorico et al 2014 martinez melendez and bennett 2016 brindha 2017 chapagain et al 2006 estimated that virtual water trade has saved 352 km3 yr 1 in the importing countries by imported agricultural production moreover the impact of virtual water trade on countries with different economic development varies greatly and it has a greater effect on alleviating water pressure on wealthy importing countries while it has less impact on poor countries distefano and kelly 2017 huang et al 2011 showed that through food imports countries can overcome resource constraints and compensate for the temporary reduction in food supply sun et al 2016 assessed the impact of virtual water embodied in grain transfer on condition of regional water resources in mainland china and the results showed that virtual water flow changed the water distribution and had a significant effect on water resources in both import and export regions zhai et al 2019 developed a virtual water food nexus model and quantified the inter provincial transfer of water accompanied by food and identified the complicated interactions between different provinces in china however what has attracted people s attention is that virtual water trade may bring other neglected but important impacts sartori and schiavo 2015 concluded that the global virtual water trade was becoming more frequent but not necessarily stable dell angelo et al 2018 pointed out that the understanding of virtual water trade by water politics may overlook some hidden but important social consequences due to limited water resources uneven distribution and excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides china is faced with increasing water pressure and serious agricultural pollution zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 guo et al 2010 cao et al 2020 gray water footprint and carbon emissions are important indicators that characterize the impact of grain production on the environment yan et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 sun et al 2019 as the population and regional economic development gap widen the amount of grain transportation among regions has also increased in china resulting in grain virtual water flow gao et al 2020 with the expansion of grain trade the intensity of virtual water flow gradually increases while redistributing water resources and influencing the environment by grain production process d odorico et al 2019 sun et al 2018 therefore it is necessary and meaningful to analyze the impact of grain virtual water flow on the environment through the carbon footprint and gray water footprint agricultural production is a water intensive process accompanied by environmental pollution water resources and agricultural pollution pose appreciable challenge to grain security wan et al 2016 deng et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 compared with traditional engineering measures virtual water provides a new perspective to solve the current water resources problems in the process of agricultural production and consumption liu et al 2018 qian et al 2018 d odorico et al 2019 following the development of the concept of virtual water another important term water footprint was proposed in the early 2000s hoekstra 2003 water footprint is divided into three categories blue water footprint green water footprint and gray water footprint hoekstra et al 2011 blue water refers to surface water and groundwater which is used in agricultural irrigation green water refers to soil moisture stored in unsaturated zone which is mainly used in rain fed production savenije 2000 hoekstra et al 2011 yang et al 2013 obviously the division of blue and green water emphasize the different characteristics of the two components according to hoekstra et al 2011 gray water footprint is different from green and blue water footprint gray water footprint presents water requirements for diluting pollutants into water bodies to meet acceptable water quality standards which is mainly used to indicate the intensity of water pollution of the production process hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 another important environmental assessment indicator similar to this is carbon footprint carbon footprint has been widely regarded as a way that address the potential impact on environment by assessing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions wiedmann and minx 2008 yan et al 2015 chen et al 2021 valipour et al 2021 found greenhouse gas emissions are one of the main factors contributing to global warming some studies focus on the impact of virtual water transfer on the regional ecological environment dalin and rodríguez iturbe 2016 dalin et al 2017 liu et al 2018 for example liu et al 2018 indicated that the global food trade can save a lot of water resources and the use of nitrogen fertilizer and also greatly reduce the loss of nitrogen dalin and rodríguez iturbe 2016 reported food trade can either decrease or increase the overall impact of agriculture on the environment which is depending on whether the impact is greater in the export region dalin et al 2017 presented that about 11 of the non renewable groundwater that use for irrigation was transferred in current international food trade some countries produce and import food from rapidly depleted aquifers which highlights the risks of global food and water security oita et al 2016 calculated the nitrogen footprints for 188 countries and the results showed that china india the united states and brazil bore 46 of global emissions approximately a quarter of the global nitrogen footprint comes from commodities traded across borders their conclusion is that the demand of consumers in other regions has driven substantial local nitrogen pollution in summary although there have been some studies on the environmental impact of virtual water trade there are few reports on comprehensively quantifying the gray water footprint and carbon emissions of virtual water trade previous studies mostly focused on the impact of the grain production process on the environment based on the concept of virtual water this study selects two environmental analysis indicators gray water footprint and carbon footprint and puts forward a comprehensive environmental assessment perspective which can reflect the regional environment from both the process of grain production and consumption this study discusses the impact of current grain virtual water flow pattern on the redistribution of gray water footprint and carbon footprint between export and import regions and clarifies the different environmental effects of virtual water flow by the regional and national scales at last this study analyzes the driving factors of the difference in environmental effects caused by grain virtual water flow which would help to form better water resources management policies and alleviate regional environmental pressures 2 materials and methods 2 1 target area the study area of this study is mainland china located in eastern asia fig 1 according to data of the meteorological dataset during 1997 2015 the average annual temperature in china was about 11 2 c the lowest is about 8 6 c and the highest is about 12 1 c in north china and south china respectively and the annual average precipitation is 642 mm the lowest is about 179 mm and the highest is about 2075 mm in xinjiang and jiangxi in 2015 respectively cmdc 1997 2015 2 2 grain type selection and data resources based on grain planting structure and consumption habits the three most important cereal crop types in china are maize wheat and rice the study focuses on these three grains which are representing 32 of the total area of the country and 66 4 of its arable lands based on the mean values during 1998 2015 annual crop yield data for wheat rice and maize were obtained from the database of the national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 1998 2015 provincial and national grain yield are available annually together with the total grain sown area and the production of the main crops nbsc 1998 2015 due to the differences in regional geographic spatial distribution and climatic conditions the main crop planting structure and crop growth period differ significantly the agricultural water use data was obtained from the china water resources bulletin cwrb 1998 2015 the input of production factors is an important source of environmental pollution the data on the input of production factors in this paper mainly include fertilizers pesticides and plastic films were mainly from the china rural statistical yearbook crsy 1998 2015 and the china environmental statistics yearbook cesy 1998 2015 2 3 methods 1 calculation of virtual water according to the china statistical yearbook and white paper on food security in china china has basically achieved self sufficiency in grains with a self sufficiency rate of over 95 which has laid a solid material foundation for ensuring national food security promoting economic and social development and long term national stability yang 2019 sun et al 2019 csy 1997 2015 therefore this study did not consider the international grain trade and only calculated the grain transfer between provinces within china the difference in grain production and grain demand between provinces is the main driving force for inter regional grain trade the per capita possession of grain is a relatively fair method of grain distribution the first step in the calculation of grain virtual water flow is to divide each identity into export area and import area based on the social equity law this study uses the national per capita share of grain as the benchmark for personal grain consumption the difference between regional per capita share of grain and national per capita share of grain is used to define regional trade characteristics if the regional per capita share of grain is higher than the national it means that the regional grain production is higher than the demand so it is defined as an export area conversely if national per capita share of grain is lower than that of the nation it means that the grain production in the region cannot meet the grain demand which is defined as an import area after determining the export area and the import area it is necessary to further determine the route and quantity of grain transportation between provinces the adjacent areas generally have similar climatic conditions grain planting structure and eating habits meanwhile it would produce less transportation costs based on this rule of grain transfer therefore according to the similar characteristics of geographical location natural conditions and agricultural production this research divides 31 provincial level administrative areas into 8 regions as the primary unit of grain virtual water flow table 1 the export area in each region firstly meets the import area inside the region and when there is a surplus it will be transferred to the import area in the adjacent region based on the calculation results it is found that the export area and the import area are in a state of aggregation which basically conforms to the transportation path of this mode after determining the transportation route it is necessary to further calculate the transportation volume of each provincial administrative area and all of them are allocated in accordance with the social equity method that is the method of distribution of grain in the export area to the import area in an equal proportion if a region contains four provincial level administrative areas of which there is only one export region there will be two situations when the surplus of grain in the export province is greater than the deficit of the other three provinces it will be transferred directly according to the deficit while the grain surplus in the export area is less than the deficit in the other three provinces the proportion of the grain shortage in the remaining three import areas needs to be calculated first and then the grain of export area is transferred to the three import areas according to this ratio sun et al 2019 2 gray water footprint and carbon footprint of grain production this study selects gray water footprint and carbon footprint as indicators to evaluate the impact of grain production patterns and virtual water flow on the regional environment the gray water footprint is calculated according to hoekstra et al 2011 which is as follows 1 w f g i α a r i c n max c n n a t where w f g i is the gray water footprint in region i ar i is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied per unit area kg ha α is the leaching rate which is generally 10 c n max is the maximum allowable nitrogen concentration 10 mg l and c n n a t is the natural background nitrogen concentration hoekstra et al 2011 the carbon footprint cf t co2 was calculated by summarizing all the individual greenhouse gas emissions from different sources mainly including direct emissions and indirect emissions the carbon footprint is calculated as follows 2 c f c f m c f n 2 o c f c h 4 where c f m is the sum of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the agricultural input in t co2 c f n 2 o represents the direct n2o emissions by the application of n fertilizer in t co2 c f c h 4 is the ch4 emissions from rice planting in a single season in t co2 3 c f m i i e f i where i is the type of agricultural source or input i i is the amount of the ith agricultural source or input fertilizer

geographical location and living habits among the regions will cause significant differences in irrigation fertilizers and pesticides and so on these production input factors are necessary conditions for the production of grain and are also the main source of agricultural pollution therefore the virtual water flow has caused the redistribution of gray water footprint and carbon footprint to some extent this study explores the impact of grain virtual water flow on the environment through the process of grain production and consumption fig 2 in addition to analyzing the carbon footprint and gray water footprint generated by the grain production process in 31 provinces in mainland china this study also assessed the impact of the grain virtual water flow on the export area and the overall gray water footprint and carbon footprint of the country the impact on the export area is mainly manifested in that the export area needs to produce more grain to meet the needs of other import areas except meeting its own grain consumption the additional grain production would increase the environmental pressure of the export area therefore this study quantifies the environmental pressure of the grain production for trade in the export area meanwhile due to the difference between the gray water footprint per unit of grain production and the carbon footprint per unit of grain production in different regions the virtual water flow between the regions would have an overall impact on the gross gray water footprint and the total carbon footprint therefore this study also quantifies the impact of the current virtual water flow on the overall gray water footprint and carbon footprint of the country 3 results 3 1 the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of grain virtual water flow gray water footprint and carbon footprint during the study period the scale of china s grain virtual water flow gradually expanded and the amount of virtual water flow increased from 67 14 gm3 to 129 87 gm3 the import region and export region have undergone a great transformation during the study period for example jiangsu has become an import region in 2014 which was an important grain producing area in 1997 the main grain virtual water export provinces are distributed in north china and northeast china the export of grain virtual water in these areas is also gradually increasing the main grain virtual water import provinces are gradually shifting to the beijing tianjin hebei region and the southeast coastal region fig 3 this study selects gray water footprint as the first indicator to analyze the impact of virtual water flow on the environment the results indicated that the gray water footprint at a national scale showed a fluctuating trend from 1997 to 2014 with obvious differences in temporal and spatial distribution fig 4 in terms of areas with increased gray water footprint inner mongolia henan and heilongjiang have the most obvious increasing trends their gray water footprints increased by 1722 7 mm³ 1636 4 mm³ and 1616 2 mm³ from 1997 to 2014 respectively meanwhile henan was the province with the largest gray water footprint in 2014 7888 3 mm³ regarding the areas with reduced gray water footprint beijing shanghai and zhejiang have the most evident reducing trends with the decreasing rate of 66 3 63 7 and 46 5 respectively they are typical grain import areas and with less gray water footprint during the study period on the contrary shandong and jiangsu are provinces with larger gray water footprints and a decreasing trend among them shandong decreased from 6516 8 mm³ in 1997 4787 3 mm³ in 2014 and jiangsu decreased from 6572 7 mm³ to 5278 6 mm³ the difference is that shandong is an export area where the export ratio is gradually increasing while jiangsu is an area where the export ratio is gradually reducing and converted to an import area this study uses carbon footprint as another indicator for analyzing the impact of virtual water flow on the environment the results show that the total carbon footprint at the national scale increased from 290 2 mton in 1997 430 4 mton in 2014 basically showing a continuous increase trend fig 5 except for beijing shanghai and zhejiang the carbon footprint of other regions showed different increasing trends provinces with larger carbon footprint are similar to those with larger gray water footprint mainly including henan shandong hebei anhui jiangsu sichuan and heilongjiang henan is the province with the largest increase in carbon footprint from 20 8 mton in 1997 36 5 mton in 2014 gradually becoming the province with the largest total carbon footprint and gray water footprint inner mongolia and xinjiang are the provinces with the fastest increasing rate in carbon footprint with an average increasing rate of about 174 in 2014 compared to 1997 3 2 influence of virtual water flow on gray water footprint compared with the grain import area the export area undertook more grain production therefore this study mainly analyzes the changes in the gray water footprint of the trade part in the export area the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part generally showed a decreasing trend from 1997 to 2003 and a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 5378 9 mm³ in 2003 10784 4 mm³ in 2014 fig 6 from the perspective of differences in spatial distribution the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part of inner mongolia jilin heilongjiang henan and anhui accounted for a relatively large proportion and showed a clear increasing trend meanwhile these provinces were important grain virtual water export areas during the study period among them the overall gray water footprint of heilongjiang was less than henan shandong and other regions but the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part was larger than that of other export areas increasing from 1177 6 mm³ in 1997 2845 2 mm³ in 2014 henan was one of the provinces with the largest increasing of the gray water footprint of the virtual water export increasing from 257 8 mm³ in 1997 2143 1 mm³ in 2014 the gray water footprint of henan s virtual water export part in 2014 was second only to heilongjiang inner mongolia was also a province where the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part increased obviously from 578 7 mm³ in 1997 2040 3 mm³ in 2014 the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part in some export areas showed a decreasing trend such as jiangsu and shandong jiangsu was the province with the largest gray water footprint of the virtual water export part in 1997 with 1246 8 mm³ and it showed a decreasing trend year by year reducing to 19 5 mm³ in 2010 and then converted to an import area after 2011 3 3 influence of virtual water flow on carbon footprint similar to the gray water footprint this study mainly analyzes the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in the export area the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in the export area fluctuated in general from 1997 to 2003 and showed a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 23 6 mton in 2003 52 9 mton in 2014 and the proportion increased from 7 66 to 13 11 respectively fig 7 from the perspective of differences in spatial distribution the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in inner mongolia jilin heilongjiang and henan were relatively large and basically showed a trend of increasing year by year although heilongjiang s gross carbon footprint was not the largest it always was the province with the largest carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part among the export regions accounting for 6 75 26 64 of the total carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part from 1997 to 2014 henan s total carbon footprint was relatively high at the beginning of the study its contribution to the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part was not significant about 3 46 with the expansion of the scale of its grain production and the extent of virtual water export henan s carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part gradually increased in 2014 henan became one of the main contributors to carbon footprint of virtual water flow part with carbon footprint of 9 9 mton accounting for 18 74 jiangsu served as an export area from 1997 to 2010 and changed from an export area to an import area in 2011 2014 with the decrease of its grain export the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in jiangsu also showed a gradually decreasing trend from 4 3 mton in 1997 accounting for 71 to 0 08 mton in 2010 accounting for 0 17 the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in xinjiang showed a relatively obvious increasing trend from 1 1 mton accounting for 4 28 in 1997 4 9 mton accounting 9 26 in 2014 4 discussion 4 1 impact of virtual water flow on gray water footprint at a national scale the research results show that virtual water trade increases the gray water footprint and carbon footprint of grain export areas in addition the gray water footprint and carbon footprint of the export part showed a clear increasing trend and a large difference in spatial distribution in order to explore the impact of virtual water flow on the country s overall gray water footprint and carbon footprint and its driving factors this study discusses the differences in gray water footprint per unit of grain production and carbon footprint per unit of grain production between regions and further explores the reasons for the differences the country s gray water footprint per unit of grain production basically showed a decreasing trend from 0 15 m³ kg in 1997 0 11 m³ kg in 2014 fig 8 different from the spatial distribution of gross gray water footprint the gray water footprint per unit of grain production in most grain export areas showed a decreasing trend such as heilongjiang henan hebei and shandong the provinces with increasing gray water footprint per unit of grain production were zhejiang guangdong hainan and yunnan all of which were typical grain import areas shaanxi beijing and tianjin had larger gray water footprint per unit of grain production while heilongjiang jiangxi and qinghai had smaller gray water footprint per unit of grain production the differences in grain production structure and climatic conditions among different regions affect the ability of regional grain production take northeast region as an example for analysis as the most important grain production base in china the northeast region has relatively fertile soil which has certain advantages in grain production compared with other provinces the amount of fertilizer applied during grain production process is smaller the gray water footprint per unit grain production in northeast region is also smaller and with the development of agricultural technology gray water footprint in northeast region is still showing a trend of decreasing the reason for the large gray water footprint in northeast region is mainly due to the grain export heilongjiang has the lowest gray water footprint per unit of grain production with only 0 067 m³ kg the grain production and grain export were the highest during the study period but the nitrogen fertilizer per unit of grain production was only 0 015 m3 kg which was the smallest in the country therefore the smaller gray water footprint per unit of grain production in northeast region is mainly due to its own grain production advantages assuming the grain production and consumption in each region were balanced and self sufficient and there is no grain trade between regions the scale of grain production in the grain import area would be appropriately reduced on the contrary the scale of grain production in the grain export area would be expanded the analysis results show that the gray water footprint per unit of grain production in most grain export areas are lower than that in grain import areas if the import area expanded grain production it would produce more gray water footprint than that currently therefore the current virtual water flow pattern is more beneficial to the water environment at the national scale although the current grain virtual water flow brought a certain pressure to the environment of the export areas it would have different effects when analyzed nationwide in order to quantitatively analyze the impact of virtual water flow on the regional gray water footprint taking 2014 as an example the current virtual water flow reduced the overall gray water footprint with 8 53 gm³ fig 9 the gray water footprint per unit of grain production in most of the export areas were relatively small thereby all the export areas showed the potential to reduce the overall gray water footprint in 2014 while the grain export of heilongjiang was the largest the gray water footprint per unit of grain production was the lowest so it contributed greatly to the overall water environment of the country accounting for 53 46 of the overall reduction in the country the gray water footprint reduction potential of heilongjiang s virtual water export to guangdong beijing and zhejiang was 1 68 gm³ 0 67 gm³ and 0 65 gm³ respectively the potential to reduce gray water footprint from jilin to guangdong beijing and zhejiang was 0 72 gm³ 0 30 gm³ and 0 28 gm³ respectively meanwhile the virtual water flow between some regions would increase gray water footprint for example the potential of increasing gray water footprint from henan and inner mongolia to shanghai by virtual water export were 0 06 gm³ and 0 04 gm³ respectively most of the grain export areas are concentrated in the water scarce northern regions driven by the grain trade the grain production process in the northern areas produced more gray water footprint the results of the study show that the gray water footprint of the grain export area due to the export of grain was 6 60 gm³ accounting for 9 04 of the total gray water footprint in 1997 with the continuous expansion of the grain trade pattern the gray water footprint due to grain export increased to 10 78 gm³ in 2014 accounting for 14 73 of the total gray water footprint that year the impact on the export area is mainly manifested in the increased application of chemical fertilizers which brings a certain environmental pressure meanwhile the grain export area needs more water resources to dilute the pollution caused by the gray water footprint and make it meet the environmental standards on the other hand the increasing of gray water footprint may have impact on the water quality of grain export areas and increase the pressure on water use in conclusion the current virtual water flow is generally friendly to the gray water footprint regardless of the internal environmental pressure in the export area 4 2 impact of virtual water flow on carbon footprint at a national scale with the input of agricultural production materials the carbon footprint per unit area in 2014 showed a certain increase compared with 1997 the carbon footprint per unit area of most import areas increased more such as the carbon footprint of hainan increased by 216 7 carbon footprint of beijing increased by 114 6 although the carbon footprint per unit area of the export area also showed an increasing trend its increasing rate was slower compared with the import area for example shandong s carbon footprint increased by 27 5 and heilongjiang s carbon footprint increased by 30 1 in order to explore the impact of grain virtual water flow on carbon footprint at the national and regional scale this study analyzed the carbon footprint per unit of grain production among each region the results show that there was a significant spatial distribution difference between the carbon footprint per unit production and the total carbon footprint among regions the national carbon footprint per unit grain production showed a fluctuating trend during the study period basically maintaining between 0 58 and 0 72 kgce kg fig 10 the carbon footprint per unit of grain production in about half of the provinces showed an increasing trend while the remaining provinces showed a fluctuating trend the results show that hainan fujian and shanghai had the largest carbon footprint per unit of grain production the carbon footprint per unit grain production of hainan zhejiang fujian and guangdong increased significantly during the study period and these provinces are all typical grain import regions on the contrast the carbon footprint per unit of grain production in inner mongolia heilongjiang and tibet were relatively smaller among them inner mongolia and heilongjiang were the main grain export areas from this perspective virtual water basically transferred from areas with smaller carbon footprint per unit grain production to areas with a larger carbon footprint per unit grain production which is beneficial to the environment as a whole due to differences in the carbon footprint per unit of grain production among provinces the virtual water flow would have an impact on overall carbon footprint taking 2014 as an example due to the virtual water flow among regions china s total carbon footprint showed an environmentally friendly pattern and the total amount of reducing carbon footprint was 20 27 gton fig 11 among the export areas heilongjiang inner mongolia jilin jiangxi hebei shandong and xinjiang had the potential to reduce the overall carbon footprint by virtual water flow the remaining 4 export areas caused an increasing in carbon footprint when performing virtual water export as the largest virtual water export area heilongjiang had a relatively small carbon footprint per unit of grain production when the grain was transferred to relevant provinces it played a very important role in reducing china s overall carbon footprint and the potential of reducing carbon footprint was 19 63 gton accounting for 96 83 of the gross carbon footprint reduction the carbon footprint reduction potential of heilongjiang s virtual water export to beijing zhejiang shanghai and tianjin was 3 60 gton 2 25 gton 1 96 gton and 1 05 gton in 2014 respectively the potential to reduce carbon footprint in inner mongolia was second with 5 04 gton the obvious difference in carbon footprint reduction between the two provinces was determined by the carbon footprint per unit of grain production and the amount of grain export henan and anhui had larger carbon footprint per unit of grain production while exporting virtual water which caused an increase in the overall carbon footprint among them the potential of increasing carbon footprint of henan and anhui by virtual water export were 4 5 gton and 3 15 gton respectively for example the carbon footprint increasing potential of henan s virtual water export to zhejiang was 1 00gton while the potential of anhui s virtual water export to zhejiang was 0 63 gton 4 3 the control measures of virtual water flow between regions according to the concept of gray water footprint it is the amount of fresh water required to assimilate pollutants to meet specific water quality standards therefore there are certain requirements on the amount of available water resources that can be used in the region after meeting current consumption and production needs especially in the export area by analyzing the ratio of regional gray water footprint to the remaining available water resources regional available water resources minus total water consumption it could be found that the water environment problems in jiangsu henan and hebei were relatively prominent as far as henan is concerned with the continuous increasing rate of grain export the gray water footprint of henan also showed a clear increasing trend and its ratio of regional gray water footprint to the remaining available water resources showed a significant decline for example the ratio of the gray water footprint to its remaining available water resources was 19 5 in 1997 and its gray water footprint was 1 06 times than the remaining available water resources in 2014 indicating that the gray water footprint of this area was already larger than the local surplus available water resources there was no surplus water resources to dilute the pollution generated during the production process of grain to meet regional environmental standards meanwhile it also showed that as the main grain virtual water export area the virtual water flow increased the pressure on the regional water environment the main grain producing area is the main body of china agricultural production especially of grain producing fertilization is one of the methods that must be invested in the process of crop growth to increase production and it is also the main factor causing regional non point source pollution and greenhouse gas emissions studies have shown that agricultural fertilization is the main source of total phosphorus and total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen the total phosphorus emissions total nitrogen emissions and ammonia nitrogen emissions in the main grain production areas are higher than those of the other two types of areas fig 12 meanwhile most of the main grain production areas are the main virtual water output areas after meeting the grain consumption needs of the local the export regions have undertaken the task of satisfying other areas the spatial distribution of wastewater discharge in most areas is similar to that of total nitrogen total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen the proportion of grain sown area to total sown area basically showed an increasing trend from 54 97 in 1995 to 60 14 in 2015 the proportion of wheat and rice both showed a decreasing trend while rice decreased from 20 51 to 18 45 and wheat decreased from 19 26 to 14 74 fig 13a therefore the increasing of the grain sown area was mainly due to the substantial increase of maize which was increasing from 15 2 in 1997 to 26 95 in 2015 due to differences in regional climatic conditions geographic locations and physiological characteristics of grains the spatial distribution of grain cultivation differs significantly among different provinces fig 13b rice is mainly growing in the south region and northeast region on the time scale the rice planting area in the northeast region showed an increasing trend in 2015 compared to 1997 while the rice planting area in the main import areas such as guangdong and zhejiang showed a tendency to shrink wheat is mainly cultivated in the central region and the huang huai hai region and the wheat planting area in the northeast region has seriously declined maize is mainly distributed in the northeast central and southwest regions and the sown area as a whole shows an increasing trend the main environmental costs of agricultural production are associated with soil and water pollution from pesticide applications and fertilizer overuse as well as groundwater depletion land use change the differences in farming methods between different crops and the demand for fertilizers and pesticides are the main factors that have different environmental impacts grain virtual water flow presents a pattern that is beneficial to the environment on the whole but it increases environmental pressure in local areas therefore in order to reduce the pressure on the virtual water export area the crop planting structure can be adjusted nationally and the planting area of crops with less environmental impact in the export area can be increased to reduce the environmental pressure meanwhile the dietary structure can be changed on the consumer side and the virtual water flow can be combined with the market economy to jointly protect the environment 5 conclusion during the study period the scale of china s grain virtual water flow gradually expanded and the amount of virtual water flow increased from 67 14 gm³ to 129 87 gm³ the gray water footprint at a national scale showed a fluctuating trend with obvious differences in temporal and spatial distribution in addition the total carbon footprint at the national scale increased from 290 2 mton in 1997 430 4 mton in 2014 basically showing a continuous increase trend the import region and export region have undergone a great transformation during the study period the main grain virtual water export provinces are distributed in north china and northeast china the main grain virtual water import provinces are gradually shifting to the beijing tianjin hebei region and the southeast coastal region the gray water footprint of the virtual water export part generally showed a decreasing trend from 1997 to 2003 and a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 5378 9mm³ in 2003 10784 4 mm³ in 2014 the gray water footprint of most of the main grain producing regions showed a clear increasing trend provinces with larger gray water footprints are basically converted into import areas and the total national gray water footprint reduced to 64 74 gm³ under current grain virtual water flow the carbon footprint of the virtual water flow part in the export area fluctuated in general from 1997 to 2003 and showed a continuous increasing trend from 2003 to 2014 increasing from 23 6 mton in 2003 52 9 mton in 2014 and the proportion increased from 7 66 to 13 11 among the export areas such as the northeast region and the huang huai hai region the carbon footprint has an obvious downward trend meanwhile the carbon footprint of the import region in the south due to increasing of grain production to meet their own needs is showing an increasing trend

9957,irrigation and fertilization are the two most important measures to ensure the agricultural development in arid regions however there is still a lack of reasonable irrigation and fertilization strategy in xinjiang the largest cotton producing area in china which causes a waste of resources and a reduction in cotton yield and pollutes the environment this study investigated the effects of four irrigation amounts w0 6 60 etc w0 8 80 etc w1 0 100 etc and w1 2 120 etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration and four nitrogen rates n250 250 kg n ha 1 n300 300 kg n ha 1 n350 350 kg n ha 1 and n400 400 kg n ha 1 on seed cotton yield nitrogen nutrition status and soil nitrogen residue so as to explore the optimal water nitrogen coupling strategy to increase cotton production and water fertilizer use efficiency while reducing environmental pollution the nitrogen dilution curves were built to assess the nitrogen nutrition status of cotton the results showed that increasing irrigation amount increased dry matter and seed cotton yield but decreased harvest index nitrogen application enhanced the nitrogen concentration and accumulation in cotton irrigation decreased the nitrogen concentration but increased the nitrogen accumulation by increasing the dry matter the highest total plant nitrogen accumulation was obtained under w1 2n400 223 88 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 242 77 kg ha 1 in 2019 with the increase of irrigation amount agronomic nitrogen utilization efficiency anue first increased and then decreased increasing irrigation amount increased nitrogen recovery efficiency nre but reduced physiological nitrogen utilization efficiency pnue pnue and anue decreased with the increasing nitrogen rate while nre first increased and then decreased soil no 3 n content increased with the increase of nitrogen rate irrigation reduced no 3 n content in the surface soil 0 30 cm while increased that in the deeper soil 40 80 cm the optimal nitrogen nutrition status was found under w1 0n300 followed by w1 0n350 furthermore the optimal dry matter seed cotton yield nre and total nitrogen accumulation were obtained under w1 0n350 which was considered as the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate in this study keywords seed cotton yield nitrogen uptake nitrogen nutrition status nitrogen use efficiency soil no 3 n 1 introduction water shortage and soil salinization are the two main constraints for the development of agriculture in arid and semi arid areas around the world hou et al 2009 irrigation and fertilization are the two most important measures for agricultural producers in these regions to maintain crop yield and quality drechsel et al 2013 xinjiang is the largest cotton producing area in china because of its unique climate suitable for cotton growth however the shortage of water resources caused by scarce rainfall and intense evaporation has seriously restricted the development of the cotton industry in this region wang et al 2011 since 1990s the soil mulching and drip irrigation has been applied in xinjiang because of its advantage of conserving soil moisture moderating soil temperature reducing insect and disease and increasing crop yield zhou et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 there is more than 2 106 ha of the cotton with drip irrigation under plastic mulch in xinjiang accounting for about 58 5 of the planting area and 71 of the cotton yield tuerxun et al 2016 wang et al 2019 however due to the lack of scientific and reasonable management of irrigation amount and fertilization rate the irrigation amount in this area far exceeds the water required by cotton this situation not only wastes a lot of water aggravates the shortage of water resources but also raises the groundwater level and causes soil salinization to some extent wang et al 2011 there is also a lack of systematic management of fertilization rate in the field and the fertilizer rate largely depends on the experiences of local farmers which results in a waste of fertilizers environmental pollution and reduction in cotton yield khan et al 2017 therefore determining an optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy is of vital importance to the development of cotton production in xinjiang as the main source of nitrogen in agricultural ecosystems shan et al 2015 nitrogen fertilizer supply is an important factor to ensure crop growth many studies have pointed out that nitrogen application dramatically enhanced crop canopy area photosynthesis crop yield fiber quality and the resistance to abiotic stresses such as salinity stress and drought stress chen et al 2010a luo et al 2013 2018 wang et al 2019 zou et al 2020 in practical agricultural production there are mainly three fates for nitrogen applied in the farmland including crop absorption soil residues and emissions to the environment such as ammonia volatilization no x emissions and leaching etc wu and ma 2015 in general crop nitrogen absorption is conducive to the agricultural production and the nitrogen uptake by the plant will be converted into yield under certain conditions nitrogen residue in the soil and emissions to the environment will waste the fertilizer and pollute the environment shrestha et al 2010 sun et al 2020 abdo et al 2021 meanwhile with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer costs and the increasing concern about greenhouse gas emissions the nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency has attracted more and more attention from the scholars lu et al 2021 rochester et al 2007 many scholars have studied crop nitrogen uptake soil nitrogen residue and nitrogen utilization efficiency shareef et al 2019 pointed out that the nitrogen application under conventional irrigation broadcasted directly on the soil surface caused a large amount of nitrogen loss which significantly reduced nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency in contrast soluble nitrogen fertilizer can be accurately delivered to the root zone with the drippers under drip irrigation fan et al 2017 reducing the nitrogen loss during filed application and improving nitrogen utilization efficiency some studies have shown that the optimal nitrogen application and nitrogen utilization efficiency were mainly determined by soil fertility and field management and appropriately reducing nitrogen application rate can improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency janat 2008 luo et al 2018 generally speaking the rationality of nitrogen application can be assessed by analyzing the status of crop nutrient absorption although it is difficult to distinguish the nutrient source absorbed by crops rochester et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 proved that increasing nitrogen application promoted the nitrogen uptake by cotton which was inhibited by the irrigation with high salinity the critical nitrogen concentration and nitrogen nutrition index nni proposed by lemaire and gasta 1997 are regularly used to assess the crops nitrogen nutrition status as we all know for crops nitrogen is an absolutely essential nutrient element to ensure growth but for soil and groundwater nitrogen might act as or be considered as a pollutant basso and ritchie 2005 ju et al 2006 concluded that the high nitrogen accumulation rate and free drainage were the conditions of nitrogen moving into the deeper soil and groundwater therefore reducing nitrogen residues in the soil is a main measure to alleviate the adverse effects of nitrogen on the environment under certain soil conditions studies have shown that continuous fertilization increased the nitrogen concentration in the soil because of limited nitrogen absorption by crop roots wang et al 1996 yin et al 2007 ma et al 2012 wang et al 1996 discovered that after fertigation the content of no 3 n and nh 4 n in the soil decreased over soil depth mainly concentrated in the upper soil layer 0 20 cm in areas with abundant rainfall such as the hai river basin the no 3 n content in the soil continued to decrease over time due to the nitrogen leaching caused by rainwater and crop absorption yin et al 2007 although nitrogen nutrition status in cotton has widely investigated based on critical nitrogen dilution curves the relationships between the fitted coefficients of critical nitrogen dilution curves and irrigation amount have been rarely explored we hypothesized that an optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate can improve the seed cotton yield while keeping cotton under an acceptable nitrogen nutrition status achieving the goal of high crop yield and saving fertilizer our specific objectives were i to investigate the effects of water and nitrogen application on seed cotton yield and harvest index ii to establish a uniform critical nitrogen dilution curve that can diagnose cotton n nutrition status under various irrigation regimes and determine the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate and iii to analyze variations in soil nitrogen residues under various irrigation amounts and nitrogen rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the field experiment was conducted at the experimental station in korla 40 53 n 86 56 e xinjiang china fig s1 in

determination of nc dilution model inconsistent with dry matter nitrogen concentration decreased over time increasing nitrogen rate had a positive effect on dry matter and nitrogen concentration and irrigation amount decreased nitrogen concentration while increased dry matter fig 5 data points from each sampling from 73 to 153 das in 2018 were used to determine the nc points by following the method proposed by justes et al 1994 above ground dry matter under the four irrigation amounts ranged from 2 97 to 25 14 mg ha 1 all over 1 mg ha 1 and nitrogen concentration ranged from 0 90 to 1 96 g 100 g 1 the critical nitrogen dilution curves were established fig 6 and the model parameters are shown in table 5 as seen from the table 5 a and b increased with the increase of irrigation amount and the increase trend conformed to the quadratic equation therefore a and b were fitted linearly with the corresponding irrigation amounts the fitting equations were as follows 11 a 6 53623 10 6 i 2 0 00553531 i 1 84081 r 2 0 99611 12 b 2 81039 10 6 i 2 0 00222502 i 0 105364 r 2 0 99905 therefore the critical nitrogen dilution curves of cotton under different irrigation amounts can be expressed as follows 13 n c 6 53623 10 6 i 2 0 00553531 i 1 84081 dm 2 81039 10 6 i 2 0 00222502 i 0 105364 3 3 2 validation of nc dilution curves independent data points from the experiments in 2019 were used to validate the curves irrigation amount and above ground dry matter in 2019 were substituted into eq 13 to calculate the simulation value and a 1 1 histogram was displayed to show the relationship between simulated and measured values rmse and n rmse were calculated to evaluate the model accuracy fig 7 as seen from fig 7 rmse of 0 1135 g 100 g 1 and n rmse of 7 4333 were obtained indicating that the model was extremely stable and could be used for cotton nitrogen nutrition diagnosis 3 3 3 nitrogen nutrition diagnosis based on the critical nitrogen dilution curve model the critical nitrogen dilution curves built in 2018 were used to determine the critical nitrogen concentration under different irrigation amounts in 2019 eq 9 was used to calculate nni and evaluate cotton nitrogen nutrition status fig 8 nni decreased gradually over time nni showed an increasing trend with the increase of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate under the extreme water deficit condition w0 6 nni of each nitrogen rate was less than 1 after 120das under w0 8 nni obtained at n400 was all over 1 under w1 0 nni obtained at n300 fluctuated around 1 throughout the whole cotton growing season nni obtained at n350 and n400 were all greater than 1 under w1 0 and w1 2 nni under n250 was all less than 1 under various irrigation amounts 3 4 soil no 3 n irrigation amount and nitrogen rate had significant effects on soil no 3 n accumulation in the 0 40 cm soil profile fig 9 in 2018 the no 3 n accumulation in the 0 40 cm soil profile was 381 7 439 76 485 03 and 522 58 kg ha 1 in n250 n300 n350 and n400 under w0 6 under w0 8 the corresponding accumulation was 378 80 416 07 463 32 and 508 87 kg ha 1 under w1 0 the corresponding accumulation was 331 88 375 09 427 99 and 464 47 kg ha 1 under w1 2 the corresponding accumulation was 304 44 340 31 375 81 and 403 43 kg ha 1 in 2019 the no 3 n accumulation was 387 42 449 05 518 28 and 593 81 kg ha 1 in n250 n300 n350 and n400 under w0 6 under w0 8 the corresponding accumulation was 375 21 424 03 494 13 and 545 18 kg ha 1 under w1 0 the corresponding accumulation was 335 72 383 68 444 70 and 489 58 kg ha 1 under w1 2 the corresponding accumulation was 295 98 336 17 403 72 and 434 66 kg ha 1 more no 3 n accumulated in the surface soil 0 30 cm in this study and gradually decreased over soil depth with the increase of irrigation amount no 3 n accumulation decreased because of the nitrogen leaching and cotton nitrogen uptake with the increase of irrigation amount no 3 n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer decreased while that in the 30 40 cm soil layer increased in 2018 with the increase of irrigation amount the proportion of no 3 n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer decreased from 57 77 to 53 09 and that in the 20 40 cm soil layer increased from 42 23 to 46 91 in 2019 the corresponding changes decreased from 60 67 to 52 44 in the 0 20 cm soil layer and increased from 39 33 to 47 56 in the 20 40 cm soil layer in this study soil no 3 n distribution in the 0 80 cm soil layer was analyzed after irrigation for each treatment in 2019 no 3 n accumulated mainly in the surface soil 0 30 cm fig 10 no 3 n content of each treatment increased with the increase of nitrogen rate increasing irrigation caused the wetting area to diffuse into deeper soils and nitrogen dissolved in the water will move to deeper soils with water increasing no 3 n content in deep soils 4 discussion 4 1 seed cotton yield and harvest index drip fertigation under mulching film has been widely adopted in xinjiang of china in recent years due to its advantages of saving water and improving yield dai and dong 2014 li et al 2019 however the optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen regimes has not yet been determined in this region irrational drip fertigation strategies cause crop yield reduction resource waste and soil pollution some studies have pointed out that seed cotton yield was mainly affected by the boll number and boll weight both of which decreased with increasing drought stress thereby reducing seed cotton yield mert 2005 wang et al 2010 however some researches found that 20 25 reduction of full irrigation had no significant effect on the seed cotton yield karam et al 2006 kang et al 2012 in the present study with the increase of the water supply seed cotton yield increased compared to w1 0 w1 2 had little effect on the increase of seed cotton yield cotton suffered from salinity stress besides water and fertilizer stresses due to the saline alkali soil in the present study more irrigation was required to ensure cotton growth therefore the inflection point of irrigation amount on the increase of seed cotton yield appeared at w1 0 100 etc instead of w0 8 80 etc under multiple stresses fertilizer supply can effectively improve the resistance of cotton to abiotic stress like salinity stresses chen et al 2010a drought stresses khan et al 2017 and provide essential nutrients for crops to ensure growth and yield formation a reasonable level of nitrogen fertilizer application is essential to ensure crop growth studies have shown that either deficiency or excessive would reduce crop yields aujla et al 2005 lokhande and reddy 2015 wang et al 2012 indicated that with the increase of nitrogen application the seed cotton first increased and then decreased and the highest seed cotton yield appeared at 360 kg n ha 1 this study further confirmed the promoting effect of nitrogen on cotton growth and seed cotton yield the seed cotton yield reached the maximum at 350 kg n ha 1 while further increasing nitrogen rate had no positive effect on seed cotton yield as an important indicator to evaluate the seed cotton yield and cultivation effectiveness harvest index have been studied by some scholars similar to previous findings mustafa et al 2011 dong et al 2012 luo et al 2018 we found that water deficit reduced the biological yield and seed cotton yield but increased harvest index harvest index increased from 0 2810 to 0 3534 in 2018 and increased from 0 2871 to 0 3469 in 2019 when irrigation amount decreased from w1 2 to w0 6 this result meant that under water deficit larger proportion of assimilate was allocated to reproductive organs we found that both irrigation amount and nitrogen rate has a promoting effect on seed cotton yield and dry matter through regression analysis but the effect would gradually decreased with the increase of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate the change trend of seed cotton yield with the increase of water and nitrogen regimes was consistent with that of above ground dry matter indicating that the increase of dry matter caused the increase of seed cotton yield with the increase of nitrogen rate the biological yield and seed cotton yield increased while the harvest index decreased the results proved that the vegetative growth of cotton was promoted by the increase of nitrogen rate resulting in the decreased in harvest index boquet and breitenbeck 2000 4 2 crop nitrogen uptake analyzing the nutrient absorption status of crop can help to judge whether the fertilization rate is reasonable rochester et al 2009 nitrogen application can increase the inorganic nitrogen content in soils yin et al 2007 making it easier for crops to absorb nitrogen from the soil and increase the crop nitrogen uptake studies have also found that the nitrogen absorption capacity of crops was affected by soil salinization zhang et al 2012 found that higher lint yield and nitrogen uptake were achieved either under moderate nitrogen rater with moderate salinity or under low nitrogen rate with high salinity in our study nitrogen uptake in different organs except for root and stem of cotton and the total were significantly affected by irrigation amount and nitrogen rate nitrogen concentration decreased while accumulation increased with the increase of irrigation amount indicating that irrigation increased nitrogen accumulation mainly by increasing dry matter increasing nitrogen rate could promote crop growth and nitrogen accumulation when nitrogen rate was less than 350 kg n ha 1 cotton was under luxury nitrogen condition when nitrogen rate exceeded 350 kg n ha 1 which had no significant effect on the increase of nitrogen accumulation there was no significant difference in cotton nitrogen uptake among w1 0 and w1 2 n350 and n400 which was consistent with that of seed cotton yield 4 3 nitrogen utilization efficiency as the most demanding macronutrient for cotton nitrogen is used in large quantities in cotton production hou et al 2007 in recent years the increasing nitrogen fertilizer costs and greenhouse gas emissions caused by nitrogen application have attracted growing attention bronson 2008 rochester et al 2009 understanding the influence of different irrigation and nitrogen regimes on nitrogen utilization efficiency will help policy makers to make reasonable nitrogen application modes reduce nitrogen input and the negative impact of excessive nitrogen applied on the environment and increase economic benefit rochester 2011 anue is an indicator that represents the increase in seed cotton yield per unit of nitrogen application novoa and loomis 1981 in the present study anue first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount in both years and the highest anue was obtained under w1 0 13 00 in 2018 and 12 71 in 2019 the results indicated that increasing irrigation amount increased seed cotton yield without n applied but excessive irrigation had no significant effect on seed cotton yield with n applied and may even leached nitrogen in root zone thereby reducing anue as an indicator of the nitrogen uptake potential of crops fang et al 2006 nre increased with the increase of irrigation amount and nre first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate with the highest nre under n350 the results indicated that increasing water and nitrogen application could make a better growth environment for cotton due to the saline alkali soil at the test site thereby improving nitrogen absorption capacity of cotton however cotton growth was inhibited under luxury nitrogen condition resulting in a decrease in nre under n400 pnue decreased with the increase of irrigation and nitrogen application seed cotton yield increased with increasing nitrogen rate but the increase rate gradually decreased which was the reason why anue and pnue decreased with increasing nitrogen rate 4 4 critical nitrogen dilution curve model lemaire and gasta 1997 proposed the concept of critical nitrogen concentration and then defined the nitrogen nutrition index to evaluate the crops nitrogen nutrition status in general by analyzing the actual nitrogen concentration of above ground dry matter and the critical nitrogen concentration the crop nitrogen nutrition status can be obtained ma et al 2019 therefore the nitrogen dilution curve model fitted by the critical nitrogen concentration has been widely used to assess the nitrogen nutrition status of crops many papers have used the nitrogen dilution curve to study the nitrogen nutrition status of crops such as winter wheat yue et al 2012 rice yao et al 2014 corn qiang et al 2015 ziadi et al 2008 rapeseed colnenne et al 1998 tomato tei et al 2002 potato giletto et al 2020 sweet pepper youzhen et al 2016 etc in the present study the critical nitrogen concentration in the above ground dry matter in 2018 was used to fit the critical nitrogen dilution curve and the parameters a and b were determined we found parameters a and b had linear relationships with the corresponding irrigation amount and performed a quadratic fitting a r2 0 99611 b r2 0 99905 the critical nitrogen dilution curves under different irrigation amounts were determined the models were validated using data acquired in 2019 and results showed that the model was very stable and could be used to diagnose crop nitrogen nutrition status rmse 0 1135 g 100 g 1 n rmse 7 4333 the nitrogen nutrition index nni can be used to quantitatively assess the intensity of nitrogen deficiency and luxury consumption lemaire and gastal 1997 the practicality of nni is emphasized by the fact that the relationship between the critical nitrogen concentration and crop mass will keep stable with changing major environmental factors lemaire et al 2008 by studying the changes of nni at different growth stages the time of nitrogen application can be optimized to achieve the balance of nitrogen supply and demand for cotton in present study nni decreased over time indicating that cotton was more prone under nitrogen deficiency in the later growth period nni increased with the increase of irrigation and nitrogen application nni under w0 6 were all less 1 after 120 das indicating cotton was in nitrogen deficiency nni under n350 and n400 was in nitrogen luxury condition when the irrigation amount exceeded w0 8 it meant that the better nitrogen nutrition status was obtained either with higher nitrogen applied under lower irrigation amount or with lower nitrogen applied under higher irrigation therefore the nitrogen nutrition status in crops can be adjusted by controlled irrigation and nitrogen measures in present study the optimal nitrogen nutrition status was obtained under w1 0n300 followed by w1 0n350 4 5 soil no 3 n water soluble nitrogen fertilizers like urea can be accurately injected into cotton root zone with drip irrigation system patel and rajput 2011 ayyadurai and manickasundaram 2014 meanwhile a wetting zone with a gradient of water content will be formed near the emitter and a concentration gradient of the same shape of inorganic nitrogen in soil will also be formed because of the point source characteristics wang et al 1996 chen et al 2009 the conclusion was confirmed in the present study no 3 n distribution forms a concentration gradient over depth the application of nitrogen and the adsorption migration and transformation of ionic by crop root are the main reasons for nitrogen accumulation in soil ma et al 2012 thus there were dramatic increases in no 3 n in the soil profile for each treatment after experiment the more no 3 n accumulated in soil with the increase of nitrogen rate due to the increased of inorganic nitrogen yin et al 2007 similar to many previous studies we found that no 3 n mainly accumulated in the surface soil 0 30 cm in present experiment the reason for nitrogen accumulated in the surface soil was nitrogen application and the shedding of leaves and withered cotton qadir et al 1997 as we know nitrogen in the soil moves with water and the more water irrigated the more nitrogen migrates to deeper soils therefore more nitrogen dissolved in the water will move to the deeper soil with increasing irrigation amount meanwhile increasing irrigation amount promoted cotton growth and enhanced the nitrogen uptake ability of cotton resulting in a decrease in nitrogen content in the surface soil 0 30 cm and increase that in deeper soils 40 80 cm 5 conclusions irrigation and nitrogen application promoted cotton growth and seed cotton yield but reduced harvest index increasing irrigation amount or nitrogen rate had no significant effect on seed cotton yield when irrigation amount exceeded 100 etc or nitrogen rate was over 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen accumulation increased with the increase of water and nitrogen regimes nitrogen concentration increased with the increase of nitrogen rate while decreased with the increasing irrigation amount the optimal nitrogen nutrition status was obtained under w1 0n300 followed by w1 0n350 meanwhile the optimal dry matter seed cotton yield nre and total nitrogen accumulation all occurred under w1 0n350 which improved seed cotton yield while provided an acceptable nitrogen status w1 0n350 was thus considered as the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate for achieving the goal of high seed cotton yield and saving fertilizer however the applicability of the developed critical nitrogen dilution curve model needs to be

9957,irrigation and fertilization are the two most important measures to ensure the agricultural development in arid regions however there is still a lack of reasonable irrigation and fertilization strategy in xinjiang the largest cotton producing area in china which causes a waste of resources and a reduction in cotton yield and pollutes the environment this study investigated the effects of four irrigation amounts w0 6 60 etc w0 8 80 etc w1 0 100 etc and w1 2 120 etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration and four nitrogen rates n250 250 kg n ha 1 n300 300 kg n ha 1 n350 350 kg n ha 1 and n400 400 kg n ha 1 on seed cotton yield nitrogen nutrition status and soil nitrogen residue so as to explore the optimal water nitrogen coupling strategy to increase cotton production and water fertilizer use efficiency while reducing environmental pollution the nitrogen dilution curves were built to assess the nitrogen nutrition status of cotton the results showed that increasing irrigation amount increased dry matter and seed cotton yield but decreased harvest index nitrogen application enhanced the nitrogen concentration and accumulation in cotton irrigation decreased the nitrogen concentration but increased the nitrogen accumulation by increasing the dry matter the highest total plant nitrogen accumulation was obtained under w1 2n400 223 88 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 242 77 kg ha 1 in 2019 with the increase of irrigation amount agronomic nitrogen utilization efficiency anue first increased and then decreased increasing irrigation amount increased nitrogen recovery efficiency nre but reduced physiological nitrogen utilization efficiency pnue pnue and anue decreased with the increasing nitrogen rate while nre first increased and then decreased soil no 3 n content increased with the increase of nitrogen rate irrigation reduced no 3 n content in the surface soil 0 30 cm while increased that in the deeper soil 40 80 cm the optimal nitrogen nutrition status was found under w1 0n300 followed by w1 0n350 furthermore the optimal dry matter seed cotton yield nre and total nitrogen accumulation were obtained under w1 0n350 which was considered as the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate in this study keywords seed cotton yield nitrogen uptake nitrogen nutrition status nitrogen use efficiency soil no 3 n 1 introduction water shortage and soil salinization are the two main constraints for the development of agriculture in arid and semi arid areas around the world hou et al 2009 irrigation and fertilization are the two most important measures for agricultural producers in these regions to maintain crop yield and quality drechsel et al 2013 xinjiang is the largest cotton producing area in china because of its unique climate suitable for cotton growth however the shortage of water resources caused by scarce rainfall and intense evaporation has seriously restricted the development of the cotton industry in this region wang et al 2011 since 1990s the soil mulching and drip irrigation has been applied in xinjiang because of its advantage of conserving soil moisture moderating soil temperature reducing insect and disease and increasing crop yield zhou et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 there is more than 2 106 ha of the cotton with drip irrigation under plastic mulch in xinjiang accounting for about 58 5 of the planting area and 71 of the cotton yield tuerxun et al 2016 wang et al 2019 however due to the lack of scientific and reasonable management of irrigation amount and fertilization rate the irrigation amount in this area far exceeds the water required by cotton this situation not only wastes a lot of water aggravates the shortage of water resources but also raises the groundwater level and causes soil salinization to some extent wang et al 2011 there is also a lack of systematic management of fertilization rate in the field and the fertilizer rate largely depends on the experiences of local farmers which results in a waste of fertilizers environmental pollution and reduction in cotton yield khan et al 2017 therefore determining an optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy is of vital importance to the development of cotton production in xinjiang as the main source of nitrogen in agricultural ecosystems shan et al 2015 nitrogen fertilizer supply is an important factor to ensure crop growth many studies have pointed out that nitrogen application dramatically enhanced crop canopy area photosynthesis crop yield fiber quality and the resistance to abiotic stresses such as salinity stress and drought stress chen et al 2010a luo et al 2013 2018 wang et al 2019 zou et al 2020 in practical agricultural production there are mainly three fates for nitrogen applied in the farmland including crop absorption soil residues and emissions to the environment such as ammonia volatilization no x emissions and leaching etc wu and ma 2015 in general crop nitrogen absorption is conducive to the agricultural production and the nitrogen uptake by the plant will be converted into yield under certain conditions nitrogen residue in the soil and emissions to the environment will waste the fertilizer and pollute the environment shrestha et al 2010 sun et al 2020 abdo et al 2021 meanwhile with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer costs and the increasing concern about greenhouse gas emissions the nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency has attracted more and more attention from the scholars lu et al 2021 rochester et al 2007 many scholars have studied crop nitrogen uptake soil nitrogen residue and nitrogen utilization efficiency shareef et al 2019 pointed out that the nitrogen application under conventional irrigation broadcasted directly on the soil surface caused a large amount of nitrogen loss which significantly reduced nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency in contrast soluble nitrogen fertilizer can be accurately delivered to the root zone with the drippers under drip irrigation fan et al 2017 reducing the nitrogen loss during filed application and improving nitrogen utilization efficiency some studies have shown that the optimal nitrogen application and nitrogen utilization efficiency were mainly determined by soil fertility and field management and appropriately reducing nitrogen application rate can improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency janat 2008 luo et al 2018 generally speaking the rationality of nitrogen application can be assessed by analyzing the status of crop nutrient absorption although it is difficult to distinguish the nutrient source absorbed by crops rochester et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 proved that increasing nitrogen application promoted the nitrogen uptake by cotton which was inhibited by the irrigation with high salinity the critical nitrogen concentration and nitrogen nutrition index nni proposed by lemaire and gasta 1997 are regularly used to assess the crops nitrogen nutrition status as we all know for crops nitrogen is an absolutely essential nutrient element to ensure growth but for soil and groundwater nitrogen might act as or be considered as a pollutant basso and ritchie 2005 ju et al 2006 concluded that the high nitrogen accumulation rate and free drainage were the conditions of nitrogen moving into the deeper soil and groundwater therefore reducing nitrogen residues in the soil is a main measure to alleviate the adverse effects of nitrogen on the environment under certain soil conditions studies have shown that continuous fertilization increased the nitrogen concentration in the soil because of limited nitrogen absorption by crop roots wang et al 1996 yin et al 2007 ma et al 2012 wang et al 1996 discovered that after fertigation the content of no 3 n and nh 4 n in the soil decreased over soil depth mainly concentrated in the upper soil layer 0 20 cm in areas with abundant rainfall such as the hai river basin the no 3 n content in the soil continued to decrease over time due to the nitrogen leaching caused by rainwater and crop absorption yin et al 2007 although nitrogen nutrition status in cotton has widely investigated based on critical nitrogen dilution curves the relationships between the fitted coefficients of critical nitrogen dilution curves and irrigation amount have been rarely explored we hypothesized that an optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate can improve the seed cotton yield while keeping cotton under an acceptable nitrogen nutrition status achieving the goal of high crop yield and saving fertilizer our specific objectives were i to investigate the effects of water and nitrogen application on seed cotton yield and harvest index ii to establish a uniform critical nitrogen dilution curve that can diagnose cotton n nutrition status under various irrigation regimes and determine the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate and iii to analyze variations in soil nitrogen residues under various irrigation amounts and nitrogen rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the field experiment was conducted at the experimental station in korla 40 53 n 86 56 e xinjiang china fig s1 in

determination of nc dilution model inconsistent with dry matter nitrogen concentration decreased over time increasing nitrogen rate had a positive effect on dry matter and nitrogen concentration and irrigation amount decreased nitrogen concentration while increased dry matter fig 5 data points from each sampling from 73 to 153 das in 2018 were used to determine the nc points by following the method proposed by justes et al 1994 above ground dry matter under the four irrigation amounts ranged from 2 97 to 25 14 mg ha 1 all over 1 mg ha 1 and nitrogen concentration ranged from 0 90 to 1 96 g 100 g 1 the critical nitrogen dilution curves were established fig 6 and the model parameters are shown in table 5 as seen from the table 5 a and b increased with the increase of irrigation amount and the increase trend conformed to the quadratic equation therefore a and b were fitted linearly with the corresponding irrigation amounts the fitting equations were as follows 11 a 6 53623 10 6 i 2

to validate the curves irrigation amount and above ground dry matter in 2019 were substituted into eq 13 to calculate the simulation value and a 1 1 histogram was displayed to show the relationship between simulated and measured values rmse and n rmse were calculated to evaluate the model accuracy fig 7 as seen from fig 7 rmse of 0 1135 g 100 g 1 and n rmse of 7 4333 were obtained indicating that the model was extremely stable and could be used for cotton nitrogen nutrition diagnosis 3 3 3 nitrogen nutrition diagnosis based on the critical nitrogen dilution curve model the critical nitrogen dilution curves built in 2018 were used to determine the critical nitrogen concentration under different irrigation amounts in 2019 eq 9 was used to calculate nni and evaluate cotton nitrogen nutrition status fig 8 nni decreased gradually over time nni showed an increasing trend with the increase of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate under the extreme water deficit condition w0 6 nni of each nitrogen rate was less than 1 after 120das under w0 8 nni obtained at n400 was all over 1 under w1 0 nni obtained at n300 fluctuated around 1 throughout the whole cotton growing season nni obtained at n350 and n400 were all greater than 1 under w1 0 and w1 2 nni under n250 was all less than 1 under various irrigation amounts 3 4 soil no 3 n irrigation amount and nitrogen rate had significant effects on soil no 3 n accumulation in the 0 40 cm soil profile fig 9 in 2018 the no 3 n accumulation in the 0 40 cm soil profile was 381 7 439 76 485 03 and 522 58 kg ha 1 in n250 n300 n350 and n400 under w0 6 under w0 8 the corresponding accumulation was 378 80 416 07 463 32 and 508 87 kg ha 1 under w1 0 the corresponding accumulation was 331 88 375 09 427 99 and 464 47 kg ha 1 under w1 2 the corresponding accumulation was 304 44 340 31 375 81 and 403 43 kg ha 1 in 2019 the no 3 n accumulation was 387 42 449 05 518 28 and 593 81 kg ha 1 in n250 n300 n350 and n400 under w0 6 under w0 8 the corresponding accumulation was 375 21 424 03 494 13 and 545 18 kg ha 1 under w1 0 the corresponding accumulation was 335 72 383 68 444 70 and 489 58 kg ha 1 under w1 2 the corresponding accumulation was 295 98 336 17 403 72 and 434 66 kg ha 1 more no 3 n accumulated in the surface soil 0 30 cm in this study and gradually decreased over soil depth with the increase of irrigation amount no 3 n accumulation decreased because of the nitrogen leaching and cotton nitrogen uptake with the increase of irrigation amount no 3 n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer decreased while that in the 30 40 cm soil layer increased in 2018 with the increase of irrigation amount the proportion of no 3 n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer decreased from 57 77 to 53 09 and that in the 20 40 cm soil layer increased from 42 23 to 46 91 in 2019 the corresponding changes decreased from 60 67 to 52 44 in the 0 20 cm soil layer and increased from 39 33 to 47 56 in the 20 40 cm soil layer in this study soil no 3 n distribution in the 0 80 cm soil layer was analyzed after irrigation for each treatment in 2019 no 3 n accumulated mainly in the surface soil 0 30 cm fig 10 no 3 n content of each treatment increased with the increase of nitrogen rate increasing irrigation caused the wetting area to diffuse into deeper soils and nitrogen dissolved in the water will move to deeper soils with water increasing no 3 n content in deep soils 4 discussion 4 1 seed cotton yield and harvest index drip fertigation under mulching film has been widely adopted in xinjiang of china in recent years due to its advantages of saving water and improving yield dai and dong 2014 li et al 2019 however the optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen regimes has not yet been determined in this region irrational drip fertigation strategies cause crop yield reduction resource waste and soil pollution some studies have pointed out that seed cotton yield was mainly affected by the boll number and boll weight both of which decreased with increasing drought stress thereby reducing seed cotton yield mert 2005 wang et al 2010 however some researches found that 20 25 reduction of full irrigation had no significant effect on the seed cotton yield karam et al 2006 kang et al 2012 in the present study with the increase of the water supply seed cotton yield increased compared to w1 0 w1 2 had little effect on the increase of seed cotton yield cotton suffered from salinity stress besides water and fertilizer stresses due to the saline alkali soil in the present study more irrigation was required to ensure cotton growth therefore the inflection point of irrigation amount on the increase of seed cotton yield appeared at w1 0 100 etc instead of w0 8 80 etc under multiple stresses fertilizer supply can effectively improve the resistance of cotton to abiotic stress like salinity stresses chen et al 2010a drought stresses khan et al 2017 and provide essential nutrients for crops to ensure growth and yield formation a reasonable level of nitrogen fertilizer application is essential to ensure crop growth studies have shown that either deficiency or excessive would reduce crop yields aujla et al 2005 lokhande and reddy 2015 wang et al 2012 indicated that with the increase of nitrogen application the seed cotton first increased and then decreased and the highest seed cotton yield appeared at 360 kg n ha 1 this study further confirmed the promoting effect of nitrogen on cotton growth and seed cotton yield the seed cotton yield reached the maximum at 350 kg n ha 1 while further increasing nitrogen rate had no positive effect on seed cotton yield as an important indicator to evaluate the seed cotton yield and cultivation effectiveness harvest index have been studied by some scholars similar to previous findings mustafa et al 2011 dong et al 2012 luo et al 2018 we found that water deficit reduced the biological yield and seed cotton yield but increased harvest index harvest index increased from 0 2810 to 0 3534 in 2018 and increased from 0 2871 to 0 3469 in 2019 when irrigation amount decreased from w1 2 to w0 6 this result meant that under water deficit larger proportion of assimilate was allocated to reproductive organs we found that both irrigation amount and nitrogen rate has a promoting effect on seed cotton yield and dry matter through regression analysis but the effect would gradually decreased with the increase of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate the change trend of seed cotton yield with the increase of water and nitrogen regimes was consistent with that of above ground dry matter indicating that the increase of dry matter caused the increase of seed cotton yield with the increase of nitrogen rate the biological yield and seed cotton yield increased while the harvest index decreased the results proved that the vegetative growth of cotton was promoted by the increase of nitrogen rate resulting in the decreased in harvest index boquet and breitenbeck 2000 4 2 crop nitrogen uptake analyzing the nutrient absorption status of crop can help to judge whether the fertilization rate is reasonable rochester et al 2009 nitrogen application can increase the inorganic nitrogen content in soils yin et al 2007 making it easier for crops to absorb nitrogen from the soil and increase the crop nitrogen uptake studies have also found that the nitrogen absorption capacity of crops was affected by soil salinization zhang et al 2012 found that higher lint yield and nitrogen uptake were achieved either under moderate nitrogen rater with moderate salinity or under low nitrogen rate with high salinity in our study nitrogen uptake in different organs except for root and stem of cotton and the total were significantly affected by irrigation amount and nitrogen rate nitrogen concentration decreased while accumulation increased with the increase of irrigation amount indicating that irrigation increased nitrogen accumulation mainly by increasing dry matter increasing nitrogen rate could promote crop growth and nitrogen accumulation when nitrogen rate was less than 350 kg n ha 1 cotton was under luxury nitrogen condition when nitrogen rate exceeded 350 kg n ha 1 which had no significant effect on the increase of nitrogen accumulation there was no significant difference in cotton nitrogen uptake among w1 0 and w1 2 n350 and n400 which was consistent with that of seed cotton yield 4 3 nitrogen utilization efficiency as the most demanding macronutrient for cotton nitrogen is used in large quantities in cotton production hou et al 2007 in recent years the increasing nitrogen fertilizer costs and greenhouse gas emissions caused by nitrogen application have attracted growing attention bronson 2008 rochester et al 2009 understanding the influence of different irrigation and nitrogen regimes on nitrogen utilization efficiency will help policy makers to make reasonable nitrogen application modes reduce nitrogen input and the negative impact of excessive nitrogen applied on the environment and increase economic benefit rochester 2011 anue is an indicator that represents the increase in seed cotton yield per unit of nitrogen application novoa and loomis 1981 in the present study anue first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount in both years and the highest anue was obtained under w1 0 13 00 in 2018 and 12 71 in 2019 the results indicated that increasing irrigation amount increased seed cotton yield without n applied but excessive irrigation had no significant effect on seed cotton yield with n applied and may even leached nitrogen in root zone thereby reducing anue as an indicator of the nitrogen uptake potential of crops fang et al 2006 nre increased with the increase of irrigation amount and nre first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate with the highest nre under n350 the results indicated that increasing water and nitrogen application could make a better growth environment for cotton due to the saline alkali soil at the test site thereby improving nitrogen absorption capacity of cotton however cotton growth was inhibited under luxury nitrogen condition resulting in a decrease in nre under n400 pnue decreased with the increase of irrigation and nitrogen application seed cotton yield increased with increasing nitrogen rate but the increase rate gradually decreased which was the reason why anue and pnue decreased with increasing nitrogen rate 4 4 critical nitrogen dilution curve model lemaire and gasta 1997 proposed the concept of critical nitrogen concentration and then defined the nitrogen nutrition index to evaluate the crops nitrogen nutrition status in general by analyzing the actual nitrogen concentration of above ground dry matter and the critical nitrogen concentration the crop nitrogen nutrition status can be obtained ma et al 2019 therefore the nitrogen dilution curve model fitted by the critical nitrogen concentration has been widely used to assess the nitrogen nutrition status of crops many papers have used the nitrogen dilution curve to study the nitrogen nutrition status of crops such as winter wheat yue et al 2012 rice yao et al 2014 corn qiang et al 2015 ziadi et al 2008 rapeseed colnenne et al 1998 tomato tei et al 2002 potato giletto et al 2020 sweet pepper youzhen et al 2016 etc in the present study the critical nitrogen concentration in the above ground dry matter in 2018 was used to fit the critical nitrogen dilution curve and the parameters a and b were determined we found parameters a and b had linear relationships with the corresponding irrigation amount and performed a quadratic fitting a r2 0 99611 b r2 0 99905 the critical nitrogen dilution curves under different irrigation amounts were determined the models were validated using data acquired in 2019 and results showed that the model was very stable and could be used to diagnose crop nitrogen nutrition status rmse 0 1135 g 100 g 1 n rmse 7 4333 the nitrogen nutrition index nni can be used to quantitatively assess the intensity of nitrogen deficiency and luxury consumption lemaire and gastal 1997 the practicality of nni is emphasized by the fact that the relationship between the critical nitrogen concentration and crop mass will keep stable with changing major environmental factors lemaire et al 2008 by studying the changes of nni at different growth stages the time of nitrogen application can be optimized to achieve the balance of nitrogen supply and demand for cotton in present study nni decreased over time indicating that cotton was more prone under nitrogen deficiency in the later growth period nni increased with the increase of irrigation and nitrogen application nni under w0 6 were all less 1 after 120 das indicating cotton was in nitrogen deficiency nni under n350 and n400 was in nitrogen luxury condition when the irrigation amount exceeded w0 8 it meant that the better nitrogen nutrition status was obtained either with higher nitrogen applied under lower irrigation amount or with lower nitrogen applied under higher irrigation therefore the nitrogen nutrition status in crops can be adjusted by controlled irrigation and nitrogen measures in present study the optimal nitrogen nutrition status was obtained under w1 0n300 followed by w1 0n350 4 5 soil no 3 n water soluble nitrogen fertilizers like urea can be accurately injected into cotton root zone with drip irrigation system patel and rajput 2011 ayyadurai and manickasundaram 2014 meanwhile a wetting zone with a gradient of water content will be formed near the emitter and a concentration gradient of the same shape of inorganic nitrogen in soil will also be formed because of the point source characteristics wang et al 1996 chen et al 2009 the conclusion was confirmed in the present study no 3 n distribution forms a concentration gradient over depth the application of nitrogen and the adsorption migration and transformation of ionic by crop root are the main reasons for nitrogen accumulation in soil ma et al 2012 thus there were dramatic increases in no 3 n in the soil profile for each treatment after experiment the more no 3 n accumulated in soil with the increase of nitrogen rate due to the increased of inorganic nitrogen yin et al 2007 similar to many previous studies we found that no 3 n mainly accumulated in the surface soil 0 30 cm in present experiment the reason for nitrogen accumulated in the surface soil was nitrogen application and the shedding of leaves and withered cotton qadir et al 1997 as we know nitrogen in the soil moves with water and the more water irrigated the more nitrogen migrates to deeper soils therefore more nitrogen dissolved in the water will move to the deeper soil with increasing irrigation amount meanwhile increasing irrigation amount promoted cotton growth and enhanced the nitrogen uptake ability of cotton resulting in a decrease in nitrogen content in the surface soil 0 30 cm and increase that in deeper soils 40 80 cm 5 conclusions irrigation and nitrogen application promoted cotton growth and seed cotton yield but reduced harvest index increasing irrigation amount or nitrogen rate had no significant effect on seed cotton yield when irrigation amount exceeded 100 etc or nitrogen rate was over 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen accumulation increased with the increase of water and nitrogen regimes nitrogen concentration increased with the increase of nitrogen rate while decreased with the increasing irrigation amount the optimal nitrogen nutrition status was obtained under w1 0n300 followed by w1 0n350 meanwhile the optimal dry matter seed cotton yield nre and total nitrogen accumulation all occurred under w1 0n350 which improved seed cotton yield while provided an acceptable nitrogen status w1 0n350 was thus considered as the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate for achieving the goal of high seed cotton yield and saving fertilizer however the applicability of the developed critical nitrogen dilution curve model needs to be further verified in other cotton species and regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

performed using the statistical software program spss sigmaplot was used for graphing and arcgis was used to mark experimental locations 3 results 3 1 overall effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation on maize yield wue and nue the meta analysis showed that straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly increased maize yields rr 0 0862 and 0 0996 respectively wue rr 0 1480 and 0 1404 respectively and nue rr 0 0722 and 0 0931 respectively but the three parameters did not differ between straw returning methods fig 2 for both straw returning methods the regression analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between yield and wue but not between wue and nue the straw incorporation yield had a positive correlation with nue but the straw mulching yield had no relationship with nue fig 3 3 2 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation at different n application rates and straw returning amounts on maize yield wue and nue both straw returning methods significantly increased maize yield and nue at the three n application rates fig 4a c more so at the lowest rate 150 kg ha 1 straw mulching significantly improved wue with the three n application rates while straw incorporation only improved wue at the medium n application rate fig 4b the rrs for straw incorporation yield had a significant negative correlation with n application rate table 1 maize yield and wue increased significantly and linearly with n application rate but nue decreased for both straw returning methods fig 5a c e straw incorporation and straw mulching significantly increased maize yield and nue for the different straw returning amounts the rrs for yield and nue under straw incorporation were significantly higher than straw mulching at the lowest straw returning amount 6000 kg ha 1 fig 4d f straw mulching significantly improved wue for the three straw returning amounts while straw incorporation only improved wue at straw returning amounts from 6000 to 9000 kg ha 1 fig 4e the maize yield under straw incorporation had a positive correlation with straw returning amount and the nue under straw mulching had a negative correlation with straw returning amount fig 5b f in addition the rrs of nue under straw mulching increased with increasing straw returning amount table 1 3 3 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation under different precipitation temperature and evaporation on maize yield wue and nue when annual average precipitation was 800 mm straw incorporation and straw mulching significantly increased yield wue and nue except wue under straw incorporation at 400 mm while annual average precipitation 800 mm had no significant effect fig 6d f the yield and nue of both straw returning methods increased with increasing annual average precipitation fig 7a e the rrs of yield and nue had significant negative correlations with precipitation under straw incorporation when annual average precipitation was 800 mm table 1 both straw returning methods significantly increased yield wue and nue for each evaporation value except nue under straw incorporation at evaporation 1200 mm fig 6g i when annual average evaporation was 1200 mm straw incorporation increased yield and nue more than straw mulching when annual average evaporation was 1200 mm straw mulching increased yield and nue more than straw incorporation fig 6g i maize yield decreased with increasing annual average evaporation under straw incorporation and straw mulching fig 7b straw incorporation decreased wue with increasing annual average evaporation but this did not occur for straw mulching fig 7d the rrs for yield and nue had significant positive correlations with evaporation under both straw returning methods table 1 straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly increased yield and nue at all temperature values except nue under straw mulching at 7 c fig 6a c the rrs for nue on straw mulching had a positive correlation with temperature and the rrs for yield and nue on straw incorporation had a negative correlation with temperature table 1 3 4 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation under different soil textures on maize yield wue and nue both straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly improved yield wue and nue in loam soil more so with straw incorporation fig 9a c in clay loam soil and clay soil straw incorporation significantly improved maize yield and nue while straw mulching only improved maize yield fig 9a c straw mulching significantly increased wue in sandy soil 4 discussion 4 1 effect of n application rate and straw returning amount on yield wue and nue under straw mulching and straw incorporation many studies believe that straw decomposition consumes and fixes some n straw returning increases the soil c n ratio and decreases n mineralization lu et al 2015 such that chemical n fertilizer is required when returning straw to the field our research found that straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly increased maize yield and nue at three n application rates with the greatest weighted response ratio found with an n application rate 100 kg ha 1 fig 4a c high n application levels increased maize yield and wue to a certain extent and reduced nue fig 5c with negative effects on the soil microbial community and structural diversity shu et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in the long term high n application rates will waste soil resources and harm sustainable agricultural development an appropriate amount of straw returning to the field is conducive to improving crop growth yield wue and nue for example 50 broken straw mulch with subsoil tillage improved spring maize production in the huanghuaihai area tao et al 2015 however excessive straw hinders normal crop growth wang et al 2009 found that returning 13 500 kg ha 1 straw to the field without chemical fertilizer reduced maize yield our study revealed that straw returning increased yield and nue at straw returning amounts 6000 kg ha 1 but not 6000 kg ha 1 and straw incorporation had a more positive effect than straw mulching fig 4d f this is because straw mulching results in a conflict between straw decomposition and crop n utilization thus insufficient soil available n reduces maize yield tao et al 2015 xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 4 2 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation under different precipitation temperature and evaporation on yield wue and nue straw returning can reduce soil evaporation dong et al 2018 yu et al 2018 and improve farmland soil moisture wang et al 2011 in arid and semi arid regions water is the most important limiting factor for maize production li et al 2013a 2013b in arid and semi arid areas with annual average precipitation 400 mm and annual average evaporation 1200 mm straw mulching increased maize yield wue and nue more than straw incorporation fig 6d i maize yield under straw mulching had a positive relationship with maize wue because straw mulching reduces soil surface evaporation and improves soil hydrothermal conditions while straw mulching has a greater impact on soil moisture than soil nitrogen increasing maize yield liu et al 2020 however in semi humid areas with 400 600 mm straw incorporation significantly increased maize yield and nue more than straw mulching fig 6d f straw decomposes more readily when buried in soil increasing soil nutrient content and nutrient availability bradford and peterson 2000 the increased maize yield under straw incorporation is related to an increase in maize nue furthermore the rrs of nue decreased with increasing annual average precipitation for both straw mulching and straw incorporation table 1 which may be because straw returning creates an oxygen deficient environment in years of heavy rainfall emitting more n2o and reducing nue g zhou et al 2017 y zhou et al 2017 temperature has an important effect on plant growth straw mulching can reduce soil temperature during early maize growth which may not benefit maize yield gao et al 2009 lu et al 2015 however we found that straw mulching had positive yield effects at different annual average temperature ranges and straw incorporation had a greater effect than straw mulching at annual average temperatures 7 c fig 6a which may be because straw mulching lowers the soil surface temperature and negatively affects maize production at annual average temperatures 11 c maize yield and nue were inversely related to temperature and the rrs of yield and nue decreased with increasing annual average temperature fig 8b e f table 1 this may be because summer maize is generally grown in areas where average annual temperatures are 11 c and summers are hot and rainy the increased soil moisture content after returning straw to the field reduces soil aeration adversely affecting maize growth when annual average temperatures are 11 c straw mulching had a greater effect on wue than straw incorporation fig 8c d soil surface water generally evaporates quickly in areas with higher temperatures straw mulching reduces the daily change in soil surface temperature yang et al 2020 reduces soil evaporation increases soil water content and thus increases wue therefore we recommend using straw incorporation in areas where annual average temperatures are 7 c and straw mulching in areas where annual average temperatures are 13 c 4 3 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation with soil texture on yield wue and nue straw returning significantly changes the soil physical structure promotes soil aggregate formation reduces soil bulk density and increases total porosity of the topsoil xu et al 2018 in clay loam clay and loam soils straw incorporation improved maize yield more than straw mulching fig 9a c as straw buried in the tillage layer is more likely to decompose improving soil physical and chemical properties and promoting aggregate formation however it is not conducive to soil ventilation and root respiration in clay loam and clay soils with poor drainage affecting maize growth and development lu et al 2015 ji et al 2014 reported that straw returning in loam soil improved soil enzyme activity more than in clay soil our results showed that both straw incorporation and straw mulching had the most significant effect on yield wue nue in loam soil fig 9a c which may be because straw returning improves soil physical and chemical properties reduces water evaporation and improves crop wue in well drained loam soils yu et al 2018 5 conclusion both straw mulching and straw incorporation increased maize yield wue and nue in arid and semi arid areas straw mulching reduced water evaporation and increased maize yield better than straw burying in semi humid areas with annual average evaporation of 400 600 mm straw burying increased maize yield more than straw mulching a straw returning amount 6000 kg ha 1 and n application rate 100 kg ha 1 had the greatest positive effect on maize yield straw incorporation and straw mulching are widely used and our results offer options for straw returning in regions where it is likely to improve maize yields and identifies regions where

decomposes in soil it competes with crops for available n cai et al 2018 moreover large amounts of straw returned to the field intensifies this competition wang et al 2018 reducing crop yield some greenhouse gases such as n2o increase with straw incorporation huang et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 the effect of straw returning is complicated and varies with experimental duration straw returning amount climatic conditions soil texture and differences in water and n input levels qin et al 2015 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 soil texture usually determines soil aeration which affects soil microbial and soil enzyme activity related to straw decomposition the nitrogen application rate and straw returning amount influence the soil c n ratio akhtar et al 2019 döring et al 2005 appropriate nitrogen fertilizer applications promote straw decomposition and supplement the effective n consumed by decomposing straw wang et al 2018 furthermore the straw returning method affects crop yields zhang et al 2017 but no systematic comparison of the different responses of straw incorporation and straw mulching to yield wue and nue has been undertaken in this study we undertook a meta analysis to 1 analyze the effects of n application rate straw returning amount annual average precipitation temperature and evaporation and soil texture on maize yield wue and nue with straw mulching and straw incorporation 2 identify suitable methods of straw returning for different temperatures precipitation and soil textures in china 3 determine the appropriate of straw returning amount and n application rate 2 materials and methods 2 1 data search and collection we used straw returning or straw mulching and maize in the keyword search to collect peer reviewed journal articles from the china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net and web of science http apps webofknowledge com to avoid any bias we selected publications with the following criteria 1 field experiment 2 cropping system includes maize 3 included control no straw returning ck and treatments straw mulching or straw incorporation 4 means standard deviations or standard error and number of replications available or can be calculated 5 included yield or water use efficiency measurements we calculated nue as follows n u e y n where y is yield kg ha 1 and n is total n input from fertilizer kg ha 1 several observations with zero n input were excluded from the final dataset to avoid errors in the nue calculation the mean standard deviation sd or standard error se and number of replicates per treatment were acquired directly from each study for publications that did not report sd we calculated the average coefficient of variation within each dataset and estimated sd as follows wang and shangguan 2015 s d x c v where x is the mean of the treatment straw mulching or straw incorporation and control ck no straw returning groups annual mean temperature and precipitation for each site were obtained from individual publications if no meteorological information was provided it was obtained from the nearest meteorological station annual mean temperature and precipitation chinese meteorological data network http data cma cn annual mean evaporation national greenhouse data system http data sheshiyuanyi com weatherdata our dataset comprised data from 112 publications including 38 on straw mulching 69 on straw incorporation and five on straw mulching and straw incorporation fig s1 if the data appeared in a graph then getdata software was used to obtain data values fig 1 shows the locations of the maize cropping field experiments in the meta analysis of china 2 2 data analysis the natural log of the response ratio rr a metric commonly used in meta analyses was calculated to quantify the effects of straw mulching and straw incorporation on yield wue and nue the logarithm of the response ratio rr was calculated as follows hedges et al 1999 r r ln x t x c ln x t ln x c where rr is the ratio of the mean value for yield wue or nue in the treatment groups straw mulching or straw incorporation x t to that in the control group no straw returning x c the variance v of rr is v r r s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where s t and s c are standard deviations for the treatment straw mulching or straw incorporation groups and control no straw returning group respectively n t and n c are the sample sizes of the treatment straw mulching or straw incorporation groups and control no straw returning group the weights of the comparisons in the meta analysis were calculated as follows curtis and wang 1998 w i 1 v i where w i is a weighting factor for study i which is adjusted according to the total number of observations per site when multiple observations were extracted from the same study bai et al 2013 li et al 2015 studies with small variance among replicates have more weight the greater the weight the more important the indicator in the comprehensive evaluation process to derive the overall response effect of the treatments straw mulching or straw incorporation groups and control no straw returning group the weighted response ratio rr between the treatments straw mulching or straw incorporation groups and control no straw returning group was calculated as r r i 1 m j 1 k w i j r r i j i 1 m j 1 k w i j where rr is the weighted response ratio between the treatment plastic film mulch group and the control no plastic film mulch group m is the number of groups for comparison and k is the comparison number in the corresponding group the standard error of rr was calculated as follows s r r 1 i 1 m j 1 k w i j the 95 confidence interval 95 ci was calculated as follows 95 c i r r 1 96 s r r metawin2 1 was used to generate 95 confidence intervals around the logarithmic response ratios rr with 4999 iterations we applied a t test to determine variation in each variable between the control and treatment and the difference in rr between subgroups maillard and angers 2014 zhou et al 2017 the effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly differed if the 95 ci of a response variable did not overlap zero bai et al 2019 kuang et al 2021 the means of the categorical variables significantly differed if their 95 cis did not overlap xia et al 2018 yu et al 2018 regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between influencing factors nar sra ap ae at and yield wue and nue under straw incorporation and straw mulching in the meta analysis we also calculated the response ratios of yield wue and nue for each experimental study pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between response ratios and influencing factors nar sra ap ae at using a two tailed test these analyses were performed using the statistical software program spss sigmaplot was used for graphing and arcgis was used to mark experimental locations 3 results 3 1 overall effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation on maize yield wue and nue the meta analysis showed that straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly increased maize yields rr 0 0862 and 0 0996 respectively wue rr 0 1480 and 0 1404 respectively and nue rr 0 0722 and 0 0931 respectively but the three parameters did not differ between straw returning methods fig 2 for both straw returning methods the regression analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between yield and wue but not between wue and nue the straw incorporation yield had a positive correlation with nue but the straw mulching yield had no relationship with nue fig 3 3 2 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation at different n application rates and straw returning amounts on maize yield wue and nue both straw returning methods significantly increased maize yield and nue at the three n application rates fig 4a c more so at the lowest rate 150 kg ha 1 straw mulching significantly improved wue with the three n application rates while straw incorporation only improved wue at the medium n application rate fig 4b the rrs for straw incorporation yield had a significant negative correlation with n application rate table 1 maize yield and wue increased significantly and linearly with n application rate but nue decreased for both straw returning methods fig 5a c e straw incorporation and straw mulching significantly increased maize yield and nue for the different straw returning amounts the rrs for yield and nue under straw incorporation were significantly higher than straw mulching at the lowest straw returning amount 6000 kg ha 1 fig 4d f straw mulching significantly improved wue for the three straw returning amounts while straw incorporation only improved wue at straw returning amounts from 6000 to 9000 kg ha 1 fig 4e the maize yield under straw incorporation had a positive correlation with straw returning amount and the nue under straw mulching had a negative correlation with straw returning amount fig 5b f in addition the rrs of nue under straw mulching increased with increasing straw returning amount table 1 3 3 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation under different precipitation temperature and evaporation on maize yield wue and nue when annual average precipitation was 800 mm straw incorporation and straw mulching significantly increased yield wue and nue except wue under straw incorporation at 400 mm while annual average precipitation 800 mm had no significant effect fig 6d f the yield and nue of both straw returning methods increased with increasing annual average precipitation fig 7a e the rrs of yield and nue had significant negative correlations with precipitation under straw incorporation when annual average precipitation was 800 mm table 1 both straw returning methods significantly increased yield wue and nue for each evaporation value except nue under straw incorporation at evaporation 1200 mm fig 6g i when annual average evaporation was 1200 mm straw incorporation increased yield and nue more than straw mulching when annual average evaporation was 1200 mm straw mulching increased yield and nue more than straw incorporation fig 6g i maize yield decreased with increasing annual average evaporation under straw incorporation and straw mulching fig 7b straw incorporation decreased wue with increasing annual average evaporation but this did not occur for straw mulching fig 7d the rrs for yield and nue had significant positive correlations with evaporation under both straw returning methods table 1 straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly increased yield and nue at all temperature values except nue under straw mulching at 7 c fig 6a c the rrs for nue on straw mulching had a positive correlation with temperature and the rrs for yield and nue on straw incorporation had a negative correlation with temperature table 1 3 4 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation under different soil textures on maize yield wue and nue both straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly improved yield wue and nue in loam soil more so with straw incorporation fig 9a c in clay loam soil and clay soil straw incorporation significantly improved maize yield and nue while straw mulching only improved maize yield fig 9a c straw mulching significantly increased wue in sandy soil 4 discussion 4 1 effect of n application rate and straw returning amount on yield wue and nue under straw mulching and straw incorporation many studies believe that straw decomposition consumes and fixes some n straw returning increases the soil c n ratio and decreases n mineralization lu et al 2015 such that chemical n fertilizer is required when returning straw to the field our research found that straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly increased maize yield and nue at three n application rates with the greatest weighted response ratio found with an n application rate 100 kg ha 1 fig 4a c high n application levels increased maize yield and wue to a certain extent and reduced nue fig 5c with negative effects on the soil microbial community and structural diversity shu et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in the long term high n application rates will waste soil resources and harm sustainable agricultural development an appropriate amount of straw returning to the field is conducive to improving crop growth yield wue and nue for example 50 broken straw mulch with subsoil tillage improved spring maize production in the huanghuaihai area tao et al 2015 however excessive straw hinders normal crop growth wang et al 2009 found that returning 13 500 kg ha 1 straw to the field without chemical fertilizer reduced maize yield our study revealed that straw returning increased yield and nue at straw returning amounts 6000 kg ha 1 but not 6000 kg ha 1 and straw incorporation had a more positive effect than straw mulching fig 4d f this is because straw mulching results in a conflict between straw decomposition and crop n utilization thus insufficient soil available n reduces maize yield tao et al 2015 xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 4 2 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation under different precipitation temperature and evaporation on yield wue and nue straw returning can reduce soil evaporation dong et al 2018 yu et al 2018 and improve farmland soil moisture wang et al 2011 in arid and semi arid regions water is the most important limiting factor for maize production li et al 2013a 2013b in arid and semi arid areas with annual average precipitation 400 mm and annual average evaporation 1200 mm straw mulching increased maize yield wue and nue more than straw incorporation fig 6d i maize yield under straw mulching had a positive relationship with maize wue because straw mulching reduces soil surface evaporation and improves soil hydrothermal conditions while straw mulching has a greater impact on soil moisture than soil nitrogen increasing maize yield liu et al 2020 however in semi humid areas with 400 600 mm straw incorporation significantly increased maize yield and nue more than straw mulching fig 6d f straw decomposes more readily when buried in soil increasing soil nutrient content and nutrient availability bradford and peterson 2000 the increased maize yield under straw incorporation is related to an increase in maize nue furthermore the rrs of nue decreased with increasing annual average precipitation for both straw mulching and straw incorporation table 1 which may be because straw returning creates an oxygen deficient environment in years of heavy rainfall emitting more n2o and reducing nue g zhou et al 2017 y zhou et al 2017 temperature has an important effect on plant growth straw mulching can reduce soil temperature during early maize growth which may not benefit maize yield gao et al 2009 lu et al 2015 however we found that straw mulching had positive yield effects at different annual average temperature ranges and straw incorporation had a greater effect than straw mulching at annual average temperatures 7 c fig 6a which may be because straw mulching lowers the soil surface temperature and negatively affects maize production at annual average temperatures 11 c maize yield and nue were inversely related to temperature and the rrs of yield and nue decreased with increasing annual average temperature fig 8b e f table 1 this may be because summer maize is generally grown in areas where average annual temperatures are 11 c and summers are hot and rainy the increased soil moisture content after returning straw to the field reduces soil aeration adversely affecting maize growth when annual average temperatures are 11 c straw mulching had a greater effect on wue than straw incorporation fig 8c d soil surface water generally evaporates quickly in areas with higher temperatures straw mulching reduces the daily change in soil surface temperature yang et al 2020 reduces soil evaporation increases soil water content and thus increases wue therefore we recommend using straw incorporation in areas where annual average temperatures are 7 c and straw mulching in areas where annual average temperatures are 13 c 4 3 effect of straw mulching and straw incorporation with soil texture on yield wue and nue straw returning significantly changes the soil physical structure promotes soil aggregate formation reduces soil bulk density and increases total porosity of the topsoil xu et al 2018 in clay loam clay and loam soils straw incorporation improved maize yield more than straw mulching fig 9a c as straw buried in the tillage layer is more likely to decompose improving soil physical and chemical properties and promoting aggregate formation however it is not conducive to soil ventilation and root respiration in clay loam and clay soils with poor drainage affecting maize growth and development lu et al 2015 ji et al 2014 reported that straw returning in loam soil improved soil enzyme activity more than in clay soil our results showed that both straw incorporation and straw mulching had the most significant effect on yield wue nue in loam soil fig 9a c which may be because straw returning improves soil physical and chemical properties reduces water evaporation and improves crop wue in well drained loam soils yu et al 2018 5 conclusion both straw mulching and straw incorporation increased maize yield wue and nue in arid and semi arid areas straw mulching reduced water evaporation and increased maize yield better than straw burying in semi humid areas with annual average evaporation of 400 600 mm straw burying increased maize yield more than straw mulching a straw returning amount 6000 kg ha 1 and n application rate 100 kg ha 1 had the greatest positive effect on maize yield straw incorporation and straw mulching are widely used and our results offer options for straw returning in regions where it is likely to improve maize yields and identifies regions where straw returning is likely to have limited benefits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

9959,declining performance of avocado orchards growing in a clayey soil irrigated with treated wastewater tww for more than 5 years has been observed in israel measures studied to mitigate this were

exchange intrinsic water use efficiency leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf to the mitigation measures applied to a hass avocado orchard persea americana mill previously irrigated with tww for 7 years stomatal conductance g s of fw mix tuf and lfi was greater than that for tww on most measurement dates which increased net leaf co2 assimilation rate a leaf and intercellular co2 concentration ci increased g s reduced intrinsic water use efficiency wue determined from either 13c discrimination iwue or gas exchange wuei as compared to tww although the wue in tww was higher than that in mitigation treatments on most measurement dates the lower assimilation rates at leaf a leaf and whole tree a tree levels observed in tww indicate that tww irrigation had negative effects on tree physiological performance a strong negative relationship between wuei a leaf g s and g s was found in all treatments with highest wuei and lowest gs in tww leaf hydraulic conductance was also lowest for tww which may indicate that lower gas exchange was linked to lower water availability to the leaves overall the increased g s a leaf a tree and k leaf in fw mix and tuf relative to tww indicate that these mitigation measures are good candidates for improving orchard performance negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww in clayey soils comparing all treatments fw was the most effective keywords stomatal conductance net assimilation rate transpiration rate leaf hydraulic conductance leaf water potential 1 introduction avocado plantations in mediterranean regions are important for the grower s economy and fresh fruit requirement of society and since avocados are healthy and nutritional they are increasing in demand according to a recent market research report the global avocado market valued at us 13 64 bn in 2018 may reach a us 21 56 bn by 2026 www transparencymarketresearch com avocado market html estimated total water requirements of avocado are 650 mm during the rainless summer provided through irrigation plus 500 600 mm supplied from winter rain carr 2013 lahav and whiley 2002 peak water use in the rainless mediterranean summer is 3 5 mm day 1 carr 2013 and most cultivars are sensitive to both water deficits and excess soil water caused by poor drainage menzel and le lagadec 2014 for instance regulated deficit irrigation and water stress caused significant yield reduction in avocado in israel silber et al 2019 compared with non stressed chartzoulakis et al 2002 reported decreased photosynthesis and gs and changes in leaf anatomy of avocado grown in water stress water deficit similarly moderate or severe water stress decreased net co2 assimilation during periods of avocado fruit growth that would have probably caused fruitlet abscission schaffer and whiley 2003 silber et al 2012 in many parts of the world especially in arid and semiarid climates water demand exceeds the water supply from fresh water sources fao 2012 un environment 2019 as a consequence inter regional and international conflicts sometimes called water wars can occur pereira et al 2002 on the other hand the production of large quantities of wastewater and its disposal to surrounding areas is becoming a critical environmental and health hazard thus the scarcity of fresh water fw coupled with the need to manage ever growing quantities of wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants increased the need to use treated wastewater tww for irrigation long term application of tww to an avocado orchard is detrimental to plant water relations and sap flow nemera et al 2020 and leaf photosynthesis bernstein et al 2004 and can reduce yield by 20 40 assouline and narkis 2013 avocado is a highly salinity sensitive fruit crop carr 2013 and irrigation with marginal quality water of high salinity and other undesirable characteristics reduces productivity bernstein et al 2004 reported that avocado roots are more sensitive to salinity than shoots in california oster et al 2007 speculated that avocado yield declines by 65 for each unit increase of irrigation water electrical conductivity ec ds m 1 above a threshold level of 0 57 ds m 1 avocado growers in israel are advised not to use irrigation water containing more than 150 and 250 mg l 1 chloride for mexican and antillean rootstocks respectively carr 2013 poor soil aeration reduces oxygen supply leading to reduced root absorption of nutrients and water resulting in reduced tree performance kozlowski 1997 high sensitivity of avocado trees to low oxygen levels in the soil was reported in several investigations ferreyra et al 2010 valoras et al 1964 lower oxygen levels in avocado tree root zones in clay soils irrigated with tww were noted compared with those found in freshwater fw irrigated trees assouline and narkis 2013 yalin et al 2017 in both publications the conclusion was that low oxygen levels in the root zone was a major factor that caused yield reduction in general the reduction in tree growth and yield following long term irrigation with marginal quality water may be a result of the deterioration of soil physicochemical properties which reduce plant physiological performance climatic changes may also induce or worsen abiotic stresses like water deficit and heat stress hatfield and dold 2019 specifically increased global warming and drought are expected in the mediterranean basin climate which is mostly conducive for growing avocado therefore elucidating the combined effects of abiotic stresses on plants caused by irrigation with poor quality water in our case and climate variables governing gas exchange and plant water relations is important to anticipate potential problems schaffer and whiley 2003 suggested that leaf conductance is a more reliable early indicator of water stress in avocado than leaf water content leaf water potential and growth variables however moreno ortega et al 2019 did not find significant differences in gas exchange of avocado trees under different regimes of water supply mitigating detrimental effects of long term salinity and poor aeration in avocado orchards requires measures that will provide sufficient water to plants and minimize salt accumulation at least in the upper profile of the soil where most roots are located we recently reported the effect of the following four mitigation measures on avocado tree water relations freshwater fw blended water mix low frequency irrigation lfi and tuff trenches tuf along with control tww nemera et al 2020 we found that tree water use increased in all mitigation measures treatment ranking from highest to lowest sap flow canopy conductance and whole plant hydraulic conductance was fw tuf mix lfi tww the observed differences can result from changes in leaf water relations or from changes in canopy structure i e reduced leaf area previous work on the response of citrus to treated wastewater showed that the reduction in tree water use resulted from poorer leaf water relations and reduced leaf conductance which was associated with changes in leaf specific hydraulic conductance and root activity paudel et al 2018 changes in root hydraulic conductivity were also associated with aquaporin gene downregulation paudel et al 2017 indicating that tww can impact the whole water transport system here we report on the impact of the mitigation measures on avocado leaf water relations gas exchange and water use efficiency following our previous findings of increased water use of mitigation measures we ask to what extent leaf level processes were affected in particular i was stomatal conductance influenced and to what degree did mitigation measures affect gas exchange ii was water use efficiency influenced iii is there a relationship between the water use efficiency determined from gas exchange and 13c discrimination iv is the change in leaf gas exchange influenced by climatic variables and v are plant and soil water status water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance affected 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental platform and treatment description the experimental setup and treatments are described by nemera et al 2020 in brief the experiment was conducted in a mature commercial fruit bearing hass avocado orchard persea americana mill grafted on degania 117 rootstock at kibbutz yasur the western galilee israel the orchard was established in 2009 and was irrigated with secondary tww until 2016 when the study commenced the experiment consisted of four mitigation measures and a control with six replications in a randomized design treatments were 1 irrigation with freshwater fw using 2 drip lines for each row of trees 2 irrigation with a 1 1 ratio of tww and fw mix using 4 drip lines due to health regulations the mix of the two water sources was obtained by irrigation with two drip lines side by side one pipe for each type of water on both sides of the tree rows 3 low frequency irrigation with tww lfi obtained by adding a third drip line to each row of trees 4 tuff trenches tuf 0 3 m deep and 0 3 m wide that were dug about 0 3 m away from the tree trunks on both sides of the tree rows and filled with volcanic tuff of particle size ranging from 0 to 8 mm one drip lateral was laid on the tuff trenches on each side of the tree rows and irrigated with tww 5 treated wastewater tww i e control irrigation using 2 drip lines for each row of trees about 0 3 m from each side of the tree trunks irrigation frequency varied among the treatments tww fw and mix treatments were irrigated three times a week lfi was irrigated twice a week tuf trenches were irrigated every day from june 2016 to july 2018 and thereafter ten times a day all treatments were irrigated with the same amount of water per week determined from reference eto and crop factors each drip lateral consisted of a set of drippers with emitters of 0 7 or 1 6 l h 1 discharge uniram netafim spaced 0 3 m apart each plot comprised three rows with at least seven trees in each row tree spacing was 3 5 m and 6 m in and between rows respectively the average textural composition of the soil in the orchard was 58 clay 19 silt and 23 sand and the main physical properties reported by russo et al 2020 are saturated water content θs 0 88 m3 m 3 residual water content

mature current season sunlit leaves from four to eight trees for each treatment between 9 30 am and 14 30 pm using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor lincoln nebraska usa equipped with a led light source 6400 02b coupled to a sensor head irga and with a co2 mixer 6400 01 to modify the incoming air s co2 concentrations leaf gas exchange was measured on june 27 july 25 and august 28 in 2017 and june 4 august 26 and september 12 in 2018 the measured parameters were net co2 assimilation rate aleaf in µmol co2 m 2 s 1 stomatal conductance gs in mol h2o m 2 s 1 intercellular co2 concentration ci in µmol co2 m 2 s 1 and transpiration rate e in mmol h2o m 2 s 1 these measurements were made by maintaining photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of about 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 with 10 blue light and a co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 in the chamber during measurement air temperature and humidity in the chamber were set to match environmental conditions where the leaf temperature was between 24 and 32 4 c 2 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue the amount of carbon assimilated per unit of water used is determined from measurements of gas exchange and carbon isotope ratios of leaf dry matter in this study the focus is on an integrative intrinsic water use efficiency and instantaneous water use efficiency the short term intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated as net photosynthetic rate a leaf divided by stomatal conductance gs hatfield and dold 2019 the gas exchange based wue determined from co2 and water exchange at the leaf level on a short temporal scale is labor intensive and requires accessing leaves of tall trees yi et al 2019 therefore we analyzed the 13c discrimination derived intrinsic water use efficiency iwue as an indicator of long term trends in the internal regulation of carbon uptake and water loss of plants seibt et al 2008 leaf discrimination against 13c δ13c was calculated from the carbon isotope signature δ13c results and expressed in delta notation as parts per thousand deviations from the international carbon isotope standard following leonardi et al 2012 4 13 c δ 13 ca δ 13 cp 1 δ 13 cp 1000 where δ13ca and δ13cp are the respective isotopic ratios of atmospheric co2 and of plant material the δ13c measurement method has been described previously see nemera et al 2020 uni et al 2020 in brief samples were oven dried at 60 c for 48 h and ground to dust by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen measurements were performed using a 13co2 cavity ring down spectroscopy analyzer crds picarro g2131i picarro santa clara ca usa with combustion module equipped with an auto sampler ecs 4010 costech analytical valencia ca usa international standards iaea ch 3 cellulose international atomic energy agency vienna austria were used for calibration the δ13c derived iwue can provide a time integrated measure of wue over the course of the growing season because of the seasonal storage of co2 assimilated during the growing season belmecheri et al 2014 frank et al 2015 the iwue was determined from δ13c as described by leonardi et al 2012 5 iwue 0 625 ca b 13 c b a where ca is the atmospheric co2 concentration in ppm δ13c is the leaf discrimination against 13c 0 625 is the ratio between the stomatal conductance to co2 and water vapor a is a constant for the leaf level discrimination against 13c in diffusion through the stomata 4 4 and b is a constant for the enzymatic carbon fixation by ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase 27 2 5 tree scale carbon assimilation rate tree scale carbon assimilation rate a tree was determined from δ13c derived intrinsic water use efficiency iwue eq 5 and gs klein et al 2016 as follows 6 atree iwue gs the gs was determined from measured individual tree transpiration rate t and vpd following beer et al 2009 klein et al 2016 7 gs t vpd 2 6 leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance midday stem water potential ψstem measurements were made on fully matured leaves taken from five trees for each mitigation treatment using a pressure chamber arimad m r c ltd israel ψstem was measured on june 14 july 6 and 19 august 7 and 21 in 2017 and on

prior to anova normality and variance homogeneity assumptions were tested by using the shapiro wilk w and the levene s test respectively when significant differences among means were found tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test was used to compare mean values 3 results 3 1 climate variables there was much variability in climatic conditions between measurement years and dates fig 1 the

temperature 27 0 c and rh 51 were recorded in june 2018 june 2018 and august 2017 respectively 3 2 leaf gas exchange differences in leaf gas exchange between treatments for different measurement periods were not always consistent a leaf in fw and mix was significantly higher than tww in july 2017 june 2018 august 2018 and september 2018 p 0 05 fig 2a the a leaf in tuf was significantly higher than tww in july 2017 june 2018 and august 2018 fig 2a the values of a leaf in lfi were intermediate between tww and the other three remediation measures the values of a tree were consistently higher in all mitigation measures than in tww particularly fw mix and tuf but differences were not statistically significant the ranges of values of a tree for fw mix tuf lfi and tww were 229 476 204 468 214 440 195 439 and 178 412 g c per tree day 1 fig 2b respectively the gs in fw was significantly higher than tww on all measurement dates except august 2017 fig 3a the gs in tww was significantly lower than mix in june 2018 august 2018 and september 2018 and tuf in july 2017 june 2018 and august 2018 fig 3a the ci in fw was significantly higher than tww in june 2017 and august 2018 fig 3b ci values in mix and tuf were significantly higher than tww only in august 2018 fig 3b the e was significantly higher in fw and mix than in tww on all measurement dates except june 2017 for fw and june 2017 and july 2017 for mix fig 3c the values of e in tuf were significantly higher than in tww on all measurement dates except in june 2017 and september 2018 fig 3c 3 3 water use efficiency the integrative intrinsic water use efficiency iwue determined from δ13c was significantly higher in tww than in fw mix and tuf in 2018 p 0 05 fig 4 values of gas exchange measurement based instantaneous intrinsic water use efficiency wuei were not consistent between measurement dates the wuei was significantly higher in tww than in fw in june 2017 august 2018 and september 2018 p 0 05 fig 5 and in tuf in august 2018 p 0 05 fig 5 the relationship between wuei and a leaf showed inconsistent trends for all treatments fig 6b yet in general an inverse type relationship was noted between wuei and g s showing that an increase in g s led to a decrease in wuei fig 6a regression analysis of wuei vs a leaf and wuei vs g s are shown in table 1 a high correlation was found between iwue and wuei in the three sampling dates in 2018 with slopes very close to 1 0 in august and september 2018 fig 7b and 7c 3 4 leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance the seasonal stem water potential ψstem mpa measurements show that there was significantly higher ψstem in fw on may 21 2018 june 11 2018 and august 6 2018 p 0 05 fig 8 the values of the ψstem in tuf were significantly lower than tww on june 25 2018 p 0 05 fig 8 the determination of water potential gradient revealed that the soil water potential ψsoil p 0 05 fig 9a determined based on pre dawn leaf water potential was significantly higher in fw than tww with no significant differences between mitigation measures and the control in ψstem fig 9b and ψleaf fig 9c leaf hydraulic conductance kleaf determined from leaf transpiration rate and the leaf water potential gradient showed that kleaf was significantly higher in fw and tuf than in tww p 0 05 fig 9d 4 discussion the results of our study demonstrate that the mitigation measures fw mix and tuf increased leaf gas exchange and leaf hydraulic conductance and decreased water use efficiency of mature avocado trees relative to tww on most measurement dates specifically gs was significantly higher in fw on five out of six measurement days and in both mix and tuf in three out of six measurements as compared to tww p 0 05 fig 3a the significantly lower g s and ci in tww relative to fw with no significant reduction in a leaf and e in june 2017 shows the onset of stress from our data it seems that g s is the most sensitive gas exchange trait affected by the long term irrigation with treated wastewater stomatal closure or the reduction of stomatal opening in avocado is an early indicator of water stress carr 2013 plaguezuelo et al 2018 also indicated that stomatal closure in avocado in a mediterranean climate is rapid and is an early indicator of water stress associated with changes in leaf anatomy restricting the diffusion of co2 the a leaf in tww was also significantly lower than both fw and mix in four out of six measurements and tuf in three out of six measurements fig 2a the lower a leaf and g s indicate that trees in tww might be under water stress from various reasons discussed elsewhere assouline and narkis 2013 paudel et al 2018 2017 2016a rahav et al 2017 soda et al 2017 in addition to the plant response observed in this study long term irrigation with tww deteriorates soil aggregate stability levy et al 2011 and increases soil repellency to water nadav et al 2013 schacht and marschner 2015 wallach et al 2005 leading to non uniform distribution of water in the rhizosphere under such a heterogeneous conditions water availability to the plant uptake may be limited moreover the higher salinity in tww might have impacted the osmotic potential gradient of the soil root junction particularly compared to fw and mix reduced plant water uptake in tww relative to fw mix and tuf was found in the same orchard from measurements of whole tree sap flow whole plant hydraulic conductance and 13c signature nemera et al 2020 similar reductions in water uptake were predicted by a numerical simulation of tww irrigation using soil parameters of an avocado orchard on clay soil russo et al 2020 a study on the effect of tww on citrus trees paudel et al 2018 2017 2016b also found that tree water uptake is reduced in tww relative to fw furthermore significantly lower ψsoil determined from pre dawn leaf water potential p 0 05 fig 9a strengthens the speculation that long term irrigation with tww negatively affects plant water uptake in mitigation measures which improved water quality fw and mix the higher leaf gas exchange observed in this study and the increased water uptake reported by nemera et al 2020 could result from the combined effect of improvement in soil physicochemical characteristics such as reduced salinity reduced concentration of toxic ions na and cl reduced sodium adsorption ratio sar reduced exchangeable sodium percentage esp and the increase in soil aggregate stability in fw nemera et al 2021 in agreement with the response of a citrus orchard paudel et al 2018 2016b to long term irrigation with treated wastewater in israel the increased gas exchange in tuf relative to tww seems to be due to increased soil aeration nemera et al 2021 and higher hydraulic conductivity of the tuf the increased soil aeration is expected to improve tree root function plants in dry environment experience stress from climate variables like high temperature and irradiance that would lead to higher vapour pressure deficit vpd and evapotranspiration which make the effects of water deficit more severe and favors salinity build up the numerical differences in a leaf g s ci and e observed between measurement dates irrespective of mitigation measures in our study show a change that was related to atmospheric water demand expressed by vpd fig 3a the lower a leaf and g s were observed in august 2017 when highest vpd air temperature and lowest rh were recorded fig 1 the high evaporative demand of the atmosphere during the irrigation seasons also decreases water use efficiency of plants notably the lowest gs ci and e were observed at higher vpd irrespective of the treatments evidence for the important role of vpd in regulating gas exchange the above discussed stressors soil quality water quality and climate variables might lead to stomatal and or nonstomatal limitation to photosynthesis the significantly lower a leaf fig 2a in tww relative to fw mix and tuf was observed when there was no significant difference in ci july 2017 august 2017 june 2018 and september 2018 fig 3b this can indicate that the poor quality irrigation water might also cause non stomatal limitation to photosynthesis at the time of linear increase of co2 assimilation with stomatal conductance wuei increases with gs because the slope of net co2 assimilation is steeper than the slope of transpiration the significant reduction in gs led to a larger increase in wuei in tww than in fw and tuf on two august and september 2018 and one august 2018 measurement dates respectively p 0 05 fig 5 the regression analyses performed to evaluate the relationship between the wuei a leaf and g s show that there was a strong decreasing relationship between wuei and g s fig 6a this indicates that water use efficiency decreased with increasing gs more sharply in tww than in the other mitigation treatments except for lfi there is no relation between wuei and a leaf fig 6a and table 1 the relationship between wuei and g s shows that gs plays a crucial role in controlling not only photosynthesis rate but also the intrinsic water use efficiency of the plant from our data and the literature it is evident that wue determined from instantaneous gas exchange measurements changes temporally with climate the iwue showed significantly higher values in tww compared with fw mix and tuf in the 2018 irrigation season p 0 05 fig 4 the δ13c derived intrinsic wue fig 4 which is a more temporally integrative variable was more stable but lower than the values of gas exchange derived intrinsic wuei fig 5 according to klein et al 2016 this difference in wue is expected as the gas exchange measurements performed under saturating light conditions favors higher a leaf and wuei than under ambient conditions which is the case in the iwue nemera et al 2020 reported that the bulk leaf tissue δ13c of avocado trees changed gradually in the mitigation measures and that it was significantly lower in fw mix and tuf by an order of magnitude compared with tww this suggest that the tww had higher intrinsic water use efficiency indicative of reduced stomatal conductance in contrast to our finding acosta rangel et al 2019 reported that the intrinsic wue of hass avocado scions grafted on different rootstocks was lower under higher salinity increased iwue under stress in our case salinity water deficit or poor rhizosphere aeration is the result of reduced stomatal conductance which in turn causes a reduction of co2 concentration at the site of carboxylation forcing rubisco to assimilate more 13co2 acosta rangel et al 2019 the evidence for the larger contribution of reduced stomatal conductance as compared with the increase in carbon assimilation rate to increasing iwue in tww is the lower co2 assimilation rate per tree fig 2b and the lower plant trunk growth than in the mitigating treatments in the same avocado orchard nemera et al 2020 thus high intrinsic wue indicated that stomata closed and tree activity was decreased which had negative effects on tree physiological response growth and productivity the correlation analysis of the iwue llong term and wuei short term showed a strong positive correlation with the highest value in tww and lowest in fw 5 conclusions long term irrigation of orchards with tww in clayey soil causes degradation of soil physicochemical properties and orchard performance this ill effect of tww requires introduction of remediation measures to enhance sustainable tww use with minimal detrimental effects on orchard performance this study investigated avocado leaf gas exchange water use efficiency and leaf hydraulic conductance in four mitigation measures together with tww control in one comprehensive study in the same orchard the results revealed that gs and a leaf were significantly increased in fw mix and tuf on most measurement dates relative to tww in addition fw and tuf significantly increased leaf hydraulic conductance as expected increased gs significantly reduced δ13c derived and gas exchange intrinsic water use efficiency and iwue and wuei exhibited a strong positive correlation the higher intrinsic wue in tww indicates that stomata close and consequently tree activity decreases although the wue in tww was higher than in mitigation treatments on most measurement dates the lower assimilation rates at leaf a leaf and whole tree a tree level observed in tww indicate that tww irrigation had a negative effect on tree physiological performance overall the increased g s a leaf a tree and k leaf in fw mix and tuf relative to tww indicate that these mitigation measures are good candidate treatments for improving orchard performance negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww therefore we conclude that fw mix and tuf treatments improved avocado leaf gas exchange and leaf hydraulic conductance relative to tww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

tww was higher than that in mitigation treatments on most measurement dates the lower assimilation rates at leaf a leaf and whole tree a tree levels observed in tww indicate that tww irrigation had negative effects on tree physiological performance a strong negative relationship between wuei a leaf g s and g s was found in all treatments with highest wuei and lowest gs in tww leaf hydraulic conductance was also lowest for tww which may indicate that lower gas exchange was linked to lower water availability to the leaves overall the increased g s a leaf a tree and k leaf in fw mix and tuf relative to tww indicate that these mitigation measures are good candidates for improving orchard performance negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww in clayey soils comparing all

mediterranean regions are important for the grower s economy and fresh fruit requirement of society and since avocados are healthy and nutritional they are increasing in demand according to a recent market research report the global avocado market valued at us 13 64 bn in 2018 may reach a us 21 56 bn by 2026 www transparencymarketresearch com avocado market html estimated total water requirements of avocado are 650 mm during the rainless summer provided through irrigation plus 500 600 mm supplied from winter rain carr 2013 lahav and whiley 2002 peak water use in the rainless mediterranean summer is 3 5 mm day 1 carr 2013 and most cultivars are sensitive to both water deficits and excess soil water caused by poor drainage menzel and le lagadec 2014 for instance regulated deficit irrigation and water stress caused significant yield reduction in avocado in israel silber et al 2019 compared with non stressed chartzoulakis et al 2002 reported decreased photosynthesis and gs and changes in leaf anatomy of avocado grown in water stress water deficit similarly moderate or severe water stress decreased net co2 assimilation during periods of avocado fruit growth that would have probably caused fruitlet abscission schaffer and whiley 2003 silber et al 2012 in many parts of the world especially in arid and semiarid climates water demand exceeds the water supply from fresh water sources fao 2012 un environment 2019 as a consequence inter regional and international conflicts sometimes called water wars can occur pereira et al 2002 on the other hand the production of large quantities of wastewater and its disposal to surrounding areas is becoming a critical environmental and health hazard thus the scarcity of fresh water fw coupled with the need to manage ever growing quantities of wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants increased the need to use treated wastewater tww for irrigation long term application of tww to an avocado orchard is detrimental to plant water relations and sap flow nemera et al 2020 and leaf photosynthesis bernstein et al 2004 and can reduce yield by 20 40 assouline and narkis 2013 avocado is a highly salinity sensitive fruit crop carr 2013 and irrigation with marginal quality water of high salinity and other undesirable characteristics reduces productivity bernstein et al 2004 reported that avocado roots are more sensitive to salinity than shoots in california oster et al 2007 speculated that avocado yield declines by 65 for each unit increase of irrigation water electrical conductivity ec ds m 1 above a threshold level of 0 57 ds m 1 avocado growers in israel are advised not to use irrigation water containing more than 150 and 250 mg l 1 chloride for mexican and antillean rootstocks respectively carr 2013 poor soil aeration reduces oxygen supply leading to reduced root absorption of nutrients and water resulting in reduced tree performance kozlowski 1997 high sensitivity of avocado trees to low oxygen levels in the soil was reported in several investigations ferreyra et al 2010 valoras et al 1964 lower oxygen levels in avocado tree root zones in clay soils irrigated with tww were noted compared with those found in freshwater fw irrigated trees assouline and narkis 2013 yalin et al 2017 in both publications the conclusion was that low oxygen levels in the root zone was a major factor that caused yield reduction in general the reduction in tree growth and yield following long term irrigation with marginal quality water may be a result of the deterioration of soil physicochemical properties which reduce plant physiological performance climatic changes may also induce or worsen abiotic stresses like water deficit and heat stress hatfield and dold 2019 specifically increased global warming and drought are expected in the mediterranean basin climate which is mostly conducive for growing avocado therefore elucidating the combined effects of abiotic stresses on plants caused by irrigation with poor quality water in our case and climate variables governing gas exchange and plant water relations is important to anticipate potential problems schaffer and whiley 2003 suggested that leaf conductance is a more reliable early indicator of water stress in avocado than leaf water content leaf water potential and growth variables however moreno ortega et al 2019 did not find significant differences in gas exchange of avocado trees under different regimes of water supply mitigating detrimental effects of long term salinity and poor aeration in avocado orchards requires measures that will provide sufficient water to plants and minimize salt accumulation at least in the upper profile of the soil where most roots are located we recently reported the effect of the following four mitigation measures on avocado tree water relations freshwater fw blended water mix low frequency irrigation lfi and tuff trenches tuf along with control tww nemera et al 2020 we found that tree water use increased in all mitigation measures treatment ranking from highest to lowest sap flow canopy conductance and whole plant hydraulic conductance was fw tuf mix lfi tww the observed differences can result from changes in leaf water relations or from changes in canopy structure i e reduced leaf area previous work on the response of citrus to treated wastewater showed that the reduction in tree water use resulted from poorer leaf water relations and reduced leaf conductance which was associated with changes in leaf specific hydraulic conductance and root activity paudel et al 2018 changes in root hydraulic conductivity were also associated with aquaporin gene downregulation paudel et al 2017 indicating that tww can impact the whole water transport system here we report on the impact of the mitigation measures on avocado leaf water relations gas exchange and water use efficiency following our previous findings of increased water use of mitigation measures we ask to what extent leaf level processes were affected in particular i was stomatal conductance influenced and to what degree did mitigation measures affect gas exchange ii was water use efficiency influenced iii is there a relationship between the water use efficiency determined from gas exchange and 13c discrimination iv is the change in leaf gas exchange influenced by climatic variables and v are plant and soil water status water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance affected 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental platform and treatment description the experimental setup and treatments are described by nemera et al 2020 in brief the experiment was conducted in a mature commercial fruit bearing hass avocado orchard persea americana mill grafted on degania 117 rootstock at kibbutz yasur the western galilee israel the orchard was established in 2009 and was irrigated with secondary tww until 2016 when the study commenced the experiment consisted of four mitigation measures and a control with six replications in a randomized design treatments were 1 irrigation with freshwater fw using 2 drip lines for each row of trees 2 irrigation with a 1 1 ratio of tww and fw mix using 4 drip lines due to health regulations the mix of the two water sources was obtained by irrigation with two drip lines side by side one pipe for each type of water on both sides of the tree rows 3 low frequency irrigation with tww lfi obtained by adding a third drip line to each row of trees 4 tuff trenches tuf 0 3 m deep and 0 3 m wide that were dug about 0 3 m away from the tree trunks on both sides of the tree rows and filled with volcanic tuff of particle size ranging from 0 to 8 mm one drip lateral was laid on the tuff trenches on each side of the tree rows and irrigated with tww 5 treated wastewater tww i e control irrigation using 2 drip lines for each row of trees about 0 3 m from each side of the tree trunks irrigation frequency varied among the treatments tww fw and mix treatments were irrigated three times a week lfi was irrigated twice a week tuf trenches were irrigated every day from june 2016 to july 2018 and thereafter ten times a day all treatments were irrigated with the same amount of water per week determined from reference eto and crop factors each drip lateral consisted of a set of drippers with emitters of 0 7 or 1 6 l h 1 discharge uniram netafim spaced 0 3 m apart each plot comprised three rows with at least seven trees in each row tree spacing was 3 5 m and 6 m in and between rows respectively the average textural composition of the soil in the orchard was 58 clay 19 silt and 23 sand and the main physical properties reported by russo et al 2020 are saturated water content θs 0 88 m3 m 3 residual water content

mature current season sunlit leaves from four to eight trees for each treatment between 9 30 am and 14 30 pm using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor lincoln nebraska usa equipped with a led light source 6400 02b coupled to a sensor head irga and with a co2 mixer 6400 01 to modify the incoming air s co2 concentrations leaf gas exchange was measured on june 27 july 25 and august 28 in 2017 and june 4 august 26 and september 12 in 2018 the measured parameters were net co2 assimilation rate aleaf in µmol co2 m 2 s 1 stomatal conductance gs in mol h2o m 2 s 1 intercellular co2 concentration ci in µmol co2 m 2 s 1 and transpiration rate e in mmol h2o m 2 s 1 these measurements were made by maintaining photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of about 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 with 10 blue light and a co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 in the chamber during measurement air temperature and humidity in the chamber were set to match environmental conditions where the leaf temperature was between 24 and 32 4 c 2 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue the amount of carbon assimilated per unit of water used is determined from measurements of gas exchange and carbon isotope ratios of leaf dry matter in this study the focus is on an integrative intrinsic water use efficiency and instantaneous water use efficiency the short term intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated as net photosynthetic rate a leaf divided by stomatal conductance gs hatfield and dold 2019 the gas exchange based wue determined from co2 and water exchange at the leaf level on a short temporal scale is labor intensive and requires accessing leaves of tall trees yi et al 2019 therefore we analyzed the 13c discrimination derived intrinsic water use efficiency iwue as an indicator of long term trends in the internal regulation of carbon uptake and water loss of plants seibt et al 2008 leaf discrimination against 13c δ13c was calculated from the carbon isotope signature δ13c results and expressed in delta notation as parts per thousand deviations from the international carbon isotope standard following leonardi et al 2012 4 13 c δ 13 ca δ 13 cp 1 δ 13 cp 1000 where δ13ca and δ13cp are the respective isotopic ratios of atmospheric co2 and of plant material the δ13c measurement method has been described previously see nemera et al 2020 uni et al 2020 in brief samples were oven dried at 60 c for 48 h and ground to dust by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen measurements were performed using a 13co2 cavity ring down spectroscopy analyzer crds picarro g2131i picarro santa clara ca usa with combustion module equipped with an auto sampler ecs 4010 costech analytical valencia ca usa international standards iaea ch 3 cellulose international atomic energy agency vienna austria were used for calibration the δ13c derived iwue can provide a time integrated measure of wue over the course of the growing season because of the seasonal storage of co2 assimilated during the growing season belmecheri et al 2014 frank et al 2015 the iwue was determined from δ13c as described by leonardi et al 2012 5 iwue 0 625 ca b 13 c b a where ca is the atmospheric co2 concentration in ppm δ13c is the leaf discrimination against 13c 0 625 is the ratio between the stomatal conductance to co2 and water vapor a is a constant for the leaf level discrimination against 13c in diffusion through the stomata 4 4 and b is a constant for the enzymatic carbon fixation by ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase 27 2 5 tree scale carbon assimilation rate tree scale carbon assimilation rate a tree was determined from δ13c derived intrinsic water use efficiency iwue eq 5 and gs klein et al 2016 as follows 6 atree iwue gs the gs was determined from measured individual

with active sap flow sensors the leaf samples for ψpd ψstem and ψleaf measurement on july 23 2018 were taken from the same branches used for gas exchange measurement ψstem was measured on fully grown shaded leaves near the main stem enclosed in aluminum and covered plastic bags for about two hours to stop transpiration and allow leaf water potential to equilibrate with stem water potential ψleaf

inc usa differences in studied parameters among treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance anova differences between mitigation measures were considered significant at the 5 probability level prior to anova normality and variance homogeneity assumptions were tested by using the shapiro wilk w and the levene s test respectively when significant differences among means were found tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test was used to compare mean values 3 results 3 1 climate variables there was much variability in climatic conditions between measurement years and dates fig 1 the

july 2017 for mix fig 3c the values of e in tuf were significantly higher than in tww on all measurement dates except in june 2017 and september 2018 fig 3c 3 3 water use efficiency the integrative intrinsic water use efficiency iwue determined from δ13c was significantly higher in tww than in fw mix and tuf in 2018 p 0 05 fig 4 values of gas exchange measurement based instantaneous intrinsic water use efficiency wuei were not consistent between measurement dates the wuei was significantly higher in tww than in fw in june 2017 august 2018 and september 2018 p 0 05 fig 5 and in tuf in august 2018 p 0 05 fig 5 the relationship between wuei and a leaf showed inconsistent trends for all treatments fig 6b yet in general an inverse type relationship was noted between wuei and g s showing that an increase in g s led to a decrease in wuei fig 6a regression analysis of wuei vs a leaf and wuei vs g s are shown in table 1 a high correlation was found between iwue and wuei in the three sampling dates in 2018 with slopes very close to 1 0 in august and september 2018 fig 7b and 7c 3 4 leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance the seasonal stem water potential ψstem mpa measurements show that there was significantly higher ψstem in fw on may 21 2018 june 11 2018 and august 6 2018 p 0 05 fig 8 the values of the ψstem in tuf were significantly lower than tww on june 25 2018 p 0 05 fig 8 the determination of water potential gradient revealed that the soil water potential ψsoil p 0 05 fig 9a determined based on pre dawn leaf water potential was significantly higher in fw than tww with no significant differences between mitigation measures and the control in ψstem fig 9b and ψleaf fig 9c leaf hydraulic conductance kleaf determined from leaf transpiration rate and the leaf water potential gradient showed that kleaf was significantly higher in fw and tuf than in tww p 0 05 fig 9d 4 discussion the results of our study demonstrate that the mitigation measures fw mix and tuf increased leaf gas exchange and leaf hydraulic conductance and decreased water use efficiency of mature avocado trees relative to tww on most measurement dates specifically gs was significantly higher in fw on five out of six measurement days and in both mix and tuf in three out of six measurements as compared to tww p 0 05 fig 3a the significantly lower g s and ci in tww relative to fw with no significant reduction in a leaf and e in june 2017 shows the onset of stress from our data it seems that g s is the most sensitive gas exchange trait affected by the long term irrigation with treated wastewater stomatal closure or the reduction of stomatal opening in avocado is an early indicator of water stress carr 2013 plaguezuelo et al 2018 also indicated that stomatal closure in avocado in a mediterranean climate is rapid and is an early indicator of water stress associated with changes in leaf anatomy restricting the diffusion of co2 the a leaf in tww was also significantly lower than both fw and mix in four out of six measurements and tuf in three out of six measurements fig 2a the lower a leaf and g s indicate that trees in tww might be under water stress from various reasons discussed elsewhere assouline and narkis 2013 paudel et al 2018 2017 2016a rahav et al 2017 soda et al 2017 in addition to the plant response observed in this study long term irrigation with tww deteriorates soil aggregate stability levy et al 2011 and increases soil repellency to water nadav et al 2013 schacht and marschner 2015 wallach et al 2005 leading to non uniform distribution of water in the rhizosphere under such a heterogeneous conditions water availability to the plant uptake may be limited moreover the higher salinity in tww might have impacted the osmotic potential gradient of the soil root junction particularly compared to fw and mix reduced plant water uptake in tww relative to fw mix and tuf was found in the same orchard from measurements of whole tree sap flow whole plant hydraulic conductance and 13c signature nemera et al 2020 similar reductions in water uptake were predicted by a numerical simulation of tww irrigation using soil parameters of an avocado orchard on clay soil russo et al 2020 a study on the effect of tww on citrus trees paudel et al 2018 2017 2016b also found that tree water uptake is reduced in tww relative to fw furthermore significantly lower ψsoil determined from pre dawn leaf water potential p 0 05 fig 9a strengthens the speculation that long term irrigation with tww negatively affects plant water uptake in mitigation measures which improved water quality fw and mix the higher leaf gas exchange observed in this study and the increased water uptake reported by nemera et al 2020 could result from the combined effect of improvement in soil physicochemical characteristics such as reduced salinity reduced concentration of toxic ions na and cl reduced sodium adsorption ratio sar reduced exchangeable sodium percentage esp and the increase in soil aggregate stability in fw nemera et al 2021 in agreement with the response of a citrus orchard paudel et al 2018 2016b to long term irrigation with treated wastewater in israel the increased gas exchange in tuf relative to tww seems to be due to increased soil aeration nemera et al 2021 and higher hydraulic conductivity of the tuf the increased soil aeration is expected to improve tree root function plants in dry environment experience stress from climate variables like high temperature and irradiance that would lead to higher vapour pressure deficit vpd and evapotranspiration which make the effects of water deficit more severe and favors salinity build up the numerical differences in a leaf g s ci and e observed between measurement dates irrespective of mitigation measures in our study show a change that was related to atmospheric water demand expressed by vpd fig 3a the lower a leaf and g s were observed in august 2017 when highest vpd air temperature and lowest rh were recorded fig 1 the high evaporative demand of the atmosphere during the irrigation seasons also decreases water use efficiency of plants notably the lowest gs ci and e were observed at higher vpd irrespective of the treatments evidence for the important role of vpd in regulating gas exchange the above discussed stressors soil quality water quality and climate variables might lead to stomatal and or nonstomatal limitation to photosynthesis the significantly lower a leaf fig 2a in tww relative to fw mix and tuf was observed when there was no significant difference in ci july 2017 august 2017 june 2018 and september 2018 fig 3b this can indicate that the poor quality irrigation water might also cause non stomatal limitation to photosynthesis at the time of linear increase of co2 assimilation with stomatal conductance wuei increases with gs because the slope of net co2 assimilation is steeper than the slope of transpiration the significant reduction in gs led to a larger increase in wuei in tww than in fw and tuf on two august and september 2018 and one august 2018 measurement dates respectively p 0 05 fig 5 the regression analyses performed to evaluate the relationship between the wuei a leaf and g s show that there was a strong decreasing relationship between wuei and g s fig 6a this indicates that water use efficiency decreased with increasing gs more sharply in tww than in the other mitigation treatments except for lfi there is no relation between wuei and a leaf fig 6a and table 1 the relationship between wuei and g s shows that gs plays a crucial role in controlling not only photosynthesis rate but also the intrinsic water use efficiency of the plant from our data and the literature it is evident that wue determined from instantaneous gas exchange measurements changes temporally with climate the iwue showed significantly higher values in tww compared with fw mix and tuf in the 2018 irrigation season p 0 05 fig 4 the δ13c derived intrinsic wue fig 4 which is a more temporally integrative variable was more stable but lower than the values of gas exchange derived intrinsic wuei fig 5 according to klein et al 2016 this difference in wue is expected as the gas exchange measurements performed under saturating light conditions favors higher a leaf and wuei than under ambient conditions which is the case in the iwue nemera et al 2020 reported that the bulk leaf tissue δ13c of avocado trees changed gradually in the mitigation measures and that it was significantly lower in fw mix and tuf by an order of magnitude compared with tww this suggest that the tww had higher intrinsic water use efficiency indicative of reduced stomatal conductance in contrast to our finding acosta rangel et al 2019 reported that the intrinsic wue of hass avocado scions grafted on different rootstocks was lower under higher salinity increased iwue under stress in our case salinity water deficit or poor rhizosphere aeration is the result of reduced stomatal conductance which in turn causes a reduction of co2 concentration at the site of carboxylation forcing rubisco to assimilate more 13co2 acosta rangel et al 2019 the evidence for the larger contribution of reduced stomatal conductance as compared with the increase in carbon assimilation rate to increasing iwue in tww is the lower co2 assimilation rate per tree fig 2b and the lower plant trunk growth than in the mitigating treatments in the same avocado orchard nemera et al 2020 thus high intrinsic wue indicated that stomata closed and tree activity was decreased which had negative effects on tree physiological response growth and productivity the correlation analysis of the iwue llong term and wuei short term showed a strong positive correlation with the highest value in tww and lowest in fw 5 conclusions long term irrigation of orchards with tww in clayey soil causes degradation of soil physicochemical properties and orchard performance this ill effect of tww requires introduction of remediation measures to enhance sustainable tww use with minimal detrimental effects on orchard performance this study investigated avocado leaf gas exchange water use efficiency and leaf hydraulic conductance in four mitigation measures together with tww control in one comprehensive study in the same orchard the results revealed that gs and a leaf were significantly increased in fw mix and tuf on most measurement dates relative to tww in addition fw and tuf significantly increased leaf hydraulic conductance as expected increased gs significantly reduced δ13c derived and gas exchange intrinsic water use efficiency and iwue and wuei exhibited a strong positive correlation the higher intrinsic wue in tww indicates that stomata close and consequently tree activity decreases although the wue in tww was higher than in mitigation treatments on most measurement dates the lower assimilation rates at leaf a leaf and whole tree a tree level observed in tww indicate that tww irrigation had a negative effect on tree physiological performance overall the increased g s a leaf a tree and k leaf in fw mix and tuf relative to tww indicate that these mitigation measures are good candidate treatments for improving orchard performance negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww therefore we conclude that fw mix and tuf treatments improved avocado leaf gas exchange and leaf hydraulic conductance relative to tww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
