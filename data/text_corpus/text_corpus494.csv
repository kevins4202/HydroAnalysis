2470,reanalysis and remotely sensed soil moisture sm products are important for monitoring hydrology and the terrestrial carbon cycle especially in water limited arid regions however it is essential to assess the reliability of sm products before they are used in this study surface sm from the european reanalysis interim v5 era5 essential climate variables ecv the famine early warning systems network fews land data assimilation system fldas and the global land data assimilation system gldas were assessed based on in situ data and the three cornered hat tch approach in a typical arid region central asia ca the validation based on in situ data indicated that all three products underestimated the observed surface sm except for era5 the era5 sm was closest to the in situ observations averaging a higher correlation coefficient of 0 59 followed by the gldas ecv and fldas the tch method revealed low uncertainties 0 05 m3 m3 for all four sm products and high uncertainties were found at high altitudes for era5 and ecv sm products the uncertainty is high in the shrublands and forests respectively fldas and gldas sm products performed better in terms of uncertainty compared to era5 and ecv with an average uncertainty below 0 03 m3 m3 except for forests the above assessment results indicate that compared with the other three sm products era5 has a better performance and more potential for application in ca there was an upward trend in surface sm from 1982 to 2018 in ca the relationship between the four sm products and aridity index and drought events showed that gldas could capture the hydrothermal conditions and drought events followed by fldas era5 and ecv our research is intended to provide some reference for the application of gridded sm products to ecosystem and water resources monitoring in arid regions keywords soil moisture gridded products three cornered hat central asia uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm is the key link between the land surface and the atmosphere babaeian et al 2019 jung et al 2010 sm not only regulates the hydrology cycle by controlling the distribution of precipitation between surface runoff and soil infiltration but also controls the redistribution of energy between sensible and latent heat rahmani et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 in addition sm deficits induce droughts and affect vegetation growth such as photosynthetic and vegetation phenology luo et al 2021 samaniego et al 2018 yu et al 2022 therefore knowledge of regional and global sm status is essential for modeling and predicting water resources drought early warning and monitoring the ecosystem carbon cycles long term observational datasets are necessary for understanding sm dynamics on large scales however in situ observational data are too scarce particularly in arid regions to provide large scale spatial and temporal scale sm measurements chen et al 2014 gu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 recently reanalysis and remotely sensed gridded sm offered the new potential to bridge this limitation the latest european reanalysis interim v5 era5 sm data is currently available hersbach et al 2020 and the sm data from famine early warning systems network fews land data assimilation system fldas and the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 also have been increasingly used in terrestrial water resources assessment and ecological monitoring agutu et al 2021 guo et al 2018b li et al 2015 qing et al 2022 remotely sensed sm data have also been widely used dorigo et al 2017 ma et al 2021 including those from the advanced scatterometer ascat soil moisture and ocean salinity smos cyclone global navigation satellite system cygnss and the essential climate variable ecv sm products chakravorty et al 2016 kim and lakshmi 2018 liu et al 2020 remotely sensed sm data typically include sm information for the surface layer 5 cm compared to reanalysis data generally 100 cm due to detection capacity limitations dorigo et al 2017 luo et al 2020 peng et al 2017 these gridded products contribute to the understanding of sm dynamics on a large scale however considering model structural flaws errors in input datasets and scale scaling issues different sm products may have some uncertainties and errors chew and small 2018 gruber et al 2020 the uncertainty of sm products is magnified in arid and semi arid regions where there is a lack of sufficient in situ station data to construct high precision models or assimilation systems babaeian et al 2019 thus there is an urgent need to evaluate the reliability of gridded sm products to expand their application in model development and ecosystem monitoring the validation of gridded sm products is usually carried out by in situ data xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 in situ sm is measured directly and usually represents the sm condition of the site being measured or homogeneous surroundings however the number of in situ sites is limited and is unable to be expanded on a large spatial scale as a complement the three cornered hat tch method has been developed for sm evaluation when in situ data are not available the theory of tch is similar to the triple collocation tc approach kim et al 2018 kim et al 2020 stoffelen 1998 but differs in that tch can handle uncertainty in more than three uncorrelated variables under appropriate constraints tch is a regression method for quantifying the uncertainty of multiple independent datasets without prior knowledge liu et al 2021a the tch method is widely used to quantify the uncertainty of precipitation xu et al 2020 sm liu et al 2019 luo et al 2020 and evapotranspiration products xu et al 2019 across grids at a regional scale previous studies have provided a viable methodology for the evaluation and validation of sm products however most studies have focused on relatively humid and semi humid areas jung et al 2020 lacava et al 2012 wang et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 and less on arid regions central asia ca is the largest arid region in eurasia with vulnerable ecosystems that are sensitive to climate change chen et al 2020 deng et al 2020a yuan et al 2021 particularly to water cycle variability hu et al 2019 shi et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 ca is becoming a hotspot for focusing on carbon and water cycles chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 and extreme climate events such as droughts guo et al 2018a guo et al 2019 and floods zheng et al 2021 due to the lack of sufficient in situ observations gridded sm data have more potential for application to ecological monitoring in ca however limitations still exist as the effectiveness of the gridded sm products in ca has not yet been assessed to fill this gap the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the performance of era5 ecv fldas and gldas sm data through in situ data and tch methods 2 further reveal the spatial temporal characteristics of surface sm in ca from 1982 to 2018 based on these four sm products 3 finally assess the ability of these four gridded sm data to capture hydrothermal conditions and drought events in ca this study has important implications for water resource prediction and ecosystem modeling in ca and the wider arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ca 46 96 e 35 55 n covers kazakhstan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and xinjiang ca has a temperate continental climate characterized by hot summers and cold winters the lower precipitation mean annual precipitation from 155 to 270 mm and

in situ sm data respectively saver and oaver are the average values of gridded and in situ sm data respectively and n is the time series length bias measures the average deviation of the gridded sm products from the in situ sm rmse and ubrmse are the root mean square error and unbiased root mean square error respectively which were used to evaluate the errors of the four gridded sm 2 3 2 three cornered hat the tch method was used to estimate the uncertainties of four sm products and the details of the tch method are described as follows liu et al 2021a liu et al 2019 5 x i x true ε i i 1 2 3 n where xi is the time series of the ith sm product being evaluated and n denotes the number of sm products xtrue and εi represent the true value and error term of the sm respectively because the xtrue is not available one of the time series is used as a reference xr and the differences between xi and xr can be written as 6 d i m x i x r ε i ε r where d is an m n 1 matrix and m is the time samples therefore the variance of the differences is as follows 7 σ ir 2 σ ε i 2 σ ε r 2 2 cov ε i ε r as the differences between every two products are independent cov εi εr is equal to zero for n products n 1 differences can be obtained and stored in an m n 1 matrix as 8 d d 1 r d 2 r d 3 r d n 1 r the covariance matrix of the differences is obtained from the following equation 9 l c o v d where l is an n 1 n 1 covariance matrix of d the n n unknown covariance matrix of the individual noises r0 is related to l by 10 l h t r 0 h where h is n 1 n matrix that can be represented as 11 h 1 0

values r11 r22 r33 r44 were the uncertainty of evaluated sm before calculating the uncertainty the era5 and fldas sm products were resampled to 0 25 0 25 by bilinear interpolation xu et al 2021 to match the spatial resolution of the ecv and gldas 2 3 3 linear regression analysis linear regression analysis was used to measure the trend in surface sm the trend slope for each pixel was calculated as follows kawabata et al 2001 15 slope n i 1 n i y i i 1 n i i 1 n y i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where yi represents the variable y in the ith year and n is the total number of years in the study period 2 3 4 anomaly analysis to assess the ability of the four sm data to monitor drought standardized anomalies of the surface sm were calculated as follows 16 anomaly i j y i j m e a n y j std y j where anomaly i j is the variable j anomaly for a year i y i j is the value of variable j for a year i and mean yj and std yj is the average and standard deviation of variable j over the study period respectively 3 results 3 1 in situ evaluation fig 2 shows the relationship between the era5 ecv fldas and gldas sm datasets and in situ sm the fitted line between era5 sm and in situ sm is closer to the 1 1 line with the maximum coefficient of determination r2 0 45 followed by gldas fldas and ecv fig 3 a shows that the era5 sm is closer to the in situ observations with the minimum mean value of bias the bias values for ecv fldas and gldas are 0 08 m3 m3 0 04 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 respectively which underestimate in situ sm the era5 sm also shows better performance in capturing long term trends with a high correlation of 0 59 on average followed by gldas ecv and fldas fig 3b the rmse results are similar to bias with mean values of 0 075 0 086 0 100 and 0 106 m3 m3 for era5 fldas ecv and gldas respectively for the ubrmse fldas has a maximum average value of 0 054 m3 m3 and era5 ecv and gldas have comparable performance with average values between 0 039 m3 m3 and 0 044 m3 m3 the results show that the era5 ecv and gldas sm products have similar capabilities in absolute sm values and outperform the fldas sm products further the performance of the four sm products in different land covers fig 3e f and basins fig 3i l is revealed based on bias correlation rmse and ubrmse for grassland and sparse vegetation era5 performs better in terms of bias correlation and rmse compared to the other three sm products for forest era5 has the minimum bias and rmse values the higher correlation coefficient with gldas and the minimum ubrmse value the era5 sm product is observed in cropland with minimum bias and rmse and maximum correlation coefficient demonstrating a better performance ecv has a small bias and rmse for shrubland and bare areas demonstrating better performance compared to other products for basins i ii and iv era5 performs better in terms of bias correlation and rmse compared to the other three sm products for basin iii era5 has the minimum rmse and ubrmse values the highest correlation coefficient and the minimum bias value with gldas sm for basin v ecv and gldas perform better in terms of the correlation rmse and ubrmse compared to the other two sm products 3 2 three cornered hat based assessment the uncertainties of the four monthly sm products are assessed based on the tch method over ca during 1982 2018 fig 4 in general the four sm products all have low uncertainties for each sm product the area with uncertainty 0 08 m3 m3 occupies 13 of the ca generally all sm products have higher uncertainties in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and south eastern xinjiang which may be due to the mountainous and complex topography of these regions fig 4d the uncertainty of fldas and gldas is lower compared to era5 and ecv for fldas and gldas sm data the uncertainty is generally below 0 04 m3 m3 in all regions except kyrgyzstan and tajikistan showing a better performance the uncertainty of era5 sm is higher in the south of kazakhstan areas with sm uncertainty above 0 08 m3 m3 for ecv occupy 13 of the study area and are mainly concentrated in the mountainous regions of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan fig 5 shows the results of the tch evaluation on different land covers fig 5a d and basins fig 5e h for the four sm products for era5 shrubland has the highest uncertainty with a mean value of 0 07 m3 m3 while the mean value of uncertainty for other land covers is concentrated at 0 05 m3 m3 for ecv products the uncertainty of sm is higher in the forest 0 07 m3 m3 and lower in other land covers the fldas and gldas sm products show a better performance on land covers relative to other products in terms of uncertainty the mean value of uncertainty is below 0 03 m3 m3 as with the ecv products the uncertainty of the sm for fldas and gldas is higher in the forest than in other land covers for era5 basin i have the highest uncertainty with a mean value of 0 06 m3 m3 and basin iii has the lowest uncertainty for ecv products the sm uncertainty is the highest in basin iii 0 06 m3 m3 and the lowest in basin ii mean value of 0 03 m3 m3 the uncertainty in fldas and gldas sm is relatively low in all five basins mean value 0 03 m3 m3 similar to the performance in land cover in terms of the spatial distribution of the lowest uncertainty sm products era5 is mainly in the tarim basin of xinjiang ecv is mainly in central kazakhstan and southern uzbekistan fldas is mainly in northern kazakhstan and tajikistan gldas is distributed mainly in xinjiang turkmenistan and most of kazakhstan fig 6 a the results of the grid statistics for the lowest uncertainty show that gldas and fldas sm products occupy a larger percentage with 42 and 32 respectively the same results were observed for the land cover fig 6b and the different basins fig 6c in terms of the lowest uncertainty the gldas and fldas sm have a larger proportion on all land covers except shrubland for shrublands the largest proportion of sm products with the lowest uncertainty is gldas followed by ecv for basins i ii and v the largest proportion of lowest uncertainty was gldas followed by fldas sm products for basins iii and iv the largest proportion of sm products with the lowest uncertainty was gldas followed by era5 3 3 spatial and temporal patterns of surface sm fig 7 shows the spatiotemporal characteristics of the surface sm for these four gridded products annual averages for the four sm products from 1982 to 2018 show a consistent spatial pattern higher surface sm in northern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan and lower surface sm in turkmenistan and xinjiang in the south the spatial variation in surface sm averages for era5 is more pronounced compared to the other sm products with the surface sm averages exceeding 0 4 m3 m3 in the northern part of kazakhstan the era5 gridded data shows an increasing trend in surface sm in ca except for southern xinjiang and kyrgyzstan fig 7b the sm dynamics of ecv are similar to that of fldas both showing an increasing trend in surface sm over most of ca the gldas product shows an increasing trend in surface sm in all regions except turkmenistan and a small part of southern xinjiang the surface sm shows an increasing trend during 1982 2018 based on the interannual variability of the four products fig 7c as shown in fig 8 a forests have the highest surface sm followed by cropland grassland and spare vegetation the surface sm ranges for forest and cropland is 0 10 0 36 m3 m3 and 0 10 0 30 m3 m3 respectively for era5 and fldas the lowest surface sm is observed in bare areas and for ecv and gldas in shrubland fig 3b shows that the dynamics of the four sm products varied across the different land covers the era5 product shows an increasing trend in surface sm for all land covers except forest with the maximum slope 0 003 m3 m3 for shrubland for ecv products the mean surface sm slope is 0 for all land covers over the study period with the maximum slope 0 001 m3 m3 for the forest fldas and gldas products show similar results with all land covers showing a slight upward trend in surface sm 3 4 relationship between the surface sm and hydrothermal conditions to assess the ability of the four sm products to capture ca hydrothermal conditions the aridity index was divided into intervals of 0 01 to fit the curves between the sm fig 8c the curves show that the relationship between surface sm and aridity index is consistent with the trend of the hydrothermal gradient with a higher aridity index indicating a wetter and higher surface sm the strongest relationship between surface sm and aridity index is observed for era5 and gldas r2 0 69 and 0 68 followed by fldas and the weakest for ecv r2 0 05 in addition the ability of the surface sm to capture drought events is revealed based on the standardized anomalies of the four sm products as shown in fig 9 blue represents surface sm above the multi year mean red represents surface sm below the multi year mean and less than 1 standard deviation represents severe sm deficits drought drought events during the study period are represented by the scpdsi fig 9e which revealed severe drought events in ca in 1995 1997 and 2008 the surface sm anomalies of era5 and fldas capture severe drought events in 1995 and 1997 in 1995 and 1997 the sm of era5 and fldas was more than one time below the standard deviation showing a severe surface sm deficit the surface sm anomalies for era5 and fldas did not capture the severe drought event in 2008 with the surface sm showing a surplus ecv sm data did not capture the severe drought events recorded by scpdsi the surface sm anomalies from gldas captured severe drought events in 1995 1997 and 2008 with surface sm anomalies below one time the standard deviation in these years consistent with the drought events revealed by scpdsi the patterns of correlation between scpdsi and the four sm products further indicate that gldas has the highest positive correlation with scpdsi followed by fldas fig 10 there is no widely distributed positive correlation between scpdsi and era5 and ecv sm data with negative correlations in southern kazakhstan and xinjiang 4 discussion 4 1 performance of sm products in ca the assessment based on field data showed that era5 overestimates in situ sm in grasslands forests and sparse vegetation this may be related to the fact that these land use types are mainly distributed in high altitude mountainous areas and in northern kazakhstan where era5 derived a higher surface sm fig 1a and fig 7a previous studies have demonstrated that era5 tends to overestimate precipitation jiao et al 2021 sun et al 2021 and underestimate temperature rakhmatova et al 2021 in these regions which affects infiltration and evaporation processes and leads to sm overestimation era5 underestimates the in situ sm of cropland shrubland and bare areas while ecv fldas and gldas underestimate the surface sm of all land covers and the same finding was found in other regions luo et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 the underestimation of the surface sm may be due to a spatial scale mismatch resulting in the extreme values of the sm being grid averaged zhang et al 2018 in addition the depths measured by the four sm products and the in situ sm are different the sm from ecv remote sensing reflects only unfrozen water in the soil and limited depth 0 2 cm which may be the main reason for the underestimation of the surface sm luo et al 2020 zeng et al 2015 furthermore some studies have pointed out that it is difficult to describe the spatial pattern of sm by in situ measurements and that the few point measurements only reveal the temporal dynamics of sm chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 therefore more attention should be paid not only to rmse or bias values but also to correlation the temporal and spatial dynamics of the surface sm in ca can be captured by the era5 and gldas due to their high correlation with in situ data fig 3b this is also observed in the different land covers and basins with higher correlations of surface sm with the in situ data for era5 and gldas compared to ecv and fldas fig 3f j the spatial temporal dynamics of surface sm correlates with hydrothermal conditions berg and mccoll 2021 zhou et al 2021 which is also confirmed by our study the sm of era5 and gldas is highly correlated with the aridity index fig 8c in situ based observations are limited in ca and assessment by tch may complement the results of in situ validation on a spatial scale the tch based assessment shows that the areas of higher uncertainty for the four sm products are mainly concentrated in mountainous areas fig 4 this is the reason for the high uncertainty of the forest mainly in mountainous areas fig 5a d this higher bias may be due to some imperfections in the inversion model of sm for data processing in high altitude areas zeng et al 2015 for the ecv sm the accuracy of optical observations of remote sensing is affected by cloud cover and atmospheric conditions particularly in mountainous areas babaeian et al 2019 the variability of energy and the complexity of the terrain makes it difficult to control the accuracy of temperature or vegetation information in assimilation models which in turn leads to higher errors in general the uncertainties of all four sm products are concentrated in the range of 0 02 0 06 m3 m3 which is determined by a consistent spatial and temporal pattern fig 4 the uncertainty of the era5 sm is higher compared to fldas and gldas which was also confirmed in a recent global scale study xu et al 2021 and is mainly concentrated in the southern part of kazakhstan the era5 dataset has a high spatial resolution and based on era interim era5 introduces soil texture information corrected for terrestrial hydrological conditions to improve the sm simulation hersbach et al 2020 although the corrected algorithm can reduce sm errors in parts of the mid latitudes it still cannot provide accurate sm estimates due to its still large errors in temperature estimation at 2 m above the ground surface in ca scipal et al 2009 previous studies have revealed that inaccurate information on soil texture in fao can also lead to bias in sm products zeng et al 2015 it is worth noting that the areas with high uncertainty in era5 sm are mainly concentrated in shrubland fig 5a and we recommended that the module for the land cover component should be recalibrated in these areas to improve the accuracy of sm estimation in ca 4 2 surface sm dynamic and relationship to hydrothermal conditions recent studies have shown that there was an increasing trend of precipitation in ca over the last decades ren et al 2022 yao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the recharge of more precipitation may lead to an increase in surface sm which was confirmed in our study an increasing trend in surface sm was observed in ca based on gridded sm era5 ecv fldas and gldas from 1982 to 2018 fig 7b c although there may be some differences in the spatial distribution of the four sm products due to the different algorithms of each model kim et al 2020 the cru data indicates an increasing trend in precipitation over the study period and the high positive spatial correlation of the four sm products with precipitation also suggests that precipitation is the main driver of surface sm for ca fig s1 temperature shows a consistent trend of increasing with surface sm fig s1d which is different from previous studies luo et al 2020 this is because while increasing temperature promotes evapotranspiration it also accelerates snow and glacier melt to replenish surface sm deng et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 this is consistent with the fact that forests in mountainous areas show the most pronounced increase in surface sm fig 7b further there is some evidence for a negative correlation between the four sm products and temperature in regions of lower elevation and a positive correlation in regions of higher elevation fig s2e h as areas of water limitation changes in sm can significantly affect ca hydrothermal conditions and ecosystems bai et al 2019 hu et al 2019 our study shows that the sm products of era5 fldas and gldas capture the hydrothermal conditions of ca indicating that the wetter the region the higher the surface sm fig 7c the relationship between ecv sm and the aridity index suggests that remotely sensed ecv sm products may be less indicative of regional hydrothermal conditions due to satellite observations of sm being limited to the top few centimeters of soil hoffmann et al 2020 this also reveals that considering regional hydrothermal conditions when constructing assimilation models of sm can improve the accuracy of sm it is noteworthy that in some recent studies the sm is considered to be one of the more appropriate indicators when distinguishing between dry and wet regions taking into account the link between sm and climate and hydrology berg and mccoll 2021 zhou et al 2021 in addition sm deficits induce drought which has received increasing attention liu et al 2020 qing et al 2022 a strong positive correlation was observed between gldas and scpdsi fig 10 this may be because gldas has features similar to the forcings of pdsi ramirez et al 2022 our study confirms that gldas sm exhibits advantages in capturing drought on an annual scale compared to other sm products figs 8 10 this may be determined by the better fit of gldas to hydrothermal conditions fig 7c4 and the high correlation with precipitation fig s1d in contrast ecv sm does not capture the drought events and suggests the wrong message because of its weak correlation with hydrothermal conditions fig 7c3 due to increasingly frequent droughts sm stress has been increasingly referred to in carbon cycle simulations qing et al 2022 stocker et al 2018 and the great potential of highly drought sensitive sm products like gldas for drought monitoring in ca 4 3 limitations and uncertainties we evaluated four gridded sm products based on in situ station data and tch to provide a basis for the application of sm products in ca however there are still uncertainties in our study the performance of gridded sm is mainly assessed by in situ stations however due to measurement errors and soil topography vegetation heterogeneity and meteorological forcing in situ station data have some representativeness errors and cannot be avoided xu et al 2021 in addition model or remotely sensed retrievals of sm typically represent hundreds of square kilometers while in situ stations can only represent a few square meters which introduces some errors in scale conversion and may bias the study results crow et al 2012 however it is undeniable that in situ validation is probably the most accurate method for sm evaluation because it directly measures sm luo et al 2020 xu et al 2021 in the future spatial downscaling methods should be developed to reduce the errors in scale conversion between gridded products and observatory data fang et al 2022 kim et al 2018 moreover to reduce the impact of the difference between the reanalyzed and remotely sensed sm products during the freeze up period on the assessment results we only assessed the performance of the growing season sm products and masked the freeze up area based on the cci land use data however uncertainties in the assessment results remain as the cci land use data has some errors in the classification of frozen areas liu et al 2021b based on four sm products we reveal the variability of surface sm over the study period highlighting the effects of precipitation and temperature forcing on surface sm dynamics however sm variability is also influenced by vegetation deng et al 2020b lian et al 2020 topography chaney et al 2015 and radiation zhou et al 2021 and the above factors will be incorporated into future work to further reveal the factors affecting sm variability in ca 5 conclusions based on the era5 ecv fldas and gldas sm datasets this study assessed surface sm dynamics in ca and the performance of the four sm products mentioned above over the period 1982 2018 the performance of the four sm data was validated with data from in situ stations all gridded products underestimate the observed surface sm on a monthly scale the era5 sm outperformed the other three products with the smallest bias value era5 sm performed better in capturing long spatial and temporal trends with a higher correlation coefficient of 0 59 on average followed by gldas ecv and fldas in forest and cropland era5 sm products showed better performance with the smallest bias and rmse values and the largest correlation coefficients ecv showed better performance in shrubland and bare areas with smaller bise and rmse values compared to the other products for the five basins of ca era5 performs better in terms of bias correlation and rmse compared to the other three sm products uncertainty was quantified for the four monthly surface sm products in ca from 1982 to 2018 using the tch method in general uncertainty was low for all four sm products with fldas and gldas sm products having lower uncertainty than era5 and ecv all sm products had high uncertainty in higher elevation regions such as kyrgyzstan tajikistan and south eastern xinjiang for the era5 sm product shrubland has higher uncertainty 0 08 m3 m3 than another land cover forest had a high uncertainty relative to other land covers for the ecv fldas and gldas sm products on the basin scale era5 and ecv have the highest uncertainties in the basin i and basin iii respectively the uncertainty in fldas and gldas sm is low in all five basins mean value 0 03 m3 m3 compared to the other sm products the areas with the lowest uncertainty for gldas have a larger proportion 42 of the study area mainly in xinjiang turkmenistan and most of kazakhstan the results indicated that surface sm showed an upward trend in ca spatially all four sm products showed a broadly upward trend except for southern xinjiang kyrgyzstan and turkmenistan the era5 product shows an increasing trend in surface sm for all land covers except forest for the ecv fldas and glda products surface sm showed an upward trend for all land covers the ability of four sm products to capture hydrothermal conditions was assessed by fitting the relationship between the aridity index and surface sm the results showed that era5 and gldas found the highest relationship between surface sm and the aridity index r2 0 69 and 0 68 while ecv found the weakest the ability of the surface sm to capture drought events was further revealed based on the standardized anomalies of the four sm products we found that surface sm anomalies from gldas successfully captured severe drought events described by scpdsi in 1995 1997 and 2008 surface sm anomalies from era5 and fldas captured severe drought events in 1995 and 1997 but were insensitive to drought events in 2008 and ecv did not capture severe drought events recorded by scpdsi author contributions guli jiapaer designed the research tao yu processed the data and wrote the manuscript anming bao junfeng zhang haiyang tu and

2470,reanalysis and remotely sensed soil moisture sm products are important for monitoring hydrology and the terrestrial carbon cycle especially in water limited arid regions however it is essential to assess the reliability of sm products before they are used in this study surface sm from the european reanalysis interim v5 era5 essential climate variables ecv the famine early warning systems network fews land data assimilation system fldas and the global land data assimilation system gldas were assessed based on in situ data and the three cornered hat tch approach in a typical arid region central asia ca the validation based on in situ data indicated that all three products underestimated the observed surface sm except for era5 the era5 sm was closest to the in situ observations averaging a higher correlation coefficient of 0 59 followed by the gldas ecv and fldas the tch method revealed low uncertainties 0 05 m3 m3 for all four sm products and high uncertainties were found at high altitudes for era5 and ecv sm products the uncertainty is high in the shrublands and forests respectively fldas and gldas sm products performed better in terms of uncertainty compared to era5 and ecv with an average uncertainty below 0 03 m3 m3 except for forests the above assessment results indicate that compared with the other three sm products era5 has a better performance and more potential for application in ca there was an upward trend in surface sm from 1982 to 2018 in ca the relationship between the four sm products and aridity index and drought events showed that gldas could capture the hydrothermal conditions and drought events followed by fldas era5 and ecv our research is intended to provide some reference for the application of gridded sm products to ecosystem and water resources monitoring in arid regions keywords soil moisture gridded products three cornered hat central asia uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm is the key link between the land surface and the atmosphere babaeian et al 2019 jung et al 2010 sm not only regulates the hydrology cycle by controlling the distribution of precipitation between surface runoff and soil infiltration but also controls the redistribution of energy between sensible and latent heat rahmani et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 in addition sm deficits induce droughts and affect vegetation growth such as photosynthetic and vegetation phenology luo et al 2021 samaniego et al 2018 yu et al 2022 therefore knowledge of regional and global sm status is essential for modeling and predicting water resources drought early warning and monitoring the ecosystem carbon cycles long term observational datasets are necessary for understanding sm dynamics on large scales however in situ observational data are too scarce particularly in arid regions to provide large scale spatial and temporal scale sm measurements chen et al 2014 gu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 recently reanalysis and remotely sensed gridded sm offered the new potential to bridge this limitation the latest european reanalysis interim v5 era5 sm data is currently available hersbach et al 2020 and the sm data from famine early warning systems network fews land data assimilation system fldas and the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 also have been increasingly used in terrestrial water resources assessment and ecological monitoring agutu et al 2021 guo et al 2018b li et al 2015 qing et al 2022 remotely sensed sm data have also been widely used dorigo et al 2017 ma et al 2021 including those from the advanced scatterometer ascat soil moisture and ocean salinity smos cyclone global navigation satellite system cygnss and the essential climate variable ecv sm products chakravorty et al 2016 kim and lakshmi 2018 liu et al 2020 remotely sensed sm data typically include sm information for the surface layer 5 cm compared to reanalysis data generally 100 cm due to detection capacity limitations dorigo et al 2017 luo et al 2020 peng et al 2017 these gridded products contribute to the understanding of sm dynamics on a large scale however considering model structural flaws errors in input datasets and scale scaling issues different sm products may have some uncertainties and errors chew and small 2018 gruber et al 2020 the uncertainty of sm products is magnified in arid and semi arid regions where there is a lack of sufficient in situ station data to construct high precision models or assimilation systems babaeian et al 2019 thus there is an urgent need to evaluate the reliability of gridded sm products to expand their application in model development and ecosystem monitoring the validation of gridded sm products is usually carried out by in situ data xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 in situ sm is measured directly and usually represents the sm condition of the site being measured or homogeneous surroundings however the number of in situ sites is limited and is unable to be expanded on a large spatial scale as a complement the three cornered hat tch method has been developed for sm evaluation when in situ data are not available the theory of tch is similar to the triple collocation tc approach kim et al 2018 kim et al 2020 stoffelen 1998 but differs in that tch can handle uncertainty in more than three uncorrelated variables under appropriate constraints tch is a regression method for quantifying the uncertainty of multiple independent datasets without prior knowledge liu et al 2021a the tch method is widely used to quantify the uncertainty of precipitation xu et al 2020 sm liu et al 2019 luo et al 2020 and evapotranspiration products xu et al 2019 across grids at a regional scale previous studies have provided a viable methodology for the evaluation and validation of sm products however most studies have focused on relatively humid and semi humid areas jung et al 2020 lacava et al 2012 wang et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 and less on arid regions central asia ca is the largest arid region in eurasia with vulnerable ecosystems that are sensitive to climate change chen et al 2020 deng et al 2020a yuan et al 2021 particularly to water cycle variability hu et al 2019 shi et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 ca is becoming a hotspot for focusing on carbon and water cycles chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 and extreme climate events such as droughts guo et al 2018a guo et al 2019 and floods zheng et al 2021 due to the lack of sufficient in situ observations gridded sm data have more potential for application to ecological monitoring in ca however limitations still exist as the effectiveness of the gridded sm products in ca has not yet been assessed to fill this gap the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the performance of era5 ecv fldas and gldas sm data through in situ data and tch methods 2 further reveal the spatial temporal characteristics of surface sm in ca from 1982 to 2018 based on these four sm products 3 finally assess the ability of these four gridded sm data to capture hydrothermal conditions and drought events in ca this study has important implications for water resource prediction and ecosystem modeling in ca and the wider arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ca 46 96 e 35 55 n covers kazakhstan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and xinjiang ca has a temperate continental climate characterized by hot summers and cold winters the lower precipitation mean annual precipitation from 155 to 270 mm and

in situ sm data respectively saver and oaver are the average values of gridded and in situ sm data respectively and n is the time series length bias measures the average deviation of the gridded sm products from the in situ sm rmse and ubrmse are the root mean square error and unbiased root mean square error respectively which were used to evaluate the errors of the four gridded sm 2 3 2 three cornered hat the tch method was used to estimate the uncertainties of four sm products and the details of the tch method are described as follows liu et al 2021a liu et al 2019 5 x i x true ε i i 1 2 3 n where xi is the time series of the ith sm product being evaluated and n denotes the number of sm products xtrue and εi represent the true value and error term of the sm respectively because the xtrue is not available one of the time series is used as a reference xr and the differences between xi and xr can be written as 6 d i m x i x r ε i ε r where d is an m n 1 matrix and m is the time samples therefore the variance of the differences is as follows 7 σ ir 2 σ ε i 2 σ ε r 2 2 cov ε i ε r as the differences between every two products are independent cov εi εr is equal to zero for n products n 1 differences can be obtained and stored in an m n 1 matrix as 8 d d 1 r d 2 r d 3 r d n 1 r the covariance matrix of the differences is obtained from the following equation 9 l c o v d

values r11 r22 r33 r44 were the uncertainty of evaluated sm before calculating the uncertainty the era5 and fldas sm products were resampled to 0 25 0 25 by bilinear interpolation xu et al 2021 to match the spatial resolution of the ecv and gldas 2 3 3 linear regression analysis linear regression analysis was used to measure the trend in surface sm the trend slope for each pixel was calculated as follows kawabata et al 2001 15 slope n i 1 n i y i i 1 n i i 1 n y i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where yi represents the variable y in the ith year and n is the total number of years in the study period 2 3 4 anomaly analysis to assess the ability of the four sm data to monitor drought standardized anomalies of the surface sm were calculated as follows 16 anomaly i j y i j m e a n y j std y j where anomaly i j is the variable j anomaly for a year i y i j is the value of variable j for a year i and mean yj and std yj is the average and standard deviation of variable j over the study period respectively 3 results 3 1 in situ evaluation fig 2 shows the relationship between the era5 ecv fldas and gldas sm datasets and in situ sm the fitted line between era5 sm and in situ sm is closer to the 1 1 line with the maximum coefficient of determination r2 0 45 followed by gldas fldas and ecv fig 3 a shows that the era5 sm is closer to the in situ observations with the minimum mean value of bias the bias values for ecv fldas and gldas are 0 08 m3 m3 0 04 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 respectively which underestimate in situ sm the era5 sm also shows better performance in capturing long term trends with a high correlation of 0 59 on average followed by gldas ecv and fldas fig 3b the rmse results are similar to bias with mean values of 0 075 0 086 0 100 and 0 106 m3 m3 for era5 fldas ecv and gldas respectively for the ubrmse fldas has a maximum average value of 0 054 m3 m3 and era5 ecv and gldas have comparable performance with average values between 0 039 m3 m3 and 0 044 m3 m3 the results show that the era5 ecv and gldas sm products have similar capabilities in absolute sm values and outperform the fldas sm products further the performance of the four sm products in different land covers fig 3e f and basins fig 3i l is revealed based on bias correlation rmse and ubrmse for grassland and sparse vegetation era5 performs better in terms of bias correlation and rmse compared to the other three sm products for forest era5 has the minimum bias and rmse values the higher correlation coefficient with gldas and the minimum ubrmse value the era5 sm product is observed in cropland with minimum bias and rmse and maximum correlation coefficient demonstrating a better performance ecv has a small bias and rmse for shrubland and bare areas demonstrating better performance compared to other products for basins i ii and iv era5 performs better in terms of bias correlation and rmse compared to the other three sm products for basin iii era5 has the minimum rmse and ubrmse values the highest correlation coefficient and the minimum bias value with gldas sm for basin v ecv and gldas perform better in terms of the correlation rmse and ubrmse compared to the other two sm products 3 2 three cornered hat based assessment the uncertainties of the four monthly sm products are assessed based on the tch method over ca during 1982 2018 fig 4 in general the four sm products all have low uncertainties for each sm product the area with uncertainty 0 08 m3 m3 occupies 13 of the ca generally all sm products have higher uncertainties in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and south eastern xinjiang which may be due to the mountainous and complex topography of these regions fig 4d the uncertainty of fldas and gldas is lower compared to era5 and ecv for fldas and gldas sm data the uncertainty is generally below 0 04 m3 m3 in all regions except kyrgyzstan and tajikistan showing a better performance the uncertainty of era5 sm is higher in the south of kazakhstan areas with sm uncertainty above 0 08 m3 m3 for ecv occupy 13 of the study area and are mainly concentrated in the mountainous regions of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan fig 5 shows the results of the tch evaluation on different land covers fig 5a d and basins fig 5e h for the four sm products for era5 shrubland has the highest uncertainty with a mean value of 0 07 m3 m3 while the mean value of uncertainty for other land covers is concentrated at 0 05 m3 m3 for ecv products the uncertainty of sm is higher in the forest 0 07 m3 m3 and lower in other land covers the fldas and gldas sm products show a better performance on land covers relative to other products in terms of uncertainty the mean value of uncertainty is below 0 03 m3 m3 as with the ecv products the uncertainty of the sm for fldas and gldas is higher in the forest than in other land covers for era5 basin i have the highest uncertainty with a mean value of 0 06 m3 m3 and basin iii has the lowest uncertainty for ecv products the sm uncertainty is the highest in basin iii 0 06 m3 m3 and the lowest in basin ii mean value of 0 03 m3 m3 the uncertainty in fldas and gldas sm is relatively low in all five basins mean value 0 03 m3 m3 similar to the performance in land cover in terms of the spatial distribution of the lowest uncertainty sm products era5 is mainly in the tarim basin of xinjiang ecv is mainly in central kazakhstan and southern uzbekistan fldas is mainly in northern kazakhstan and tajikistan gldas is distributed mainly in xinjiang turkmenistan and most of kazakhstan fig 6 a the results of the grid statistics for the lowest uncertainty show that gldas and fldas sm products occupy a larger percentage with 42 and 32 respectively the same results were observed for the land cover fig 6b and the different basins fig 6c in terms of the lowest uncertainty the gldas and fldas sm have a larger proportion on all land covers except shrubland for shrublands the largest proportion of sm products with the lowest uncertainty is gldas followed by ecv for basins i ii and v the largest proportion of lowest uncertainty was gldas followed by fldas sm products for basins iii and iv the largest proportion of sm products with the lowest uncertainty was gldas followed by era5 3 3 spatial and temporal patterns of surface sm fig 7 shows the spatiotemporal characteristics of the surface sm for these four gridded products annual averages for the four sm products from 1982 to 2018 show a consistent spatial pattern higher surface sm in northern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan and lower surface sm in turkmenistan and xinjiang in the south the spatial variation in surface sm averages for era5 is more pronounced compared to the other sm products with the surface sm averages exceeding 0 4 m3 m3 in the northern part of kazakhstan the era5 gridded data shows an increasing trend in surface sm in ca except for southern xinjiang and kyrgyzstan fig 7b the sm dynamics of ecv are similar to that of fldas both showing an increasing trend in surface sm over most of ca the gldas product shows an increasing trend in surface sm in all regions except turkmenistan and a small part of southern xinjiang the surface sm shows an increasing trend during 1982 2018 based on the interannual variability of the four products fig 7c as shown in fig 8 a forests have the highest surface sm followed by cropland grassland and spare vegetation the surface sm ranges for forest and cropland is 0 10 0 36 m3 m3 and 0 10 0 30 m3 m3 respectively for era5 and fldas the lowest surface sm is observed in bare areas and for ecv and gldas in shrubland fig 3b shows that the dynamics of the four sm products varied across the different land covers the era5 product shows an increasing trend in surface sm for all land covers except forest with the maximum slope 0 003 m3 m3 for shrubland for ecv products the mean surface sm slope is 0 for all land covers over the study period with the maximum slope 0 001 m3 m3 for the forest fldas and gldas products show similar results with all land covers showing a slight upward trend in surface sm 3 4 relationship between the surface sm and hydrothermal conditions to assess the ability of the four sm products to capture ca hydrothermal conditions the aridity index was divided into intervals of 0 01 to fit the curves between the sm fig 8c the curves show that the relationship between surface sm and aridity index is consistent with the trend of the hydrothermal gradient with a higher aridity index indicating a wetter and higher surface sm the strongest relationship between surface sm and aridity index is observed for era5 and gldas r2 0 69 and 0 68 followed by fldas and the weakest for ecv r2 0 05 in addition the ability of the surface sm to capture drought events is revealed based on the standardized anomalies of the four sm products as shown in fig 9 blue represents surface sm above the multi year mean red represents surface sm below the multi year mean and less than 1 standard deviation represents severe sm deficits drought drought events during the study period are represented by the scpdsi fig 9e which revealed severe drought events in ca in 1995 1997 and 2008 the surface sm anomalies of era5 and fldas capture severe drought events in 1995 and 1997 in 1995 and 1997 the sm of era5 and fldas was more than one time below the standard deviation showing a severe surface sm deficit the surface sm anomalies for era5 and fldas did not capture the severe drought event in 2008 with the surface sm showing a surplus ecv sm data did not capture the severe drought events recorded by scpdsi the surface sm anomalies from gldas captured severe drought events in 1995 1997 and 2008 with surface sm anomalies below one time the standard deviation in these years consistent with the drought events revealed by scpdsi the patterns of correlation between scpdsi and the four sm products further indicate that gldas has the highest positive correlation with scpdsi followed by fldas fig 10 there is no widely distributed positive correlation between scpdsi and era5 and ecv sm data with negative correlations in southern kazakhstan and xinjiang 4 discussion 4 1 performance of sm products in ca the assessment based on field data showed that era5 overestimates in situ sm in grasslands forests and sparse vegetation this may be related to the fact that these land use types are mainly distributed in high altitude mountainous areas and in northern kazakhstan where era5 derived a higher surface sm fig 1a and fig 7a previous studies have demonstrated that era5 tends to overestimate precipitation jiao et al 2021 sun et al 2021 and underestimate temperature rakhmatova et al 2021 in these regions which affects infiltration and evaporation processes and leads to sm overestimation era5 underestimates the in situ sm of cropland shrubland and bare areas while ecv fldas and gldas underestimate the surface sm of all land covers and the same finding was found in other regions luo et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 the underestimation of the surface sm may be due to a spatial scale mismatch resulting in the extreme values of the sm being grid averaged zhang et al 2018 in addition the depths measured by the four sm products and the in situ sm are different the sm from ecv remote sensing reflects only unfrozen water in the soil and limited depth 0 2 cm which may be the main reason for the underestimation of the surface sm luo et al 2020 zeng et al 2015 furthermore some studies have pointed out that it is difficult to describe the spatial pattern of sm by in situ measurements and that the few point measurements only reveal the temporal dynamics of sm chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 therefore more attention should be paid not only to rmse or bias values but also to correlation the temporal and spatial dynamics of the surface sm in ca can be captured by the era5 and gldas due to their high correlation with in situ data fig 3b this is also observed in the different land covers and basins with higher correlations of surface sm with the in situ data for era5 and gldas compared to ecv and fldas fig 3f j the spatial temporal dynamics of surface sm correlates with hydrothermal conditions berg and mccoll 2021 zhou et al 2021 which is also confirmed by our study the sm of era5 and gldas is highly correlated with the aridity index fig 8c in situ based observations are limited in ca and assessment by tch may complement the results of in situ validation on a spatial scale the tch based assessment shows that the areas of higher uncertainty for the four sm products are mainly concentrated in mountainous areas fig 4 this is the reason for the high uncertainty of the forest mainly in mountainous areas fig 5a d this higher bias may be due to some imperfections in the inversion model of sm for data processing in high altitude areas zeng et al 2015 for the ecv sm the accuracy of optical observations of remote sensing is affected by cloud cover and atmospheric conditions particularly in mountainous areas babaeian et al 2019 the variability of energy and the complexity of the terrain makes it difficult to control the accuracy of temperature or vegetation information in assimilation models which in turn leads to higher errors in general the uncertainties of all four sm products are concentrated in the range of 0 02 0 06 m3 m3 which is determined by a consistent spatial and temporal pattern fig 4 the uncertainty of the era5 sm is higher compared to fldas and gldas which was also confirmed in a recent global scale study xu et al 2021 and is mainly concentrated in the southern part of kazakhstan the era5 dataset has a high spatial resolution and based on era interim era5 introduces soil texture information corrected for terrestrial hydrological conditions to improve the sm simulation hersbach et al 2020 although the corrected algorithm can reduce sm errors in parts of the mid latitudes it still cannot provide accurate sm estimates due to its still large errors in temperature estimation at 2 m above the ground surface in ca scipal et al 2009 previous studies have revealed that inaccurate information on soil texture in fao can also lead to bias in sm products zeng et al 2015 it is worth noting that the areas with high uncertainty in era5 sm are mainly concentrated in shrubland fig 5a and we recommended that the module for the land cover component should be recalibrated in these areas to improve the accuracy of sm estimation in ca 4 2 surface sm dynamic and relationship to hydrothermal conditions recent studies have shown that there was an increasing trend of precipitation in ca over the last decades ren et al 2022 yao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the recharge of more precipitation may lead to an increase in surface sm which was confirmed in our study an increasing trend in surface sm was observed in ca based on gridded sm era5 ecv fldas and gldas from 1982 to 2018 fig 7b c although there may be some differences in the spatial distribution of the four sm products due to the different algorithms of each model kim et al 2020 the cru data indicates an increasing trend in precipitation over the study period and the high positive spatial correlation of the four sm products with precipitation also suggests that precipitation is the main driver of surface sm for ca fig s1 temperature shows a consistent trend of increasing with surface sm fig s1d which is different from previous studies luo et al 2020 this is because while increasing temperature promotes evapotranspiration it also accelerates snow and glacier melt to replenish surface sm deng et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 this is consistent with the fact that forests in mountainous areas show the most pronounced increase in surface sm fig 7b further there is some evidence for a negative correlation between the four sm products and temperature in regions of lower elevation and a positive correlation in regions of higher elevation fig s2e h as areas of water limitation changes in sm can significantly affect ca hydrothermal conditions and ecosystems bai et al 2019 hu et al 2019 our study shows that the sm products of era5 fldas and gldas capture the hydrothermal conditions of ca indicating that the wetter the region the higher the surface sm fig 7c the relationship between ecv sm and the aridity index suggests that remotely sensed ecv sm products may be less indicative of regional hydrothermal conditions due to satellite observations of sm being limited to the top few centimeters of soil hoffmann et al 2020 this also reveals that considering regional hydrothermal conditions when constructing assimilation models of sm can improve the accuracy of sm it is noteworthy that in some recent studies the sm is considered to be one of the more appropriate indicators when distinguishing between dry and wet regions taking into account the link between sm and climate and hydrology berg and mccoll 2021 zhou et al 2021 in addition sm deficits induce drought which has received increasing attention liu et al 2020 qing et al 2022 a strong positive correlation was observed between gldas and scpdsi fig 10 this may be because gldas has features similar to the forcings of pdsi ramirez et al 2022 our study confirms that gldas sm exhibits advantages in capturing drought on an annual scale compared to other sm products figs 8 10 this may be determined by the better fit of gldas to hydrothermal conditions fig 7c4 and the high correlation with precipitation fig s1d in contrast ecv sm does not capture the drought events and suggests the wrong message because of its weak correlation with hydrothermal conditions fig 7c3 due to increasingly frequent droughts sm stress has been increasingly referred to in carbon cycle simulations qing et al 2022 stocker et al 2018 and the great potential of highly drought sensitive sm products like gldas for drought monitoring in ca 4 3 limitations and uncertainties we evaluated four gridded sm products based on in situ station data and tch to provide a basis for the application of sm products in ca however there are still uncertainties in our study the performance of gridded sm is mainly assessed by in situ stations however due to measurement errors and soil topography vegetation heterogeneity and meteorological forcing in situ station data have some representativeness errors and cannot be avoided xu et al 2021 in addition model or remotely sensed retrievals of sm typically represent hundreds of square kilometers while in situ stations can only represent a few square meters which introduces some errors in scale conversion and may bias the study results crow et al 2012 however it is undeniable that in situ validation is probably the most accurate method for sm evaluation because it directly measures sm luo et al 2020 xu et al 2021 in the future spatial downscaling methods should be developed to reduce the errors in scale conversion between gridded products and observatory data fang et al 2022 kim et al 2018 moreover to reduce the impact of the difference between the reanalyzed and remotely sensed sm products during the freeze up period on the assessment results we only assessed the performance of the growing season sm products and masked the freeze up area based on the cci land use data however uncertainties in the assessment results remain as the cci land use data has some errors in the classification of frozen areas liu et al 2021b based on four sm products we reveal the variability of surface sm over the study period highlighting the effects of precipitation and temperature forcing on surface sm dynamics however sm variability is also influenced by vegetation deng et al 2020b lian et al 2020 topography chaney et al 2015 and radiation zhou et al 2021 and the above factors will be incorporated into future work to further reveal the factors affecting sm variability in ca 5 conclusions based on the era5 ecv fldas and gldas sm datasets this study assessed surface sm dynamics in ca and the performance of the four sm products mentioned above over the period 1982 2018 the performance of the four sm data was validated with data from in situ stations all gridded products underestimate the observed surface sm on a monthly scale the era5 sm outperformed the other three products with the smallest bias value era5 sm performed better in capturing long spatial and temporal trends with a higher correlation coefficient of 0 59 on average followed by gldas ecv and fldas in forest and cropland era5 sm products showed better performance with the smallest bias and rmse values and the largest correlation coefficients ecv showed better performance in shrubland and bare areas with smaller bise and rmse values compared to the other products for the five basins of ca era5 performs better in terms of bias correlation and rmse compared to the other three sm products uncertainty was quantified for the four monthly surface sm products in ca from 1982 to 2018 using the tch method in general uncertainty was low for all four sm products with fldas and gldas sm products having lower uncertainty than era5 and ecv all sm products had high uncertainty in higher elevation regions such as kyrgyzstan tajikistan and south eastern xinjiang for the era5 sm product shrubland has higher uncertainty 0 08 m3 m3 than another land cover forest had a high uncertainty relative to other land covers for the ecv fldas and gldas sm products on the basin scale era5 and ecv have the highest uncertainties in the basin i and basin iii respectively the uncertainty in fldas and gldas sm is low in all five basins mean value 0 03 m3 m3 compared to the other sm products the areas with the lowest uncertainty for gldas have a larger proportion 42 of the study area mainly in xinjiang turkmenistan and most of kazakhstan the results indicated that surface sm showed an upward trend in ca spatially all four sm products showed a broadly upward trend except for southern xinjiang kyrgyzstan and turkmenistan the era5 product shows an increasing trend in surface sm for all land covers except forest for the ecv fldas and glda products surface sm showed an upward trend for all land covers the ability of four sm products to capture hydrothermal conditions was assessed by fitting the relationship between the aridity index and surface sm the results showed that era5 and gldas found the highest relationship between surface sm and the aridity index r2 0 69 and 0 68 while ecv found the weakest the ability of the surface sm to capture drought events was further revealed based on the standardized anomalies of the four sm products we found that surface sm anomalies from gldas successfully captured severe drought events described by scpdsi in 1995 1997 and 2008 surface sm anomalies from era5 and fldas captured severe drought events in 1995 and 1997 but were insensitive to drought events in 2008 and ecv did not capture severe drought events recorded by scpdsi author contributions guli jiapaer designed the research tao yu processed the data and wrote the manuscript anming bao junfeng zhang haiyang tu and

2471,multi satellite gauge based and atmospheric reanalysis precipitation and temperature datasets with increasing spatiotemporal resolution are proliferating in recent decades their estimation accuracy has been evaluated in several areas but their applications in global hydrological monitoring and modelling have been poorly understood so far here we focus on the performance of the recently released multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 and the atmospheric reanalysis era5 temperature in modelling daily river discharge over 10 596 global catchments four lumped models including xaj gr4j hmets and hbv are employed to take different model conceptual schemes into consideration moreover different streamflow conditions including the peak timing and volumes of both high and low flows are evaluated to reveal further dynamics the results show that a the mswep v2 and era5 combination yields satisfactory performance in global streamflow simulation with at least one candidate model exhibiting kling gupta efficiency kge 0 5 at both calibration and validation periods for each catchment b better simulation skills are achieved in temperate cold polar and tropical köppen geiger climate zones whereas the arid zone has poorer performance c the xaj gr4j and hmets models with different degree of realisms have their own merits in simulating both daily mean flow and wet flow conditions but perform less satisfactorily in low flow conditions while the hbv exhibits consistently poor performance in various flow conditions over most catchments our findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate hydrological models by considering both climatic and geophysical conditions and targeting streamflow metrics and suggest the potential of using multi satellite and atmospheric reanalysis datasets as observed alternatives for quasi global hydrological modelling keywords satellite precipitation atmospheric reanalysis hydrological models runoff simulation global data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation is usually deemed as a key element in hydrological cycle daly et al 2008 yin et al 2022a yin et al 2022b but a challenging variable to estimate due to its high spatiotemporal heterogeneity beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b specifically meteorological and geographical conditions involving topography convection monsoon synoptic systems such as typhoon complicate precipitation physics and hamper precise precipitation estimation especially at a global scale prein and gobiet 2017 over the past decades a plethora of precipitation datasets have been developed attempting to bridge the gap between estimation accuracy and full coverage across the globe cmorph 2004 brocca et al 2014 skofronick jackson et al 2017 typically four principal measurements have been used to observe or estimate precipitation first the ground based in situ gauge observations can be the most accurate approach to determine point scale precipitation however the accuracy of regional or catchment scale precipitation is highly dependent on the network distribution density which is extremely variable at a global scale hijmans et al 2005 this hampers the use of in situ precipitation in ungauged regions fallah and orth 2020 second radars can offer high spatiotemporal resolution of localized precipitation but only cover economically developed regions and are typically not publicly available martens et al 2013 third satellite retrieved precipitation datasets which are especially suitable for tropics and convection dominated regions smith et al 2005 however these satellite retrieval approaches are incapable to catch light rainfall events leading to visible biases especially in cold climate zones kidd et al 2012 laviola et al 2013 last atmospheric reanalysis models are robust when looking large scale general patterns however rough resolutions and deficiencies in parameterizations of reanalysis models make them poorly characterize localized weather systems associated with convection yin et al 2021 motivated by the lack of a robust estimation of global precipitation beck et al 2019a developed a global 3 hour 0 1 gridded precipitation dataset the mswep v2 by optimally combining data from gauges satellites and reanalysis data sources this dataset that specifically designed for hydrological modelling took full advantage of the complementary strengths of multiple source datasets beck et al 2017a its strengths have been thoroughly investigated by several recent studies beck et al 2019b awange et al 2019 mazzoleni et al 2019 fallah and orth 2020 however to our knowledge no study has thoroughly evaluated the hydrological applicability of msewp v2 at a quasi global scale to date studies focusing on the hydrological application generally used streamflow observations from a small number of catchments limiting the generalization of their results almagro et al 2021 tarek et al 2020 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the processes from climate variables e g precipitation to their hydrological impacts are non linear a minor bias in precipitation could naturally lead to a small runoff bias in one basin but could also result in a multifold scaled runoff bias in another basin with different runoff generation mechanisms mpelasoka and chiew 2009 thus the superiority of precipitation dataset exhibited in the climate field may not be fully replicated in the impact field to obtain further insights into the mswep v2 it is important to perform a global hydrological analysis thoroughly investigating its capability in capturing streamflow characteristics on the other hand temperature is another important input to force precipitation runoff models the atmospheric reanalysis temperature provides an opportunity to bridge the gap of minimum input requirements in hydrological models particularly in large scale studies involving regions with sparse weather stations the era5 reanalysis released by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf owns high spatial 30 km and temporal 1 h resolutions and has increasingly been applied in environmental and hydrological fields hersbach et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 thus the era5 temperature is combined with mswep v2 to synergistically drive hydrological models precipitation runoff models have been developed over many decades ranging from physically based machine learning algorithm based to lumped conceptual models lees et al 2021 the performance of the physically based models has been increasingly examined at the global scale zaherpour et al 2018 müller schmied et al 2021 generally global hydrological models ghms contributing to the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isimip schewe et al 2014 warszawski et al 2014 including the watergap water global assessment and prognosis alcamo et al 2003 clm leng et al 2015 dbh tang et al 2007 h08 hanasaki et al 2008 lpjml rost et al 2008 are prominent pioneers in large scale hydrological simulations for example müller schmied et al 2016 employed the watergap model to investigate variations of global water balance components over 1901 2010 period and found that the human foot print and change in precipitation are two major factors in driving variations of runoff zhao et al 2017 applied nine ghms within the isimip project with the global river routing model cama flood to perform global flood simulations and found apparently improved agreement with observations zaherpour et al 2018 evaluated runoff simulations from isimip in 40 catchments across eight global hydrobelts and concluded that ghms generally perform better in the wetter equatorial and northern hydrobelts than in drier southern hydrobelts however without a calibration procedure these ghms typically perform unsatisfactorily in reproducing the observed streamflow for individual catchments at daily and monthly timescales hattermann et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 on the other hand machine learning algorithm is also a common approach to simulate global runoff using precipitation and temperature datasets as inputs ghiggi et al 2019 constructed a global gridded monthly runoff dataset spanning 1902 to 2014 by using a machine learning approach providing a good candidate for global water resources assessments compared with the physically based ghms and machine learning approaches conceptual hydrological models are usually combined with a calibration for individual catchments and enable to produce reliable river discharge at daily time scale with low computational costs and data requirements more recently the hydrological simulation performances of conceptual models have been extensively applied in various scientific and operational fields including agricultural monitoring flood and drought forecasting investigation of water dynamics wang et al 2017 schellekens et al 2017 and climatic controls on vegetation yang et al 2016 there exists a plenty of lumped hydrological models differing in the conceptual schemes to represent the stores and fluxes of water and energy the internal equations and processes and number of free parameters involved knoben et al 2019 lee et al 2021 for example the simple structure gr4j model and the high degree of realism xaj model perrin et al 2003 zhao 1992 regardless of their divergent complexity in model structures and parameterization differences in model performance is critical and instructive with regards to better understanding streamflow patterns and the evolving extreme events yang et al 2020 consequently there is an increasing need of large scale evaluations of model capability to identify appropriate model structure s in streamflow simulation context specifically whether lumped models with complicated structures and parameterization schemes demonstrate superiority than highly conceptual models deserve further evaluations in different streamflow conditions e g wet and dry extremes here we evaluate the applicability of multi satellite precipitation mswep v2 and reanalysis temperature era5 in hydrological simulation for 10 596 catchments in different climate zones over the globe in addition we assess the performance of four hydrological models differing in structures and parameterization including xaj gr4j hmets and hbv models in terms of both daily mean and extreme streamflow conditions e g peak timing and volumes of high flows and low flows the expectation is that such a large quantity of catchments and varied of model structures should provide more general understanding about hydrological performance of satellite blended and reanalysis climate estimations and enable us to explicitly reveal the strengths and weaknesses of varied hydrological models across climate types and zones 2 data 2 1 mswep v2 product the mswep v2 is the fully global precipitation dataset that optimally merging a range of gauge satellite and reanalysis estimates with a 0 1 spatial resolution from 1979 to near real time beck et al 2019a this mswep v2 precipitation dataset is superior than other gridded precipitation dataset in the following aspects a high spatial 0 1 and temporal 3 hourly resolution that fully cover global land and oceans increasing the local relevance of precipitation estimates b the optimal merging of a wide range of gauge satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets facilitate the best possible precipitation estimation at local scale c the distributional biases correction procedure effectively eliminate distorted precipitation peaks d the procedure of using observed streamflow from 13 762 global catchments enable the correction of systematic terrestrial biases e the procedure of employing daily observed precipitation from over 77 000 global gauges and a gauge correction scheme secure the robustness and precision of estimation in an evaluation of the dataset beck et al 2019b found that mswep v2 precipitation shows higher plausible spatial patterns in the mean magnitude and frequency than other state of the art datasets 2 2 era5 reanalysis dataset the state of the art era5 is the fifth generation reanalysis dataset from ecmwf and is currently publicly available from 1950 onwards hersbach et al 2020 we only focus on 1979 2017 period because limited observation information prior to 1979 potentially weaken the reliability of era5 its spatial resolution is 30 km and it contains atmospheric variables at 139 pressure levels several studies have evaluated the characteristics of era5 outputs in comparison to observations and other analyses and found era5 performs well olauson 2018 kalverla et al 2019 specifically surface air temperature in era5 have been proved to be of smaller mean background errors and considerably improved fit to observations when compared to previous era reanalysis releases in contrast observation stations with long time records are sparse over the globe lins 2008 burn et al 2012 menne et al 2018 limiting its application when estimating catchment averaged temperature globally therefore we select the era5 temperature data as the input in calibrating hydrological models 2 3 observed streamflow data streamflow records and the boundary data for 22 416 catchments located in five köppen geiger climate zones fig 1 beck et al 2018 were

models xaj gr4j hmets hbv are implemented and calibrated over all the available catchments the four hydrological models involving different model structures and parameters perform well in a wide range of hydrological regimes yin et al 2021 all four models require daily precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration as inputs consistent with previous studies gu et al 2021 the simple oudin formulation oudin et al 2005 is used to estimate potential evapotranspiration that used in conceptual hydrological models 3 1 1 the xaj hydrological model the xaj model zhao 1992 is a lumped and conceptual model based on evapotranspiration runoff generation runoff separation and runoff routing modules a three layer soil moisture module including four parameters is set up for evapotranspiration estimation the runoff generation contains three free parameters and occurs on repletion of storage to capacity values then the generated runoff scheme which has four free parameters is separated into three components surface runoff ground water and soil moisture runoff routing is achieved by using the muskingum method which includes four parameters gill 1978 the efficiency of the xaj model has been established over agricultural pastural and forested areas zhao 1992 considering snowmelt runoff the cemaneige model that contains two free parameters is incorporated into this model to estimate snowmelt from precipitation valéry et al 2014 3 1 2 the gr4j hydrological model the gr4j hydrological model is a lumped rainfall runoff model that only contains four free parameters perrin et al 2003 the first routine is to determine a net rainfall or a net evapotranspiration by subtracting potential evapotranspiration from precipitation then there is a production store reservoir 1 to determine the actual precipitation and evaporation rate a percolation leakage which is calculated as a power function of the store content is used to mainly simulate low flow simulation edijatno et al 1999 two unit hydrographs uh1 that combined with a non linear routing store reservoir 2 and uh2 are used to account for 90 and 10 of total flow components respectively the good performance of gr4j model has been tested over semi arid to temperate and tropical humid catchments perrin et al 2003 since this model lack snow accumulation and snowmelt algorithms cemaneige module is also incorporated in gr4j to consider snow related watersheds 3 1 3 the hmets hydrological model the hmets hydrological model was proposed by martel et al 2017 consisting of 21 free parameters this lumped conceptual model routs runoff mainly through four modules snow accumulation melting and refreezing evapotranspiration infiltration and flow routing schemes the snow module is based on a degree day model proposed by vehviläinen 1992 which contains 10 parameters and allows for melting and refreezing process within the snowpack the evapotranspiration module only involves 1 free parameter assuming that real evapotranspiration can be estimated by a linear function of potential evapotranspiration the vertical water balance controlled by 6 free parameters consists of three layers surface vadose and saturated zones outlet streamflow are then routed a horizontal transport scheme consists of by four components the surface and delayed runoff which involve two unit hydrographs the hypodermic flow and the base flow in an evaluation of the model martel et al 2017 found that hmets performed well over hundreds of catchments 3 1 4 the hbv hydrological model the hbv conceptual hydrological model was proposed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute to simulate urban runoff and streamflow forecasting bergström and forsman 1973 bergström 1995 this daily time step model contains 14 free parameters and 4 routines the snow routine involves 5 parameters and calculates snow accumulation and snowmelt by using a degree day method seibert and vis 2012 the soil routine is designed to estimate groundwater recharge and actual evapotranspiration which is controlled by 3 free parameters then there is a groundwater routine in which the runoff is computed as a function of water storage finally a triangular weighting function which contains 1 free parameter is used in the routing routine to rout runoff the hbv model has become widely used since 1970 s seibert and vis 2012 and is therefore applied in this study to simulate runoff 3 2 hydrological model calibration the precipitation oudin based potential evapotranspiration and observed streamflow series are used to calibrate free parameters in four hydrological models before calibrating hydrological models catchments with 20 years continuous streamflow record and with 90 of daily data are discarded then we determine a 20 year time window with the lowest missing data in the observed streamflow record to calibrate free parameters in which the odd years are used for calibration whereas the even years are used for validation following previous studies martel et al 2017 the optimal values for the free parameters in hydrological models are estimated based on the shuffled complex evolution optimization algorithm sce ua duan et al 1994 sce ua is used since it considers both deterministic and random search techniques and outperforms many other algorithms in calibrating hydrological models duan et al 1994 in terms of the objective function the kling gupta efficiency kge that based on a decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse considers correlation variability bias and mean value bias between simulated and observed streamflow series and is selected in this study nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 2009 this kge metric addresses several perceived shortcomings in traditional nse metric and has been prevalently used in recent studies knoben et al 2019 gu et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 almagro et al 2021 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r refers to the pearson s correlation coefficient β is the ratio of estimated and observed mean values and γ denotes the ratio of the estimated and observed coefficients of variation a kge of 1 indicates a perfect fit between simulated and observed streamflow generally a kge value higher than 0 5 can be considered good model performance rogelis et al 2016 therefore only catchments where at least one hydrological model shows kge 0 5 in both calibrated and validated periods are selected as a result 10 596 catchments are remained and used for the analysis to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the hydrological model in simulating daily runoff high flow and low flow signatures the nse and correlation coefficient cc are also used as metrics 2 nse 1 t 1 t q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 3 cc t 1 t q sim t q sim q obs t q obs t 1 t q sim t q sim 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 where q sim t and q obs t indicate simulated and observed streamflow or high flow and low flow metrics at the t day respectively t represent total time length q sim and q obs mean the average values of simulations and observations respectively like kge nse 1 cc 1 indicates perfect agreement between simulations and observations the high flow signatures are sampled by extracting the largest 10 events volumes and timing annually whereas the low flow signatures are estimated by the smallest 10 events volumes and timing annually 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of hydrological models the catchment averaged daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures and streamflow records are employed to calibrate and validate the xaj gr4j hmets hbv models over catchments in five climate zones the best performing hydrological model with the highest kge scores in calibration and validation periods are presented in fig 2 as shown the number of in situ observations allocated in north america south america europe china and australia dominate the population of streamflow gauges geographically wise our study cannot well represent the hydrological simulation performance in data sparse regions such as africa south asia middle east and russia there are 10 596 catchments with at least one hydrological model showing kge score higher than 0 5 indicating the applicability of mswep v2 in streamflow simulations specifically there are 9900 catchments yielding kge scores exceeding 0 7 during the calibration period where as 8607 catchments during the validation period though kge scores slightly decrease in the validation relative to the calibration these hydrological models generally perform quite well according to fig 2 we also find that the simplest gr4j model with the least number of free parameters shows strengths in a maximum number of catchments 4623 among the four hydrological models in terms of daily mean streamflow the xaj model exhibits the best simulation skill in 3110 catchments followed by the hmets model which is optimal in 2236 catchments the hbv model performs the best in only 627 catchments 5 92 of catchments spatially both gr4j and xaj perform slightly better in temperate cold and polar climate zones than in tropical and arid zones by contrast the hmets model tends to be more spatially homogeneous being the optimal in most global catchments e g in south america northern australia and southern china and only being less promising in some catchments located in the arid zone to reveal more details about simulation skills among the four hydrological models fig 3 presents differences in kge scores between the best performing model and the remaining models for example the first row shows differences in terms of kge between the best performing model the reference model hereafter and the xaj model over 7486 catchments the other 3110 catchments with highest kge scores in xaj model are neglected from the spatially averaged perspective the difference of kge scores between the hmets and the reference model is the smallest meankge 0 06 in calibration and meankge 0 10 in validation though the hmets model is optimal in only about 20 of catchments its simulation skills in the remaining catchments are comparable to the reference model indicating the wide applicability of hmets the difference of kge for gr4j is slightly larger than for hmets model with meankge 0 10 in calibration and meankge 0 12 in validation the xaj model in which the spatially averaged difference of kge is 0 14 in calibration and 0 17 in validation ranks the third finally the hbv model exhibits substantial differences in simulation skills to the reference model meankge 0 25 in calibration and meankge 0 27 in validation suggesting its limitation when performing streamflow simulations generally all the models except for hbv have a good ability to reproduce daily streamflow over different climate zones spatially the hmets demonstrates generally homogeneous simulation skills over five climate zones except for some catchments in the arid climate zone fig 3e f the wide application of this model with maximum number of free parameters among the four models suggests that complex structures in models might not superfluous when simulating streamflow across different climatic and geographical regions in terms of the gr4j and xaj models they are capable of capturing the main features of streamflow generation in most global catchments but struggle to produce reliable simulations in some catchments located in south america and northern australia fig 3a d the bad performance of xaj and gr4j in these tropical and arid catchments indicates their limitations the hbv model produces apparent kge difference to the reference model over most global catchments fig 3g h in fact it seems this model can only simulate streamflow in the cold climate zone e g northern north america and northern europe in which its performance is analogical to the reference model this is explainable the hbv model is specifically designed to consider the snowmelt runoff processes and is thus more appropriate in cold climates 4 2 hydrological performance evaluated by nse and cc metrics to better display the ability of hydrological models in capturing streamflow generation we also estimated the cc and nse scores for the reference model and the remaining models respectively in terms of cc the reference model consistently performs well with around 78 2 and 70 8 of catchments showing cc scores higher than 0 8 in calibration and validation periods respectively fig 4 moreover the spatial pattern of cc scores for the reference model is similar to the kge scores in which the scores are high over majority of catchments but are to some degree low in the middle of north america and europe generally the gr4j and hmets models are most approaching the reference model with both spatially averaged cc being 0 79 followed by the xaj presenting spatially averaged cc being 0 73 and finally the hbv only having averaged cc of 0 61 fig 5 this again demonstrates the pronounced ability of gr4j hmets and xaj models in hydrological simulations while the limitation of hbv to look further spatial details we find that both gr4j and hmets models demonstrate higher cc scores in temperate cold and polar climate zones while lower scores in tropical and arid zones fig 5d i specifically the gr4j hmets produce averaged cc scores of 0 80 0 80 in the former three climate zones while 0 73 0 79 and 0 71 0 67 in the latter two zones the xaj model achieves the best performance in polar zone with averaged cc score being 0 81 followed by the cold and temperate zones showing averaged cc of 0 75 and 0 72 and then the tropical and arid zones with averaged cc scores of 0 68 and 0 66 respectively fig 5a c the cc scores in the hbv model remains the lowest over majority of catchments particularly in tropical arid and temperate climate zones where the averaged cc scores are even lower than 0 60 fig 5j l overall model performance measured by the cc scores is typically in line with that by the kge scores fig 6 fig 7 presents nse scores in the calibration and validation periods for the reference model the remaining models the reference model determined by the kge metric still achieves acceptable performance in terms of the nse scores with 89 7 of catchments showing nse 0 5 and the global averaged nse being 0 69 in calibration period and 81 8 of catchments presenting nse 0 5 and the averaged nse being 0 65 in validation period fig 6 however there is high spatial variability of nse scores across the global catchments in the calibration period the values of nse range from 0 13 to 0 92 the nse scores in the validation period are slightly smaller than in the calibration but still present a wide range over global catchments with nse scores varying from 0 06 to 0 91 specifically the highest nse scores can be found in the temperate climate zone in average being 0 69 and they are also acceptable in the cold and polar climate zones in average being 0 67 and 0 68 respectively by contrast nse scores of catchments in tropical and arid climate zones are lower than in other zones with both spatially averaged nse 0 5 compared with the reference model the nse scores produced by the remaining models are lower as expected fig 7 nevertheless the nse values from the hmets are the closest to those obtained from the reference model with 62 7 of catchments exhibiting nse 0 5 and the global averaged nse being 0 61 median being 0 66 in the calibration period and 50 3 of catchments producing nse 0 5 and the averaged nse being 0 50 median being 0 58 in the validation period spatially this model performs well over most of catchments and exhibits averaged nse 0 5 in catchments of tropical temperate cold and polar climate zones though it produces some visible biases in arid regions leading to averaged nse 0 3 the gr4j and xaj model present similar performance in terms of nse being inferior to the hmets but superior to the hbv in detail the spatially averaged nse in xaj model are 0 34 in calibration median being 0 56 and 0 20 in validation median being 0 49 periods respectively among the five climate zones three of them temperate cold and polar demonstrates averaged nse 0 3 though the global median nse values in gr4j tend to be high being 0 66 in calibration and 0 60 in validation periods the global mean nse values are quite low only being 0 34 and 0 20 in calibration and validation periods respectively this indicates the apparent differences between median and mean values finally the hbv model consistently perform the worst with regard to nse metric with the nse 0 3 for all five climate zones 4 3 wet extremes simulations we also examine the reliability of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv models to simulate floods volumes and timing by kge and cc metrics and group the results by five climate zones figs 8 and 9 these hydrological models exhibit good ability to estimate the magnitude of floods with globally averaged kge scores being 0 63 0 62 0 64 and 0 56 for the xaj gr4j hmets and hbv respectively specifically the hbv model demonstrates worse simulations skills in capturing flood volumes compared to the other three models in line with its poor performance with regard to daily mean streamflow performance in the hmets model remains spatially homogeneous patterns as indicated by kge interquartile range smaller than 0 3 over five climate zones fig 8 in addition the xaj and gr4j models also produce promising performance in terms of flood volumes spatially all models provide superior simulation ability in the arid temperate and cold climate zones and inferior ability in the tropical and polar zones further the poor performance in tropical and polar zones are especially apparent in xaj and gr4j models with lower averaged kge scores and large interquartile ranges fig 8a b on the other hand we also identify the model showing the highest kge scores in simulating the flood volumes and compare them with the reference model we find that the superiority of the reference model related to daily mean streamflow only hold in 54 8 of catchments when simulating flood volumes this suggests that the selection of hydrological models should be taken carefully and targeted at specific aspects the cc metric presents similar patterns to kge scores fig 8e l which will not be further discussed for the sake of brevity compared with flood volumes the flood timing is less satisfactorily captured by hydrological models with globally averaged kge 0 3 for all four models fig 9 the differences of simulation ability related to flood timing are minor among four hydrological models regarding climate zones all four hydrological models provide almost consistent kge scores among five regions but slightly higher scores in tropical and temperate zones as illustrated in fig 9a d the cc metric presents similar patterns to those of kge those relatively low cc scores indicate poor performance in representing flood timing over four hydrological models overall these results exhibit the insufficiency of hydrological simulations in representing the timing of wet extremes 4 4 dry extremes simulations figs 10 and 11 illustrate the performance of four hydrological models in estimating low flow volumes and timing respectively with regard to low flow volumes xaj gr4j and hmets demonstrate reasonable cc scores with globally averaged values being 0 45 0 53 and 0 42 respectively fig 10e g by contrast the hbv model still performs the worst and the globally averaged cc score is only 0 31 fig 10 h spatially catchments in tropical temperate and cold climate zones have higher cc scores compared with catchments in arid and polar zones indicating better performance of hydrological models in the former three zones the kge scores are quite low for four hydrological models over five climate zones this can be in part explained by the high sensitivity of kge scores in low flow quantities nevertheless it also indicates the limitation of hydrological simulations in representing low flows again we investigate the performance of the reference model in characterizing low flow volumes there is only around 36 2 38 7 of catchments providing the highest cc kge scores in low flow volumes not shown indicating that the reference model may not the promising model in catching low flow conditions as expected the ability of hydrological simulations in estimating low flow timing is inferior than associated volumes among the four hydrological models cc scores in low flow timing are higher in xaj gr4j and hmets models globally averaged cc 0 24 0 29 0 26 in xaj gr4j hmets respectively and lower in hbv model cc 0 21 this again shows the poor ability of hbv model in characterizing streamflow with regard to the spatial variability low flow timing are better represented in catchments distributed in tropical temperate and cold climate zones with median cc values ranging between 0 20 and 0 34 than in arid and polar zones with median cc scores lower than 0 15 fig 11 this might be explained by that the low flows in arid and polar zones are mainly controlled by the groundwater rather than rainfall and these conceptual hydrological models could not realistically capture the groundwater dynamics and complex percolation properties 5 discussion this study aims to evaluate the potential of satellite blended and atmospheric reanalysis datasets in hydrological modelling and the applicability of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv models over 10 596 catchments we obtain pretty good performance using the combination of mswep v2 precipitation and era5 reanalysis temperature as forcing with all these catchments achieving kge higher than 0 5 and exceeding 80 of catchments yielding kge higher than 0 7 in calibration and validation periods besides we also use the cc and nse metrics to verify the reliability of the combination in hydrological simulations and obtained high scores these different criteria exhibit the robustness of high resolution precipitation and temperature in hydrological simulations on the other hand since hydrological modelling outcomes are more linked to precipitation than temperature these fairly good simulation skills potentially indicate that mswep v2 can substitute gauge based precipitation when performing global scale analysis or in data scarce regions jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tarek et al 2020 fig 12 displays the reference model efficiency in terms of kge as a function of catchment size through our set of 10 596 catchments in the calibration and validation respectively for the subset of catchments with areas between 500 and 10 000 km2 fig 12c many of them perform very well with the highest probability density occurring in the range of kge 0 875 0 90 the same pattern is exhibited for the catchments with areas between 1000 and 2000 2000 5000 5000 10000 10 000 100 000 km2 subsets for the groups of small catchments 200 and 200 500 km2 though the averaged kge scores are slightly lower they still perform well the group of super large catchments 100 000 km2 only include limited number of catchments 22 most of them have 0 8 kge scores in the calibration period and 0 7 kge scores in the validation period generally though groups with moderate size 500 100 000 km2 exhibit slightly better simulation skills there is no apparent difference between different size categories indicating that catchment size has minor impact on hydrological simulations moreover this again confirms the hydrological applicability of satellite based and atmospheric reanalysis datasets in varied size of catchments with regard to the four hydrological models we find xaj gr4j hmets have their own strengths while hbv consistently perform the worst the simplest model gr4j with only four free parameters demonstrates its simulation superiority in around 43 6 of catchments followed by the xaj achieving highest kge scores in around 29 4 of catchments though the complicated hmets model with 21 free parameters only performs the best in approximately 21 1 of catchments it exhibits the most homogeneous simulation skills across different climate zones we further present the performance of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv and the determined best performing models in each climate zone fig s1 although the xaj gr4j and hmets have different structural complexity they yield similar performance in temperate cold and polar catchments during calibration and validation these results suggest that simple snow module e g cemaneige in xaj and gr4j and routing processes e g two routing processes in gr4j are usually sufficient to simulate streamflow conditions in catchments within temperate cold and polar climates however only the hmets model exhibits good performance in tropical catchments while the xaj gr4j and hbv exhibit poor skills fig s1 this is also explainable because the complicated structures in hmets with 10 parameter snow module and four routing processes can better adapt to various hydro meteorological characteristics of catchments and facilitate its wide applicability which is in line with recent findings from tarek et al 2020 in addition we also notice that all the models present relatively poor performance in arid catchments this deficient skill of simulating streamflow in arid catchments by conceptual models has been reported by previous studies mcmillan et al 2016 mathevet et al 2020 clark et al 2008 used the framework for understanding structural errors fuse to diagnose relationships between model structure and model performance they reported that dry catchments involve both saturated areas and infiltration excess runoff lumped models usually do not have module for considering infiltration excess runoff and the saturated area parameterizations are used to compensate for this weakness therefore it is important to choose appropriate model structures in dry catchments newman et al 2015 declared that aridity can be the dominant factor influencing model performance and lumped models typically achieve higher efficiency in wetter catchments overall this illustrates structural inadequacies of such hydrological models in the context of arid catchments besides the hydrological model structures it should be noted that several other factors e g initial conditions precipitation inputs model parameters also play important roles in shaping streamflow conditions newman et al 2017 mizukami et al 2019 for example hashemi et al 2000 reported that several model parameters e g the percolation rate had a strong influence on flood estimation newman et al 2021 found that both initial conditions and precipitation frequency distribution might cause large uncertainties in floods simulation this suggests that more attention should be paid to various components in the entire hydrological modelling chain from meteorological forcing to the objective functions and the target flow conditions e g high flow low flow moreover the reliability of the mswep v2 precipitation and era5 temperature to force four hydrological models are further evaluated by the timing and volumes of both wet and dry extremes compared to the average streamflow condition the skills of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv in capturing extreme events are less satisfactory generally these hydrological simulations can better characterize wet extremes than low flow events and better represent volumes than timing this is explainable because wet extremes are primarily driven by precipitation forcing which further confirms the reliability of mswep v2 while low flows are mainly related to model structures beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b therefore using these simulations to perform further exploration such as flood analysis is acceptable while directly using them to simulate dry extremes could produce some biases and should be carefully considered the dry conditions in these catchments could be dominated by complicated physical and geomorphological conditions such as groundwater modulation which can not be correctly represented by these conceptual hydrological models future studies can consider other distribution hydrological models physically based land surface models and even combining machine learning with the current simulated streamflow to obtain corrected low flow conditions which is beyond the objective of this study there are some limitations worth clearly communication in model calibration and validation the choice of a 20 year time period actually represents a tradeoff between avoiding the non stationarity in long term streamflow series caused by global climate and land use change and calibration requirements for robustness long term record length can better represent catchment conditions and improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation in addition longer time window of continuous records could filter out a vast of catchments weaken the robustness of this study to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of model performance we further examine the kge in different time periods and seasons despite inconsistent time period among different catchments due to record limitation fig 13 similar scores can be found between the former and latter decades and the best performing models determined by the overall performance hold the highest kge regardless of decades fig s2 with regard to model performance in warm may october in northern hemisphere and november april in southern hemisphere and cold seasons satisfactory scores hold in temperate and cold catchments without much seasonal variations however the good model performance during the warm season slightly fades during the cold season in tropical catchments and markedly weakens in arid and polar catchments fig s3 the inferior performance of arid and polar catchments in the cold season is possibly due to a model structural inadequacies in arid and non perennial catchments mathevet et al 2020 b the use of the kge objective function in model calibration emphasizes on large runoff while arid and polar catchments typically produce low flows and even cut off during the cold season further different season division yields similar results fig s4 though these hydrological models exhibit varying performance in different seasons the selected models always achieve the highest scores implying the rationality of the determined best performing models there are now several potential other precipitation datasets that could have been included in future comparison such as era5 reanalysis precipitation gpm precipitation etc however the target of this study is a first evaluation of the combined satellite based and atmospheric reanalysis datasets in quasi global hydrological application and the suitability of four conceptual hydrological models with varying hydrological processes and parameters finally the hourly temporal resolution provides the opportunity to investigate sub daily hydrological response future work can focus on evaluating the sub daily performance of hydrological simulation with satellite based and atmospheric reanalysis datasets 6 conclusions the main objective of this study is to assess the combination of mswep v2 and era5 temperature as potential reference datasets for hydrological simulation and the model capability with different structures and parameters at a global scale by performing a large scale hydrological modelling study based on four conceptual hydrological models over different climate zones the main conclusions are summarized as follows a the first assessment shows that the transformation of mswep v2 precipitation and era5 temperature into runoff is satisfactory at 10 596 catchments in both the daily mean and high flow conditions the combined blended and reanalysis datasets perform quite well while in low flow simulations there are some visible biases b the catchment size cannot impact the hydrological performance indicating the combination datasets are appropriate from small sized watersheds e g 200 km2 to large scale catchments e g 100 000 km2 given that the density of the gauging station network is sparse in some areas mswep v2 and era5 reanalysis has the potential serving as an alternative to gauge based precipitation and temperature especially for large scale studies c in terms of the four hydrological models the gr4j model is optimal in most amounts of catchments though its performance in some tropical and arid catchments is less promising the xaj model also achieves the best in many catchments slightly fewer than the gr4j but its modelling skills in tropical and arid regions are still less satisfactory for the hmets model though it exhibits the best performance in a fewer number of catchments than the xaj it has a wider suitability over different climate zones and can better simulate streamflow in the tropics than others by contrast the hbv model consistently performs the worst in most of catchments and in terms of different metrics and streamflow conditions this study verifies the superiority of satellite based and atmospheric datasets in global streamflow modelling meanwhile the results show that both the simple gr4j and complicated xaj and hmets hydrological models have their own merits nevertheless more cares should be taken when forcing conceptual hydrological models in the arid catchments and we highlight the need to select appropriate hydrological models according to climatic and geophysical conditions when performing streamflow simulations credit authorship contribution statement lei gu

2471,multi satellite gauge based and atmospheric reanalysis precipitation and temperature datasets with increasing spatiotemporal resolution are proliferating in recent decades their estimation accuracy has been evaluated in several areas but their applications in global hydrological monitoring and modelling have been poorly understood so far here we focus on the performance of the recently released multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 and the atmospheric reanalysis era5 temperature in modelling daily river discharge over 10 596 global catchments four lumped models including xaj gr4j hmets and hbv are employed to take different model conceptual schemes into consideration moreover different streamflow conditions including the peak timing and volumes of both high and low flows are evaluated to reveal further dynamics the results show that a the mswep v2 and era5 combination yields satisfactory performance in global streamflow simulation with at least one candidate model exhibiting kling gupta efficiency kge 0 5 at both calibration and validation periods for each catchment b better simulation skills are achieved in temperate cold polar and tropical köppen geiger climate zones whereas the arid zone has poorer performance c the xaj gr4j and hmets models with different degree of realisms have their own merits in simulating both daily mean flow and wet flow conditions but perform less satisfactorily in low flow conditions while the hbv exhibits consistently poor performance in various flow conditions over most catchments our findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate hydrological models by considering both climatic and geophysical conditions and targeting streamflow metrics and suggest the potential of using multi satellite and atmospheric reanalysis datasets as observed alternatives for quasi global hydrological modelling keywords satellite precipitation atmospheric reanalysis hydrological models runoff simulation global data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation is usually deemed as a key element in hydrological cycle daly et al 2008 yin et al 2022a yin et al 2022b but a challenging variable to estimate due to its high spatiotemporal heterogeneity beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b specifically meteorological and geographical conditions involving topography convection monsoon synoptic systems such as typhoon complicate precipitation physics and hamper precise precipitation estimation especially at a global scale prein and gobiet 2017 over the past decades a plethora of precipitation datasets have been developed attempting to bridge the gap between estimation accuracy and full coverage across the globe cmorph 2004 brocca et al 2014 skofronick jackson et al 2017 typically four principal measurements have been used to observe or estimate precipitation first the ground based in situ gauge observations can be the most accurate approach to determine point scale precipitation however the accuracy of regional or catchment scale precipitation is highly dependent on the network distribution density which is extremely variable at a global scale hijmans et al 2005 this hampers the use of in situ precipitation in ungauged regions fallah and orth 2020 second radars can offer high spatiotemporal resolution of localized precipitation but only cover economically developed regions and are typically not publicly available martens et al 2013 third satellite retrieved precipitation datasets which are especially suitable for tropics and convection dominated regions smith et al 2005 however these satellite retrieval approaches are incapable to catch light rainfall events leading to visible biases especially in cold climate zones kidd et al 2012 laviola et al 2013 last atmospheric reanalysis models are robust when looking large scale general patterns however rough resolutions and deficiencies in parameterizations of reanalysis models make them poorly characterize localized weather systems associated with convection yin et al 2021 motivated by the lack of a robust estimation of global precipitation beck et al 2019a developed a global 3 hour 0 1 gridded precipitation dataset the mswep v2 by optimally combining data from gauges satellites and reanalysis data sources this dataset that specifically designed for hydrological modelling took full advantage of the complementary strengths of multiple source datasets beck et al 2017a its strengths have been thoroughly investigated by several recent studies beck et al 2019b awange et al 2019 mazzoleni et al 2019 fallah and orth 2020 however to our knowledge no study has thoroughly evaluated the hydrological applicability of msewp v2 at a quasi global scale to date studies focusing on the hydrological application generally used streamflow observations from a small number of catchments limiting the generalization of their results almagro et al 2021 tarek et al 2020 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the processes from climate variables e g precipitation to their hydrological impacts are non linear a minor bias in precipitation could naturally lead to a small runoff bias in one basin but could also result in a multifold scaled runoff bias in another basin with different runoff generation mechanisms mpelasoka and chiew 2009 thus the superiority of precipitation dataset exhibited in the climate field may not be fully replicated in the impact field to obtain further insights into the mswep v2 it is important to perform a global hydrological analysis thoroughly investigating its capability in capturing streamflow characteristics on the other hand temperature is another important input to force precipitation runoff models the atmospheric reanalysis temperature provides an opportunity to bridge the gap of minimum input requirements in hydrological models particularly in large scale studies involving regions with sparse weather stations the era5 reanalysis released by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf owns high spatial 30 km and temporal 1 h resolutions and has increasingly been applied in environmental and hydrological fields hersbach et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 thus the era5 temperature is combined with mswep v2 to synergistically drive hydrological models precipitation runoff models have been developed over many decades ranging from physically based machine learning algorithm based to lumped conceptual models lees et al 2021 the performance of the physically based models has been increasingly examined at the global scale zaherpour et al 2018 müller schmied et al 2021 generally global hydrological models ghms contributing to the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isimip schewe et al 2014 warszawski et al 2014 including the watergap water global assessment and prognosis alcamo et al 2003 clm leng et al 2015 dbh tang et al 2007 h08 hanasaki et al 2008 lpjml rost et al 2008 are prominent pioneers in large scale hydrological simulations for example müller schmied et al 2016 employed the watergap model to investigate variations of global water balance components over 1901 2010 period and found that the human foot print and change in precipitation are two major factors in driving variations of runoff zhao et al 2017 applied nine ghms within the isimip project with the global river routing model cama flood to perform global flood simulations and found apparently improved agreement with observations zaherpour et al 2018 evaluated runoff simulations from isimip in 40 catchments across eight global hydrobelts and concluded that ghms generally perform better in the wetter equatorial and northern hydrobelts than in drier southern hydrobelts however without a calibration procedure these ghms typically perform unsatisfactorily in reproducing the observed streamflow for individual catchments at daily and monthly timescales hattermann et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 on the other hand machine learning algorithm is also a common approach to simulate global runoff using precipitation and temperature datasets as inputs ghiggi et al 2019 constructed a global gridded monthly runoff dataset spanning 1902 to 2014 by using a machine learning approach providing a good candidate for global water resources assessments compared with the physically based ghms and machine learning approaches conceptual hydrological models are usually combined with a calibration for individual catchments and enable to produce reliable river discharge at daily time scale with low computational costs and data requirements more recently the hydrological simulation performances of conceptual models have been extensively applied in various scientific and operational fields including agricultural monitoring flood and drought forecasting investigation of water dynamics wang et al 2017 schellekens et al 2017 and climatic controls on vegetation yang et al 2016 there exists a plenty of lumped hydrological models differing in the conceptual schemes to represent the stores and fluxes of water and energy the internal equations and processes and number of free parameters involved knoben et al 2019 lee et al 2021 for example the simple structure gr4j model and the high degree of realism xaj model perrin et al 2003 zhao 1992 regardless of their divergent complexity in model structures and parameterization differences in model performance is critical and instructive with regards to better understanding streamflow patterns and the evolving extreme events yang et al 2020 consequently there is an increasing need of large scale evaluations of model capability to identify appropriate model structure s in streamflow simulation context specifically whether lumped models with complicated structures and parameterization schemes demonstrate superiority than highly conceptual models deserve further evaluations in different streamflow conditions e g wet and dry extremes here we evaluate the applicability of multi satellite precipitation mswep v2 and reanalysis temperature era5 in hydrological simulation for 10 596 catchments in different climate zones over the globe in addition we assess the performance of four hydrological models differing in structures and parameterization including xaj gr4j hmets and hbv models in terms of both daily mean and extreme streamflow conditions e g peak timing and volumes of high flows and low flows the expectation is that such a large quantity of catchments and varied of model structures should provide more general understanding about hydrological performance of satellite blended and reanalysis climate estimations and enable us to explicitly reveal the strengths and weaknesses of varied hydrological models across climate types and zones 2 data 2 1 mswep v2 product the mswep v2 is the fully global precipitation dataset that optimally merging a range of gauge satellite and reanalysis estimates with a 0 1 spatial resolution from 1979 to near real time beck et al 2019a this mswep v2 precipitation dataset is superior than other gridded precipitation dataset in the following aspects a high spatial 0 1 and temporal 3 hourly resolution that fully cover global land and oceans increasing the local relevance of precipitation estimates b the optimal merging of a wide range of gauge satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets facilitate the best possible precipitation estimation at local scale c the distributional biases correction procedure effectively eliminate distorted precipitation peaks d the procedure of using observed streamflow from 13 762 global catchments enable the correction of systematic terrestrial biases e the procedure of employing daily observed precipitation from over 77 000 global gauges and a gauge correction scheme secure the robustness and precision of estimation in an evaluation of the dataset beck et al 2019b found that mswep v2 precipitation shows higher plausible spatial patterns in the mean magnitude and frequency than other state of the art datasets 2 2 era5 reanalysis dataset the state of the art era5 is the fifth generation reanalysis dataset from ecmwf and is currently publicly available from 1950 onwards hersbach et al 2020 we only focus on 1979 2017 period because limited observation information prior to 1979 potentially weaken the reliability of era5 its spatial resolution is 30 km and it contains atmospheric variables at 139 pressure levels several studies have evaluated the characteristics of era5 outputs in comparison to observations and other analyses and found era5 performs well olauson 2018 kalverla et al 2019 specifically surface air temperature in era5 have been proved to be of smaller mean background errors and considerably improved fit to observations when compared to previous era reanalysis releases in contrast observation stations with long time records are sparse over the globe lins 2008 burn et al 2012 menne et al 2018 limiting its application when estimating catchment averaged temperature globally therefore we select the era5 temperature data as the input in

models xaj gr4j hmets hbv are implemented and calibrated over all the available catchments the four hydrological models involving different model structures and parameters perform well in a wide range of hydrological regimes yin et al 2021 all four models require daily precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration as inputs consistent with previous studies gu et al 2021 the simple oudin formulation oudin et al 2005 is used to estimate potential evapotranspiration that used in conceptual hydrological models 3 1 1 the xaj hydrological model the xaj model zhao 1992 is a lumped and conceptual model based on evapotranspiration runoff generation runoff separation and runoff routing modules a three layer soil moisture module including four parameters is set up for evapotranspiration estimation the runoff generation contains three free parameters and occurs on repletion of storage to capacity values then the generated runoff scheme which has four free parameters is separated into three components surface runoff ground water and soil moisture runoff routing is achieved by using the muskingum method which includes four parameters gill 1978 the efficiency of the xaj model has been established over agricultural pastural and forested areas zhao 1992 considering snowmelt runoff the cemaneige model that contains two free parameters is incorporated into this model to estimate snowmelt from precipitation valéry et al 2014 3 1 2 the gr4j hydrological model the gr4j hydrological model is a lumped rainfall runoff model that only contains four free parameters perrin et al 2003 the first routine is to determine a net rainfall or a net evapotranspiration by subtracting potential evapotranspiration from precipitation then there is a production store reservoir 1 to determine the actual precipitation and evaporation rate a percolation leakage which is calculated as a power function of the store content is used to mainly simulate low flow simulation edijatno et al 1999 two unit hydrographs uh1 that combined with a non linear routing store reservoir 2 and uh2 are used to account for 90 and 10 of total flow components respectively the good performance of gr4j model has been tested over semi arid to temperate and tropical humid catchments perrin et al 2003 since this model lack snow accumulation and snowmelt algorithms cemaneige module is also incorporated in gr4j to consider snow related watersheds 3 1 3 the hmets hydrological model the hmets hydrological model was proposed by martel et al 2017 consisting of 21 free parameters this lumped conceptual model routs runoff mainly through four modules snow accumulation melting and refreezing evapotranspiration infiltration and flow routing schemes the snow module is based on a degree day model proposed by vehviläinen 1992 which contains 10 parameters and allows for melting and refreezing process within the snowpack the evapotranspiration module only involves 1 free parameter assuming that real evapotranspiration can be estimated by a linear function of potential evapotranspiration the vertical water balance controlled by 6 free parameters consists of three layers surface vadose and saturated zones outlet streamflow are then routed a horizontal transport scheme consists of by four components the surface and delayed runoff which involve two unit hydrographs the hypodermic flow and the base flow in an evaluation of the model martel et al 2017 found that hmets performed well over hundreds of catchments 3 1 4 the hbv hydrological model the hbv conceptual hydrological model was proposed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute to simulate urban runoff and streamflow forecasting bergström and forsman 1973 bergström 1995 this daily time step model contains 14 free parameters and 4 routines the snow routine involves 5 parameters and calculates snow accumulation and snowmelt by using a degree day method seibert and vis 2012 the soil routine is designed to estimate groundwater recharge and actual evapotranspiration which is controlled by 3 free parameters then there is a groundwater routine in which the runoff is computed as a function of water storage finally a triangular weighting function which contains 1 free parameter is used in the routing routine to rout runoff the hbv model has become widely used since 1970 s seibert and vis 2012 and is therefore applied in this study to simulate runoff 3 2 hydrological model calibration the precipitation oudin based potential evapotranspiration and observed streamflow series are used to calibrate free parameters in four hydrological models before calibrating hydrological models catchments with 20 years continuous streamflow record and with 90 of daily data are discarded then we determine a 20 year time window with the lowest missing data in the observed streamflow record to calibrate free parameters in which the odd years are used for calibration whereas the even years are used for validation following previous studies martel et al 2017 the optimal values for the free parameters in hydrological models are estimated based on the shuffled complex evolution optimization algorithm sce ua duan et al 1994 sce ua is used since it considers both deterministic and random search techniques and outperforms many other algorithms in calibrating hydrological models duan et al 1994 in terms of the objective function the kling gupta efficiency kge that based on a decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse considers correlation variability bias and mean value bias between simulated and observed streamflow series and is selected in this study nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 2009 this kge metric addresses several perceived shortcomings in traditional nse metric and has been prevalently used in recent studies knoben et al 2019 gu et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 almagro et al 2021 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r refers to the pearson s correlation coefficient β is the ratio of estimated and observed mean values and γ denotes the ratio of the estimated and observed coefficients of variation a kge of 1 indicates a perfect fit between simulated and observed streamflow generally a kge value higher than 0 5 can be considered good model performance rogelis et al 2016 therefore only catchments where at least one hydrological model shows kge 0 5 in both calibrated and validated periods are selected as a result 10 596 catchments are remained and used for the analysis to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the hydrological model in simulating daily runoff high flow and low flow signatures the nse and correlation coefficient cc are also used as metrics 2 nse 1 t 1 t q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 3 cc t 1 t q sim t q sim q obs t q obs t 1 t q sim t q sim 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 where q sim t and q obs t indicate simulated and observed streamflow or high flow and low flow metrics at the t day respectively t represent total time length q sim and q obs mean the average values of simulations and observations respectively like kge nse 1 cc 1 indicates perfect agreement between simulations and observations the high flow signatures are sampled by extracting the largest 10 events volumes and timing annually whereas the low flow signatures are estimated by the smallest 10 events volumes and timing annually 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of hydrological models the catchment averaged daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures and streamflow records are employed to calibrate and validate the xaj gr4j hmets hbv models over catchments in five climate zones the best performing hydrological model with the highest kge scores in calibration and validation periods are presented in fig 2 as shown the number of in situ observations allocated in north america south america europe china and australia dominate the population of streamflow gauges geographically wise our study cannot well represent the hydrological simulation performance in data sparse regions such as africa south asia middle east and russia there are 10 596 catchments with at least one hydrological model showing kge score higher than 0 5 indicating the applicability of mswep v2 in streamflow simulations specifically there are 9900 catchments yielding kge scores exceeding 0 7 during the calibration period where as 8607 catchments during the validation period though kge scores slightly decrease in the validation relative to the calibration these hydrological models generally perform quite well according to fig 2 we also find that the simplest gr4j model with the least number of free parameters shows strengths in a maximum number of catchments 4623 among the four hydrological models in terms of daily mean streamflow the xaj model exhibits the best simulation skill in 3110 catchments followed by the hmets model which is optimal in 2236 catchments the hbv model performs the best in only 627 catchments 5 92 of catchments spatially both gr4j and xaj perform slightly better in temperate cold and polar climate zones than in tropical and arid zones by contrast the hmets model tends to be more spatially homogeneous being the optimal in most global catchments e g in south america northern australia and southern china and only being less promising in some catchments located in the arid zone to reveal more details about simulation skills among the four hydrological models fig 3 presents differences in kge scores between the best performing model and the remaining models for example the first row shows differences in terms of kge between the best performing model the reference model hereafter and the xaj model over 7486 catchments the other 3110 catchments with highest kge scores in xaj model are neglected from the spatially averaged perspective the difference of kge scores between the hmets and the reference model is the smallest meankge 0 06 in calibration and meankge 0 10 in validation though the hmets model is optimal in only about 20 of catchments its simulation skills in the remaining catchments are comparable to the reference model indicating the wide applicability of hmets the difference of kge for gr4j is slightly larger than for hmets model with meankge 0 10 in calibration and meankge 0 12 in validation the xaj model in which the spatially averaged difference of kge is 0 14 in calibration and 0 17 in validation ranks the third finally the hbv model exhibits substantial differences in simulation skills to the reference model meankge 0 25 in calibration and meankge 0 27 in validation suggesting its limitation when performing streamflow simulations generally all the models except for hbv have a good ability to reproduce daily streamflow over different climate zones spatially the hmets demonstrates generally homogeneous simulation skills over five climate zones except for some catchments in the arid climate zone fig 3e f the wide application of this model with maximum number of free parameters among the four models suggests that complex structures in models might not superfluous when simulating streamflow across different climatic and geographical regions in terms of the gr4j and xaj models they are capable of capturing the main features of streamflow generation in most global catchments but struggle to produce reliable simulations in some catchments located in south america and northern australia fig 3a d the bad performance of xaj and gr4j in these tropical and arid catchments indicates their limitations the hbv model produces apparent kge difference to the reference model over most global catchments fig 3g h in fact it seems this model can only simulate streamflow in the cold climate zone e g northern north america and northern europe in which its performance is analogical to the reference model this is explainable the hbv model is specifically designed to consider the snowmelt runoff processes and is thus more appropriate in cold climates 4 2 hydrological performance evaluated by nse and cc metrics to better display the ability of hydrological models in capturing streamflow generation we also estimated the cc and nse scores for the reference model and the remaining models respectively in terms of cc the reference model consistently performs well with around 78 2 and 70 8 of catchments showing cc scores higher than 0 8 in calibration and validation periods respectively fig 4 moreover the spatial pattern of cc scores for the reference model is similar to the kge scores in which the scores are high over majority of catchments but are to some degree low in the middle of north america and europe generally the gr4j and hmets models are most approaching the reference model with both spatially averaged cc being 0 79 followed by the xaj presenting spatially averaged cc being 0 73 and finally the hbv only having averaged cc of 0 61 fig 5 this again demonstrates the pronounced ability of gr4j hmets and xaj models in hydrological simulations while the limitation of hbv to look further spatial details we find that both gr4j and hmets models demonstrate higher cc scores in temperate cold and polar climate zones while lower scores in tropical and arid zones fig 5d i specifically the gr4j hmets produce averaged cc scores of 0 80 0 80 in the former three climate zones while 0 73 0 79 and 0 71 0 67 in the latter two zones the xaj model achieves the best performance in polar zone with averaged cc score being 0 81 followed by the cold and temperate zones showing averaged cc of 0 75 and 0 72 and then the tropical and arid zones with averaged cc scores of 0 68 and 0 66 respectively fig 5a c the cc scores in the hbv model remains the lowest over majority of catchments particularly in tropical arid and temperate climate zones where the averaged cc scores are even lower than 0 60 fig 5j l overall model performance measured by the cc scores is typically in line with that by the kge scores fig 6 fig 7 presents nse scores in the calibration and validation periods for the reference model the remaining models the reference model determined by the kge metric still achieves acceptable performance in terms of the nse scores with 89 7 of catchments showing nse 0 5 and the global averaged nse being 0 69 in calibration period and 81 8 of catchments presenting nse 0 5 and the averaged nse being 0 65 in validation period fig 6 however there is high spatial variability of nse scores across the global catchments in the calibration period the values of nse range from 0 13 to 0 92 the nse scores in the validation period are slightly smaller than in the calibration but still present a wide range over global catchments with nse scores varying from 0 06 to 0 91 specifically the highest nse scores can be found in the temperate climate zone in average being 0 69 and they are also acceptable in the cold and polar climate zones in average being 0 67 and 0 68 respectively by contrast nse scores of catchments in tropical and arid climate zones are lower than in other zones with both spatially averaged nse 0 5 compared with the reference model the nse scores produced by the remaining models are lower as expected fig 7 nevertheless the nse values from the hmets are the closest to those obtained from the reference model with 62 7 of catchments exhibiting nse 0 5 and the global averaged nse being 0 61 median being 0 66 in the calibration period and 50 3 of catchments producing nse 0 5 and the averaged nse being 0 50 median being 0 58 in the validation period spatially this model performs well over most of catchments and exhibits averaged nse 0 5 in catchments of tropical temperate cold and polar climate zones though it produces some visible biases in arid regions leading to averaged nse 0 3 the gr4j and xaj model present similar performance in terms of nse being inferior to the hmets but superior to the hbv in detail the spatially averaged nse in xaj model are 0 34 in calibration median being 0 56 and 0 20 in validation median being 0 49 periods respectively among the five climate zones three of them temperate cold and polar demonstrates averaged nse 0 3 though the global median nse values in gr4j tend to be high being 0 66 in calibration and 0 60 in validation periods the global mean nse values are quite low only being 0 34 and 0 20 in calibration and validation periods respectively this indicates the apparent differences between median and mean values finally the hbv model consistently perform the worst with regard to nse metric with the nse 0 3 for all five climate zones 4 3 wet extremes simulations we also examine the reliability of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv models to simulate floods volumes and timing by kge and cc metrics and group the results by five climate zones figs 8 and 9 these hydrological models exhibit good ability to estimate the magnitude of floods with globally averaged kge scores being 0 63 0 62 0 64 and 0 56 for the xaj gr4j hmets and hbv respectively specifically the hbv model demonstrates worse simulations skills in capturing flood volumes compared to the other three models in line with its poor performance with regard to daily mean streamflow performance in the hmets model remains spatially homogeneous patterns as indicated by kge interquartile range smaller than 0 3 over five climate zones fig 8 in addition the xaj and gr4j models also produce promising performance in terms of flood volumes spatially all models provide superior simulation ability in the arid temperate and cold climate zones and inferior ability in the tropical and polar zones further the poor performance in tropical and polar zones are especially apparent in xaj and gr4j models with lower averaged kge scores and large interquartile ranges fig 8a b on the other hand we also identify the model showing the highest kge scores in simulating the flood volumes and compare them with the reference model we find that the superiority of the reference model related to daily mean streamflow only hold in 54 8 of catchments when simulating flood volumes this suggests that the selection of hydrological models should be taken carefully and targeted at specific aspects the cc metric presents similar patterns to kge scores fig 8e l which will not be further discussed for the sake of brevity compared with flood volumes the flood timing is less satisfactorily captured by hydrological models with globally averaged kge 0 3 for all four models fig 9 the differences of simulation ability related to flood timing are minor among four hydrological models regarding climate zones all four hydrological models provide almost consistent kge scores among five regions but slightly higher scores in tropical and temperate zones as illustrated in fig 9a d the cc metric presents similar patterns to those of kge those relatively low cc scores indicate poor performance in representing flood timing over four hydrological models overall these results exhibit the insufficiency of hydrological simulations in representing the timing of wet extremes 4 4 dry extremes simulations figs 10 and 11 illustrate the performance of four hydrological models in estimating low flow volumes and timing respectively with regard to low flow volumes xaj gr4j and hmets demonstrate reasonable cc scores with globally averaged values being 0 45 0 53 and 0 42 respectively fig 10e g by contrast the hbv model still performs the worst and the globally averaged cc score is only 0 31 fig 10 h spatially catchments in tropical temperate and cold climate zones have higher cc scores compared with catchments in arid and polar zones indicating better performance of hydrological models in the former three zones the kge scores are quite low for four hydrological models over five climate zones this can be in part explained by the high sensitivity of kge scores in low flow quantities nevertheless it also indicates the limitation of hydrological simulations in representing low flows again we investigate the performance of the reference model in characterizing low flow volumes there is only around 36 2 38 7 of catchments providing the highest cc kge scores in low flow volumes not shown indicating that the reference model may not the promising model in catching low flow conditions as expected the ability of hydrological simulations in estimating low flow timing is inferior than associated volumes among the four hydrological models cc scores in low flow timing are higher in xaj gr4j and hmets models globally averaged cc 0 24 0 29 0 26 in xaj gr4j hmets respectively and lower in hbv model cc 0 21 this again shows the poor ability of hbv model in characterizing streamflow with regard to the spatial variability low flow timing are better represented in catchments distributed in tropical temperate and cold climate zones with median cc values ranging between 0 20 and 0 34 than in arid and polar zones with median cc scores lower than 0 15 fig 11 this might be explained by that the low flows in arid and polar zones are mainly controlled by the groundwater rather than rainfall and these conceptual hydrological models could not realistically capture the groundwater dynamics and complex percolation properties 5 discussion this study aims to evaluate the potential of satellite blended and atmospheric reanalysis datasets in hydrological modelling and the applicability of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv models over 10 596 catchments we obtain pretty good performance using the combination of mswep v2 precipitation and era5 reanalysis temperature as forcing with all these catchments achieving kge higher than 0 5 and exceeding 80 of catchments yielding kge higher than 0 7 in calibration and validation periods besides we also use the cc and nse metrics to verify the reliability of the combination in hydrological simulations and obtained high scores these different criteria exhibit the robustness of high resolution precipitation and temperature in hydrological simulations on the other hand since hydrological modelling outcomes are more linked to precipitation than temperature these fairly good simulation skills potentially indicate that mswep v2 can substitute gauge based precipitation when performing global scale analysis or in data scarce regions jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tarek et al 2020 fig 12 displays the reference model efficiency in terms of kge as a function of catchment size through our set of 10 596 catchments in the calibration and validation respectively for the subset of catchments with areas between 500 and 10 000 km2 fig 12c many of them perform very well with the highest probability density occurring in the range of kge 0 875 0 90 the same pattern is exhibited for the catchments with areas between 1000 and 2000 2000 5000 5000 10000 10 000 100 000 km2 subsets for the groups of small catchments 200 and 200 500 km2 though the averaged kge scores are slightly lower they still perform well the group of super large catchments 100 000 km2 only include limited number of catchments 22 most of them have 0 8 kge scores in the calibration period and 0 7 kge scores in the validation period generally though groups with moderate size 500 100 000 km2 exhibit slightly better simulation skills there is no apparent difference between different size categories indicating that catchment size has minor impact on hydrological simulations moreover this again confirms the hydrological applicability of satellite based and atmospheric reanalysis datasets in varied size of catchments with regard to the four hydrological models we find xaj gr4j hmets have their own strengths while hbv consistently perform the worst the simplest model gr4j with only four free parameters demonstrates its simulation superiority in around 43 6 of catchments followed by the xaj achieving highest kge scores in around 29 4 of catchments though the complicated hmets model with 21 free parameters only performs the best in approximately 21 1 of catchments it exhibits the most homogeneous simulation skills across different climate zones we further present the performance of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv and the determined best performing models in each climate zone fig s1 although the xaj gr4j and hmets have different structural complexity they yield similar performance in temperate cold and polar catchments during calibration and validation these results suggest that simple snow module e g cemaneige in xaj and gr4j and routing processes e g two routing processes in gr4j are usually sufficient to simulate streamflow conditions in catchments within temperate cold and polar climates however only the hmets model exhibits good performance in tropical catchments while the xaj gr4j and hbv exhibit poor skills fig s1 this is also explainable because the complicated structures in hmets with 10 parameter snow module and four routing processes can better adapt to various hydro meteorological characteristics of catchments and facilitate its wide applicability which is in line with recent findings from tarek et al 2020 in addition we also notice that all the models present relatively poor performance in arid catchments this deficient skill of simulating streamflow in arid catchments by conceptual models has been reported by previous studies mcmillan et al 2016 mathevet et al 2020 clark et al 2008 used the framework for understanding structural errors fuse to diagnose relationships between model structure and model performance they reported that dry catchments involve both saturated areas and infiltration excess runoff lumped models usually do not have module for considering infiltration excess runoff and the saturated area parameterizations are used to compensate for this weakness therefore it is important to choose appropriate model structures in dry catchments newman et al 2015 declared that aridity can be the dominant factor influencing model performance and lumped models typically achieve higher efficiency in wetter catchments overall this illustrates structural inadequacies of such hydrological models in the context of arid catchments besides the hydrological model structures it should be noted that several other factors e g initial conditions precipitation inputs model parameters also play important roles in shaping streamflow conditions newman et al 2017 mizukami et al 2019 for example hashemi et al 2000 reported that several model parameters e g the percolation rate had a strong influence on flood estimation newman et al 2021 found that both initial conditions and precipitation frequency distribution might cause large uncertainties in floods simulation this suggests that more attention should be paid to various components in the entire hydrological modelling chain from meteorological forcing to the objective functions and the target flow conditions e g high flow low flow moreover the reliability of the mswep v2 precipitation and era5 temperature to force four hydrological models are further evaluated by the timing and volumes of both wet and dry extremes compared to the average streamflow condition the skills of xaj gr4j hmets and hbv in capturing extreme events are less satisfactory generally these hydrological simulations can better characterize wet extremes than low flow events and better represent volumes than timing this is explainable because wet extremes are primarily driven by precipitation forcing which further confirms the reliability of mswep v2 while low flows are mainly related to model structures beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b therefore using these simulations to perform further exploration such as flood analysis is acceptable while directly using them to simulate dry extremes could produce some biases and should be carefully considered the dry conditions in these catchments could be dominated by complicated physical and geomorphological conditions such as groundwater modulation which can not be correctly represented by these conceptual hydrological models future studies can consider other distribution hydrological models physically based land surface models and even combining machine learning with the current simulated streamflow to obtain corrected low flow conditions which is beyond the objective of this study there are some limitations worth clearly communication in model calibration and validation the choice of a 20 year time period actually represents a tradeoff between avoiding the non stationarity in long term streamflow series caused by global climate and land use change and calibration requirements for robustness long term record length can better represent catchment conditions and improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation in addition longer time window of continuous records could filter out a vast of catchments weaken the robustness of this study to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of model performance we further examine the kge in different time periods and seasons despite inconsistent time period among different catchments due to record limitation fig 13 similar scores can be found between the former and latter decades and the best performing models determined by the overall performance hold the highest kge regardless of decades fig s2 with regard to model performance in warm may october in northern hemisphere and november april in southern hemisphere and cold seasons satisfactory scores hold in temperate and cold catchments without much seasonal variations however the good model performance during the warm season slightly fades during the cold season in tropical catchments and markedly weakens in arid and polar catchments fig s3 the inferior performance of arid and polar catchments in the cold season is possibly due to a model structural inadequacies in arid and non perennial catchments mathevet et al 2020 b the use of the kge objective function in model calibration emphasizes on large runoff while arid and polar catchments typically produce low flows and even cut off during the cold season further different season division yields similar results fig s4 though these hydrological models exhibit varying performance in different seasons the selected models always achieve the highest scores implying the rationality of the determined best performing models there are now several potential other precipitation datasets that could have been included in future comparison such as era5 reanalysis precipitation gpm precipitation etc however the target of this study is a first evaluation of the combined satellite based and atmospheric reanalysis datasets in quasi global hydrological application and the suitability of four conceptual hydrological models with varying hydrological processes and parameters finally the hourly temporal resolution provides the opportunity to investigate sub daily hydrological response future work can focus on evaluating the sub daily performance of hydrological simulation with satellite based and atmospheric reanalysis datasets 6 conclusions the main objective of this study is to assess the combination of mswep v2 and era5 temperature as potential reference datasets for hydrological simulation and the model capability with different structures and parameters at a global scale by performing a large scale hydrological modelling study based on four conceptual hydrological models over different climate zones the main conclusions are summarized as follows a the first assessment shows that the transformation of mswep v2 precipitation and era5 temperature into runoff is satisfactory at 10 596 catchments in both the daily mean and high flow conditions the combined blended and reanalysis datasets perform quite well while in low flow simulations there are some visible biases b the catchment size cannot impact the hydrological performance indicating the combination datasets are appropriate from small sized watersheds e g 200 km2 to large scale catchments e g 100 000 km2 given that the density of the gauging station network is sparse in some areas mswep v2 and era5 reanalysis has the potential serving as an alternative to gauge based precipitation and temperature especially for large scale studies c in terms of the four hydrological models the gr4j model is optimal in most amounts of catchments though its performance in some tropical and arid catchments is less promising the xaj model also achieves the best in many catchments slightly fewer than the gr4j but its modelling skills in tropical and arid regions are still less satisfactory for the hmets model though it exhibits the best performance in a fewer number of catchments than the xaj it has a wider suitability over different climate zones and can better simulate streamflow in the tropics than others by contrast the hbv model consistently performs the worst in most of catchments and in terms of different metrics and streamflow conditions this study verifies the superiority of satellite based and atmospheric datasets in global streamflow modelling meanwhile the results show that both the simple gr4j and complicated xaj and hmets hydrological models have their own merits nevertheless more cares should be taken when forcing conceptual hydrological models in the arid catchments and we highlight the need to select appropriate hydrological models according to climatic and geophysical conditions when performing streamflow simulations credit authorship contribution statement lei gu

aims mainly to understand the degradation of water quality and find solutions to improve the situation the impact of chantal s research goes far beyond the regional context however as she always endeavours to identify and highlight generic knowledge in every study even when it relies on data from one or a few local study sites when chantal started her career in the mid 1980s publishing in english in international journals was not an obvious choice for french researchers it is noteworthy that her first international article was published in french in the journal of hydrology before english became the dominant language of global scientific communication gascuel odoux and mérot 1986 chantal was one of the first researchers at sas to disseminate her research in english and we consider her responsible for the internationalization of the unit first as a researcher and then as unit director subsequently chantal and her colleagues increasingly published their research in international journals including the journal of hydrology the internationalization of her research also led her to participate in european research projects e g cost actions and to co author many articles with international teams mainly in european countries facing similar problems with diffuse agricultural pollution such as the united kingdom uk ireland and the netherlands her international research career is also marked by two scientific visits one to the french national research institute for sustainable development ird in dakar senegal 1991 1992 and the other to the university of british colombia vancouver canada 2006 2007 the ph d students that chantal supervises are certain to have the opportunity for a short term scientific visit to a foreign country to broaden their horizons chantal s career is also marked by her institutional involvement within the sas unit more broadly at inrae and in french research in general in 2000 she co founded the armorican centre for environment research caren with philippe davy cnrs to federate research teams from several institutes inrae cnrs university of rennes working on environmental sciences in rennes france caren became osur observatoire des sciences de l univers de rennes in 2010 under the leadership of gilles pinay cnrs and chantal served as its vice director she was also the director of the sas unit with nearly 100 people from 2004 to 2011 since 2016 chantal has also served part time as deputy scientific director for the environment at inrae where she actively investigates and promotes agroecology as a discipline that returns ecology to the centre of agricultural system design caquet et al 2020b gascuel odoux et al 2022 gascuel and magda 2015 this article reviews chantal s contributions to hydrology and related disciplines as we limit it to a review of her published articles we felt it was important to present chantal s institutional involvement in the introduction however this introduction like the review that follows is far from complete because she has made many diverse contributions we hope however that the present reflection on her career highlights its unique features fig 1 in this review article we divided chantal s scientific contributions into four main categories 1 influence of soil and subsoil properties on hydrological processes 2 water solute and particulate transfer at the catchment scale 3 design of integrated approaches to landscapes and territorial management 4 contributions to public policies and public debate 2 influence of soil and subsoil properties on hydrological processes since the 1980s chantal and colleagues particularly philippe mérot inrae have analysed and modelled runoff generation and groundwater dynamics along with colleagues from the sas unit she conducted research to identify the relevant scales of the spatial variability in infiltration runoff and the distribution of saturated areas since the pioneering studies of betson 1964 and dunne and black 1970 in the united states weyman 1970 1973 in the uk and cappus 1960 in france runoff generation in saturated areas was considered a key factor that controlled stream flow generation early interactions with keith beven univ of lancaster uk mike kirby univ of leeds uk and philippe davy cnrs france convinced chantal that shallow groundwater played a major role in the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of catchments consequently they decided in the mid 1990s to study and develop models of shallow groundwater dynamics 2 1 spatial variability in infiltration and runoff at the beginning of her career including her phd research 1981 1984 chantal investigated spatial variability in runoff and water infiltration at the field scale knowledge of the spatial variability in soil physical properties was required to address several agricultural issues such as wetland preservation in agricultural areas three main objectives governed her studies in this field i quantifying spatial variability ii analysing correlations between hydrological and soil factors and iii producing soil maps chantal and colleagues used geostatistics and isotopic tracer methods such as 18o to study water movement soil water content gascuel odoux and mérot 1986 soil properties gascuel odoux 1987 gascuel odoux and merot 1991 and the rainfall rate merot et al 1989 starting from in situ measurements and sampling both methods improved mapping of water movement and soil characteristics gascuel odoux and boivin 1994 gascuel odoux et al 1991 chantal has promoted the use of geostatistics to define appropriate strategies for soil sampling and the spatial resolution of in situ measurements chantal and colleagues also conducted early research on the ability of a helicopter borne c band scatterometer radar to map the extent of saturated areas brun et al 1990 in particular they demonstrated benefits of using ers 1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter to map these extents merot et al 1994 these studies paved the way for using remote sensing to map saturated areas and to limit parameter ranges of uncertainty in hydrological models such as topmodel franks et al 1998 with a fine knowledge of soil properties chantal and colleagues have used several approaches to study runoff generation in rural contexts from in situ measurement of overland flow in an agricultural field they identified local microtopography soil crusting and the spatial distribution of soil patches with high hydraulic conductivity as the main factors that control runoff gascuel odoux et al 1996 from experiments and computer modelling they showed that flow path connectivity at the square meter scale depends on the ratio of the mean slope to random roughness which controls transfers within the soil surface and may change significantly over time during a storm event darboux et al 2002 while runoff may be triggered on the upper part of hillslopes sheet flow is low and the runoff coefficient decreases as the slope length increases infiltration and soil deposition are particularly active in concave parts of hillslopes regardless of the characteristics of storm events and are enhanced by hedgerow networks merot et al 1999 this result contradicts the intuitive model of downstream amplification of runoff through aggregation in the drainage area it also supports the assumption of a threshold of spatial scale at which to define the head of channel networks at least in temperate regions such as brittany after this major observation chantal and colleagues worked to improve maps of surface flow connectivity using digital elevation models dems by representing the influence of hedgerows and field networks on the drainage area aurousseau et al 2009 gascuel odoux et al 2011 tortrat et al 2003 2 2 riparian wetland mapping because riparian wetlands in agricultural landscapes strongly influence hydrology water quality and biodiversity their degradation in intensive agricultural landscapes is of great concern to address the need for reliable wetland mapping chantal and colleagues developed a hydrological typology of wetlands durand et al 2000 mérot et al 2006 first potential wetlands are defined by soil properties and topographic data that can be derived from available databases and dems second existing wetlands are mapped from in situ observation of soil water content and wetland vegetation third effective wetlands are defined for a variety of ecosystem services related to hydrology water quality and biodiversity mapping these three types of wetlands requires different levels of investigation effort this study was the basis for the inventory of valley bottom wetland maps currently used in brittany gascuel et al 2009 and for the peew potential existing and effective wetlands method which provides a framework for organizing knowledge about wetland management mérot et al 2006 2 3 characterization and modelling of shallow groundwater since the 1990s chantal and colleagues have assessed the ability of hydrological models to predict spatial variability in groundwater levels in catchments attracted by topmodel s ability to capture with elegant simplicity the dynamics and dominant controls of shallow groundwater hydrology in a semi distributed form beven et al 2020 they considered this model as a reference this led chantal to collaborate with keith beven to conduct one of the first studies of the influence of temporal and spatial resolutions on model parameterization and simulations bruneau et al 1995 specifically she worked to determine the appropriate modelling approach for predicting dynamics of the water table and stream runoff simultaneously in catchments dominated by saturated subsurface flow gascuel odoux et al 2010b martin 2003 martin et al 2006 molenat 1999 molenat et al 2005 chantal has always been convinced that the spatial distribution of shallow groundwater must be predicted well to simulate matter fluxes and travel times in catchments section 2 furthermore she showed that groundwater is the main component of stream flow during both base flow conditions and storm events gascuel odoux et al 1999 molénat et al 1999 her research has made good use of the number and quality of water table records in the catchments of the agrhys observatory agro hydro systems gascuel odoux et al 2018 high frequency records 1 h from wells on transects extending down hillslopes provided the data necessary to analyse the ability to simulate spatio temporal dynamics of shallow groundwater in this regard topmodel s assumptions appear to work well for simulating stream flow and the water table in valley bottoms but less well for simulating midslope and upslope areas relaxing two of topmodel s assumptions steady state spatial subsurface flux and topographic assumptions significantly improve water table simulations for these two areas molenat et al 2005 the question is then how much the representation of geometry e g depth thickness of the soil and subsoil as well as the hydraulic properties of groundwater systems can be simplified while still achieving acceptable simulations of the water table transit time and solute fluxes spatial simulations of the water table were less sensitive to the geometry of the subsoil than to the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity martin et al 2006 consequently chantal analysed the relevance of considering homogeneous hydraulic geometry i e soil and subsoil thickness and depth and properties e g hydraulic conductivity drainable porosity using the hillvi model weiler and mcdonnell 2004 she demonstrated that considering lateral variations in hydraulic properties along the hillslope improves the spatial prediction of water tables only slightly gascuel odoux et al 2010b she concluded that i there is some incommensurability in comparing point observations to grid averaged predictions and ii improving spatial simulations of water table requires fitting local transmissivity to local water table observations which would require acquiring these observations 3 water solute and particulate transfer at the catchment scale since the early 1990s chantal s research has focussed mainly on water solute and particulate transfer in agricultural catchments she has considered the understanding of processes that underlie these transfers as a key scientific challenge to preserve and or restore water quality in the face of high agricultural pressures and climate change in the context of the severe nitrate contamination of water that western france was experiencing chantal advanced knowledge of the nitrogen n cycle and nitrate transfer at the catchment scale however as water quality should be evaluated as a whole she collaborated with other colleagues especially gérard gruau cnrs france catherine grimaldi inrae france and aline dia cnrs france to extended the study of matter transfer to carbon c p and suspended sediments they soon perceived the need for long term and spatially distributed hydrological and concentration time series associated with the observation of agricultural practices to this end she actively contributed to the development of the agrhys research observatory in brittany fig 2 fovet et al 2018b this long term observatory has focused since 1992 on headwater catchments kervidy naizin 5 km2 and kerbernez 1 2 km2 and characterized by hard rock aquifers an oceanic climate and dominance of agricultural land uses devoted to animal farming the agrhys observatory is dedicated to the investigation of the biogeochemical response times of catchments to variations in climate and agriculture with a focus on the following elements water nitrogen carbon and phosphorus chantal has co supervised 11 phd thesis that have analyzed agrhys observational data from gascuel odoux et al 2018 to promote the observatory develop scientific collaborations and investigate scientific questions over a wider range of hydroclimatic conditions chantal has worked to integrate the observatory into a national ozcar gaillardet et al 2018 and a european network elter through collaborations her research has also benefited from observations from research catchments outside of france e g ireland norway extrapolation of results acquired in headwater catchments associated with the needs and requests of local and national water managers have led her and colleagues to extend the study of transfers to mesoscale catchments and national scales to this end chantal has also used operational water information and monitoring databases 3 1 groundwater nitrate transfer from estimation of travel time to connectivity analysis chantal and colleagues have addressed groundwater nitrate transfer in agricultural catchments for the past 30 years it is useful to recall the scientific context in the 1990s when she began this research most studies focussed mainly on storm events to understand the main hydrological and biogeochemical processes that control dynamics of solute concentrations and fluxes in stream water in addition solute transfer times in headwater catchments with shallow groundwater were assumed to be short due to the shallow groundwater and short travel distances along hillslopes from the soil to a stream in this context chantal and philippe davy explored two topics i estimating travel times in shallow groundwater systems and ii exploring relationships between the dynamics of shallow groundwater and stream nitrate concentration at seasonal and annual scales the objective of this research was to better understand and predict long term dynamics of stream nitrate concentrations and fluxes section 3 how long does it take a solute to travel from the soil to a stream this question was initially motivated by water management concerns in a context of high nitrate contamination of streams and rivers several research teams and especially chantal s were challenged by water management agencies and public authorities to estimate how much time it would take stream water quality to recover after implementing good agricultural practices subsequently chantal and colleagues used a variety of approaches to quantify groundwater travel time spectral analysis of long time series of in stream solute concentrations led to the conclusion that mean travel time in the kervidy naizin catchment brittany exceeded 1 3 years molénat et al 1999 computer simulations performed later with distributed physical based groundwater models predicted that travel times varied greatly across catchments taking up to 3 years in the kervidy naizin catchment molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 and 14 years in the kerbernez catchments brittany martin et al 2006 further research by chantal and colleagues confirmed the magnitude of previously estimated mean transit times while emphasizing their high uncertainties they did this by i using spectral analysis of stream solute concentration time series and gaseous tracers cfcs and sf6 in collaboration with luc aquilina univ of rennes 1 to calibrate a groundwater model molénat et al 2013 and ii applying a conceptual compartment based model calibrated with long time series of solute concentration fovet et al 2015 the results of these studies were in line with those of other studies of catchment transit times e g kirchner et al 2000 mcguire et al 2002 stewart and fahey 2010 chantal has also extensively studied the influence of groundwater dynamics on stream nitrate concentrations she began from observations that stream water concentrations varied not only in the short term due to storm events but in the long term at seasonal and annual scales understanding low frequency variations requires understanding nitrate groundwater transfer and interactions between groundwater and surface water one main advance of chantal and colleagues was to develop a conceptual model based on the connectivity of hydrological compartments in a catchment to explain seasonal dynamics molenat et al 2008 stream nitrate concentration in most agricultural catchments with shallow groundwater was shown to follow an annual cycle with the highest concentrations in winter and the lowest in summer aubert et al 2013b martin et al 2004 molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 meanwhile a steady state spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in groundwater with a decreasing pattern from upslope to downslope was revealed as a common characteristic of the two catchments in the agrhys observatory martin et al 2004 molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 high nitrate concentrations in upslope areas behave as an infinite pool at the multi annual scale ruiz et al 2002 chantal and colleagues showed that riparian zones where the water table rises to the soil surface are hot spots of denitrification that result in nitrate concentrations near zero section 3 with these elements the concept of connectivity assumes that stream nitrate concentration depends on the connection of hydrological compartments i e high nitrate groundwater upslope a nitrate free riparian zone and low nitrate deep groundwater with the connection and disconnection of these compartments controlled by temporal dynamics of the groundwater level along the hillslope ocampo et al 2006a b in the susannah brook catchment australia and wriedt and rode 2006 in the lowland schaugraben catchment germany also demonstrated the ability of hydrological connectivity to explain variations in stream nitrate concentration the connectivity assumption has also been confirmed since then by the study and modelling of long term 10 years stream nitrate concentration aubert et al 2013a strohmenger et al 2021 the connectivity concept has also helped guide the design of conceptual compartment based models to explore the response of stream water quality to climatic and anthropogenic forcing section 2 3 3 2 influence of riparian wetland dynamics on sediment and phosphorus transfer unlike nitrate suspended sediments and p forms are transferred mainly via surface and shallow subsurface flowpaths lefrançois et al 2007 vongvixay et al 2010 consequently they are transferred mainly during short storm events which implies specifically monitoring and analysing them during these events chantal and colleagues particularly catherine grimaldi analysed the shape and direction of concentration discharge hysteresis loops to differentiate events with a proximal source in or near the stream clockwise hysteresis from those with a more distal source along the hillslope anticlockwise hysteresis in a grassland catchment in which cattle had access to the stream lefrançois et al 2007 showed that suspended sediments originated mainly from the stream channel and banks either by hydraulic erosion or cattle trampling the high seasonal availability of suspended sediments during the grazing season lefrançois et al 2007 and the sharp decrease in suspended sediment fluxes after construction of watering troughs vongvixay et al 2018 confirmed the crucial role of bank degradation by cattle in the suspended sediment dynamics of this catchment in contrast an arable catchment with supposedly higher potential for hillslope erosion but the presence of woody vegetation or grass buffer strips along the stream had one fifth the suspended sediment fluxes vongvixay et al 2018 in this catchment stream protection limited the delivery of eroded soil from arable fields during most but not the largest storm events chantal and colleagues research on suspended sediment paved the way for research on particle associated contaminants specifically forms of p results for the kervidy naizin catchment showed however that a large percentage of p 13 48 of annual load is transferred in dissolved forms minaudo et al 2017 and that storm dynamics of dissolved p are not synchronous with those of particulate p dupas et al 2015b dupas et al 2015b concluded that particulate and dissolved p forms have different spatial origins in the landscape and are transferred by different mechanisms particulate p originates from resuspension of streambed sediments bank erosion and occasionally from erosion on hillslopes in contrast dissolved p originates from riparian soils when fluctuations in the shallow groundwater level connect them to the stream monitoring p concentration in the soil water of the riparian zone revealed that alternating dry and wet phases in these zones fosters p solubilisation dupas et al 2015c it is therefore essential not to rely only on riparian buffers to limit p transfer to streams as the p that they retain may be remobilized management efforts should therefore limit erosion at its original source place buffer features e g grass strips hedgerows upslope of riparian wetlands and extract p from these hydrologically connected zones dupas et al 2017 3 3 development of an integrated conceptual model of solute and particulate transfer in headwater catchments in the 2010s chantal and colleagues have developed conceptual models of solute and particulate transfer in agricultural headwater catchments that went beyond earlier disjointed work on nitrate and phosphorus exports gascuel odoux et al 2018 the work relied strongly on long term and high frequency monitoring of the concentrations of multiple constituents in the kervidy naizin catchment i e daily since 2000 and for several parameters sub hourly since 2011 fovet et al 2018b water quality monitoring at the outlet of the 5 km2 catchment is supplemented with measurements in several other environmental compartments such as the soil groundwater and atmosphere to interpret these data chantal and colleagues conceptualized a catchment as a set of compartments each with static chemical signatures aubert et al 2013b concentration dynamics at the outlet are then conceptualized as a mixing of compartment contributions fig 3 to add complexity one can also consider dynamic chemical signatures when biogeochemical reactions or agricultural management modifies concentrations aubert et al 2013a chantal and colleagues have applied this representation of a catchment to develop perceptual models formal end member mixing analyses durand and juan torres 1996 and flexible mixing reservoir models fovet et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2014 strohmenger et al 2021 in addition to dividing a catchment into compartments chantal and colleagues also divided time into characteristic time scales long term multi annual seasonal intra annual and storm events e g strohmenger et al 2020 while environmental studies often aggregate data at different time scales she has specifically focussed on interactions between time scales for example aubert et al 2013b showed that seasonal cycles of nitrate chloride sulphate dissolved organic c doc and dissolved inorganic c depended on each year s mean weather conditions hot cold vs dry wet martin et al 2004 showed that seasonal nitrate cycles can even reverse i e winter maxima become summer maxima due to a catchment s recovery from high n inputs another example of interaction between time scales is the analysis and interpretation of how storm event dynamics vary among seasons aubert et al 2013c used latent dirichlet allocation models and showed that storm dynamics of four solutes i e nitrate chloride doc and sulphate depend on antecedent hydrological conditions dupas et al 2015d used dynamic time warping techniques and showed that p transfer dynamics during spring storms differ from those during autumn and winter storms highlighting the risk of incidental p losses after spreading animal waste in spring more recently fovet et al 2018a showed that storm event dynamics of nitrate and doc during autumn rewetting of the catchment differ from those during the rest of the year they attributed this difference to contributions of riparian wetlands in autumn along with these methods chantal and colleagues also used frequency analysis which showed that the fractal scaling of water quality observed in forested catchments can also be observed in intensive agricultural catchments aubert et al 2014 in addition to studying individual chemical elements in a disjointed manner chantal played a pioneering role in developing joint conceptual models cnp cycles and their interactions in agricultural landscapes this evolution from a focus on nitrate section 2 2 to coupled cnp cycles accompanied a change in water managers concerns from drinking water production often with nitrate standard not being met to reaching a good ecological status of surface water in contexts with a high risk of eutrophication le moal et al 2019 joint understanding of cnp cycles and transfer is crucial to understand how the concentration of each element is controlled by that of the others and how their relative concentrations influence aquatic ecosystems this work is also motivated by the necessity to identify potential risks of pollution swapping when dealing with one element without considering the others strohmenger et al 2020 showed that dynamics of nitrate and doc concentrations are opposite at annual seasonal and storm event scales while p dynamics are independent of those of the other two the ratios of pairs of elements may vary more when dynamics of the elements are asynchronous or out of phase and vary less when their dynamics are in phase guillemot et al 2021 confirmed these results using data from 180 headwater catchments in brittany and found that the temporal opposition between nitrate and doc and the independence of p is also spatially valid across brittany minaudo et al 2019 also found temporal opposition between nitrate and forms of p at the seasonal and storm event scales and attributed it to different dominant sources for both nutrients diffuse sources for n and a combination of diffuse and point sources for p 3 4 retrospective and prospective analysis of the influence of climate on water quality the influence of climate change on surface water quality in agricultural catchments greatly concerns the scientific community and water managers analysis of 16 years of meteorological data from the kervidy naizin catchment revealed an increase in temperature but no overall trend in annual discharge although winters tended to become wetter and summers tended to become drier strohmenger et al 2020 these observations of recent trends are consistent with predictions of climate models for the region although the predicted trend in annual rainfall is uncertain merot et al 2014 predicting responses of hydrological systems to these changes is challenging due to the complexity of the processes involved the many feedback loops that exist and potential interactions with changes in land management blöschl et al 2019 chantal s contributions to understanding the influence of climate variability on water quality have relied mainly on retrospective analysis of long term monitoring data dupas et al 2018 gascuel odoux et al 2010a mellander et al 2018 strohmenger et al 2020 disentangling the influence of climate from that of changes in land management is especially challenging especially for regions whose agriculture has changed greatly the past several decades dupas et al 2016 strohmenger et al 2020 using public water quality data from brittany gascuel et al 2010a and dupas et al 2018 highlighted the existence of mesoscale 2 6 year variations in discharge that drive synchronous variations in nitrate concentrations and fluxes fig 4 here discharge is taken as an integrative indicator of several climatic variables rainfall and evapotranspiration itself influenced by temperature these mesoscale variations may mask improvements in land management in certain years or exaggerate these improvements in other years thus water quality must be observed for more than 5 10 years to reliably assess effects of improved land management on water quality trends in addition to analysing public data monitoring research catchments provides both more variables and a higher temporal resolution using high frequency nitrate and p concentration data from france ireland and norway mellander et al 2018 hypothezised a connection between the north atlantic oscillation nao index and nutrient concentrations the index s influence positive or negative varied among catchments and often differed between nitrate and p because these data were available only during an upward trend in the nao index 2010 2016 future analysis should cover several cycles of the index piazza et al 2018 observed similar connections between inter annual variations in anion concentrations and the el niño southern oscillation enso index in nested catchments of the subtropical zone in contrast the data analysis of strohmenger et al 2020 considered several hydroclimatic variables instead of a single integrated variable such as discharge or the nao or enso index their results highlighted the joint influence of changes in climate and land management on long term trends in nitrate decreasing p decreasing and doc increasing they also highlighted effects of extreme climatic conditions whose frequency is predicted to increase such as flushing episodes with high doc concentration after a long summer drought or a disproportionate influence of large storm events on p transfer finally chantal also participated in prospective studies that used the integrated agro hydrological model tnt2 salmon monviola et al 2013 section 3 1 salmon monviola et al 2013 simulated the influence of temperature rainfall and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on water and n cycles in the kervidy naizin catchment and highlighted the importance of understanding how the functioning of riparian wetlands would respond to climate change overall the synergetic effect of increasing temperature decreasing rainfall and increasing carbon dioxide concentration is predicted to decrease n loads in the catchment s stream but uncertainties remain about how farming practices will respond to climate change and other incentives and then interact with the direct effects of climate change to influence water and n cycles 4 integrating hydrology into the design of integrated approaches to landscapes and territorial management several projects that chantal has conducted investigate how understanding hydrological processes can contribute to environmental management in agricultural areas in the late 1990 s many studies reported degradation of water resources and her research aimed to assess impacts of agriculture on water quality later her research moved from impact assessments toward the design of sustainable rural landscapes in a context in which the global environmental situation had become alarming caquet et al 2020a indeed the need to act became urgent ipbes 2019 ipcc 2014 and challenged the scientific community to provide evidence based contributions to sustainable societal development in a changing environment montanari et al 2013 in this context a territory as a geographic area and its relevant physical and societal dimensions is relevant for considering interactions among different agricultural systems cultivated and uncultivated areas and agricultural and non agricultural stakeholders gascuel and magda 2015 peyraud et al 2015 this section illustrates chantal s contributions to the management of agricultural areas from assessing impacts on water bodies to designing landscapes 4 1 integrating hydrology with other disciplines some researchers see hydrology as a single holistic discipline while others see it as a group of distinct sub disciplines baveye 2011 in recent years hydrology has evolved towards more interdisciplinary perspectives mccurley and jawitz 2017 to address complex scientific questions such as those raised by critical zone science brantley et al 2017 gaillardet et al 2018 and current challenges such as the water energy food nexus montanari et al 2015 wagener et al 2010 through collaborations chantal has contributed actively to developing broad understanding of hydrological processes the research conducted within these collaborations has related agricultural practices to water quality at catchment outlets and highlighted the need to combine thorough understanding of catchment hydrology with that of agricultural systems for example she worked with a local chamber of agriculture to assess based on field experiments effects of maize cropping techniques e g a mixed weeding strategy no tillage on herbicide transfer by surface runoff results showed that compared to conventional chemical weeding a mixed weeding strategy reduced herbicide concentrations by ca 75 and fluxes by up to 90 they also observed that no tillage increased soil infiltrability by a factor of 5 10 which greatly reduced surface runoff and herbicide transfer by up to 90 compared to those of conventional tillage heddadj and gascuel 2001 to explore agricultural practices to reduce n transfer to streams chantal helped patrick durand inrae and other colleagues develop integrated agro hydrological models moreau et al 2012 whereas field experiments are complex and costly particularly at the landscape level integrated modelling can predict whether changes in agricultural practices are likely to reach a targeted reduction in nitrate concentrations in groundwater or streams they used the spatially distributed agro hydrological model tnt2 beaujouan et al 2001 which couples a crop model brisson et al 1998 with a hydrological model based on topmodel beven 1997 to predict the ability of introducing cover crops i e fast growing crops that are grown between successive main crops to reduce n losses at the catchment scale durand et al 2015 agro hydrological models especially spatially distributed models generate a large amount of spatio temporal data of various formats and semantics due to technological barriers that prevent efficient data processing only daily flux and concentrations at the catchment outlet are usually analysed even though higher temporal or spatial resolutions may be simulated thus tools are needed to store display and analyse this spatio temporal information and turn it into useful knowledge that helps understand agro environmental systems and adaptations to meet environmental targets to address this issue chantal worked with computer scientists in particular marie odile cordier inria france to investigate the use of innovative machine learning techniques with data simulated by such models and extract knowledge about complex rural landscapes symbolic learning techniques helped them identify spatial patterns of herbicide sinks or sources and factors that explained herbicide transfer along the river network trépos et al 2012 2013 chantal and colleagues also developed a data warehouse to analyse output of the process based model using online analytical processing bouadi et al 2017 using this approach enabled quantifying impacts of agricultural practices on n emissions at multiple spatio temporal scales by providing relevant ways to identify and analyse where and why n pollution occurs in a catchment 4 2 integrated catchment modelling chantal has co led several projects to develop integrated models designed to support the management of rural areas using these models has facilitated dialogue among local stakeholders around land management scenarios for example by exploring ex ante simulations of impacts of changes in agricultural practices on water quality gascuel and magda 2015 one main innovation of chantal and colleagues has been to consider both farming and biophysical systems and their interactions in their modelling approaches to encompass the entire causal chain from farming activities to water pollution and to find ways to adapt farming systems to environmental objectives with computer scientist frederic garcia inrae chantal led a study of interactions between farmers technical decisions and biophysical systems in the development of the decision oriented sacadeau model gascuel odoux et al 2009 salmon monviola et al 2011 by predicting sources of water pollution by maize herbicides sacadeau aims to help decision makers decrease water pollution at the catchment level sacadeau combines a farmer decision submodel based on technical and environmental conditions developed with agricultural experts a temperature based crop phenology submodel and a submodel of water and chemical transfer within agricultural catchments in the transfer submodel chantal developed an innovative approach to modelling surface drainage networks that determines surface water connectivity by considering the topography between and within farm fields hedgerows roads and ditches aurousseau et al 2009 gascuel odoux et al 2011 this landscape drainage network considers both farming systems and landscape features unlike a traditional drainage network extracted from dem data alone the spatial representation based on this landscape drainage network has been useful for assessing effects of land use agricultural practices and the landscape on herbicide contamination of stream water many biophysical models such as swat arnold et al 1998 shetran birkinshaw and ewen 2000 tnt2 beaujouan et al 2001 2002 and dnmt liu et al 2005 operate at the catchment scale and simulate effects of agricultural practices on n transfer and transformation however they do not represent consistent farming systems because they do not explicitly represent farmer decisions this is particularly critical for mixed farming systems in which processes such as fodder production and manure spreading of cropping and livestock systems are closely related in other words when a model simulates large changes in the cropping system there is no guarantee that it will simulate production of enough forage for animals or that the amount of manure applied in the model will equal the amount of manure produced durand et al 2015 to address this gap and assess effects of different dairy farming systems on catchment n dynamics patrick durand chantal and colleagues developed the casimod n model fig 5 which couples a farmer decision model with the tnt2 model moreau et al 2013 casimod n simulates farming systems explicitly through production strategies and farmer decisions and translates these decisions into management practices representing these strategies when simulating management practices ensures that i simulated fodder production matches livestock feed requirements ii livestock feeding and manure management strategies are consistent with each other and iii specific farm constraints e g distances between fields are met applying casimod n to the yar catchment brittany in a project co led by chantal and laurent ruiz inrae demonstrated that such models can be powerful and relevant tools to redesign farming systems durand et al 2015 gascuel et al 2015 moreau et al 2013 here she made a decisive contribution by building a multidisciplinary research group 4 3 integrating hydrological sciences with non academic stakeholders the international research agenda of the 2000s and 2010s as described in the prediction in ungauged basins hrachowitz et al 2013 and panta rhei montanari et al 2013 initiatives challenged the scientific community to make progress in transferring knowledge about well known research sites to poorly gauged monitored or documented catchments for which societal issues are strong in accordance with this agenda chantal co led several projects to conceptualize farming systems in catchments affected by water pollution in these projects scenarios of agricultural practices at farming system and catchment scales were co built with local non academic stakeholders from the agricultural and or water management sector this co building allows future scenarios to be explored while the integrated models described previously section 3 2 can predict impacts of these scenarios on water resources to develop the decision oriented sacadeau model gascuel et al 2009 salmon monviola et al 2011 the farmer decision submodel that represents farmers constraints and strategies was built first in collaboration with advisers from the brittany chamber of agriculture their expertise enabled definition of decision rules for crop sowing and weeding strategies and their distribution among fields then different symbolic learning techniques were applied to model predictions to identify situations that would decrease water pollution by herbicides and make sense for stakeholders trépos et al 2012 in the acassya project researchers worked with local stakeholders to reconcile agriculture especially dairy farming with coastal activities in areas affected by coastal eutrophication gascuel et al 2015 thus researchers farmers local authorities and environmental managers co built knowledge about current and future dairy farming systems to design new systems compatible with the vulnerability of downstream ecosystems the project combined virtual experiments conducted with the casimod n model moreau et al 2013 with field experiments on pilot farms results showed that co building knowledge required on going dialogue reflexivity and long term involvement by researchers levain et al 2015 using integrated models that couple farmer decision crop and hydrological models enabled stakeholders to discuss and adopt scenarios durand et al 2015 gascuel et al 2015 moreau et al 2013 4 4 making scientific knowledge accessible and relevant for water and environmental managers chantal has promoted the development of methods to improve water management that are scientifically sound and operational for example considerable effort was made to transfer knowledge about critical source areas of pollutants into a decision support tool called territ eau gascuel odoux et al 2011 gascuel et al 2009 territ eau helps stakeholders define action plans that include changes in agricultural practices and systems as well as restoration and preservation of semi natural areas in rural landscapes at the end of the 1990s as agriculture continued to intensify and landscape features such as the functional role of landscape features as potential buffer for diffuse pollution dorioz et al 2010 gascuel odoux et al 2011 gascuel et al 2008 chantal helped identify landscape features that can serve as a buffer of diffuse n and p pollution she helped develop pioneer approaches for predicting and mapping these landscape features and assessing their effectiveness as buffers section 1 2 for example modifying the topographic index by considering downslope topography enabled prediction of wetland extents in hydrosystems controlled by subsurface groundwater gascuel et al 1998 later mérot et al 2006 used this modified index to develop the peew method for wetland management that decision makers and local managers can apply directly 5 contributing to public policies and public debate chantal has also contributed to non academic publications that involved hydrology and that were intended to guide public policy makers and local water managers as well as contribute to public debate they are examples of how hydrological research can help address human induced societal issues montanari et al 2015 wagener et al 2010 5 1 contributions to joint scientific assessments in france ministries can request joint scientific assessments on any subject which summarize validated scientific knowledge in response to a complex question related to a strong and urgent societal issue in them a group of experts analyses the international scientific literature to inform public debate about the given question chantal contributed to the joint scientific assessment pesticides agriculture and the environment reducing the use of pesticides and limiting their environmental impact aubertot et al 2007 which updated knowledge about and data on agricultural use of pesticides their contamination of environmental compartments and impacts on non target organisms and ecosystems chantal specifically contributed to the chapters related to hydrological transfers i e buffer zones transfer indices and models examining pesticide drift in the environment and discussing crop management strategies and spatial configurations to reduce it chantal co led another joint scientific assessment entitled causes mechanisms consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena le moal et al 2019 pinay et al 2018 that highlights the general increase in n and p fluxes to oceans and agriculture s increased contribution to them during the 20th century to predict eutrophication risk nutrient transfer and transformation processes need to be considered along with climatic variability and ecological vulnerability of downstream ecosystems control strategies can occasionally use engineered nutrient removal techniques but will first require source reduction 5 2 tools and expertise for public water policies chantal led several national studies to help the french national office for water and aquatic environments onema from 2006 to 2016 now merged with other agencies into the national office for biodiversity report to the european commission regarding french objectives of the water framework directive these studies harmonized methods for estimating n and p emissions to all french rivers the methods are based on the nutting model nutrient transfer modelling which uses a statistical approach to estimate nutrient loads from multiple variables including n and p surpluses and catchment characteristics dupas et al 2013 compared national and regional calibrations of the nutting n model in two regions of france regional models generally showed better fit but larger uncertainty in parameter estimates when the calibration data did not include enough catchments or variability in land and river characteristics dupas et al 2015a estimated that 53 of the soil n surplus and 95 of the p surplus is retained and that this apparent retention is driven by annual runoff and hydrological connectivity respectively 5 3 contributions to scientific resource centres chantal took an active role in creating a resource centre with the national office for water and aquatic environments for drinking water protection to help local authorities design more ambitious and effective action plans for managing water resources menard et al 2014 this resource centre aims to facilitate coordination among stakeholders and to disseminate documents and methods it provides case studies in which i outputs from biophysical models are presented to stakeholders as in dupas et al 2015a and ii local experts identified the critical role of crop rotations especially the periods between main crops via participatory modelling another resource centre called creseb resource and expertise centre for water in brittany was created in 2011 to transfer up to date scientific knowledge to local and regional water managers chantal was president of its scientific and technical board for four years during this period she promoted the topics of hydromorphology diffuse agricultural pollutants floods and support for transitions in territorial projects 6 conclusion as a researcher team leader unit director and deputy scientific director of a national research institute chantal gascuel odoux has successfully led several careers at once we have traced and summarized chantal s vision objectives and achievements over the past 40 years essentially limiting the article to the field of water sciences in relation to the scope of the journal of hydrology nevertheless chantal s interdisciplinary approach also led her to conduct important research in soil science and agronomy furthermore she has conducted her research along with collective institutional responsibilities at the national level in doing so chantal has gained national and international recognition within the hydrology community her contribution to agricultural research and development in france was recognized in 2014 when she was awarded the rank of knight of the legion of honour the highest french order of merit we also want to emphasise chantal s human qualities guided by a strong sense of collective work and driven by a clear idea of what science and public research in particular must provide to society chantal has always been attentive and benevolent towards her mentees and all of the colleagues students technicians engineers and researchers with and for whom she has worked chantal has helped define the directions of future research in landscape agroecology necessary to design sustainable agricultural systems she has paved the way for young researchers to conduct high quality research that meets societal needs the relative effects of human activities and the climate on cnp cycles and the eutrophying impacts of major contaminants on aquatic ecology are among the research fields that chantal has opened up and that we will be exploring in the years and decades to come 7

2472,here we highlight the career contributions of chantal gascuel odoux in hydrology soil science and agronomy these contributions are divided into four main categories i influence of soil and subsoil properties on hydrological processes ii water solute and particulate transfer at the catchment scale iii design of integrated approaches to landscapes and territorial management iv contributions to public policies and public debates we conclude by emphasising chantal s human qualities which we particularly appreciate as former mentees keywords chantal gascuel odoux catchment groundwater water quality climate agriculture modelling data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a hydrologist at the french agricultural research institute inrae 2 2 before 2020 inrae the national research institute for agricultural food and the environment was inra the national institute of agricultural research chantal gascuel odoux has always conducted research with an interdisciplinary dimension embedded in environmental sciences in her research hydrology intersects most often with soil science and agronomy the disciplines of her closest colleagues at her research unit sas soil agro and hydrosystems spatialization however her collaborations and interdisciplinary research span a much broader range of disciplines and expertise such as social sciences aquatic ecology and computer science this vast range of collaborations reflects chantal s curiosity and embodies her conviction that collaboration is key to research above all she considers that interdisciplinary research is crucial to address societal challenges related to agriculture food and the environment understanding chantal s contributions to scientific knowledge of and societal debates around agriculture and the environment requires understanding the societal context of brittany in western france where she has spent most of her career beginning in the 1960s brittany experienced rapid development of intensive agriculture particularly confined animal production because of its temperate oceanic climate and shallow soils and aquifers water pollution by nitrate phosphorus p and pesticides soon surged aubertot et al 2007 gascuel et al 2015 today brittany is a region of europe emblematic for its high nutrient loads and subsequent eutrophication problems in both tourist oriented coastal bays and reservoirs used for drinking water le moal et al 2019 in this context understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the brittany region aims mainly to understand the degradation of water quality and find solutions to improve the situation the impact of chantal s research goes far beyond the regional context however as she always endeavours to identify and highlight generic knowledge in every study even when it relies on data from one or a few local study sites when chantal started her career in the mid 1980s publishing in english in international journals was not an obvious choice for french researchers it is noteworthy that her first international article was published in french in the journal of hydrology before english became the dominant language of global scientific communication gascuel odoux and mérot 1986 chantal was one of the first researchers at sas to disseminate her research in english and we consider her responsible for the internationalization of the unit first as a researcher and then as unit director subsequently chantal and her colleagues increasingly published their research in international journals including the journal of hydrology the internationalization of her research also led her to participate in european research projects e g cost actions and to co author many articles with international teams mainly in european countries facing similar problems with diffuse agricultural pollution such as the united kingdom uk ireland and the netherlands her international research career is also marked by two scientific visits one to the french national research institute for sustainable development ird in dakar senegal 1991 1992 and the other to the university of british colombia vancouver canada 2006 2007 the ph d students that chantal supervises are certain to have the opportunity for a short term scientific visit to a foreign country to broaden their horizons chantal s career is also marked by her institutional involvement within the sas unit more broadly at inrae and in french research in general in 2000 she co founded the armorican centre for environment research caren with philippe davy cnrs to federate research teams from several institutes inrae cnrs university of rennes working on environmental sciences in rennes france caren became osur observatoire des sciences de l univers de rennes in 2010 under the leadership of gilles pinay cnrs and chantal served as its vice director she was also the director of the sas unit with nearly 100 people from 2004 to 2011 since 2016 chantal has also served part time as deputy scientific director for the environment at inrae where she actively investigates and promotes agroecology as a discipline that returns ecology to the centre of agricultural system design caquet et al 2020b gascuel odoux et al 2022 gascuel and magda 2015 this article reviews chantal s contributions to hydrology and related disciplines as we limit it to a review of her published articles we felt it was important to present chantal s institutional involvement in the introduction however this introduction like the review that follows is far from complete because she has made many diverse contributions we hope however that the present reflection on her career highlights its unique features fig 1 in this review article we divided chantal s scientific contributions into four main categories 1 influence of soil and subsoil properties on hydrological processes 2 water solute and particulate transfer at the catchment scale 3 design of integrated approaches to landscapes and territorial management 4 contributions to public policies and public debate 2 influence of soil and subsoil properties on hydrological processes since the 1980s chantal and colleagues particularly philippe mérot inrae have analysed and modelled runoff generation and groundwater dynamics along with colleagues from the sas unit she conducted research to identify the relevant scales of the spatial variability in infiltration runoff and the distribution of saturated areas since the pioneering studies of betson 1964 and dunne and black 1970 in the united states weyman 1970 1973 in the uk and cappus 1960 in france runoff generation in saturated areas was considered a key factor that controlled stream flow generation early interactions with keith beven univ of lancaster uk mike kirby univ of leeds uk and philippe davy cnrs france convinced chantal that shallow groundwater played a major role in the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of catchments consequently they decided in the mid 1990s to study and develop models of shallow groundwater dynamics 2 1 spatial variability in infiltration and runoff at the beginning of her career including her phd research 1981 1984 chantal investigated spatial variability in runoff and water infiltration at the field scale knowledge of the spatial variability in soil physical properties was required to address several agricultural issues such as wetland preservation in agricultural areas three main objectives governed her studies in this field i quantifying spatial variability ii analysing correlations between hydrological and soil factors and iii producing soil maps chantal and colleagues used geostatistics and isotopic tracer methods such as 18o to study water movement soil water content gascuel odoux and mérot 1986 soil properties gascuel odoux 1987 gascuel odoux and merot 1991 and the rainfall rate merot et al 1989 starting from in situ measurements and sampling both methods improved mapping of water movement and soil characteristics gascuel odoux and boivin 1994 gascuel odoux et al 1991 chantal has promoted the use of geostatistics to define appropriate strategies for soil sampling and the spatial resolution of in situ measurements chantal and colleagues also conducted early research on the ability of a helicopter borne c band scatterometer radar to map the extent of saturated areas brun et al 1990 in particular they demonstrated benefits of using ers 1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter to map these extents merot et al 1994 these studies paved the way for using remote sensing to map saturated areas and to limit parameter ranges of uncertainty in hydrological models such as topmodel franks et al 1998 with a fine knowledge of soil properties chantal and colleagues have used several approaches to study runoff generation in rural contexts from in situ measurement of overland flow in an agricultural field they identified local microtopography soil crusting and the spatial distribution of soil patches with high hydraulic conductivity as the main factors that control runoff gascuel odoux et al 1996 from experiments and computer modelling they showed that flow path connectivity at the square meter scale depends on the ratio of the mean slope to random roughness which controls transfers within the soil surface and may change significantly over time during a storm event darboux et al 2002 while runoff may be triggered on the upper part of hillslopes sheet flow is low and the runoff coefficient decreases as the slope length increases infiltration and soil deposition are particularly active in concave parts of hillslopes regardless of the characteristics of storm events and are enhanced by hedgerow networks merot et al 1999 this result contradicts the intuitive model of downstream amplification of runoff through aggregation in the drainage area it also supports the assumption of a threshold of spatial scale at which to define the head of channel networks at least in temperate regions such as brittany after this major observation chantal and colleagues worked to improve maps of surface flow connectivity using digital elevation models dems by representing the influence of hedgerows and field networks on the drainage area aurousseau et al 2009 gascuel odoux et al 2011 tortrat et al 2003 2 2 riparian wetland mapping because riparian wetlands in agricultural landscapes strongly influence hydrology water quality and biodiversity their degradation in intensive agricultural landscapes is of great concern to address the need for reliable wetland mapping chantal and colleagues developed a hydrological typology of wetlands durand et al 2000 mérot et al 2006 first potential wetlands are defined by soil properties and topographic data that can be derived from available databases and dems second existing wetlands are mapped from in situ observation of soil water content and wetland vegetation third effective wetlands are defined for a variety of ecosystem services related to hydrology water quality and biodiversity mapping these three types of wetlands requires different levels of investigation effort this study was the basis for the inventory of valley bottom wetland maps currently used in brittany gascuel et al 2009 and for the peew potential existing and effective wetlands method which provides a framework for organizing knowledge about wetland management mérot et al 2006 2 3 characterization and modelling of shallow groundwater since the 1990s chantal and colleagues have assessed the ability of hydrological models to predict spatial variability in groundwater levels in catchments attracted by topmodel s ability to capture with elegant simplicity the dynamics and dominant controls of shallow groundwater hydrology in a semi distributed form beven et al 2020 they considered this model as a reference this led chantal to collaborate with keith beven to conduct one of the first studies of the influence of temporal and spatial resolutions on model parameterization and simulations bruneau et al 1995 specifically she worked to determine the appropriate modelling approach for predicting dynamics of the water table and stream runoff simultaneously in catchments dominated by saturated subsurface flow gascuel odoux et al 2010b martin 2003 martin et al 2006 molenat 1999 molenat et al 2005 chantal has always been convinced that the spatial distribution of shallow groundwater must be predicted well to simulate matter fluxes and travel times in catchments section 2 furthermore she showed that groundwater is the main component of stream flow during both base flow conditions and storm events gascuel odoux et al 1999 molénat et al 1999 her research has made good use of the number and quality of water table records in the catchments of the agrhys observatory agro hydro systems gascuel odoux et al 2018 high frequency records 1 h from wells on transects extending down hillslopes provided the data necessary to analyse the ability to simulate spatio temporal dynamics of shallow groundwater in this regard topmodel s assumptions appear to work well for simulating stream flow and the water table in valley bottoms but less well for simulating midslope and upslope areas relaxing two of topmodel s assumptions steady state spatial subsurface flux and topographic assumptions significantly improve water table simulations for these two areas molenat et al 2005 the question is then how much the representation of geometry e g depth thickness of the soil and subsoil as well as the hydraulic properties of groundwater systems can be simplified while still achieving acceptable simulations of the water table transit time and solute fluxes spatial simulations of the water table were less sensitive to the geometry of the subsoil than to the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity martin et al 2006 consequently chantal analysed the relevance of considering homogeneous hydraulic geometry i e soil and subsoil thickness and depth and properties e g hydraulic conductivity drainable porosity using the hillvi model weiler and mcdonnell 2004 she demonstrated that considering lateral variations in hydraulic properties along the hillslope improves the spatial prediction of water tables only slightly gascuel odoux et al 2010b she concluded that i there is some incommensurability in comparing point observations to grid averaged predictions and ii improving spatial simulations of water table requires fitting local transmissivity to local water table observations which would require acquiring these observations 3 water solute and particulate transfer at the catchment scale since the early 1990s chantal s research has focussed mainly on water solute and particulate transfer in agricultural catchments she has considered the understanding of processes that underlie these transfers as a key scientific challenge to preserve and or restore water quality in the face of high agricultural pressures and climate change in the context of the severe nitrate contamination of water that western france was experiencing chantal advanced knowledge of the nitrogen n cycle and nitrate transfer at the catchment scale however as water quality should be evaluated as a whole she collaborated with other colleagues especially gérard gruau cnrs france catherine grimaldi inrae france and aline dia cnrs france to extended the study of matter transfer to carbon c p and suspended sediments they soon perceived the need for long term and spatially distributed hydrological and concentration time series associated with the observation of agricultural practices to this end she actively contributed to the development of the agrhys research observatory in brittany fig 2 fovet et al 2018b this long term observatory has focused since 1992 on headwater catchments kervidy naizin 5 km2 and kerbernez 1 2 km2 and characterized by hard rock aquifers an oceanic climate and dominance of agricultural land uses devoted to animal farming the agrhys observatory is dedicated to the investigation of the biogeochemical response times of catchments to variations in climate and agriculture with a focus on the following elements water nitrogen carbon and phosphorus chantal has co supervised 11 phd thesis that have analyzed agrhys observational data from gascuel odoux et al 2018 to promote the observatory develop scientific collaborations and investigate scientific questions over a wider range of hydroclimatic conditions chantal has worked to integrate the observatory into a national ozcar gaillardet et al 2018 and a european network elter through collaborations her research has also benefited from observations from research catchments outside of france e g ireland norway extrapolation of results acquired in headwater catchments associated with the needs and requests of local and national water managers have led her and colleagues to extend the study of transfers to mesoscale catchments and national scales to this end chantal has also used operational water information and monitoring databases 3 1 groundwater nitrate transfer from estimation of travel time to connectivity analysis chantal and colleagues have addressed groundwater nitrate transfer in agricultural catchments for the past 30 years it is useful to recall the scientific context in the 1990s when she began this research most studies focussed mainly on storm events to understand the main hydrological and biogeochemical processes that control dynamics of solute concentrations and fluxes in stream water in addition solute transfer times in headwater catchments with shallow groundwater were assumed to be short due to the shallow groundwater and short travel distances along hillslopes from the soil to a stream in this context chantal and philippe davy explored two topics i estimating travel times in shallow groundwater systems and ii exploring relationships between the dynamics of shallow groundwater and stream nitrate concentration at seasonal and annual scales the objective of this research was to better understand and predict long term dynamics of stream nitrate concentrations and fluxes section 3 how long does it take a solute to travel from the soil to a stream this question was initially motivated by water management concerns in a context of high nitrate contamination of streams and rivers several research teams and especially chantal s were challenged by water management agencies and public authorities to estimate how much time it would take stream water quality to recover after implementing good agricultural practices subsequently chantal and colleagues used a variety of approaches to quantify groundwater travel time spectral analysis of long time series of in stream solute concentrations led to the conclusion that mean travel time in the kervidy naizin catchment brittany exceeded 1 3 years molénat et al 1999 computer simulations performed later with distributed physical based groundwater models predicted that travel times varied greatly across catchments taking up to 3 years in the kervidy naizin catchment molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 and 14 years in the kerbernez catchments brittany martin et al 2006 further research by chantal and colleagues confirmed the magnitude of previously estimated mean transit times while emphasizing their high uncertainties they did this by i using spectral analysis of stream solute concentration time series and gaseous tracers cfcs and sf6 in collaboration with luc aquilina univ of rennes 1 to calibrate a groundwater model molénat et al 2013 and ii applying a conceptual compartment based model calibrated with long time series of solute concentration fovet et al 2015 the results of these studies were in line with those of other studies of catchment transit times e g kirchner et al 2000 mcguire et al 2002 stewart and fahey 2010 chantal has also extensively studied the influence of groundwater dynamics on stream nitrate concentrations she began from observations that stream water concentrations varied not only in the short term due to storm events but in the long term at seasonal and annual scales understanding low frequency variations requires understanding nitrate groundwater transfer and interactions between groundwater and surface water one main advance of chantal and colleagues was to develop a conceptual model based on the connectivity of hydrological compartments in a catchment to explain seasonal dynamics molenat et al 2008 stream nitrate concentration in most agricultural catchments with shallow groundwater was shown to follow an annual cycle with the highest concentrations in winter and the lowest in summer aubert et al 2013b martin et al 2004 molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 meanwhile a steady state spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in groundwater with a decreasing pattern from upslope to downslope was revealed as a common characteristic of the two catchments in the agrhys observatory martin et al 2004 molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 high nitrate concentrations in upslope areas behave as an infinite pool at the multi annual scale ruiz et al 2002 chantal and colleagues showed that riparian zones where the water table rises to the soil surface are hot spots of denitrification that result in nitrate concentrations near zero section 3 with these elements the concept of connectivity assumes that stream nitrate concentration depends on the connection of hydrological compartments i e high nitrate groundwater upslope a nitrate free riparian zone and low nitrate deep groundwater with the connection and disconnection of these compartments controlled by temporal dynamics of the groundwater level along the hillslope ocampo et al 2006a b in the susannah brook catchment australia and wriedt and rode 2006 in the lowland schaugraben catchment germany also demonstrated the ability of hydrological connectivity to explain variations in stream nitrate concentration the connectivity assumption has also been confirmed since then by the study and modelling of long term 10 years stream nitrate concentration aubert et al 2013a strohmenger et al 2021 the connectivity concept has also helped guide the design of conceptual compartment based models to explore the response of stream water quality to climatic and anthropogenic forcing section 2 3 3 2 influence of riparian wetland dynamics on sediment and phosphorus transfer unlike nitrate suspended sediments and p forms are transferred mainly via surface and shallow subsurface flowpaths lefrançois et al 2007 vongvixay et al 2010 consequently they are transferred mainly during short storm events which implies specifically monitoring and analysing them during these events chantal and colleagues particularly catherine grimaldi analysed the shape and direction of concentration discharge hysteresis loops to differentiate events with a proximal source in or near the stream clockwise hysteresis from those with a more distal source along the hillslope anticlockwise hysteresis in a grassland catchment in which cattle had access to the stream lefrançois et al 2007 showed that suspended sediments originated mainly from the stream channel and banks either by hydraulic erosion or cattle trampling the high seasonal availability of suspended sediments during the grazing season lefrançois et al 2007 and the sharp decrease in suspended sediment fluxes after construction of watering troughs vongvixay et al 2018 confirmed the crucial role of bank degradation by cattle in the suspended sediment dynamics of this catchment in contrast an arable catchment with supposedly higher potential for hillslope erosion but the presence of woody vegetation or grass buffer strips along the stream had one fifth the suspended sediment fluxes vongvixay et al 2018 in this catchment stream protection limited the delivery of eroded soil from arable fields during most but not the largest storm events chantal and colleagues research on suspended sediment paved the way for research on particle associated contaminants specifically forms of p results for the kervidy naizin catchment showed however that a large percentage of p 13 48 of annual load is transferred in dissolved forms minaudo et al 2017 and that storm dynamics of dissolved p are not synchronous with those of particulate p dupas et al 2015b dupas et al 2015b concluded that particulate and dissolved p forms have different spatial origins in the landscape and are transferred by different mechanisms particulate p originates from resuspension of streambed sediments bank erosion and occasionally from erosion on hillslopes in contrast dissolved p originates from riparian soils when fluctuations in the shallow groundwater level connect them to the stream monitoring p concentration in the soil water of the riparian zone revealed that alternating dry and wet phases in these zones fosters p solubilisation dupas et al 2015c it is therefore essential not to rely only on riparian buffers to limit p transfer to streams as the p that they retain may be remobilized management efforts should therefore limit erosion at its original source place buffer features e g grass strips hedgerows upslope of riparian wetlands and extract p from these hydrologically connected zones dupas et al 2017 3 3 development of an integrated conceptual model of solute and particulate transfer in headwater catchments in the 2010s chantal and colleagues have developed conceptual models of solute and particulate transfer in agricultural headwater catchments that went beyond earlier disjointed work on nitrate and phosphorus exports gascuel odoux et al 2018 the work relied strongly on long term and high frequency monitoring of the concentrations of multiple constituents in the kervidy naizin catchment i e daily since 2000 and for several parameters sub hourly since 2011 fovet et al 2018b water quality monitoring at the outlet of the 5 km2 catchment is supplemented with measurements in several other environmental compartments such as the soil groundwater and atmosphere to interpret these data chantal and colleagues conceptualized a catchment as a set of compartments each with static chemical signatures aubert et al 2013b concentration dynamics at the outlet are then conceptualized as a mixing of compartment contributions fig 3 to add complexity one can also consider dynamic chemical signatures when biogeochemical reactions or agricultural management modifies concentrations aubert et al 2013a chantal and colleagues have applied this representation of a catchment to develop perceptual models formal end member mixing analyses durand and juan torres 1996 and flexible mixing reservoir models fovet et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2014 strohmenger et al 2021 in addition to dividing a catchment into compartments chantal and colleagues also divided time into characteristic time scales long term multi annual seasonal intra annual and storm events e g strohmenger et al 2020 while environmental studies often aggregate data at different time scales she has specifically focussed on interactions between time scales for example aubert et al 2013b showed that seasonal cycles of nitrate chloride sulphate dissolved organic c doc and dissolved inorganic c depended on each year s mean weather conditions hot cold vs dry wet martin et al 2004 showed that seasonal nitrate cycles can even reverse i e winter maxima become summer maxima due to a catchment s recovery from high n inputs another example of interaction between time scales is the analysis and interpretation of how storm event dynamics vary among seasons aubert et al 2013c used latent dirichlet allocation models and showed that storm dynamics of four solutes i e nitrate chloride doc and sulphate depend on antecedent hydrological conditions dupas et al 2015d used dynamic time warping techniques and showed that p transfer dynamics during spring storms differ from those during autumn and winter storms highlighting the risk of incidental p losses after spreading animal waste in spring more recently fovet et al 2018a showed that storm event dynamics of nitrate and doc during autumn rewetting of the catchment differ from those during the rest of the year they attributed this difference to contributions of riparian wetlands in autumn along with these methods chantal and colleagues also used frequency analysis which showed that the fractal scaling of water quality observed in forested catchments can also be observed in intensive agricultural catchments aubert et al 2014 in addition to studying individual chemical elements in a disjointed manner chantal played a pioneering role in developing joint conceptual models cnp cycles and their interactions in agricultural landscapes this evolution from a focus on nitrate section 2 2 to coupled cnp cycles accompanied a change in water managers concerns from drinking water production often with nitrate standard not being met to reaching a good ecological status of surface water in contexts with a high risk of eutrophication le moal et al 2019 joint understanding of cnp cycles and transfer is crucial to understand how the concentration of each element is controlled by that of the others and how their relative concentrations influence aquatic ecosystems this work is also motivated by the necessity to identify potential risks of pollution swapping when dealing with one element without considering the others strohmenger et al 2020 showed that dynamics of nitrate and doc concentrations are opposite at annual seasonal and storm event scales while p dynamics are independent of those of the other two the ratios of pairs of elements may vary more when dynamics of the elements are asynchronous or out of phase and vary less when their dynamics are in phase guillemot et al 2021 confirmed these results using data from 180 headwater catchments in brittany and found that the temporal opposition between nitrate and doc and the independence of p is also spatially valid across brittany minaudo et al 2019 also found temporal opposition between nitrate and forms of p at the seasonal and storm event scales and attributed it to different dominant sources for both nutrients diffuse sources for n and a combination of diffuse and point sources for p 3 4 retrospective and prospective analysis of the influence of climate on water quality the influence of climate change on surface water quality in agricultural catchments greatly concerns the scientific community and water managers analysis of 16 years of meteorological data from the kervidy naizin catchment revealed an increase in temperature but no overall trend in annual discharge although winters tended to become wetter and summers tended to become drier strohmenger et al 2020 these observations of recent trends are consistent with predictions of climate models for the region although the predicted trend in annual rainfall is uncertain merot et al 2014 predicting responses of hydrological systems to these changes is challenging due to the complexity of the processes involved the many feedback loops that exist and potential interactions with changes in land management blöschl et al 2019 chantal s contributions to understanding the influence of climate variability on water quality have relied mainly on retrospective analysis of long term monitoring data dupas et al 2018 gascuel odoux et al 2010a mellander et al 2018 strohmenger et al 2020 disentangling the influence of climate from that of changes in land management is especially challenging especially for regions whose agriculture has changed greatly the past several decades dupas et al 2016 strohmenger et al 2020 using public water quality data from brittany gascuel et al 2010a and dupas et al 2018 highlighted the existence of mesoscale 2 6 year variations in discharge that drive synchronous variations in nitrate concentrations and fluxes fig 4 here discharge is taken as an integrative indicator of several climatic variables rainfall and evapotranspiration itself influenced by temperature these mesoscale variations may mask improvements in land management in certain years or exaggerate these improvements in other years thus water quality must be observed for more than 5 10 years to reliably assess effects of improved land management on water quality trends in addition to analysing public data monitoring research catchments provides both more variables and a higher temporal resolution using high frequency nitrate and p concentration data from france ireland and norway mellander et al 2018 hypothezised a connection between the north atlantic oscillation nao index and nutrient concentrations the index s influence positive or negative varied among catchments and often differed between nitrate and p because these data were available only during an upward trend in the nao index 2010 2016 future analysis should cover several cycles of the index piazza et al 2018 observed similar connections between inter annual variations in anion concentrations and the el niño southern oscillation enso index in nested catchments of the subtropical zone in contrast the data analysis of strohmenger et al 2020 considered several hydroclimatic variables instead of a single integrated variable such as discharge or the nao or enso index their results highlighted the joint influence of changes in climate and land management on long term trends in nitrate decreasing p decreasing and doc increasing they also highlighted effects of extreme climatic conditions whose frequency is predicted to increase such as flushing episodes with high doc concentration after a long summer drought or a disproportionate influence of large storm events on p transfer finally chantal also participated in prospective studies that used the integrated agro hydrological model tnt2 salmon monviola et al 2013 section 3 1 salmon monviola et al 2013 simulated the influence of temperature rainfall and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on water and n cycles in the kervidy naizin catchment and highlighted the importance of understanding how the functioning of riparian wetlands would respond to climate change overall the synergetic effect of increasing temperature decreasing rainfall and increasing carbon dioxide concentration is predicted to decrease n loads in the catchment s stream but uncertainties remain about how farming practices will respond to climate change and other incentives and then interact with the direct effects of climate change to influence water and n cycles 4 integrating hydrology into the design of integrated approaches to landscapes and territorial management several projects that chantal has conducted investigate how understanding hydrological processes can contribute to environmental management in agricultural areas in the late 1990 s many studies reported degradation of water resources and her research aimed to assess impacts of agriculture on water quality later her research moved from impact assessments toward the design of sustainable rural landscapes in a context in which the global environmental situation had become alarming caquet et al 2020a indeed the need to act became urgent ipbes 2019 ipcc 2014 and challenged the scientific community to provide evidence based contributions to sustainable societal development in a changing environment montanari et al 2013 in this context a territory as a geographic area and its relevant physical and societal dimensions is relevant for considering interactions among different agricultural systems cultivated and uncultivated areas and agricultural and non agricultural stakeholders gascuel and magda 2015 peyraud et al 2015 this section illustrates chantal s contributions to the management of agricultural areas from assessing impacts on water bodies to designing landscapes 4 1 integrating hydrology with other disciplines some researchers see hydrology as a single holistic discipline while others see it as a group of distinct sub disciplines baveye 2011 in recent years hydrology has evolved towards more interdisciplinary perspectives mccurley and jawitz 2017 to address complex scientific questions such as those raised by critical zone science brantley et al 2017 gaillardet et al 2018 and current challenges such as the water energy food nexus montanari et al 2015 wagener et al 2010 through collaborations chantal has contributed actively to developing broad understanding of hydrological processes the research conducted within these collaborations has related agricultural practices to water quality at catchment outlets and highlighted the need to combine thorough understanding of catchment hydrology with that of agricultural systems for example she worked with a local chamber of agriculture to assess based on field experiments effects of maize cropping techniques e g a mixed weeding strategy no tillage on herbicide transfer by surface runoff results showed that compared to conventional chemical weeding a mixed weeding strategy reduced herbicide concentrations by ca 75 and fluxes by up to 90 they also observed that no tillage increased soil infiltrability by a factor of 5 10 which greatly reduced surface runoff and herbicide transfer by up to 90 compared to those of conventional tillage heddadj and gascuel 2001 to explore agricultural practices to reduce n transfer to streams chantal helped patrick durand inrae and other colleagues develop integrated agro hydrological models moreau et al 2012 whereas field experiments are complex and costly particularly at the landscape level integrated modelling can predict whether changes in agricultural practices are likely to reach a targeted reduction in nitrate concentrations in groundwater or streams they used the spatially distributed agro hydrological model tnt2 beaujouan et al 2001 which couples a crop model brisson et al 1998 with a hydrological model based on topmodel beven 1997 to predict the ability of introducing cover crops i e fast growing crops that are grown between successive main crops to reduce n losses at the catchment scale durand et al 2015 agro hydrological models especially spatially distributed models generate a large amount of spatio temporal data of various formats and semantics due to technological barriers that prevent efficient data processing only daily flux and concentrations at the catchment outlet are usually analysed even though higher temporal or spatial resolutions may be simulated thus tools are needed to store display and analyse this spatio temporal information and turn it into useful knowledge that helps understand agro environmental systems and adaptations to meet environmental targets to address this issue chantal worked with computer scientists in particular marie odile cordier inria france to investigate the use of innovative machine learning techniques with data simulated by such models and extract knowledge about complex rural landscapes symbolic learning techniques helped them identify spatial patterns of herbicide sinks or sources and factors that explained herbicide transfer along the river network trépos et al 2012 2013 chantal and colleagues also developed a data warehouse to analyse output of the process based model using online analytical processing bouadi et al 2017 using this approach enabled quantifying impacts of agricultural practices on n emissions at multiple spatio temporal scales by providing relevant ways to identify and analyse where and why n pollution occurs in a catchment 4 2 integrated catchment modelling chantal has co led several projects to develop integrated models designed to support the management of rural areas using these models has facilitated dialogue among local stakeholders around land management scenarios for example by exploring ex ante simulations of impacts of changes in agricultural practices on water quality gascuel and magda 2015 one main innovation of chantal and colleagues has been to consider both farming and biophysical systems and their interactions in their modelling approaches to encompass the entire causal chain from farming activities to water pollution and to find ways to adapt farming systems to environmental objectives with computer scientist frederic garcia inrae chantal led a study of interactions between farmers technical decisions and biophysical systems in the development of the decision oriented sacadeau model gascuel odoux et al 2009 salmon monviola et al 2011 by predicting sources of water pollution by maize herbicides sacadeau aims to help decision makers decrease water pollution at the catchment level sacadeau combines a farmer decision submodel based on technical and environmental conditions developed with agricultural experts a temperature based crop phenology submodel and a submodel of water and chemical transfer within agricultural catchments in the transfer submodel chantal developed an innovative approach to modelling surface drainage networks that determines surface water connectivity by considering the topography between and within farm fields hedgerows roads and ditches aurousseau et al 2009 gascuel odoux et al 2011 this landscape drainage network considers both farming systems and landscape features unlike a traditional drainage network extracted from dem data alone the spatial representation based on this landscape drainage network has been useful for assessing effects of land use agricultural practices and the landscape on herbicide contamination of stream water many biophysical models such as swat arnold et al 1998 shetran birkinshaw and ewen 2000 tnt2 beaujouan et al 2001 2002 and dnmt liu et al 2005 operate at the catchment scale and simulate effects of agricultural practices on n transfer and transformation however they do not represent consistent farming systems because they do not explicitly represent farmer decisions this is particularly critical for mixed farming systems in which processes such as fodder production and manure spreading of cropping and livestock systems are closely related in other words when a model simulates large changes in the cropping system there is no guarantee that it will simulate production of enough forage for animals or that the amount of manure applied in the model will equal the amount of manure produced durand et al 2015 to address this gap and assess effects of different dairy farming systems on catchment n dynamics patrick durand chantal and colleagues developed the casimod n model fig 5 which couples a farmer decision model with the tnt2 model moreau et al 2013 casimod n simulates farming systems explicitly through production strategies and farmer decisions and translates these decisions into management practices representing these strategies when simulating management practices ensures that i simulated fodder production matches livestock feed requirements ii livestock feeding and manure management strategies are consistent with each other and iii specific farm constraints e g distances between fields are met applying casimod n to the yar catchment brittany in a project co led by chantal and laurent ruiz inrae demonstrated that such models can be powerful and relevant tools to redesign farming systems durand et al 2015 gascuel et al 2015 moreau et al 2013 here she made a decisive contribution by building a multidisciplinary research group 4 3 integrating hydrological sciences with non academic stakeholders the international research agenda of the 2000s and 2010s as described in the prediction in ungauged basins hrachowitz et al 2013 and panta rhei montanari et al 2013 initiatives challenged the scientific community to make progress in transferring knowledge about well known research sites to poorly gauged monitored or documented catchments for which societal issues are strong in accordance with this agenda chantal co led several projects to conceptualize farming systems in catchments affected by water pollution in these projects scenarios of agricultural practices at farming system and catchment scales were co built with local non academic stakeholders from the agricultural and or water management sector this co building allows future scenarios to be explored while the integrated models described previously section 3 2 can predict impacts of these scenarios on water resources to develop the decision oriented sacadeau model gascuel et al 2009 salmon monviola et al 2011 the farmer decision submodel that represents farmers constraints and strategies was built first in collaboration with advisers from the brittany chamber of agriculture their expertise enabled definition of decision rules for crop sowing and weeding strategies and their distribution among fields then different symbolic learning techniques were applied to model predictions to identify situations that would decrease water pollution by herbicides and make sense for stakeholders trépos et al 2012 in the acassya project researchers worked with local stakeholders to reconcile agriculture especially dairy farming with coastal activities in areas affected by coastal eutrophication gascuel et al 2015 thus researchers farmers local authorities and environmental managers co built knowledge about current and future dairy farming systems to design new systems compatible with the vulnerability of downstream ecosystems the project combined virtual experiments conducted with the casimod n model moreau et al 2013 with field experiments on pilot farms results showed that co building knowledge required on going dialogue reflexivity and long term involvement by researchers levain et al 2015 using integrated models that couple farmer decision crop and hydrological models enabled stakeholders to discuss and adopt scenarios durand et al 2015 gascuel et al 2015 moreau et al 2013 4 4 making scientific knowledge accessible and relevant for water and environmental managers chantal has promoted the development of methods to improve water management that are scientifically sound and operational for example considerable effort was made to transfer knowledge about critical source areas of pollutants into a decision support tool called territ eau gascuel odoux et al 2011 gascuel et al 2009 territ eau helps stakeholders define action plans that include changes in agricultural practices and systems as well as restoration and preservation of semi natural areas in rural landscapes at the end of the 1990s as agriculture continued to intensify and landscape features such as the functional role of landscape features as potential buffer for diffuse pollution dorioz et al 2010 gascuel odoux et al 2011 gascuel et al 2008 chantal helped identify landscape features that can serve as a buffer of diffuse n and p pollution she helped develop pioneer approaches for predicting and mapping these landscape features and assessing their effectiveness as buffers section 1 2 for example modifying the topographic index by considering downslope topography enabled prediction of wetland extents in hydrosystems controlled by subsurface groundwater gascuel et al 1998 later mérot et al 2006 used this modified index to develop the peew method for wetland management that decision makers and local managers can apply directly 5 contributing to public policies and public debate chantal has also contributed to non academic publications that involved hydrology and that were intended to guide public policy makers and local water managers as well as contribute to public debate they are examples of how hydrological research can help address human induced societal issues montanari et al 2015 wagener et al 2010 5 1 contributions to joint scientific assessments in france ministries can request joint scientific assessments on any subject which summarize validated scientific knowledge in response to a complex question related to a strong and urgent societal issue in them a group of experts analyses the international scientific literature to inform public debate about the given question chantal contributed to the joint scientific assessment pesticides agriculture and the environment reducing the use of pesticides and limiting their environmental impact aubertot et al 2007 which updated knowledge about and data on agricultural use of pesticides their contamination of environmental compartments and impacts on non target organisms and ecosystems chantal specifically contributed to the chapters related to hydrological transfers i e buffer zones transfer indices and models examining pesticide drift in the environment and discussing crop management strategies and spatial configurations to reduce it chantal co led another joint scientific assessment entitled causes mechanisms consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena le moal et al 2019 pinay et al 2018 that highlights the general increase in n and p fluxes to oceans and agriculture s increased contribution to them during the 20th century to predict eutrophication risk nutrient transfer and transformation processes need to be considered along with climatic variability and ecological vulnerability of downstream ecosystems control strategies can occasionally use engineered nutrient removal techniques but will first require source reduction 5 2 tools and expertise for public water policies chantal led several national studies to help the french national office for water and aquatic environments onema from 2006 to 2016 now merged with other agencies into the national office for biodiversity report to the european commission regarding french objectives of the water framework directive these studies harmonized methods for estimating n and p emissions to all french rivers the methods are based on the nutting model nutrient transfer modelling which uses a statistical approach to estimate nutrient loads from multiple variables including n and p surpluses and catchment characteristics dupas et al 2013 compared national and regional calibrations of the nutting n model in two regions of france regional models generally showed better fit but larger uncertainty in parameter estimates when the calibration data did not include enough catchments or variability in land and river characteristics dupas et al 2015a estimated that 53 of the soil n surplus and 95 of the p surplus is retained and that this apparent retention is driven by annual runoff and hydrological connectivity respectively 5 3 contributions to scientific resource centres chantal took an active role in creating a resource centre with the national office for water and aquatic environments for drinking water protection to help local authorities design more ambitious and effective action plans for managing water resources menard et al 2014 this resource centre aims to facilitate coordination among stakeholders and to disseminate documents and methods it provides case studies in which i outputs from biophysical models are presented to stakeholders as in dupas et al 2015a and ii local experts identified the critical role of crop rotations especially the periods between main crops via participatory modelling another resource centre called creseb resource and expertise centre for water in brittany was created in 2011 to transfer up to date scientific knowledge to local and regional water managers chantal was president of its scientific and technical board for four years during this period she promoted the topics of hydromorphology diffuse agricultural pollutants floods and support for transitions in territorial projects 6 conclusion as a researcher team leader unit director and deputy scientific director of a national research institute chantal gascuel odoux has successfully led several careers at once we have traced and summarized chantal s vision objectives and achievements over the past 40 years essentially limiting the article to the field of water sciences in relation to the scope of the journal of hydrology nevertheless chantal s interdisciplinary approach also led her to conduct important research in soil science and agronomy furthermore she has conducted her research along with collective institutional responsibilities at the national level in doing so chantal has gained national and international recognition within the hydrology community her contribution to agricultural research and development in france was recognized in 2014 when she was awarded the rank of knight of the legion of honour the highest french order of merit we also want to emphasise chantal s human qualities guided by a strong sense of collective work and driven by a clear idea of what science and public research in particular must provide to society chantal has always been attentive and benevolent towards her mentees and all of the colleagues students technicians engineers and researchers with and for whom she has worked chantal has helped define the directions of future research in landscape agroecology necessary to design sustainable agricultural systems she has paved the way for young researchers to conduct high quality research that meets societal needs the relative effects of human activities and the climate on cnp cycles and the eutrophying impacts of major contaminants on aquatic ecology are among the research fields that chantal has opened up and that we will be exploring in the years and decades to come 7

2473,bioretention cell bc design variation significantly changes its hydrological dynamics at unit scale leading to major changes in its target design goals when designed unit replicated at the catchment scale improved understanding of the behaviors of bc design parameters under different rainfall conditions is critical for effective implementation of bcs to achieve design goals this paper illustrates and compares two global sensitivity analysis methods i e vars and sobol for the identification of influential parameters and their variations in hydrological dynamics model responses under different rainfall conditions and perturbation scales so as to quantify their uncertainty and reliability for influential factors ranking from the application results of both sensitivity analysis methods six parameters out of the total seventeen including conductivity berm height vegetation volume suction head porosity and wilting point were indicated for their significant sensitivities to surface infiltration surface outflow and peak flow in addition soil thickness conductivity slope and field capacity in a total of nine were categorized as influential to storage outputs conductivity and vegetation volume were ranked as the most influential parameters followed by berm height and suction head porosity and wilting point the results analysis also demonstrated that the behavior of design parameters towards model response significantly changes with different rainfall conditions and perturbation scales as well as the used sensitivity analysis methods in particular it is indicated from this study that the vars is preferred over other sensitivity analysis approaches including the sobol method i e variance based method because of its higher accuracy reliability and computational

1 introduction bioretention cell bc is one of the most typical widely used low impact developments lid employed as a stormwater management solution with respect to quantitative and qualitative stormwater problems bonneau et al 2021 the working principle of bioretention cell is based on the six words thematic concept which is to infiltrate retain store cleanse use and drain urban stormwater for mimicking pre development hydrological conditions of urban catchment by promoting reduction of surface runoff and peak flow and increasing infiltration and storage cleaning of pollutants and pathogens brunetti et al 2016 li et al 2018 li et al 2020 marvin et al 2020 research conducted over the past two decades has comprehensively been involved in the quantification of bc s benefits through performance evaluation of bc in the laboratory bonneau et al 2021 li et al 2020 winston et al 2016 and by different modelling approaches lisenbee et al 2021 raei et al 2019 yang chui 2018b these research studies have proved significant contributions of low impact developments or nature based solutions including bc for sustainable management of stormwater through urban flood control stormwater pollutants control and aesthetic improvements in urban catchment numerous previous research studies also proved bc s successful implementation results in terms of reduction in peak flows and removal of metals and suspended solids debusk wynn 2011 li et al 2016 trowsdale simcock 2011 winston et al 2016 while demonstrating significant variation in the removal of dissolved solids and capturing them as a great challenge fan et al 2019 liu et al 2017 performance of bioretention cell is mainly determined on different factors including its location implementation area to drainage area ratio and bioretention cell design brown et al 2013 skorobogatov et al 2020 zhang chui 2020 a significant number of research studies have been conducted to investigate evaluate and optimize the first two factors e g bc location bc implementation area to drainage area ratio rezaei et al 2021 singh et al 2020 tansar et al 2022 tavakol davani et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b yang chui 2018a zhang et al 2018 however limited attention is paid for improved understanding of variation in outputs i e surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow by changing bc design

improvement in surface runoff reduction pollutant concentration reduction or variation of other hydrological parameters such as conductivity porosity residence time and water retention capacity fassman beck et al 2015 kim et al 2018 madrazo uribeetxebarria et al 2021 mei et al 2018 segismundo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 stormwater management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff model being widely utilized by different urban planners engineers and researchers for the planning modelling and optimization of lids such as bioretention cells rossman huber 2016a b apart from modelling and performance evaluation of bc at catchment scale the comprehensive assessment and improved understanding of hydrological dynamics of different design parameters of bc i e at unit scale are significantly important to optimize its design configurations with target goals although research efforts from the early 2000 s have made a significant contribution on the existence quantification and optimization of bc benefits at different installation scales within catchment however there is an apparent knowledge gap to understand underlying hydrological processes its variability contributing factors identification of optimal soil media composition soil plant interaction vegetation type and density presence of underdrain and subsoil conditions li et al 2019 zhang chui 2019 for example an attempt is made to link fundamental hydrological performance of bioretention cell and its design parameters by introducing a new concept of bioretention abstraction volume bav defining the total volume of water stored in soil media pore spaces and depression bowl of bioretention cell davis et al 2012 a sound knowledge of soil water retention parameters and media characteristics including porosity field capacity wilting point and depth of root zone that effectively utilize soil moisture contents are required for determination of bav the findings of this study enabled us to find a relationship between quantitative design and performance information for design optimization of bc that provides tailor made designs for target volume reduction by varying of soil composition vegetation and configuration in addition to this characterization and optimization of soil media properties vegetation density and efficient layout of ponding storage provide sufficient information for understanding overall design of bioretention system lewellyn 2018 despite some research studies have focused on the understanding of bc as a system including korgaonkar et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 but there is still necessary to comprehensively understand and characterize role and hydrological dynamics of different design parameters under various rainfall conditions sensitivity analysis sa can be used as a main tool for understanding and identifying key design parameters with their relative importance on different model responses xing et al 2021 various sensitivity analysis sa methods are broadly categorized into two groups 1 local and 2 global sensitivity analysis methods van griensven et al 2006 chen et al 2020 local sa methods measure how model response varies at a local scale around a single point with variation of uncertain input factors however global sensitivity analysis gsa methods determine behavior of model response with variation of uncertain parameters across the factor space and quantify uncertainties associated with each factor local sa methods include the one factor at a time method czitrom 1999 and the regional sensitivity analysis rsa method hornberger spear 1981 and various global sa methods including the derivative base method morris 1991 the variance based method sobol 1993 and most recently developed variogram based method i e variogram analysis of response surfaces vars framework razavi gupta 2016a b previous research studies on local sensitivity analysis of hydraulic and hydrological models have demonstrated several limitations of local methods gan et al 2014 saltelli annoni 2010 song et al 2015 tang et al 2006 wainwright et al 2014 vars framework highlighted two major challenges in previously developed gsa methods including 1 ambiguous definition of global sensitivity and 2 high computational cost the first challenge demonstrates that different baseline theoretical definitions and philosophies are used for development of different gsa methods leading to different or event conflicting sensitivity results of factors the second challenge explains large computational burden cost i e number of model simulations required to estimate reliable and robust sensitivity analysis results a novel and comprehensive entitled vars framework is developed as unifying theory by providing different gsa methods and theories a common foundation for overcoming above mentioned challenges razavi gupta 2016a b razavi et al 2019 unlike other gsa methods vars characterize spatial structure of response surface of model at local and global scale the directional variograms and covariograms translate spatial structure of response surface in on dimension across the full range of different parameters perturbation scales meles et al 2021 vars also unifies previously developed widely used gsa methods i e derivative base method morris variance base method sobol by developing a theoretical relationship between vars and other derivative variance base methods and enables simultaneous generation of sensitivity indices of both morris and sobol methods together with vars indices using a common set of sample points vars also be considered highly efficient robust providing reliable and stable results with 1 2 order of fewer sample points model simulations compared to other gsa methods because vars is being developed to leverage information contained in pairs of points rather of individual points in this study we will comprehensively evaluate performance of two gsa methods including vars framework and sobol s method and identify key design parameters of bc quantify associated uncertainties with their parameter s rankings and estimation the reliability of their rankings the main contribution of this paper is threefold 1 to improve understanding of sensitivity of key design parameters with their hydrological dynamics under different rainfall conditions 2 to understand parameters behavior towards different model responses across the perturbation scales under both vars and sobol methods and comparative assessment of their associated uncertainties and 3 to rank key design parameters under different model responses and estimation of reliability of their factor rankings 2 methodology 2 1 variogram based sensitivity analysis method vars a novel robust and comprehensive global sensitivity analysis gsa method named variogram analysis of response surfaces vars razavi gupta 2016a b is developed based on an anisotropic variogram concept that characterizes the spatial structure of dependent variables e g model responses across different perturbation scales in multi dimensional parameter space vars uses powerful techniques like variograms to explain how model responses vary spatially and temporally with the variation of one or more sets of factors e g its parameters forcings boundary conditions etc considering a range of parameter perturbation scales razavi gupta 2019 in addition vars also calculates several indices of two commonly applied gsa methods variance based sobol 1993 and derivative based morris 1991 with 1 2 orders of magnitude of computational efficiency vars analysis describes spatial variability and dependency of model response within a domain formed by a set of different factors suppose y represents model response is a function of n parameters θ 1 θ n as shown in eq 1 varies within design factor space predefined by the n dimensional hypercube bounds between the θ 1 min θ n min and θ 1 max θ n max 1 y f θ 1 θ n let h h i h n is a location in the n dimensional factor space and suppose a and b are two points with locations θ a and θ b having a distance vector of h θ a θ b and its multidimensional directional variogram γ h and covariograms c h can be calculated as follows by eqs 2 and 3 2 γ h 1 2 v y θ h y θ 3 c h 1 2 c o v y θ h y θ directional variograms and covariograms are the main building blocks of vars and contain substantial sensitivity information of all design parameters across the full range of perturbation scales h i here h i represents fraction or percentage of factor space for any given parameter i these indices directional variogram and covariograms are calculated at each time step during simulation period in time varying analysis or as an aggregate value in time aggregate sensitivity analysis the directional variogram calculated along one dimension parameter of i th parameter is a one dimensional function γ h i which is equivalent to γ h when h j 0 for all j i directional variograms are defined based on distances between pairs of points along one dimension rather than locations of pairs in the parameter space a set of sensitivity metrics known as ivars integrated variogram across a range of scales is computed by integration of variograms at given perturbation scale h i e g 10 30 or 50 of i th parameter 4 γ h i 0 h i γ h i d h i ivars50 also called total variogram effect when h 50 of factor range is recognized as the most comprehensive vars based global sensitivity index with rich information of model response surface across the full range of perturbation scale computed for sensitivity analysis of bioretention design parameters in this study ivars50 is computed by ensuring that perturbation scale is less than 50 meaning value of h i or h i is 50 for the reliability of variograms otherwise variograms become meaningless the distance between any two pair of points within factor space cannot exceed half of its total range readers are referred to razavi gupta 2016a b 2019 razavi et al 2019

surfaces with 90 confidence intervals and also provide parameters reliability showing factors rankings sheikholeslami et al 2019 bootstrapping algorithms use m cross sections for each parameter and randomly perform sampling and replacement of m of the m cross sections for larger number of times e g hundreds or thousands and estimate vars sensitivity metrics in this process parameters remain independent without any interactions and same cross sections are sampled again m times but with different initial points and a given resolution δ h 2 2 variance based sensitivity analysis method sobol the global and model independent sa method known as sobol method saltelli et al 1999 sobol 1990 was developed on variance decomposition concept and enabled to evaluate non linear and non monotonic functions and models the sensitivity of parameters is estimated based on variance decomposition of model response with respect to relative contribution of each parameter and their interactions saltelli et al 2008 saltelli et al 2004 there are two sensitivity indices of sobol method the first order index main effect and the second order index total effect the first order effect estimates how model response changes with individual contribution of each parameter however the second order effect estimates individual contribution to variation in model response and their interactions saltelli et al 2010 the first term of eq 6 named v i demonstrates individual contribution of each parameter i with addition of their respective variance and second term named v ij indicates individual contribution and interactions of parameters like i and j with variance because of combination of both parameters higher ranking indices are also defined with same method as second order indices s ij eq 6 represents total output variance with individual variance of parameters and their interactions as follows 6 v y i 1 k v i i 1 k j i k v ij v 1 2 k where v y represent total variance of output v i denotes first order variance of parameter x i v i v e y x i and interactions of all parameters v ij to v 1 k starting from i 1 to k are calculated by v ij v e y x i x j v i v j the variance of

parameters multiple factors boost interaction of one parameter with other parameters such as number of parameters involved in sensitivity analysis their variation ranges and variance based method have better suitability for models functions having large number of parameters vars framework estimates sobol indices total order effect as by products using same sample points generated by star based sampling technique and sample space reducing significant computational time and resources 2 3 numerical implementation of vars framework a new robust and computationally efficient star based sampling strategy is designed for numerical practical implementation of vars framework collectively known as the star vars razavi gupta 2016a firstly star centers n are randomly selected within factor space by using latin hypercube sampling lhs in this study other sampling techniques such as random and progressive latin hypercube sampling plhs sheikholeslami razavi 2017 can also be employed following this the cross sections of evenly spaced sample points based on predefined δ h value are produced based on each n star center along each of parameters within their factor spaces these generated set of

factor space 2 4 vars pyswmm setup and working procedure vars toolbox was developed in matlab environment razavi gupta 2019 and externally linked to pyswmm a python wrapper for stormwater management model in this study as shown in fig 1 b a more comprehensive version of the toolbox is recently developed and now is available in python as well vars tool sensitivity analysis package in python fig 1a explained step by step methodology adopted in this study firstly the random sample points are generated in vars using star based sampling technique across full range of factor space and stored in a text file the factor space of bioretention cell parameters is defined according to its design guidelines explained in swmm user and technical manuals rossman huber 2016a b and chinese lid design standards mohrud 2015 secondly a python based script for pyswmm is developed to read design parameters of different layers of bioretention cells in a monte carlo type setting simulated for specified rainfall scenarios and stored model responses in a csv file lastly vars read model responses and generated a set of sensitivity metrics the parameters used in vars algorithm are as follows number of

sensitivity analysis of bioretention design parameters is conducted on a hypothetical catchment of 1 km2 1000 m 2 1000 m 2 fig 3 a with 5 treatment area of total impervious area the conceptual design of bioretention cell in swmm with flux representation of each layer are shown in fig 3b 2 5 bioretention cell modelling in swmm swmm is widely being applied for short term and long term modelling of lids for their performance evaluation as stormwater management strategies against reduction of urban runoff and pollution controls bioretention cell is one of the most widely used lids modelled in swmm for planning analysis design management and optimization according to various placement scenarios i e type location and size swmm models lid controls as an additional object of sub catchments and assigned a specified fraction of its imperviousness area for capturing runoff by using dynamic rainfall runoff process in a computationally efficient manner rossman huber 2016b the conceptual design of bioretention cells in swmm is based on three essential vertical layers i e surface layer soil layer and storage layer and with an optional underdrain layer system placed in gravel storage beds total surface inflow i q 0 receives from direct precipitation i and runoff q 0 drained from other nearby impervious areas on surface layer of bioretention cell first layer the surface inflow either infiltrates f 1 into soil layer second layer or ponding water can evaporate e 1 or excessive ponding water outflows q 1 on berms of bc the soil layer containing engineering soil mixture either evaporates e 2 or percolates into storage layer third layer f 2 of received infiltrated water from surface layer following this process the storage layer based on coarse crushed stores or gravels received percolation from soil layer that either exfiltrate into native soil f 3 evaporates e 3 or directly conveyance to underlying perforated underdrain q 3 system if it is placed total water drained to drainage system is based on surface outflow q 1 and flow drained by underlaying underdrain q 3 swmm made some simplified assumptions for modelling of lids for convenient understanding of physical processes are as follows 1 lid unit has same cross sectional area throughout its all vertical layers 2 the infiltrated water passes through all vertical layers and is one dimensional 3 surface inflow and moisture contents are uniformly distributed over top and soil layers respectively 4 storage layer considers only a simple reservoir for water storage with negligible metric forces within layer under these assumptions the simple mass balance equations eq 11 13 are solved for modelling hydrological performance of lid control including bc as explaining rate of change of water in each vertical layer as difference between inflow and outflow flux described as volume stored per unit area per unit time the mass balance equations of three vertical layers are as follows 11 ϕ 1 d 1 t i q 0 e 1 f 1 q 1 13 d 2 θ 2 t f 1 e 2 f 2 13 ϕ 3 d 3 t f 2 e 3 f 3 q 3 total amount of water q e a n d f that either infiltrates evaporates or is stored in any of these three vertical layers d i a n d θ i is a function of existing water content in any of various layers specific site and soil characterises ϕ i and d i are layer porosities and layer thickness respectively swmm numerically solved these set of coupled equations for each time step to calculate how total inflow hydrograph i q 0 is distributed and converted into surface runoff underdrain outflow q 3 and exfiltration f 3 into underlying native soil surface infiltration f 1 is modelled by using the green ampt eq 14 which is usually applied for saturated conditions developed at top of soil layer residual content or wilting point of dry soil is represented by starting values of θ 20 of dry soil that increases just after rainfall events and decreases during dry periods moreover characteristics of k 2 s ϕ 2 and ψ 2 for bioretention cells amended soil is dependent on nature and properties of soil which can significantly vary infiltration rate in comparison to rest of sub catchment eq 15 represents ponded surface water when exceeds maximum freeboard height d 1 becomes immediate surface outflow rate of percolation flux f 2 from soil to storage layer is modelled in swmm by using darcy s law as represented by eq

q s 17 18 a n d 19 represent evapotranspiration et rate computed for surface soil and storage layers respectively at each time step based on user supplied time series of daily potential et e 0 t the amount of et in each layer is dependent on amount of potential et remaining and water stored in layer θ wp represents user supplied wilting point moisture content exfiltration rate f 3 of storage layer into native soil computed based on depth of stored water and amount of moisture contents of native soil swmm considers user supplied saturated hydraulic conductivity of native soil as exfiltration rate as moisture content of native soil is not known underdrain outflow q 3 is modelled based on simple empirical power as represented by eq 20 certain limits on infiltration percolation flux evapotranspiration rates and outflow rates are imposed to keep moisture levels in each layer within limits of layer s capacity neither to become negative nor exceed further technical and

analysis 3 1 vars based sensitivity indices 3 1 1 directional variograms vars and sobol methods were applied for global sensitivity analysis of bioretention cell design parameters under different rainfall scenarios and reliability of factors ranking evaluated through bootstrapping technique both global sensitivity analysis methods evaluate parameters dynamic behaviors towards different model responses with a range of perturbation scales their impacts and improved understanding of quantification of each parameter s contribution to the total model response surface the perturbation scale h i of the i th parameter decides domain of sensitivity with smaller and larger values of h representing sensitivity of parameter to response surface at a local scale and larger scale respectively under this methodology a variogram γ h i with smaller value shows lower sensitivity of underlying response surface of i th parameter at a specific perturbation scale h i and vice versa for larger value the vars based directional variograms of influential parameters of bioretention cells for different model responses a surface infiltration b surface outflow c storageand d peak flow are represented in fig 4 as an example we selected and showed directional variograms of one rainfall scenario i e 20 year return period other scenarios have similar patterns of variograms total six parameters out of seventeen including conductivity c berm height bh vegetation volume vv suction head sh porosity p and wilting point wp indicated their sensitivities for surface infiltration surface outflow and peak flow and in addition to these parameters soil thickness sot conductivity slope cs and field capacity fc in a total of nine categorized as influential for storage output generally the directional variograms clearly demonstrated that conductivity vegetation volume and berm height are the most influential parameters for four model responses i e surface infiltration surface outflow storage volume and peak flow however other parameters demonstrated lower sensitivity moreover sensitivity is perturbation scale dependent the larger the magnitude of variation across the perturbation scale the most sensitive parameters are otherwise vice versa the lower sensitive parameters showed limited variation in variograms across the perturbation scale showing their smaller influence on model response moreover the directional variograms of two most influential parameters i e conductivity and vegetation volume changed their rankings between perturbation scales of 0 4 and 0 5 as shown in fig 4b and c this behavior is clearly explained by a comprehensive study haghnegahdar razavi 2017 based on three different real case studies and used different metrics to understand perturbation scale phenomena and their impact on parameters sensitivities the findings of the study conclude that sensitivity analysis is scale dependent also the ratio of sensitivities and rankings of parameters are significantly dependent on perturbation scales and performance metrics like our results a large variation in sensitivity analysis results of parameters was observed under different perturbation scales to improve understanding of valuable information on parameters behavior and its underlying processes at different perturbation scales vars is the only scale dependent sensitivity analysis method capable of providing comprehensive information about model sensitivity at multiple perturbation scales with no extra computational burden based on these results it can be learned that a full spectrum of perturbation scales is necessary for accurate factors ranking otherwise consideration of a specific perturbation scale is not reliable alipour et al 2022 also the directional variograms are only reliable and considered for h i is 50 otherwise they lost their meanings as explained in the methodology section 2 1 3 1 2 time aggregate sensitivity index time aggregate sensitivity index was chosen for this study as it is the summary of statistical information of the dynamical behaviors of model responses during the whole simulation period it aggregates sensitivity information of model response for each time step of the overall simulation period vars also provides a time varying sensitivity index in the form of time series representing model behaviors at each time step of the simulation period bioretention cell is mostly designed and placed in urban areas to improve their perviousness with the objective of reduction of increased stormwater runoff and filtering pollutants e g phosphorus nitrogen etc thereby controlling stormwater load quantitatively and qualitatively on site to reduce burden on the urban drainage system the performance of a bioretention cell can significantly vary with its various design configurations and installation locations the replication of a well designed bioretention cell can substantially improve its collective benefits at a catchment scale considering its significance of design configurations and wide usage in urban areas the global sensitivity analysis of bioretention cell parameters is conducted under various design rainfall scenarios e g return period 5 10 20 100 year time of peak e g 0 1 0 4 0 9 storm duration e g 6 7 8 9 10hr as shown in fig 5 the vars based comprehensive sensitivity index ivars50 also called total variogram effect is selected and normalized to indicate relative contribution of each parameter towards model response and variations in dynamic behaviors of parameters across various rainfall scenarios here all parameters are categorized into three classes a parameter having a ratio of sensitivity of more than 10 is classified as very important if it s between 1 and 10 called important and parameters with less than 1 value of sensitivity indices are recognized as less important haghnegahdar et al 2017 rosolem et al 2012 a surface infiltration overall it can be clearly recognized that conductivity and vegetation volume are the most influential parameters followed by berm height and suction head and remaining parameters are less influential for all rainfall scenarios and model responses in case of surface infiltration fig 5a conductivity is by far the most influential parameter contributing 78 89 of total ivars50 across all rainfall scenarios the main reason for higher contribution of this parameter towards surface infiltration is because it controls infiltration rate in soil layer of bioretention cell and can also be partly caused by the interaction of this parameter with performance of other parameters e g vegetation volume berm height and suction head the next most important parameter is vegetation volume which controls and retains surface runoff and improves surface infiltration rate contributing 6 16 of ivars50 across all rainfall scenarios together these two important parameters contribute to a total of 92 95 showing a significant influence on the design configuration of bioretention cells both of these parameters significantly contribute capturing and storing surface runoff providing substantial impact on reduction of surface outflow and peak flow resultantly reducing significant stormwater load on urban drainage systems following this the next two parameters including suction head and berm height with their contribution of 2 6 and 1 3 respectively categorized as important respectively the remaining parameters are classified as less influential as their individual contributions in ivars50 are less than 1 it is worth mentioning that together these four parameters i e suction head berm height porosity and wilting point only contribute 5 8 of ivars50 across all rainfall scenarios in case of rainfall scenarios the sensitivity of conductivity decreases from lower to higher return periods and earlier to later peaks however it increases from shorter to longer storm events in principle conductivity is the main parameter who has major contribution in controlling infiltration rate and resultantly storage in bioretention cells overall total infiltration volume increased from lower to higher return periods however sensitivity of conductivity gradually decreased because of increase in utilization of unsaturated soil media in bioretention cells resultantly the saturated soil media reduces opportunity for incoming surface inflow to infiltrate from surface to soil layer in case of time to peak scenarios the major amount of rainfall received at specific periods i e earlier middle and later of storms likewise return period scenarios the sensitivity of conductivity parameter is higher during earlier storm peaks as larger amount of rainfall can be infiltrated in earlier peak storms because of availability of maximum storage capacity in soil and storage layers however the storage capacity is gradually filled with water infiltrated before storm peak resultantly reducing infiltration rate as storm peak shifts from earlier to later part of storm a reversal effect on sensitivity of conductivity was observed for storm duration scenarios with relatively smaller increase in sensitivity index from shorter to longer storm events compared to return periods and time to peak scenarios the main reason for gradual increase in sensitivity of conductivity for longer storm events may be because of increase in percolation of infiltrated water from soil to storage layers leading to providing infiltration opportunities for incoming water in case of vegetation volume opposite pattern of sensitivity index comparted to conductivity is observed for three types of rainfall scenarios i e return period time to peak and storm duration as the objective of this parameter is to retain runoff on surface of bioretention cell and the capability to retain maximum amount of runoff depends on either two factors 1 increase in intensity of rainfall or 2 reduction in infiltration rate it is clear from surface infiltration results fig 5a that both factors are fulfilled during higher return periods and second factor is fulfilled during later peak and shorter duration storm events in case of berm height the main purpose of this design parameter is to control the stormwater on surface layer until it overflows on the berms of bioretention cell the results of berm height are consistent with vegetation volume for all rainfall scenarios but with relatively lesser magnitude because both design parameters have similar design objectives but berm height has lesser impact on controlling surface runoff compared to vegetation volume moreover the suction head replicates pattern of conductivity results with lesser magnitude for return periods and time to peak scenarios however no significant variation was observed for storm duration scenarios this parameter s higher contribution for shorter and earlier peak storm events is because of unsaturated soil layer conditions b surface outflow conductivity and vegetation volume are the most influential parameters with their individual contribution of 47 54 and 37 44 in ivars50 vegetation volume contributing relatively less than conductivity across all rainfall scenarios as shown in fig 5b together both parameters contribute 90 92 in ivars50 showing significant impact on variation of model response under changing these parameters the next two parameters berm height and suction head contribute 6 8 and 1 3 in ivars50 across all types of rainfall scenarios other remaining parameters including porosity and wilting point contribute less than 1 moreover these four parameters collectively could only make 8 10 contribution to surface outflow in general all parameters represented limited variation in their sensitivity across the different rainfall scenarios both conductivity and vegetation volume showed an approximate opposite similar pattern of results compared to surface infiltration fig 5a during return periods and time to peak scenarios and no variations in their sensitivities were observed during different storm duration events fig 5b it is interesting to note that sensitivity of conductivity increases for surface outflow during higher return periods because infiltration rate increases during high intensity storms followed by exploitation of major storage capacity of bioretention cell and resultantly surface outflow increases however vegetation volume shows reduction in its response during high storms and earlier peak events and no significant variation in its response towards surface outflow is observed for storm duration scenarios interestingly berm height does not show any significant variation in its sensitivity index during time to peak and storm duration scenarios however a gradual increase in its sensitivity index for higher intensity storm events is because larger amount of runoff during higher storms exceeds berm s capacity and overflow from bioretention cell it is important to explain that it indicated relatively higher sensitivity for surface outflow compared to surface infiltration for all types of rainfall scenarios suction head does not demonstrate any noticeable variation in its sensitivity across all types of rainfall scenarios c storage volume fig 5c showed that when it comes to storage volume once again conductivity and vegetation volume are the most influential parameters with their individual contributions of 48 53 and 36 43 respectively together both parameters have 89 90 of contribution towards total model response indicating responsible for major storage volume in all rainfall scenarios the next two parameters are berm height and suction head categorized as influential with their individual contributions of 5 8 and 1 3 respectively following that other remaining five parameters including soil thickness porosity field capacity wilting point and conductivity slope have less than 1 contribution to storage volume together these five parameters only contributed 8 11 in case of high intensity storms the sensitivity indices for storage volume are consistent with the fact that sensitivity of conductivity increases because larger amount of volume is stored during higher storms compared to lower the sensitivity of vegetation volume for higher storms reduces because this design parameter supports retention of water on the surface layer rather than infiltration it is also important to mention that the sensitivity indices pattern of conductivity and vegetation volume are approximately opposite in comparison with surface infiltration for return periods as surface infiltration rate decreases during high intensity storm events leading to a reduction in sensitivity however amount of volume stored during higher storms increases in case of time to peak scenarios both conductivity and vegetation volume showed higher and lower sensitivity respectively consistent with surface infiltration volume results because a significantly larger amount of water infiltrated during earlier storm peak events compared to later because of the availability of unsaturated soil layer resultantly lesser volume of water retained on the surface layer reduces the influence of vegetation volume on storage interestingly the sensitivity of berm height for storage is significantly larger than surface infiltration explaining that berm height should be carefully designed for enhancing the storage capacity of bioretention cells optimal design of berm height can make a significant contribution to the reduction of stormwater load on urban drainage systems by exploiting the maximum storage capacity of bioretention cells placed within a catchment in case of rainfall scenarios the impact of berm height on storage capacity increases during high intensity storm events and no significant variation in its influence was observed for other rainfall scenarios limited variations in sensitivities of other design parameters were observed during storm duration scenarios d peak flow conductivity and vegetation volume demonstrated the highest influence with their individual contribution of 37 52 and 41 46 respectively on peak flow measured at a node located just downstream of bioretention cell for all rainfall scenarios as shown in fig 5d a significant variation in peak flow is influenced by both of these parameters as they collectively contribute 93 99 the next two parameters including berm height and suction head categorized as important as they contribute 5 15 and 1 7 while other remaining two parameters individual contribution to peak flow is less than 1 together these four parameters contribute to total of 1 7 peak flow is one of the main factors that causes overflow of the urban drainage system it is clear from the results that the impact of conductivity on the reduction of peak flow declines during higher storm events because of a gradual decrease in infiltration rate during higher storm events fig 5d in case of time to peak scenarios conductivity showed maximum impact on peak flow reduction during earlier peak storms because the larger amount of water infiltrated during earlier peaks compared to later leading to significant reduction in the surface outflow these results are consistent with surface infiltration surface outflow and storage overall the vegetation volume demonstrated no significant influence on peak flow in all types of rainfall scenarios berm height showed a relatively larger influence on peak flow compared to surface infiltration surface outflow and storage for return periods and time to peak scenarios the sensitivity of berm height clearly illustrates a significant rise from lower to higher and earlier to later peak events and no significant influence on peak flow was observed on duration events considering berm height s impact on peak flow the height of the berm should be carefully determined and decided for controlling the peak of storm events across the urban catchment a carefully designed berm height may significantly play a key role in the de synchronization of different peaks generated from different collection points in the main drainage system of the catchment other parameters showed limited variation in their sensitivity across all types of rainfall scenarios 3 2 assessment of perturbation scale and confidence intervals for vars and sobol methods comparative assessment of vars ivars10 ivars30 and ivars50 and sobol sensitivity indices are conducted with comparison of their 90 confidence intervals demonstrated quantification of uncertainty associated with each sensitivity index estimated by using bootstrapping technique as shown in fig 6 the length of error bars represents magnitude of uncertainty here the parameters are also ranked based on their sensitivity level from higher to lower by left to right in fig 6 overall conductivity and vegetation volume has the highest influence on different model responses such as surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow fig 6 a d under vars and sobol methods however it is important to notice that the magnitude of the parameter s sensitivity significantly changes under different perturbation scales global sensitivity analysis methods and target model responses taking conductivity as an example a significant variation in the magnitude of ivars10 ivars30 and ivars50 can be observed for surface infiltration fig 6a and the magnitude of variation among these indices significantly varies for other model responses i e surface outflow storage and peak flow as shown in fig 6 b d from these results it is inferred that the parameters influence the model response changes with change in their perturbation scale moreover the degree of uncertainty associated with each sensitivity index is also dynamic under different perturbation scales and model responses it is important to note that the confidence intervals of vars indices specifically ivars50 are smaller than sobol s confidence intervals indicating low uncertainty level and higher reliability of ivars results over sobol results the sensitivity of conductivity consistently reduced from smaller scale ivars10 to medium larger scale ivars30 ivars50 for surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow with different magnitudes showing a larger variation in parameter value may reduce its impact on different model responses in accordance with the variation of ivars indices comparing vegetation volume with conductivity a relatively smaller variation among sensitivity indices including ivars10 ivars30 ivars50 and sobol are observed moreover the sensitivity of vars indices for vegetation volume increases for surface infiltration surface outflow and storage as perturbation scale increases however it decreases for peak flow these patterns of ivars results explain that the behavior of parameters for different target outputs is dynamic for different model responses when it comes to considering different perturbation scales for example some parameters can have monotonic behavior i e either only increasing or decreasing for different model responses with respect to different perturbation scales however some can also have dynamic behaviors i e both increasing and decreasing in this study only vegetation volume shows dynamic behavior to different model responses while other influential parameters demonstrated monotonic behaviors 3 3 factors ranking and reliability fig 7 shows the sensitivity indices and associated parameters rankings by using vars and sobol methods for four model responses surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow fig 7 a d respectively the most sensitive parameter is ranked at one while the least sensitive is ranked with the highest value of ranking i e either 6 or 9 the numbering on bars represents rank of parameter and value of normalized ivars50 showed relative contribution of parameter towards total model response here factors are ranked based on sensitivity indices results of three vars indices ivars10 ivars30 and ivars50 and sobol index and both methods ranked parameters at same levels in above mentioned four model responses based on the ranking of parameters it is clear that conductivity or vegetation volume has far larger contributions towards model responses compared to other parameters and they are mostly ranked in first and second place followed by berm height or suction head and the next two parameters are porosity and wiling points the detailed contribution of individual and combined parameters under different rainfall scenarios is explained in section 3 1 2 fig 8 represents reliability estimates of factor ranking of ivars10 ivars30 ivars50 and sobol index for a return period of 20 year return period reliability of factor rankings is estimated by calculating the success rate on the percentage of times among 1000 bootstrap re samplings with consideration of sensitivity ranks of parameters equal to the original rank obtained by the initial sample comparative evaluation of reliability estimates of vars under different perturbation scales and sobol index indicate higher trust in factors ranking on ivars50 and sobol indices in particular ivars50 is considered to be one of the best reliable indices for the calculation of ranking of parameters compared to ivars10 ivars30 and particularly in comparison with the sobol method overall the reliability of parameters ranking of ivars50 is approximately equal to sobol method for surface infiltration fig 8a and storage fig 8c however a significantly higher value of reliability estimates of ivars50 compared to sobol for most of parameters including conductivity and vegetation volume showing higher trust on factor ranking on ivars50 for surface outflow fig 8b and peak flow fig 8d 4 further discussion and implications improved understanding of hydrological dynamics of bioretention cell design parameters is important for better decision making when there is a need to plan model and install bioretention cells at a catchment scale palla gnecco 2015 majority of researchers stormwater modellers drainage engineers and nature based practitioners mostly design bioretention cells or other green infrastructure by using general or given design parameters designing and implementation of green infrastructure without appropriate knowledge of local climate dynamics i e rainfall patterns soil characteristics groundwater table conditions design guidelines and target goals may result in inefficient and inadequate outputs conductivity and vegetation volume proved to be the most influential parameters controlling stormwater infiltration outflow storage and peak flow together both of these parameters have demonstrated their contribution of more than 89 in the above mentioned model responses conductivity depends on types of soil structure and other properties e g filter media depth and the selection of suitable soil for the installation of bioretention cells may not only increase the benefits of conductivity on target goals of green infrastructure but also improve performance of other parameters especially related to soil properties i e porosity wilting point suction head etc because these design parameters are based on soil properties and have strong interactions with each other s leimgruber et al 2018 this analysis is consistent with previous studies where different soil types are analyzed against their impacts on long term hydrological performance of bioretention cells and soil s conductivity between loamy and sandy loam recommended considering appropriate infiltration rate retention effect and vegetation growth for bioretention design meng et al 2014 moreover other previous studies also found conductivity as the most influential parameter for designing bioretention cells chui et al 2016 meng et al 2014 sun et al 2011 and other green infrastructures korgaonkar et al 2020 another most important parameter is vegetation whose suitable type and appropriate density should be designed for improving infiltration and storage outputs and reducing peak flow the next important parameter is berm height which has a significant role in controlling outflow improving storage and reducing peak flow by containing a significant volume of water as ponding on surface of bioretention cell during and after rainfall events chui et al 2016 leimgruber et al 2018 other design parameters showed limited effect on different model responses comparative assessment of vars and sobol methods conclude that vars is preferred over sobol sensitivity analysis method because of its higher accuracy and reliability based on results explained in sections 3 2 and 3 3 it is clear that vars provides more accurate results because of the smaller magnitude of uncertainties associated with vars results compared to sobol indices fig 6 moreover it is important to mention that sobol s total order effects compared here with ivars50 were obtained by vars in addition to comparing the two sa methods the accuracy of sensitivity analysis methods also needs to be discussed considering their numerical implementations as this factor has a significant influence on the efficiency and accuracy of method a recent study becker 2020 evaluated ten numerical implementations i e sampling based and metamodelling approaches of sobol s method utilizing the metafunction approach the findings of the study concluded vars estimator performed more efficiently than other estimators of sobol s total order effects by investigating correct rankings and correct classification of parameters groups as well as sampling errors categorizing vars as an efficient and robust numerical implementation among others however researchers and modellers must identify the most effective method and its numerical implementation to fit their model s characteristics and objective of sensitivity analysis taking into account the setting of their designed experiments and the limitation of applied methods and their numerical implementations furthermore the majority of reliability estimates of factor rankings of vars i e especially ivars50 the most comprehensive index are higher than sobol giving more trust to vars results compared to sobol method our findings on comparative evaluation of both results are consistent with previous studies alipour et al 2022 razavi gupta 2016a b sheikholeslami et al 2017 where they also recognized vars better than sobol or other global sensitivity analysis methods in addition to its accuracy and reliability vars is based on and considers variogram analysis of response surface across the full range of perturbation scales providing a more comprehensive understanding of sensitivity by evaluation of structure of response surface however the sobol method is a variance based approach that accounts for only two specific indices of vars for smaller and larger scales respectively furthermore vars method proves to be more computationally efficient by 1 2 order of magnitude compared to other variance based or derivatives based approaches because in vars information contains in the form of pairs rather than individuals this study expands our horizon on the understanding of hydrological behaviors of design parameters under different design rainfall scenarios and perturbation scales identifying influential parameters their interactions and associated uncertainties and compares the performance and reliability of vars and sobol methods sensitivity analysis results provide sufficient information about influential and non influential design parameters with their impacts on different model responses that can be carefully used to prioritize influential and eliminate non influential parameters during model calibration and optimization shahed behrouz et al 2020 furthermore future research is needed to specify or find certain ranges for calibration within designed factor space of parameters to improve design accuracy of bioretention cell or other green infrastructure and reduce uncertainty associated with design parameters and it will also save time for other modellers and practitioners this research contributes to better understanding of dynamical nature of bc design parameters and their underlying mechanisms under multiple rainfall scenarios with varying intensities storm durations and peaks impact of bc key design parameters significantly changes model responses i e surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow under different rainfall conditions understanding and selecting appropriate design parameters under local climate dynamics and bc design principles may considerably enhance existing design and understanding for increasing its advantages and impacts at the catchment scale moreover sensitivity is a scale dependent phenomenon so quantification of parameters sensitivity under multiple perturbation scales provides more comprehensive information about impact of key design parameters and their underlying process and vars is capable of performing sensitivity analysis of parameters with no extra computational burden however other methods may require additional computational costs for comprehensive sensitivity analysis under multiple perturbation scales and may become infeasible when the considered model system has large design parameters further the contributions and rankings of key design parameters toward total model response are significantly dependent on perturbation scales and performance metrics vars is preferred over the sobol method because of is highly accurate reliable and computationally efficient 5 summary and conclusions in this study two global sensitivity analysis techniques including vars i e variogram based and sobol i e variance based methods are applied and compared for improved understanding of hydrological behaviors of design

1 introduction bioretention cell bc is one of the most typical widely used low impact developments lid employed as a stormwater management solution with respect to quantitative and qualitative stormwater problems bonneau et al 2021 the working principle of bioretention cell is based on the six words thematic concept which is to infiltrate retain store cleanse use and drain urban stormwater for mimicking pre development hydrological conditions of urban catchment by promoting reduction of surface runoff and peak flow and increasing infiltration and storage cleaning of pollutants and pathogens brunetti et al 2016 li et al 2018 li et al 2020 marvin et al 2020 research conducted over the past two decades has comprehensively been involved in the quantification of bc s benefits through performance evaluation of bc in the laboratory bonneau et al 2021 li et al 2020 winston et al 2016 and by different modelling approaches lisenbee et al 2021 raei et al 2019 yang chui 2018b these research studies have proved significant contributions of low impact developments or nature based solutions including bc for sustainable management of stormwater through urban flood control stormwater pollutants control and aesthetic improvements in urban catchment numerous previous research studies also proved bc s successful implementation results in terms of reduction in peak flows and removal of metals and suspended solids debusk wynn 2011 li et al 2016 trowsdale simcock 2011 winston et al 2016 while demonstrating significant variation in the removal of dissolved solids and capturing them as a great challenge fan et al 2019 liu et al 2017 performance of bioretention cell is mainly determined on different factors including its location implementation area to drainage area ratio and bioretention cell design brown et al 2013 skorobogatov et al 2020 zhang chui 2020 a significant number of research studies have been conducted to investigate evaluate and optimize the first two factors e g bc location bc implementation area to drainage area ratio rezaei et al 2021 singh et al 2020 tansar et al 2022 tavakol davani et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b yang chui 2018a zhang et al 2018 however limited attention is paid for improved understanding of variation in outputs i e surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow by changing bc design configurations tirpak et al 2021 design of bioretention cell is based on variations of its size shape media engineering soil underdrain and or surface vegetation with the main goal to improve potential to capture stormwater runoff and treat runoff contaminants skorobogatov et al 2020 a limited number of studies dedicated their efforts to improve understanding about hydrologic dynamics of bioretention cells particularly demonstrating the impact of variation in design parameters on outputs or identification of the most effective combination of materials i e engineering soil media for improvement in surface runoff reduction pollutant concentration reduction or variation of other hydrological parameters such as conductivity porosity residence time and water retention capacity fassman beck et al 2015 kim et al 2018 madrazo uribeetxebarria et al 2021 mei et al 2018 segismundo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 stormwater management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff model being widely utilized by different urban planners engineers and researchers for the planning modelling and optimization of lids such as bioretention cells rossman huber 2016a b apart from modelling and performance evaluation of bc at catchment scale the comprehensive assessment and improved understanding of hydrological dynamics of different design parameters of bc i e at unit scale are significantly important to optimize its design configurations with target goals although research efforts from the early 2000 s have made a significant contribution on the existence quantification and optimization of bc benefits at different installation scales within catchment however there is an apparent knowledge gap to understand underlying hydrological processes its variability contributing factors identification of optimal soil media composition soil plant interaction vegetation type and density presence of underdrain and subsoil conditions li et al 2019 zhang chui 2019 for example an attempt is made to link fundamental hydrological performance of bioretention cell and its design parameters by introducing a new concept of bioretention abstraction volume bav defining the total volume of water stored in soil media pore spaces and depression bowl of bioretention cell davis et al 2012 a sound knowledge of soil water retention parameters and media characteristics including porosity field capacity wilting point and depth of root zone that effectively utilize soil moisture contents are required for determination of bav the findings of this study enabled us to find a relationship between quantitative design and performance information for design optimization of bc that provides tailor made designs for target volume reduction by varying of soil composition vegetation and configuration in addition to this characterization and optimization of soil media properties vegetation density and efficient layout of ponding storage provide sufficient information for understanding overall design of bioretention system lewellyn 2018 despite some research studies have focused on the understanding of bc as a system including korgaonkar et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 but there is still necessary to comprehensively understand and characterize role and hydrological dynamics of different design parameters under various rainfall conditions sensitivity analysis sa can be used as a main tool for understanding and identifying key design parameters with their relative importance on different model responses xing et al 2021 various sensitivity analysis sa methods are broadly categorized into two groups 1 local and 2 global sensitivity analysis methods van griensven et al 2006 chen et al 2020 local sa methods measure how model response varies at a local scale around a single point with variation of uncertain input factors however global sensitivity analysis gsa methods determine behavior of model response with variation of uncertain parameters across the factor space and quantify uncertainties associated with each factor local sa methods include the one factor at a time method czitrom 1999 and the regional sensitivity analysis rsa method hornberger spear 1981 and various global sa methods including the derivative base method morris 1991 the variance based method sobol 1993 and most recently developed variogram based method i e variogram analysis of response surfaces vars framework razavi gupta 2016a b previous research studies on local sensitivity analysis of hydraulic and hydrological models have demonstrated several limitations of local methods gan et al 2014 saltelli annoni 2010 song et al 2015 tang et al 2006 wainwright et al 2014 vars framework highlighted two major challenges in previously developed gsa methods including 1 ambiguous definition of global sensitivity and 2 high computational cost the first challenge demonstrates that different baseline theoretical definitions and philosophies are used for development of different gsa methods leading to different or event conflicting sensitivity results of factors the second challenge explains large computational burden cost i e number of model simulations required to estimate reliable and robust sensitivity analysis results a novel and comprehensive entitled vars framework is developed as unifying theory by providing different gsa methods and theories a common foundation for overcoming above mentioned challenges razavi gupta 2016a b razavi et al 2019 unlike other gsa methods vars characterize spatial structure of response surface of model at local and global scale the directional variograms and covariograms translate spatial structure of response surface in on dimension across the full range of different parameters perturbation scales meles et al 2021 vars also unifies previously developed widely used gsa methods i e derivative base method morris variance base method sobol by developing a theoretical relationship between vars and other derivative variance base methods and enables simultaneous generation of sensitivity indices of both morris and sobol methods together with vars indices using a common set of sample points vars also be considered highly efficient robust providing reliable and stable results with 1 2 order of fewer sample points model simulations compared to other gsa methods because vars is being developed to leverage information contained in pairs of points rather of individual points in this study we will comprehensively evaluate performance of two gsa methods including vars framework and sobol s method and identify key design parameters of bc quantify associated uncertainties with their parameter s rankings and estimation the reliability of their rankings the main contribution of this paper is threefold 1 to improve understanding of sensitivity of key design parameters with their hydrological dynamics under different rainfall conditions 2 to understand parameters behavior towards different model responses across the perturbation scales under both vars and sobol methods and comparative assessment of their associated uncertainties and 3 to rank key design parameters under different model responses and estimation of reliability of their factor rankings 2 methodology 2 1 variogram based sensitivity analysis method vars a novel robust and comprehensive global sensitivity analysis gsa method named variogram analysis of response surfaces vars razavi gupta 2016a b is developed based on an anisotropic variogram concept that characterizes the spatial structure of dependent variables e g model responses across different perturbation scales in multi dimensional parameter space vars uses powerful techniques like variograms to explain how model responses vary spatially and temporally with the variation of one or more sets of factors e g its parameters forcings boundary conditions etc considering a range of parameter perturbation scales razavi gupta 2019 in addition vars also calculates several indices of two commonly applied gsa methods variance based sobol 1993 and derivative based morris 1991 with 1 2 orders of magnitude of computational efficiency vars analysis describes spatial variability and dependency of model response within a domain formed by a set of different factors suppose y represents model response is a function of n parameters θ 1 θ n as shown in eq 1 varies within design factor space predefined by the n dimensional hypercube bounds between the θ 1 min θ n min and θ 1 max θ n max 1 y f θ 1 θ n let h h i h n is a location in the n dimensional factor space and suppose a and b are two points with locations θ a and θ b having a distance vector of h θ a θ b and its multidimensional directional variogram γ h and covariograms c h can be calculated as follows by eqs 2 and 3 2 γ h 1 2 v y θ h y θ 3 c h 1 2 c o v y θ h y θ directional variograms and covariograms are the main building blocks of vars and contain substantial sensitivity information of all design parameters across the full range of perturbation scales h i here h i represents fraction or percentage of factor space for any given parameter i these indices directional variogram and covariograms are calculated at each time step during simulation period in time varying analysis or as an aggregate value in time aggregate sensitivity analysis the directional variogram calculated along one dimension parameter of i th parameter is a one dimensional function γ h i which is equivalent to γ h when h j 0 for all j i directional variograms are defined based on distances between pairs of points along one dimension rather than locations of pairs in the parameter space a set of sensitivity metrics known as ivars integrated variogram across a range of scales is computed by integration of variograms at given perturbation scale h i e g 10 30 or 50 of i th parameter 4 γ h i 0 h i γ h i d h i ivars50 also called total variogram effect when h 50 of factor range is recognized as the most comprehensive vars based global sensitivity index with rich information of model response surface across the full range of perturbation scale computed for sensitivity analysis of bioretention design parameters in this study ivars50 is computed by ensuring that perturbation scale is less than 50 meaning value of h i or h i is 50 for the reliability of variograms otherwise variograms become meaningless the distance between any two pair of points within factor space cannot exceed half of its total range readers are referred to razavi gupta 2016a b 2019 razavi et al 2019

1 1 star based bootstrapping vars framework was originally enabled with a star based bootstrapping technique efron 1992 razavi gupta 2016b to evaluate uncertainties associated with model response surfaces with 90 confidence intervals and also provide parameters reliability showing factors rankings sheikholeslami et al 2019 bootstrapping algorithms use m cross sections for each parameter and randomly perform sampling and replacement of m of the m cross sections for larger number of times e g hundreds or thousands and estimate vars sensitivity metrics in this process parameters remain independent without any interactions and same cross sections are sampled again m times but with different initial points and a given resolution δ h 2 2 variance based sensitivity analysis method sobol the global and model independent sa method known as sobol method saltelli et al 1999 sobol 1990 was developed on variance decomposition concept and enabled to evaluate non linear and non monotonic functions and models the sensitivity of parameters is estimated based on variance decomposition of model response with respect to relative contribution of each parameter and their interactions saltelli et al 2008 saltelli et al 2004 there are two sensitivity indices of sobol method the first order index main effect and the second order index total effect the first order effect estimates how model response changes with individual contribution of each parameter however the second order effect estimates individual contribution to variation in model response and their interactions saltelli et al 2010 the first term of eq 6 named v i demonstrates individual contribution of each parameter i with addition of their respective variance and second term named v ij indicates individual contribution and interactions of parameters like i and j with variance because of combination of both parameters higher ranking indices are also defined with same method as second order indices s ij eq 6 represents total output variance with individual variance of parameters and their interactions as follows 6 v y i 1 k v i i 1 k j i k v ij v 1 2 k where v y represent total variance of output v i denotes first order variance of parameter x i v i v e y x i and interactions of all parameters v ij to v 1 k starting from i 1 to k are calculated by v ij v e y x i x j v i v j the variance of conditional expectation v e y x i explains average residual variance of model response when x i is fixed across full range sometimes known as first order index main effect explaining contribution significance of x i to total variance v y the first order s i second order s ij and total order s ti sensitivity indices are calculated as follows by eqs 7 8 and 9 first order index 7 s i v i y v y second order index 8 s ij v ij y v y total order index 9 s ti 1 v i y v y the first order and second order indices are differentiated based on measure of interactions of i th parameter with other parameters multiple factors boost interaction of one parameter with other parameters such as number of parameters involved in sensitivity analysis their variation ranges and variance based method have better suitability for models functions having large number of parameters vars framework estimates sobol indices total order effect as by products using same sample points generated by star based sampling technique and sample space reducing significant computational time and resources 2 3 numerical implementation of vars framework a new robust and computationally efficient star based sampling strategy is designed for numerical practical implementation of vars framework collectively known as the star vars razavi gupta 2016a firstly star centers n are randomly selected within factor space by using latin hypercube sampling lhs in this study other sampling techniques such as random and progressive latin hypercube sampling plhs sheikholeslami razavi 2017 can also be employed following this the cross sections of evenly spaced sample points based on predefined δ h value are produced based on each n star center along each of parameters within their factor spaces these generated set of points having h values of h 2 δ h a n d 3 δ h of each dimension are extracted and a set of sensitivity indices including directional variogram γ h and covariograms c h and ivars with other gsa indices e g sobol and morris are numerically estimated with no extra computational cost the computational cost of implementing the star vars framework e g number of model simulations is as follows 10 c o m p u t a t i o n a l c o s t n d 1 δ h 1 1 where n d and δ h represent number of star centers number of parameters and perturbation resolution i e shortest space between sets of sample points within factor space 2 4 vars pyswmm setup and working procedure vars toolbox was developed in matlab environment razavi gupta 2019 and externally linked to pyswmm a python wrapper for stormwater management model in this study as shown in fig 1 b a more comprehensive version of the toolbox is recently developed and now is available in python as well vars tool sensitivity analysis package in python fig 1a explained step by step methodology adopted in this study firstly the random sample points are generated in vars using star based sampling technique across full range of factor space and stored in a text file the factor space of bioretention cell parameters is defined according to its design guidelines explained in swmm user and technical manuals rossman huber 2016a b and chinese lid design standards mohrud 2015 secondly a python based script for pyswmm is developed to read design parameters of different layers of bioretention cells in a monte carlo type setting simulated for specified rainfall scenarios and stored model responses in a csv file lastly vars read model responses and generated a set of sensitivity metrics the parameters used in vars algorithm are as follows number of stars n 100 sampling resolution δ h 0 1 perturbation resolution 0 1 0 3 0 5 bootstrap size 1000 and confidence interval 0 90 based on these parameters one trial needs 15 400 model runs total of 17

respectively as shown in fig 2 the shanghai rainstorm idf formula is used to design synthetic rainfall which is widely employed for planning designing and development of local urban water drainage infrastructure shanghai municipal engineering design institute 2003 tansar et al 2022 table 1 represents bioretention cell parameters their short names and range of their factor spaces vars based sensitivity analysis of bioretention design parameters is conducted on a hypothetical catchment of 1 km2 1000 m 2 1000 m 2 fig 3 a with 5 treatment area of total impervious area the conceptual design of bioretention cell in swmm with flux representation of each layer are shown in fig 3b 2 5 bioretention cell modelling in swmm swmm is widely being applied for short term and long term modelling of lids for their performance evaluation as stormwater management strategies against reduction of urban runoff and pollution controls bioretention cell is one of the most widely used lids modelled in swmm for planning analysis design management and optimization according to various placement scenarios i e type location and size swmm models lid controls as an additional object of sub catchments and assigned a specified fraction of its imperviousness area for capturing runoff by using dynamic rainfall runoff process in a computationally efficient manner rossman huber 2016b the conceptual design of bioretention cells in swmm is based on three essential vertical layers i e surface layer soil layer and storage layer and with an optional underdrain layer system placed in gravel storage beds total surface inflow i q 0 receives from direct precipitation i and runoff q 0 drained from other nearby impervious areas on surface layer of bioretention cell first layer the surface inflow either infiltrates f 1 into soil layer second layer or ponding water can evaporate e 1 or excessive ponding water outflows q 1 on berms of bc the soil layer containing engineering soil mixture either evaporates e 2 or percolates into storage layer third layer f 2 of received infiltrated water from surface layer following this process the storage layer based on coarse crushed stores or gravels received percolation from soil layer that either exfiltrate into native soil f 3 evaporates e 3 or directly conveyance to underlying perforated underdrain q 3 system if it is placed total water drained to drainage system is based on surface outflow q 1 and flow drained by underlaying underdrain q 3 swmm made some simplified assumptions for modelling of lids for convenient understanding of physical processes are as follows 1 lid unit has same cross sectional area throughout its all vertical layers 2 the infiltrated water passes through all vertical layers and is one dimensional 3 surface inflow and moisture contents are uniformly distributed over top and soil layers respectively 4 storage layer considers only a simple reservoir for water storage with negligible metric forces within layer under these assumptions the simple mass balance equations eq 11 13 are solved for modelling hydrological performance of lid control including bc as explaining rate of change of water in each vertical layer as difference between inflow and outflow flux described as volume stored per unit area per unit time the mass balance equations of three vertical layers are as follows 11 ϕ 1 d 1 t i q 0 e 1 f 1 q 1 13 d 2 θ 2 t f 1 e 2 f 2 13 ϕ 3 d 3 t f 2 e 3 f 3 q 3 total amount of water q e a n d f that either infiltrates evaporates or is stored in any of these three vertical layers d i a n d θ i is a function of existing water content in any of various layers specific site and soil characterises ϕ i and d i are layer porosities and layer thickness respectively swmm numerically solved these set of coupled equations for each time step to calculate how total inflow hydrograph i q 0 is distributed and converted into surface runoff underdrain outflow q 3 and exfiltration f 3 into underlying native soil surface infiltration f 1 is modelled by using the green ampt eq 14 which is usually applied for saturated conditions developed at top of soil layer residual content or wilting point of dry soil is represented by starting values of θ 20 of dry soil that increases just after rainfall events and decreases during dry periods moreover characteristics of k 2 s ϕ 2 and ψ 2 for bioretention cells amended soil is dependent on nature and properties of soil which can significantly vary infiltration rate in comparison to rest of sub catchment eq 15 represents ponded surface water when exceeds maximum freeboard height d 1 becomes immediate surface outflow rate of percolation flux f 2 from soil to storage layer is modelled in swmm by using darcy s law as represented by eq 16 k 2 s hco and θ fc represent soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity mm s decay constant explains relationship between conductivity and moisture content and soil s field capacity moisture content e q s 17 18 a n d 19 represent evapotranspiration et rate computed for surface soil and storage layers respectively at each time step based on user supplied time series of daily potential et e 0 t the amount of et in each layer is dependent on amount of potential et remaining and water stored in layer θ wp represents user supplied wilting point moisture content exfiltration rate f 3 of storage layer into native soil computed based on depth of stored water and amount of moisture contents of native soil swmm considers user supplied saturated hydraulic conductivity of native soil as exfiltration rate as moisture content of native soil is not known underdrain outflow q 3 is modelled based on simple empirical power as represented by eq 20 certain limits on infiltration percolation flux evapotranspiration rates and outflow rates are imposed to keep moisture levels in each layer within limits of layer s capacity neither to become negative nor exceed further technical and

analysis 3 1 vars based sensitivity indices 3 1 1 directional variograms vars and sobol methods were applied for global sensitivity analysis of bioretention cell design parameters under different rainfall scenarios and reliability of factors ranking evaluated through bootstrapping technique both global sensitivity analysis methods evaluate parameters dynamic behaviors towards different model responses with a range of perturbation scales their impacts and improved understanding of quantification of each parameter s contribution to the total model response surface the perturbation scale h i of the i th parameter decides domain of sensitivity with smaller and larger values of h representing sensitivity of parameter to response surface at a local scale and larger scale respectively under this methodology a variogram γ h i with smaller value shows lower sensitivity of underlying response surface of i th parameter at a specific perturbation scale h i and vice versa for larger value the vars based directional variograms of influential parameters of bioretention cells for different model responses a surface infiltration b surface outflow c storageand d peak flow are represented in fig 4 as an example we selected and showed directional variograms of one rainfall scenario i e 20 year return period other scenarios have similar patterns of variograms total six parameters out of seventeen including conductivity c berm height bh vegetation volume vv suction head sh porosity p and wilting point wp indicated their sensitivities for surface infiltration surface outflow and peak flow and in addition to these parameters soil thickness sot conductivity slope cs and field capacity fc in a total of nine categorized as influential for storage output generally the directional variograms clearly demonstrated that conductivity vegetation volume and berm height are the most influential parameters for four model responses i e surface infiltration surface outflow storage volume and peak flow however other parameters demonstrated lower sensitivity moreover sensitivity is perturbation scale dependent the larger the magnitude of variation across the perturbation scale the most sensitive parameters are otherwise vice versa the lower sensitive parameters showed limited variation in variograms across the perturbation scale showing their smaller influence on model response moreover the directional variograms of two most influential parameters i e conductivity and vegetation volume changed their rankings between perturbation scales of 0 4 and 0 5 as shown in fig 4b and c this behavior is clearly explained by a comprehensive study haghnegahdar razavi 2017 based on three different real case studies and used different metrics to understand perturbation scale phenomena and their impact on parameters sensitivities the findings of the study conclude that sensitivity analysis is scale dependent also the ratio of sensitivities and rankings of parameters are significantly dependent on perturbation scales and performance metrics like our results a large variation in sensitivity analysis results of parameters was observed under different perturbation scales to improve understanding of valuable information on parameters behavior and its underlying processes at different perturbation scales vars is the only scale dependent sensitivity analysis method capable of providing comprehensive information about model sensitivity at multiple perturbation scales with no extra computational burden based on these results it can be learned that a full spectrum of perturbation scales is necessary for accurate factors ranking otherwise consideration of a specific perturbation scale is not reliable alipour et al 2022 also the directional variograms are only reliable and considered for h i is 50 otherwise they lost their meanings as explained in the methodology section 2 1 3 1 2 time aggregate sensitivity index time aggregate sensitivity index was chosen for this study as it is the summary of statistical information of the dynamical behaviors of model responses during the whole simulation period it aggregates sensitivity information of model response for each time step of the overall simulation period vars also provides a time varying sensitivity index in the form of time series representing model behaviors at each time step of the simulation period bioretention cell is mostly designed and placed in urban areas to improve their perviousness with the objective of reduction of increased stormwater runoff and filtering pollutants e g phosphorus nitrogen etc thereby controlling stormwater load quantitatively and qualitatively on site to reduce burden on the urban drainage system the performance of a bioretention cell can significantly vary with its various design configurations and installation locations the replication of a well designed bioretention cell can substantially improve its collective benefits at a catchment scale considering its significance of design configurations and wide usage in urban areas the global sensitivity analysis of bioretention cell parameters is conducted under various design rainfall scenarios e g return period 5 10 20 100 year time of peak e g 0 1 0 4 0 9 storm duration e g 6 7 8 9 10hr as shown in fig 5 the vars based comprehensive sensitivity index ivars50 also called total variogram effect is selected and normalized to indicate relative contribution of each parameter towards model response and variations in dynamic behaviors of parameters across various rainfall scenarios here all parameters are categorized into three classes a parameter having a ratio of sensitivity of more than 10 is classified as very important if it s between 1 and 10 called important and parameters with less than 1 value of sensitivity indices are recognized as less important haghnegahdar et al 2017 rosolem et al 2012 a surface infiltration overall it can be clearly recognized that conductivity and vegetation volume are the most influential parameters followed by berm height and suction head and remaining parameters are less influential for all rainfall scenarios and model responses in case of surface infiltration fig 5a conductivity is by far the most influential parameter contributing 78 89 of total ivars50 across all rainfall scenarios the main reason for higher contribution of this parameter towards surface infiltration is because it controls infiltration rate in soil layer of bioretention cell and can also be partly caused by the interaction of this parameter with performance of other parameters e g vegetation volume berm height and suction head the next most important parameter is vegetation volume which controls and retains surface runoff and improves surface infiltration rate contributing 6 16 of ivars50 across all rainfall scenarios together these two important parameters contribute to a total of 92 95 showing a significant influence on the design configuration of bioretention cells both of these parameters significantly contribute capturing and storing surface runoff providing substantial impact on reduction of surface outflow and peak flow resultantly reducing significant stormwater load on urban drainage systems following this the next two parameters including suction head and berm height with their contribution of 2 6 and 1 3 respectively categorized as important respectively the remaining parameters are classified as less influential as their individual contributions in ivars50 are less than 1 it is worth mentioning that together these four parameters i e suction head berm height porosity and wilting point only contribute 5 8 of ivars50 across all rainfall scenarios in case of rainfall scenarios the sensitivity of conductivity decreases from lower to higher return periods and earlier to later peaks however it increases from shorter to longer storm events in principle conductivity is the main parameter who has major contribution in controlling infiltration rate and resultantly storage in bioretention cells overall total infiltration volume increased from lower to higher return periods however sensitivity of conductivity gradually decreased because of increase in utilization of unsaturated soil media in bioretention cells resultantly the saturated soil media reduces opportunity for incoming surface inflow to infiltrate from surface to soil layer in case of time to peak scenarios the major amount of rainfall received at specific periods i e earlier middle and later of storms likewise return period scenarios the sensitivity of conductivity parameter is higher during earlier storm peaks as larger amount of rainfall can be infiltrated in earlier peak storms because of availability of maximum storage capacity in soil and storage layers however the storage capacity is gradually filled with water infiltrated before storm peak resultantly reducing infiltration rate as storm peak shifts from earlier to later part of storm a reversal effect on sensitivity of conductivity was observed for storm duration scenarios with relatively smaller increase in sensitivity index from shorter to longer storm events compared to return periods and time to peak scenarios the main reason for gradual increase in sensitivity of conductivity for longer storm events may be because of increase in percolation of infiltrated water from soil to storage layers leading to providing infiltration opportunities for incoming water in case of vegetation volume opposite pattern of sensitivity index comparted to conductivity is observed for three types of rainfall scenarios i e return period time to peak and storm duration as the objective of this parameter is to retain runoff on surface of bioretention cell and the capability to retain maximum amount of runoff depends on either two factors 1 increase in intensity of rainfall or 2 reduction in infiltration rate it is clear from surface infiltration results fig 5a that both factors are fulfilled during higher return periods and second factor is fulfilled during later peak and shorter duration storm events in case of berm height the main purpose of this design parameter is to control the stormwater on surface layer until it overflows on the berms of bioretention cell the results of berm height are consistent with vegetation volume for all rainfall scenarios but with relatively lesser magnitude because both design parameters have similar design objectives but berm height has lesser impact on controlling surface runoff compared to vegetation volume moreover the suction head replicates pattern of conductivity results with lesser magnitude for return periods and time to peak scenarios however no significant variation was observed for storm duration scenarios this parameter s higher contribution for shorter and earlier peak storm events is because of unsaturated soil layer conditions b surface outflow conductivity and vegetation volume are the most influential parameters with their individual contribution of 47 54 and 37 44 in ivars50 vegetation volume contributing relatively less than conductivity across all rainfall scenarios as shown in fig 5b together both parameters contribute 90 92 in ivars50 showing significant impact on variation of model response under changing these parameters the next two parameters berm height and suction head contribute 6 8 and 1 3 in ivars50 across all types of rainfall scenarios other remaining parameters including porosity and wilting point contribute less than 1 moreover these four parameters collectively could only make 8 10 contribution to surface outflow in general all parameters represented limited variation in their sensitivity across the different rainfall scenarios both conductivity and vegetation volume showed an approximate opposite similar pattern of results compared to surface infiltration fig 5a during return periods and time to peak scenarios and no variations in their sensitivities were observed during different storm duration events fig 5b it is interesting to note that sensitivity of conductivity increases for surface outflow during higher return periods because infiltration rate increases during high intensity storms followed by exploitation of major storage capacity of bioretention cell and resultantly surface outflow increases however vegetation volume shows reduction in its response during high storms and earlier peak events and no significant variation in its response towards surface outflow is observed for storm duration scenarios interestingly berm height does not show any significant variation in its sensitivity index during time to peak and storm duration scenarios however a gradual increase in its sensitivity index for higher intensity storm events is because larger amount of runoff during higher storms exceeds berm s capacity and overflow from bioretention cell it is important to explain that it indicated relatively higher sensitivity for surface outflow compared to surface infiltration for all types of rainfall scenarios suction head does not demonstrate any noticeable variation in its sensitivity across all types of rainfall scenarios c storage volume fig 5c showed that when it comes to storage volume once again conductivity and vegetation volume are the most influential parameters with their individual contributions of 48 53 and 36 43 respectively together both parameters have 89 90 of contribution towards total model response indicating responsible for major storage volume in all rainfall scenarios the next two parameters are berm height and suction head categorized as influential with their individual contributions of 5 8 and 1 3 respectively following that other remaining five parameters including soil thickness porosity field capacity wilting point and conductivity slope have less than 1 contribution to storage volume together these five parameters only contributed 8 11 in case of high intensity storms the sensitivity indices for storage volume are consistent with the fact that sensitivity of conductivity increases because larger amount of volume is stored during higher storms compared to lower the sensitivity of vegetation volume for higher storms reduces because this design parameter supports retention of water on the surface layer rather than infiltration it is also important to mention that the sensitivity indices pattern of conductivity and vegetation volume are approximately opposite in comparison with surface infiltration for return periods as surface infiltration rate decreases during high intensity storm events leading to a reduction in sensitivity however amount of volume stored during higher storms increases in case of time to peak scenarios both conductivity and vegetation volume showed higher and lower sensitivity respectively consistent with surface infiltration volume results because a significantly larger amount of water infiltrated during earlier storm peak events compared to later because of the availability of unsaturated soil layer resultantly lesser volume of water retained on the surface layer reduces the influence of vegetation volume on storage interestingly the sensitivity of berm height for storage is significantly larger than surface infiltration explaining that berm height should be carefully designed for enhancing the storage capacity of bioretention cells optimal design of berm height can make a significant contribution to the reduction of stormwater load on urban drainage systems by exploiting the maximum storage capacity of bioretention cells placed within a catchment in case of rainfall scenarios the impact of berm height on storage capacity increases during high intensity storm events and no significant variation in its influence was observed for other rainfall scenarios limited variations in sensitivities of other design parameters were observed during storm duration scenarios d peak flow conductivity and vegetation volume demonstrated the highest influence with their individual contribution of 37 52 and 41 46 respectively on peak flow measured at a node located just downstream of bioretention cell for all rainfall scenarios as shown in fig 5d a significant variation in peak flow is influenced by both of these parameters as they collectively contribute 93 99 the next two parameters including berm height and suction head categorized as important as they contribute 5 15 and 1 7 while other remaining two parameters individual contribution to peak flow is less than 1 together these four parameters contribute to total of 1 7 peak flow is one of the main factors that causes overflow of the urban drainage system it is clear from the results that the impact of conductivity on the reduction of peak flow declines during higher storm events because of a gradual decrease in infiltration rate during higher storm events fig 5d in case of time to peak scenarios conductivity showed maximum impact on peak flow reduction during earlier peak storms because the larger amount of water infiltrated during earlier peaks compared to later leading to significant reduction in the surface outflow these results are consistent with surface infiltration surface outflow and storage overall the vegetation volume demonstrated no significant influence on peak flow in all types of rainfall scenarios berm height showed a relatively larger influence on peak flow compared to surface infiltration surface outflow and storage for return periods and time to peak scenarios the sensitivity of berm height clearly illustrates a significant rise from lower to higher and earlier to later peak events and no significant influence on peak flow was observed on duration events considering berm height s impact on peak flow the height of the berm should be carefully determined and decided for controlling the peak of storm events across the urban catchment a carefully designed berm height may significantly play a key role in the de synchronization of different peaks generated from different collection points in the main drainage system of the catchment other parameters showed limited variation in their sensitivity across all types of rainfall scenarios 3 2 assessment of perturbation scale and confidence intervals for vars and sobol methods comparative assessment of vars ivars10 ivars30 and ivars50 and sobol sensitivity indices are conducted with comparison of their 90 confidence intervals demonstrated quantification of uncertainty associated with each sensitivity index estimated by using bootstrapping technique as shown in fig 6 the length of error bars represents magnitude of uncertainty here the parameters are also ranked based on their sensitivity level from higher to lower by left to right in fig 6 overall conductivity and vegetation volume has the highest influence on different model responses such as surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow fig 6 a d under vars and sobol methods however it is important to notice that the magnitude of the parameter s sensitivity significantly changes under different perturbation scales global sensitivity analysis methods and target model responses taking conductivity as an example a significant variation in the magnitude of ivars10 ivars30 and ivars50 can be observed for surface infiltration fig 6a and the magnitude of variation among these indices significantly varies for other model responses i e surface outflow storage and peak flow as shown in fig 6 b d from these results it is inferred that the parameters influence the model response changes with change in their perturbation scale moreover the degree of uncertainty associated with each sensitivity index is also dynamic under different perturbation scales and model responses it is important to note that the confidence intervals of vars indices specifically ivars50 are smaller than sobol s confidence intervals indicating low uncertainty level and higher reliability of ivars results over sobol results the sensitivity of conductivity consistently reduced from smaller scale ivars10 to medium larger scale ivars30 ivars50 for surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow with different magnitudes showing a larger variation in parameter value may reduce its impact on different model responses in accordance with the variation of ivars indices comparing vegetation volume with conductivity a relatively smaller variation among sensitivity indices including ivars10 ivars30 ivars50 and sobol are observed moreover the sensitivity of vars indices for vegetation volume increases for surface infiltration surface outflow and storage as perturbation scale increases however it decreases for peak flow these patterns of ivars results explain that the behavior of parameters for different target outputs is dynamic for different model responses when it comes to considering different perturbation scales for example some parameters can have monotonic behavior i e either only increasing or decreasing for different model responses with respect to different perturbation scales however some can also have dynamic behaviors i e both increasing and decreasing in this study only vegetation volume shows dynamic behavior to different model responses while other influential parameters demonstrated monotonic behaviors 3 3 factors ranking and reliability fig 7 shows the sensitivity indices and associated parameters rankings by using vars and sobol methods for four model responses surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow fig 7 a d respectively the most sensitive parameter is ranked at one while the least sensitive is ranked with the highest value of ranking i e either 6 or 9 the numbering on bars represents rank of parameter and value of normalized ivars50 showed relative contribution of parameter towards total model response here factors are ranked based on sensitivity indices results of three vars indices ivars10 ivars30 and ivars50 and sobol index and both methods ranked parameters at same levels in above mentioned four model responses based on the ranking of parameters it is clear that conductivity or vegetation volume has far larger contributions towards model responses compared to other parameters and they are mostly ranked in first and second place followed by berm height or suction head and the next two parameters are porosity and wiling points the detailed contribution of individual and combined parameters under different rainfall scenarios is explained in section 3 1 2 fig 8 represents reliability estimates of factor ranking of ivars10 ivars30 ivars50 and sobol index for a return period of 20 year return period reliability of factor rankings is estimated by calculating the success rate on the percentage of times among 1000 bootstrap re samplings with consideration of sensitivity ranks of parameters equal to the original rank obtained by the initial sample comparative evaluation of reliability estimates of vars under different perturbation scales and sobol index indicate higher trust in factors ranking on ivars50 and sobol indices in particular ivars50 is considered to be one of the best reliable indices for the calculation of ranking of parameters compared to ivars10 ivars30 and particularly in comparison with the sobol method overall the reliability of parameters ranking of ivars50 is approximately equal to sobol method for surface infiltration fig 8a and storage fig 8c however a significantly higher value of reliability estimates of ivars50 compared to sobol for most of parameters including conductivity and vegetation volume showing higher trust on factor ranking on ivars50 for surface outflow fig 8b and peak flow fig 8d 4 further discussion and implications improved understanding of hydrological dynamics of bioretention cell design parameters is important for better decision making when there is a need to plan model and install bioretention cells at a catchment scale palla gnecco 2015 majority of researchers stormwater modellers drainage engineers and nature based practitioners mostly design bioretention cells or other green infrastructure by using general or given design parameters designing and implementation of green infrastructure without appropriate knowledge of local climate dynamics i e rainfall patterns soil characteristics groundwater table conditions design guidelines and target goals may result in inefficient and inadequate outputs conductivity and vegetation volume proved to be the most influential parameters controlling stormwater infiltration outflow storage and peak flow together both of these parameters have demonstrated their contribution of more than 89 in the above mentioned model responses conductivity depends on types of soil structure and other properties e g filter media depth and the selection of suitable soil for the installation of bioretention cells may not only increase the benefits of conductivity on target goals of green infrastructure but also improve performance of other parameters especially related to soil properties i e porosity wilting point suction head etc because these design parameters are based on soil properties and have strong interactions with each other s leimgruber et al 2018 this analysis is consistent with previous studies where different soil types are analyzed against their impacts on long term hydrological performance of bioretention cells and soil s conductivity between loamy and sandy loam recommended considering appropriate infiltration rate retention effect and vegetation growth for bioretention design meng et al 2014 moreover other previous studies also found conductivity as the most influential parameter for designing bioretention cells chui et al 2016 meng et al 2014 sun et al 2011 and other green infrastructures korgaonkar et al 2020 another most important parameter is vegetation whose suitable type and appropriate density should be designed for improving infiltration and storage outputs and reducing peak flow the next important parameter is berm height which has a significant role in controlling outflow improving storage and reducing peak flow by containing a significant volume of water as ponding on surface of bioretention cell during and after rainfall events chui et al 2016 leimgruber et al 2018 other design parameters showed limited effect on different model responses comparative assessment of vars and sobol methods conclude that vars is preferred over sobol sensitivity analysis method because of its higher accuracy and reliability based on results explained in sections 3 2 and 3 3 it is clear that vars provides more accurate results because of the smaller magnitude of uncertainties associated with vars results compared to sobol indices fig 6 moreover it is important to mention that sobol s total order effects compared here with ivars50 were obtained by vars in addition to comparing the two sa methods the accuracy of sensitivity analysis methods also needs to be discussed considering their numerical implementations as this factor has a significant influence on the efficiency and accuracy of method a recent study becker 2020 evaluated ten numerical implementations i e sampling based and metamodelling approaches of sobol s method utilizing the metafunction approach the findings of the study concluded vars estimator performed more efficiently than other estimators of sobol s total order effects by investigating correct rankings and correct classification of parameters groups as well as sampling errors categorizing vars as an efficient and robust numerical implementation among others however researchers and modellers must identify the most effective method and its numerical implementation to fit their model s characteristics and objective of sensitivity analysis taking into account the setting of their designed experiments and the limitation of applied methods and their numerical implementations furthermore the majority of reliability estimates of factor rankings of vars i e especially ivars50 the most comprehensive index are higher than sobol giving more trust to vars results compared to sobol method our findings on comparative evaluation of both results are consistent with previous studies alipour et al 2022 razavi gupta 2016a b sheikholeslami et al 2017 where they also recognized vars better than sobol or other global sensitivity analysis methods in addition to its accuracy and reliability vars is based on and considers variogram analysis of response surface across the full range of perturbation scales providing a more comprehensive understanding of sensitivity by evaluation of structure of response surface however the sobol method is a variance based approach that accounts for only two specific indices of vars for smaller and larger scales respectively furthermore vars method proves to be more computationally efficient by 1 2 order of magnitude compared to other variance based or derivatives based approaches because in vars information contains in the form of pairs rather than individuals this study expands our horizon on the understanding of hydrological behaviors of design parameters under different design rainfall scenarios and perturbation scales identifying influential parameters their interactions and associated uncertainties and compares the performance and reliability of vars and sobol methods sensitivity analysis results provide sufficient information about influential and non influential design parameters with their impacts on different model responses that can be carefully used to prioritize influential and eliminate non influential parameters during model calibration and optimization shahed behrouz et al 2020 furthermore future research is needed to specify or find certain ranges for calibration within designed factor space of parameters to improve design accuracy of bioretention cell or other green infrastructure and reduce uncertainty associated with design parameters and it will also save time for other modellers and practitioners this research contributes to better understanding of dynamical nature of bc design parameters and their underlying mechanisms under multiple rainfall scenarios with varying intensities storm durations and peaks impact of bc key design parameters significantly changes model responses i e surface infiltration surface outflow storage and peak flow under different rainfall conditions understanding and selecting appropriate design parameters under local climate dynamics and bc design principles may considerably enhance existing design and understanding for increasing its advantages and impacts at the catchment scale moreover sensitivity is a scale dependent phenomenon so quantification of parameters sensitivity under multiple perturbation scales provides more comprehensive information about impact of key design parameters and their underlying process and vars is capable of performing sensitivity analysis of parameters with no extra computational burden however other methods may require additional computational costs for comprehensive sensitivity analysis under multiple perturbation scales and may become infeasible when the considered model system has large design parameters further the contributions and rankings of key design parameters toward total model response are significantly dependent on perturbation scales and performance metrics vars is preferred over the sobol method because of is highly accurate reliable and computationally efficient 5 summary and conclusions in this study two global sensitivity analysis techniques including vars i e variogram based and sobol i e variance based methods are applied and compared for improved understanding of hydrological behaviors of design parameters under different rainfall conditions and impactful recommendations for improving designing and implementation of bioretention cell vars provides unique characteristics for measuring of model response across the range of perturbation scales and investigates impact of perturbation scale on rankings and contributions of parameter sensitivity sobol method provides relative contribution of each parameter and their interactions calculated by variance decomposition concept a set of samples generated by star based sampling technique is used for estimation of sensitivity indices of both methods vars and sobol and uncertainties associated with both methods are quantified by star based bootstrapping technique sensitivity analysis was performed on a hypothetical catchment of 1 km2 covered with 5 of bioretention cell area directional variograms and ivars an integrated sensitivity index with their unique characteristics of studying model response variation with respect to input parameters under different perturbation scales are chosen for investigation of magnitude of importance and rankings of parameters the conclusions drawn from results of both sensitivity analysis methods are as follows 1 six out of seventeenth design parameters including conductivity c berm height bh vegetation volume vv suction head sh porosity p and wilting point wp demonstrated their sensitivities for surface infiltration surface outflow and peak flow and apart from these parameters soil thickness sot conductivity slope cs and field capacity fc in a total of nine showed their significant influences on storage 2 the first two most sensitive parameters are ranked as c and vv followed by bh sh and next two parameters are p and wp and remaining parameters 3 the behavior of

understanding design parameters and its underlying processes are dependent on application of such sensitivity analysis techniques e g vars having capability to study model response surface under multiple perturbation scales with no additional computational burden sensitivity analysis under different perturbation scales of design parameters improves understanding of their dynamical behaviors contributions and rankings 5 the magnitude ratio of factors sensitivities and rankings are dependent on range of design space of parameters 6 the comparative assessment of both global sensitivity analysis methods concludes thatvars is preferred over sobol method i e variance based method because of its higher accuracy reliability and computational efficiency vars enriches with star based sampling strategy that considers information of sample points in the form of pairs rather than single future research is needed to better understand hydrological behavior of bioretention cells for short term and long term rainfalls for improvement in its design and well implementation this knowledge will support improving accuracy in bc design to achieve required target design goals and help

2474,this study is the first attempt to investigate the bias of the sentinel 3 altimetry measurements over rivers resulting from the satellite ground track shift and the associated river slope altimetry based water levels are measured at the so called virtual stations vs which are defined as the area where the satellite pass intersects with a river channel since the ground tracks of the sentinel 3 satellites can shift up to 1km away from the nominal track the calculated heights over vs correspond to different locations on the river however all measurements at a given vs are combined into one time series of water levels assigned to a single reference position because rivers are inclined water bodies the upstream measurements are characterized by a positive bias while the downstream measurements reveal a negative bias in this study we investigate water levels measured at 16 vs of the sentinel 3 satellites located on the middle odra oder river to correct the measurements for the bias we calculate the river slope by employing two separate approaches 1 using in situ water levels referenced to a common vertical datum kronsztadt 86 calculating the slope for each satellite measurement time as well as 2 using the means of water levels from vs calculating the slope once for the entire study period the uncorrected water level anomalies compared to the anomalies from the neighbouring gauges are characterized by a mean root mean square error rmse of 22 cm the correction of water levels utilizing both approaches led to similar outputs and resulted in a statistically significant improvement in mean accuracy by 5 64 cm and 5 74 cm for the gauge based and vs based approaches respectively i e over 25 improvement in mean rmse the percentage improvement varied from 4 99 to 53 23 depending on vs this study confirms the importance of the bias caused by the satellite ground track shift and the associated river slope determines its contribution to the overall altimetry measurement error budget and provides a fully automated approach to correct the time series for the slope effect keywords sentinel 3 altimetry river slope satellite ground track shift odra river 1 introduction according to the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2021 climate change will be manifested not only by an increase in the average temperature but also by the intensification of extreme events such as droughts floods and hurricanes in the face of these changes as well as due to the demographic and economic growth access to freshwater will become more and more difficult haddeland et al 2014 therefore monitoring of inland waters as well as their sustainable management is of great importance however the availability of water level measurements on rivers is decreasing over the recent decades hannah et al 2011 satellite altimetry has a great potential to become an alternative to in situ gauging since it provides regular measurements in almost the entire earth initially developed to observe sea level dynamics e g kosek 2001 leuliette et al 2004 nerem et al 1994 2010 niedzielski and kosek 2009 the climate change initiative coastal sea level team 2020 the altimetric method has also shown potential to monitor inland waters including lakes rivers and wetlands e g cazenave et al 1997 crétaux et al 2009 frappart et al 2006 sulistioadi et al 2015 tourian et al 2016 however there are still a few issues that need to be resolved for satellite altimetry to provide precise fully useable water level measurements of inland waters the main problem in utilizing altimetry measurements on rivers is their spatial and temporal resolution the ground track separation on the equator for the currently operating satellites cryosat 2 sentinel 3 and jason 3 is of 7 5km 104km and 315km while their revisit time is of 369 27 and 10 days respectively further the accuracy of altimetry based water levels of rivers is an order of decimetre e g biancamaria et al 2017 halicki and niedzielski 2022 jiang et al 2020 kittel et al 2021 which is still an order of magnitude lower than the accuracy of gauge measurements altimetry measurements over inland waters are conducted at the so called virtual stations vs which are the intersections of satellite ground tracks with river channels one of the main challenges of inland water observation with altimetry is the proper retracking of the signal returning from the earth surface due to the contribution of land contamination to the returned waveforms gao et al 2019 numerous retrackers were developed and validated over inland waters in order to properly detect the reflection from water surface as well as to mitigate the contamination of the signal due to its reflection from land jarihani et al 2013 studied multiple satellite altimetry data processed with various retrackers over some of the australian lakes and rivers those authors confirmed the general usefulness of this technique in hydrological applications the performance of several retrackers was studied on a basis of sentinel 3a altimetry over the brahmaputra river by huang et al 2019 who thoroughly investigated their performance over river sections located on high altitudes with complex terrain significant improvement in data quality was brought by the development of the synthetic aperture radar sar mode which reduced the along track resolution from 1 64km to 300m nielsen et al 2017 due to this change the returning waveform is less affected by land contamination further smaller water bodies can now be sensed by the altimeter quartly et al 2020 another improvement of altimetry products over rivers and lakes came with the development of the open loop mode which due to the a priori information about the surface topography enables controlling the range window position of the altimeter this leads to a significant increase in the number of vs for satellites operating in this mode le gac et al 2021 despite the above mentioned progress in altimetry over inland waters there are still numerous factors affecting its accuracy initially altimetry measurements of river stages were constrained by a minimum river width of 1km birkett 1998 along with the technological development of altimetry the minimum river width decreased below 100 m and currently it is not a factor limiting the measurements santos da silva et al 2010 a thorough investigation of such factors was conducted by maillard et al 2015 who studied the envisat and saral altimetry over the são francisco river those authors identified three factors which may affect the altimetric measurement 1 land cover along the satellite ground track near the river 2 river channel morphology width direction and shape and 3 land topography near the river channel the influence of the two first factors was also studied by halicki and niedzielski 2022 who investigated the sentinel 3a altimetry water levels over polish rivers the authors found no influence of the river width and land cover on the accuracy of altimetric measurements however the complex river channel morphology the presence of sandbars etc and the unfavourable geographical setting of the vs i e the river channel parallel to the satellite ground track or multiple crossings of the river channel by the satellite ground track occurred more often on vs characterized by lower accuracy due to orbit perturbations the satellite ground tracks do never perfectly superimpose for example the ground track deviation of the sentinel 3 satellites is of 1km https sentinels copernicus eu web sentinel missions sentinel 3 satellite description orbit accessed on 13 04 2022 however altimetric measurements on rivers from a given vs are usually combined into one time series assuming that they were all taken over the same river outlet cross section in a specific geographical situation i e when a river channel is aligned almost parallelly to the satellite ground track a shift of 1km might result in water level measurements taken several kilometres upstream or downstream the nominal vs fig 1 since rivers slope towards the mouth altimetry based water levels measured away from the central position of vs are characterized by bias negative for downstream and positive for upstream passes fig 2 the effect of the satellite ground track shift and the river slope on the river altimetry observations hereinafter referred to as river altimetry slope bias was already noticed in the 90s birkett 1998 koblinsky et al 1993 for that time the problem of the river altimetry slope bias could not be solved since gradients across wetland and river basins are poorly known and the altimetry itself can only provide along track gradients birkett 1998 further koblinsky et al 1993 and birkett 1998 focused mainly on the amazon river which in most of its parts has a gentle slope of several centimetres per kilometre e g birkett et al 2002 therefore the river altimetry slope bias appears to be of minor importance to the best of authors knowledge the first study to suggest and apply a correction for the bias described above was the work of santos da silva et al 2010 who studied the ers 2 and envisat altimetry over the amazon basin the authors applied a correction by manually entering a slope value and correcting for the height difference between the mean location of the pass and the location retained for the virtual station the correction for most of the altimetry time series was characterized as a second order correction also boergens et al 2016 identified the river altimetry slope bias the authors corrected the envisat measurements over the mekong river by using the river slope described in literature however due to the lack of gradient values of the mekong river tributaries that correction was applied only to the main stream also in that work the improvement in the accuracy was called a secondary correction both santos da silva et al 2010 and boergens et al 2016 described the correction to be of second order however their studies employed altimetry data of the ers 2 and envisat satellites which operate in the low resolution mode lrm the footprint size of altimetric measurements carried out by these satellites is larger than one kilometre the new altimetry missions sentinel 3a 3b and cryosat 2 are equipped with the sar altimeters the along track resolution of which is only 300m further the sentinel 3 satellites operate in the open loop mode therefore it would be recommended to study the river altimetry slope bias based on the new altimeter data which is characterized by a higher accuracy than the ers 2 and envisat missions it is also to be mentioned that both of the previously described approaches used a priori information about the river slope which is indispensable for the calculation of the vertical difference however the gradient of a given river section can be now calculated with the use of altimetry data such calculations were performed in the amazon river using topex poseidon altimetry birkett et al 2002 and using icesat laser altimetry over the kongo river o loughlin et al 2013 the altimetry based river slope was also calculated by garambois et al 2017 and bjerklie et al 2018 for the purpose of hydrological modelling altimetry based gradient calculations were also conducted to unify or compare water levels of different vs or in situ stations e g hall et al 2012 schneider et al 2018 tourian et al 2016 villadsen et al 2015 xiang et al 2021 in our study we aim to thoroughly analyse the river altimetry slope bias we consider 16 vs of the sentinel 3 satellites located on the middle odra oder river hereinafter abbreviated as odra river we also propose a correction based on the distance between each measurement and the reference position of a vs as well as on the river slope of a given river section the gradient value will be calculated in two separate approaches 1 using water levels from neighbouring gauges which will result in the river slope value at each time of the satellite pass as well as 2 using means of water levels at vs the gauge based slope will serve as a reference since in situ readings are of very high quality using the up to date slope we will determine the contribution of the river altimetry slope bias to the overall budget of the altimetric measurement error the second approach will be performed using one river slope value fixed for the whole study period for a given river section we argue that water level time series corrected for the river altimetry slope bias will be characterized by a lower root mean square errors rmse than the uncorrected measurements the novelty of this study resides in correcting the highly accurate sentinel 3 measurements which since operating in the sar mode are characterized by a small along track resolution further we propose a fully automatic approach that allows to calculate corrections based only on satellite data without the need to use manually entered slopes santos da silva et al 2010 or slopes previously presented in the literature boergens et al 2016 our solution can be used operationally as it does not require any a priori data 2 study area odra is poland s second longest river with length of 854km it has its headwaters in czechia in the sudetes mountains but it predominantly flows through the territory of western poland odra is usually divided into the upper odra upstream from the kędzierzyn koźle city the middle odra between the kędzierzyn koźle city and the mouth of the warta river and the lower odra downstream the mouth of the warta river in its upper part odra is a narrow mountainous river on the contrary on its lower part the river is almost flat with slope values varying from 0 05m km to 0 001m km dubicki et al 2005 the upper part of the middle odra is channelled and regulated by numerous hydraulic structures considering the above described river characteristics as well as the availability of gauge and altimetry measurements the study area has been limited to the middle odra section between the ścinawa and kostrzyn nad odrą gauges fig 3 which is free of water damming structures and its slope ranges from 0 19m km to 0 28m km dubicki et al 2005 the study area can be characterized as a lowland with altitudes below 300m a s l gently sloping towards the nw direction four main tributaries along the studied reach are warta nysa łużycka bóbr and barycz with length of 795km 246km 278km and 136km respectively following the river classification based on width meybeck et al 1996 most of the middle odra river can be classified as a small river 40 200m in width the regime can be classified as nival moderately developed wrzesiński 2017 this implies that the average flow in the spring month is 130 180 of the average annual flow which is driven by snow thawing the channel of the middle odra river has undergone numerous regulations during the last two centuries kreft and parzonka 2007 in particular the river section considered in this study is characterized by the occurrence of stony groins on both sides of the channel 3 data 3 1 altimetric data sentinel 3 is an earth observation satellite mission developed by the european space agency designed to monitor open oceans as well as coastal areas and inland waters fletcher 2012 currently two satellites operate under this mission namely sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b launched in february 2016 and april 2018 respectively both operate on a sun synchronous orbit the height of which is of 814 5km the ground tracks of this constellation of satellites are spaced 52km at the equator and the repeat cycle is of 27 days one of the instruments carried by these satellites is the synthetic aperture radar altimeter sral which uses the ku band and c band frequencies it operates in the sar mode between 60 n and 60 s considering the on board tracking mode of sentinel 3 both satellites operate in the open loop mode in this study we use the non time critical ntc sentinel 3 data provided by the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat through the copernicus online data access coda https www eumetsat int coda accessed on 13 04 2022 service based on the sentinel 3 data we derived water level time series for 16 vs located on the middle odra river fig 3 11 of which are vs of the sentinel 3a and 5 of them are sentinel 3b vs table 1 the mean distance between the compared stations is of 12 53km and it ranges from 1 88km to 28 56km the river width at the studied vs measured on a basis of google earth imagery ranges from 105 to 215m with a mean of 145m 3 2 in situ data the gauge network consists of 9 in situ stations fig 3 located closer than 30km from the vs table 1 water levels from these gauges are used for two purposes to assess the accuracy of satellite measurements as well as to calculate the river slope of a given section readings from the kostrzyn nad odrą gauge are used only for the slope calculation since it is not the nearest gauge to any vs the water levels are operationally measured by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute instytut meteorologii i gospodarki wodnej państwowy instytut badawczy imgw pib and provided with a time step of 1 h the time span of in situ data ranges from april 2016 to august 2021 imgw pib provided also the gauge zero heights referenced to the kronsztadt 86 vertical datum these values are crucial for the gauge based slope calculation see section 4 2 1 in total in situ data gaps while satellite passes over vs occur in 25 situations out of 969 considered however in situ data is missing 49 times when trying to calculate the gauge based slope value since for this calculation stages from both neighbouring gauges are indispensable see section 4 2 1 all in all this is still a very low number of missing data and we do not conduct any gap interpolation for this study 4 methods 4 1 water level time series from satellite altimetry the methodology for the estimation of water level time series for 16 vs using sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b is based on the dahiti approach described in schwatke et al 2015 this approach is based on an extended outlier rejection applied retracking and a kalman filter step however for this study we added a new outlier criteria based on river centrelines taken from the swot river database sword altenau et al 2021 the sword centrelines are used to estimate the exact river crossings of each altimeter track which are later used for the river slope correction additionally a new outlier criteria is applied rejecting all altimeter measurements which are further away than 500m from the river crossings based on the remaining altimeter measurements and the dahiti approach are water level time series for 16 vs computed the water levels are given normal heights all water level time series are freely available on the dahiti webportal https dahiti dgfi tum de accessed on 13 04 2022 4 2 slope calculation 4 2 1 gauge based approach calculation of the river slope in the gauge based approach is conducted on a basis of in situ measurements gauge zeros and water levels above gauge zero for each satellite pass water levels from the upstream and the downstream adjacent gauges are juxtaposed as mentioned in section 3 2 in 49 situations there is a data gap at one of the gauges in such case we decided to compare heights from up to 24 h before or after the altimetric measurement however the compared water levels need to refer to the same time for example in case of data gaps at time t 0 we look for water surface elevations wse at t 1 h for both gauges then for the wse at t 1 h and so on up to 24 h due to this operation the calculation of the river slope is impossible only in 20 situations finally the river slope at each of the satellite passes is calculated as follows 1 g a u g e b a s e d s l o p e m km h u z u h d z d d where h u h d are the upstream and downstream water levels above gauge zero m z u z d are the upstream and downstream gauge zeros m and d is the along river distance between gauges km the result of this calculation is the mean river slope on the river section between neighbouring gauges 4 2 2 vs based approach as mentioned in the introduction the river slope calculation is now possible with the use of altimetry data the gradient can be determined if the vertical difference and the along river distance between the vs are known one of the approaches for estimating the vertical difference resides in subtracting the means of heights from two adjacent vs e g tourian et al 2016 a modified approach was presented by o loughlin et al 2013 who calculated the mean heights of selected months another approach is a subtraction of water levels from neighbouring gauges conducted at each measurement epoch which was applied in the work of garambois et al 2017 and bjerklie et al 2018 this allows a unique slope estimation for each satellite pass on contrary villadsen et al 2015 and xiang et al 2021 did not calculate the slope directly but they rather interpolated heights on different locations on the river the interpolation was a function of the distance from a given location to the river mouth or any established point on the river the parameters of which were calculated on a basis of water levels from all vs of a studied river section usually the neighbouring vs are not being observed by the satellite at the same time therefore there should be a maximum time difference between vs which are chosen for the slope calculation hall et al 2012 used only those vs pairs the measurements of which are maximally one day apart on the contrary o loughlin et al 2013 defined the threshold to be of 2 days in our study the time shift between observations on vs of one satellite sentinel 3a or sentinel 3b located on neighbouring parallel ground tracks is of 4 days although the distance between them is 104km at the equator fig 4 however in case of multiple crossing of a satellite ground track and a river channel some vs can be observed almost simultaneously within several seconds therefore they form an excellent basis for slope calculation the time shifts between measurements on neighbouring vs of two different satellites or between readings from adjacent vs located on non parallel tracks are not stable fig 4 therefore before using such pairs for the slope calculation the actual time shift should be verified considering the above mentioned time delays between vs measurements as well as knowing the accuracy of altimetry based wse on rivers of an order of decimetre we do not calculate the river slope at each measurement time for a river section between two vs one slope value is estimated using the vertical difference between those stations calculated on a basis of mean wse values see eq 2 the river slope is calculated between vs the measurements of which are maximally 4 days apart so the neighbouring parallel passes are included the slope of such river section is calculated as follows 2 v s b a s e d s l o p e m km h u h d d where h u h d are the upstream and downstream means of vs water levels m and d is the along river distance between vs km this value represents the slope of the river section between the two vs 4 3 distance calculation and water levels correction the second essential value for the proposed correction is the distance from the altimetric measurement to the vs reference position in this study we used the river centreline from the map of the hydrographic division of poland mapa podziału hydrograficznego polski in most cases the satellite track crossed the river at each of its passes for such situations the altimetric measurement location is defined as the intersection between the river line and the current satellite pass however on several vs in some cases the satellite did not pass exactly over the river in these situations the off nadir correction is applied boergens et al 2016 and the measurement location is defined as the point on the river located closest to the current satellite pass finally the distance is being determined as the length of the river section between the current altimetric measurement and the reference position of the vs having established the river slope and the distance from the reference it is possible to calculate the corrected water levels which is conducted as follows 3 c o r r e c t e d w s e w s e r s d where w s e is the water surface elevation on a vs m r s is the river slope m km and d is the along river distance from the current altimetry measurement to the reference position of the vs km the value of the correction is subtracted from wse since the distance value is set a positive number for measurements upstream and as a negative number for measurements downstream the reference position therefore if the satellite passes downstream the reference position the measurement is likely to be underestimated therefore the shift should increase wse on the other hand for measurements taken upstream the reference position the correction should lower wse as it is likely to be overestimated fig 5 presents the workflow of data processing carried out in this study after retrieving sentinel 3a 3b ntc data from eumetsat this data is being processed and corrected in the modified dahiti approach these water levels are then corrected for the measurements non stationarity with the use of the gauge based slope calculated for each measurement time separately and the vs based slope calculated once for the entire study area finally all three time series uncorrected corrected with gauge based slope approach 1 and corrected with vs based slope approach 2 are compared with wse from the adjacent gauges the comparison is conducted taking into account the time lag between the compared stations which is thoroughly described in halicki and niedzielski 2022 4 4 statistical methods to check if errors of the estimated water levels are reduced as a result of applying slope corrections along the lines of the approach 1 and 2 numerous statistical tests are employed three data sets are analysed 1 rmse at 16 vs before correction 2 rmse at 16 vs after correction based on the approach 1 and 3 rmse at 16 vs after correction based on the approach 2 to evaluate the significance of the above mentioned reduction in rmse two pairs of data sets are considered 1 uncorrected data vs corrected data using approach 1 2 uncorrected data vs corrected data using approach 2 the welch two sample student s t test is utilized in which the null hypothesis of equal means of rmse in two samples is tested against the one sided alternative that mean rmse of the corrected water level is significantly lower than mean rmse of the uncorrected river stages the choice of the two sample student s t test is due to its considerable power to carry out the statistical inference using the two sample student s t test numerous assumptions must be fulfilled 1 each of three data sets must be internally statistically independent 2 each of three data sets must be normally distributed 3 variances of data sets juxtaposed in the aforementioned pairs must be equal first the hypothesis of independence within each data set is verified using the ljung box test ljung and box 1978 second the normality hypothesis is checked using the shapiro wilk test royston 1995 third the f test for comparing variances of normally distributed samples is used 5 results since rivers are water bodies characterized by an inclined water surface and the satellite ground track can shift up to one kilometre towards both sides the altimetric measurements are subject to be biased this can be observed in fig 6 which presents the amount of bias of every altimetry measurement at all studied vs the bias is calculated as the difference between the altimetry based water level anomaly compared to the corresponding water level anomaly from the neighbouring gauge each subfigure shows the river the nominal ground track the reference position of the vs and the altimetric measurement locations see section 4 3 the colour of which depends on the bias size the subfigures present also the arrows which show the flow direction on almost every vs the bias of measurements conducted downstream the reference position is negative which suggests an underestimation of wse the opposite effect occurs for measurements conducted upstream the reference position fig 6 the only vs for which this trend is ambiguous is vs 13659 it is also worth noting that the geographical setting of the vs determines the maximum distances between the measurements and the reference position if the satellite pass is quite parallel to the river channel e g vs 18753 vs 23410 the furthest measurements might be even 2 3 km away from the reference position for such points the bias may exceed 0 5 m fig 6 allows also for the identification of vs with measurements taken not exactly over the river channel vs 18752 and vs 38366 for these measurements we apply the off nadir correction boergens et al 2016 the river slope did not undergo significant changes during the study period considering the 6 year period and all the studied river sections the river slope values calculated with the gauge based approach ranged from 0 24 to 0 30 m km table 2 the mean values of the slope ranged from 0 26 to 0 29 m km this confirms that the river slope along the middle odra river is stable interestingly the vs based approach reveals very similiar slopes the values range from 0 26 to 0 28 m km and they do not differ from the gauge based mean slope values by more than 0 02 m km this proves the high efficiency of this method which is based only on satellite data however it has to be mentioned that the slope values are calculated for river sections with lengths varying from 15 315km to 59 645km for the gauge approach and from 10 07km to 86 361km for the vs approach this method would not be applicable on river sections where waterfalls or dams occur the accuracy of three wse time series are presented in table 3 the rmse of the uncorrected wse ranges from 14 cm to 34 cm with mean of 22 cm almost half of studied vs 7 out of 16 are characterized by rmse lower than 20 cm after applying the correction using the gauge based slope the mean rmse amounts to 16 cm which is a reduction of 25 46 only in one situation the applied correction does not improve the accuracy vs 13659 the decrease is of 0 4 cm which is 2 26 of the primary accuracy for other vs the improvement ranges from 0 7 cm to 13 4 cm while the improvement percentages vary from 4 99 to 53 23 the lowest rmse is of 9 cm vs 13660 while the highest rmse occurs for vs 23408 31 cm interestingly the correction using the vs based slope results in a very similiar improvement the mean rmse is even 0 1 cm lower than the rmse of wse calculated using the approach 1 the maximum difference between those two approaches is of 0 7 cm which is only 6 02 difference however the mean difference between these time series is of 0 64 therefore both approaches seem to have a very similiar high efficiency in order to check if the reduction in rmse of water level determination attained as a result of applying corrections known as the approaches 1 and 2 is statistically significant the welch two sample student s t test has been utilized the rmse values juxtaposed in table 3 have been paired uncorrected data vs corrected using approach 1 uncorrected data vs corrected using approach 2 to check if there is a statistically significant reduction in mean rmse in all statistical tests the significance level of 0 05 has been assumed table 4 shows that p values of the above mentioned test with the one sided alternative which says that after the correction mean rmse is lower than before the correction are of 0 0061 and 0 0054 for approach 1 and 2 respectively it means that at the pre assumed significance level the difference between rmse averages is statistically significant the one sided two sample student s t test is powerful i e in our case 16 elements in each group significance level of 0 05 standard deviation of approximately 6 difference in means of approximately 5 5 its power is of approximately 0 81 it legitimates the inference based on only 16 elements in each group to perform the two sample student s t test appropriately a number of assumptions must be fulfilled see section 4 4 it is apparent from table 4 that all the investigated rmse data are internally independent as inferred on a basis of the ljung box test and the associated high p values exceeding 0 4 also the shapiro wilk test suggests that it is impossible to reject the null hypothesis of normality at the pre defined significance level p values are greater than 0 08 therefore three data tests each representing 16 rmse values obtained using or not different slope correction approaches are highly likely to follow the normal samples which is needed to apply the two sample student s t test properly in addition variances in groups uncorrected data vs corrected data with approach 1 as well as uncorrected data vs corrected data with approach 2 do not vary significantly that is confirmed by the f test the p values of which exceed 0 7 thus the assumptions required for the two sample student s t test to be used are met the statistical independence quantified by the ljung box test show that neither the accuracy of the uncorrected wse time series nor the correction improvement do not show any spatial dependencies the lack of dependency is also apparent from fig 7 interestingly the only vs with a decrease in accuracy vs 13659 is the most downstream located site on the other hand the two vs located in the vicinity of this vs are characterized by an increase of accuracy greater than 30 fig 7 shows that the improvement in the accuracy after applying the approach 1 and approach 2 correction is very similiar the only tributary which flows into the odra river on a section between a vs and an in situ station is the barycz river the two vs located on this section are vs 18754 and vs 23409 but despite this tributary wse time series from both vs correspond well with the wse time series from the głogów gauge due to the correction of the river altimetry slope bias the corrected wse anomalies from almost all vs correspond better to the water level anomalies from the neighbouring gauges than the uncorrected wse the correspondence with daily averages of gauge water levels is presented in fig 8 as example we present data from two vs one vs of the sentinel 3a fig 8a and one vs of the sentinel 3b satellite fig 8b although in some cases the correction increases the difference between altimetry and gauge data in most cases the correction moves the water levels closer to the gauge values considering the presented graphs the correction improves the accuracy both during low and high water periods all graphs showing the corrected in the approach 1 heights uncorrected heights and daily averages of gauge water level anomalies are presented in the supplementary material fig s1 6 discussion determination of the river slope is a key point in the proposed river altimetry slope bias correction since for the studied river section the accurate gauge readings are referenced to a common vertical datum kronsztadt 86 it was possible to calculate the river slope at each section for every time of the satellite observation however this approach cannot be applied for numerous rivers with missing in situ measurements therefore it is essential to propose an alternative for the river slope calculation this problem can be solved by calculating river gradients using altimetry measurements that cover most of the globe and are publicly available further this approach proved its accuracy in numerous studies e g garambois et al 2017 schneider et al 2018 villadsen et al 2015 in our study we calculated one slope value for each river section which was based on the difference between mean height values of the vs the same approach was applied by tourian et al 2016 also santos da silva et al 2010 used this method however only on crossovers of two satellite ground tracks since satellites pass over the virtual stations on different days we decided to calculate the river slope on a basis of vs with measurements maximally 4 days apart we choose this threshold because this is the time difference between two neighbouring either ascending or descending passes of a satellite sentinel 3a or sentinel 3b on the contrary hall et al 2012 compared vs with measurements maximally two days apart and o loughlin et al 2013 maximally one day apart however these authors used data from different altimetric missions the slope values of river sections of the middle odra river obtained in the vs based approach agree well with mean slopes calculated with the gauge readings the maximum difference between the mean slopes for a given vs is of 0 02m km it is also worth noting that the mean gradient ranges 0 26 0 29 and 0 26 0 28m km for the gauge based and vs based approaches respectively agree with the slope range of the middle odra river 0 19 0 28 m km presented by dubicki et al 2005 an evaluation of the vs based approach for the river slope calculation was also performed by bjerklie et al 2018 who used jason 2 altimetry over the yukon river the authors estimated the slope separately for each satellite measurement time to verify the obtained gradients the authors compared them with slopes calculated with the use of laser altimetry from the icesat mission as well as with values presented in the literature both comparisons confirmed the high accuracy of this approach although these approaches show promising results it is to be mentioned that the slope values refer sometimes to river sections with length of several dozens of kilometres in our study the longest section was of 86 36km the longer the section is the greater the generalization of the obtained slope becomes also this approach would not be applicable on river sections with dams or waterfalls as the slope is not constant along these sections the wse values at vs of the sentinel 3 satellites on the middle odra river calculated with the modified dahiti approach are characterized by high accuracy the mean rmse of vs water level anomalies compared with anomalies from the neighbouring gauges is of 22 cm which is comparable with the mean rmse for the corresponding vs from the hydroweb database which were studied by halicki and niedzielski 2022 comparing 9 vs of the sentinel 3a satellite considered in both studies the mean rmse is of 22 cm and 20 cm for the dahiti and hydroweb water levels respectively both results show the high quality of sentinel 3 data and they are comparable to other studies which assessed the sentinel 3 accuracy over rivers see table 5 in the paper by halicki and niedzielski 2022 to the best of our knowledge the only two studies to apply a correction of the river altimetry slope bias are the works of boergens et al 2016 and santos da silva et al 2010 both authors describe the improvement in accuracy to be of several centimetres in the mean rmse although this is a value comparable with the mean improvement obtained in our work 5 64 cm and 5 74 cm for the approach 1 and approach 2 respectively there are several differences which have to be mentioned first of all both authors used a priori data for the river slope borrowed from literature therefore their approaches are not applicable along ungauged rivers further these studies used envisat and ers 2 altimeters operating in the lrm mode which are characterized by a significantly larger footprint than the sentinel 3 altimeter operating in sar mode therefore the accuracy of water levels estimated by these altimeters vary significantly both boergens et al 2016 and santos da silva et al 2010 obtained rmse values ranging from decimetres up to several metres therefore an improvement in the accuracy of a few centimetres did not seem as a key correction on contrary due to the development of the sar altimeters and the open loop mode the accuracy of the sentinel 3 river altimetry can be of 20 40 cm in rmse e g bogning et al 2018 halicki and niedzielski 2022 kittel et al 2021 zaidi et al 2021 therefore in our study the correction by more than 5 centimetres represents more than 25 of rmse and for some of the vs the improvement was about 50 the research in this study was carried out on the middle odra river with slopes varying from 0 24m km to 0 30m km the proposed correction strongly depends on this value so it will certainly be smaller on rivers characterized by a more gentle gradient for example the slope of most of the amazon river is only of 0 01 0 04m km e g birkett et al 2002 however there are many stretches of rivers that are wide enough to be monitored by satellites but also located in mountainous areas it is in these rivers that first of all the correction suggested in this study should be applied as the slope of these rivers is much greater which increases the river altimetry slope bias the occurrence of the river altimetry slope bias is clearly visible in fig 9a taking into account all of the altimetric measurements the bias clearly correlates with the distance from a measurement to the reference position the pearson correlation coefficient between the biases before correction and the distances from the reference position is of 0 65 which is a strong and statistically significant correlation at the significance level of 0 05 after applying the gauge based correction the biases are deprived of a clear trend fig 9b and they do not correlate to the distance from the reference position the pearson correlation coefficient is weak and equal to 0 16 the occurrence of the river altimetry slope bias is also confirmed by the slope of the regression line presented in fig 9a for the uncorrected data the slope is of 0 218m km after applying the correction the slope of the regression line is reduced to 0 041m km this can suggest even a slight overcorrection of the river altimetry slope bias however this bias is not the only source of the altimetry error therefore no inference should be made on a basis of such small correlation coefficient 0 16 and the associated slope of the regression line 0 041m km in conclusion since both approaches proposed in this study showed a very similiar performance it can be stated that both allow for the elimination of the river altimetry slope bias 7 conclusions due to orbit perturbations satellite ground tracks do never perfectly superimpose since rivers are inclined water bodies a non exact location of water level measurements might lead to certain bias in previous altimetry missions the bias was often overlooked because there were factors that contributed to the measurement budget error on a much larger scale the sentinel 3 satellites are equipped with the sar radar altimeter and operate in the open loop mode therefore they provide water level elevations of rivers the accuracy of which is in the order of decimetres in this study we aimed to assess the contribution of the river altimetry slope bias to the overall altimetry measurement error budget as well as to propose a fully automated approach that allows to calculate corrections based only on satellite data we studied water levels from 16 vs of the sentinel 3 satellites located on the middle odra river and calculated in the modified dahiti approach the accuracy was determined by comparing the water level anomalies from the vs with anomalies from the neighbouring gauges the contribution to the overall error budget was estimated using in situ measurements which allowed for an individual slope determination for each satellite measurement the second approach was based on river gradients estimated on a basis of the mean heights of vs the following conclusions can be drawn rmse of the uncorrected water level anomalies are characterized by a mean value of 22 cm ranging from 14 cm to 34 cm the river slope calculation with the use of satellite data provided accurate values almost identical to those calculated with the in situ data the correction with the gauge based slope allowed for a mean reduction in rmse by 5 64 cm which is an improvement of about 25 the correction with the vs based slope performed very similarly reducing rmse by 5 74 cm the decrease in rmse for the 16 vs is statistically significant for both approaches only on one vs the correction resulted in a slight decrease of accuracy less than 1 cm in the remaining stations the improvement ranged from 0 7 cm to 13 4 cm which stands for a percentage from 4 99 to 53 23 the findings of this study confirm that applying the correction of the river altimetry slope bias can lead to a significant improvement in accuracy this correction is suggested especially for 1 altimetry observations carried out in the sar mode since they are characterized by a small along track resolution and high accuracy and for 2 altimetry observations over mountainous rivers where the measurement biases should be greater due to the higher river gradients however it has to be mentioned that the proposed approach is only applicable to river sections without dams or waterfalls since they disallow a proper river slope determination the problem in question might soon be resolved with the launch of the surface water and ocean topography swot mission thanks to the wide swath technology the mission is planned to provide accurate river slope values which could serve the purpose of the correction of the river altimetry slope bias credit authorship contribution statement michał halicki conceived the study

2474,this study is the first attempt to investigate the bias of the sentinel 3 altimetry measurements over rivers resulting from the satellite ground track shift and the associated river slope altimetry based water levels are measured at the so called virtual stations vs which are defined as the area where the satellite pass intersects with a river channel since the ground tracks of the sentinel 3 satellites can shift up to 1km away from the nominal track the calculated heights over vs correspond to different locations on the river however all measurements at a given vs are combined into one time series of water levels assigned to a single reference position because rivers are inclined water bodies the upstream measurements are characterized by a positive bias while the downstream measurements reveal a negative bias in this study we investigate water levels measured at 16 vs of the sentinel 3 satellites located on the middle odra oder river to correct the measurements for the bias we calculate the river slope by employing two separate approaches 1 using in situ water levels referenced to a common vertical datum kronsztadt 86 calculating the slope for each satellite measurement time as well as 2 using the means of water levels from vs calculating the slope once for the entire study period the uncorrected water level anomalies compared to the anomalies from the neighbouring gauges are characterized by a mean root mean square error rmse of 22 cm the correction of water levels utilizing both approaches led to similar outputs and resulted in a statistically significant improvement in mean accuracy by 5 64 cm and 5 74 cm for the gauge based and vs based approaches respectively i e over 25 improvement in mean rmse the percentage improvement varied from 4 99 to 53 23 depending on vs this study confirms the importance of the bias caused by the satellite ground track shift and the associated river slope determines its contribution to the overall altimetry measurement error budget and provides a fully automated approach to correct the time series for the slope effect keywords sentinel 3 altimetry river slope satellite ground track shift odra river 1 introduction according to the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2021 climate change will be manifested not only by an increase in the average temperature but also by the intensification of extreme events such as droughts floods and hurricanes in the face of these changes as well as due to the demographic and economic growth access to freshwater will become more and more difficult haddeland et al 2014 therefore monitoring of inland waters as well as their sustainable management is of great importance however the availability of water level measurements on rivers is decreasing over the recent decades hannah et al 2011 satellite altimetry has a great potential to become an alternative to in situ gauging since it provides regular measurements in almost the entire earth initially developed to observe sea level dynamics e g kosek 2001 leuliette et al 2004 nerem et al 1994 2010 niedzielski and kosek 2009 the climate change initiative coastal sea level team 2020 the altimetric method has also shown potential to monitor inland waters including lakes rivers and wetlands e g cazenave et al 1997 crétaux et al 2009 frappart et al 2006 sulistioadi et al 2015 tourian et al 2016 however there are still a few issues that need to be resolved for satellite altimetry to provide precise fully useable water level measurements of inland waters the main problem in utilizing altimetry measurements on rivers is their spatial and temporal resolution the ground track separation on the equator for the currently operating satellites cryosat 2 sentinel 3 and jason 3 is of 7 5km 104km and 315km while their revisit time is of 369 27 and 10 days respectively further the accuracy of altimetry based water levels of rivers is an order of decimetre e g biancamaria et al 2017 halicki and niedzielski 2022 jiang et al 2020 kittel et al 2021 which is still an order of magnitude lower than the accuracy of gauge measurements altimetry measurements over inland waters are conducted at the so called virtual stations vs which are the intersections of satellite ground tracks with river channels one of the main challenges of inland water observation with altimetry is the proper retracking of the signal returning from the earth surface due to the contribution of land contamination to the returned waveforms gao et al 2019 numerous retrackers were developed and validated over inland waters in order to properly detect the reflection from water surface as well as to mitigate the contamination of the signal due to its reflection from land jarihani et al 2013 studied multiple satellite altimetry data processed with various retrackers over some of the australian lakes and rivers those authors confirmed the general usefulness of this technique in hydrological applications the performance of several retrackers was studied on a basis of sentinel 3a altimetry over the brahmaputra river by huang et al 2019 who thoroughly investigated their performance over river sections located on high altitudes with complex terrain significant improvement in data quality was brought by the development of the synthetic aperture radar sar mode which reduced the along track resolution from 1 64km to 300m nielsen et al 2017 due to this change the returning waveform is less affected by land contamination further smaller water bodies can now be sensed by the altimeter quartly et al 2020 another improvement of altimetry products over rivers and lakes came with the development of the open loop mode which due to the a priori information about the surface topography enables controlling the range window position of the altimeter this leads to a significant increase in the number of vs for satellites operating in this mode le gac et al 2021 despite the above mentioned progress in altimetry over inland waters there are still numerous factors affecting its accuracy initially altimetry measurements of river stages were constrained by a minimum river width of 1km birkett 1998 along with the technological development of altimetry the minimum river width decreased below 100 m and currently it is not a factor limiting the measurements santos da silva et al 2010 a thorough investigation of such factors was conducted by maillard et al 2015 who studied the envisat and saral altimetry over the são francisco river those authors identified three factors which may affect the altimetric measurement 1 land cover along the satellite ground track near the river 2 river channel morphology width direction and shape and 3 land topography near the river channel the influence of the two first factors was also studied by halicki and niedzielski 2022 who investigated the sentinel 3a altimetry water levels over polish rivers the authors found no influence of the river width and land cover on the accuracy of altimetric measurements however the complex river channel morphology the presence of sandbars etc and the unfavourable geographical setting of the vs i e the river channel parallel to the satellite ground track or multiple crossings of the river channel by the satellite ground track occurred more often on vs characterized by lower accuracy due to orbit perturbations the satellite ground tracks do never perfectly superimpose for example the ground track deviation of the sentinel 3 satellites is of 1km https sentinels copernicus eu web sentinel missions sentinel 3 satellite description orbit accessed on 13 04 2022 however altimetric measurements on rivers from a given vs are usually combined into one time series assuming that they were all taken over the same river outlet cross section in a specific geographical situation i e when a river channel is aligned almost parallelly to the satellite ground track a shift of 1km might result in water level measurements taken several kilometres upstream or downstream the nominal vs fig 1 since rivers slope towards the mouth altimetry based water levels measured away from the central position of vs are characterized by bias negative for downstream and positive for upstream passes fig 2 the effect of the satellite ground track shift and the river slope on the river altimetry observations hereinafter referred to as river altimetry slope bias was already noticed in the 90s birkett 1998 koblinsky et al 1993 for that time the problem of the river altimetry slope bias could not be solved since gradients across wetland and river basins are poorly known and the altimetry itself can only provide along track gradients birkett 1998 further koblinsky et al 1993 and birkett 1998 focused mainly on the amazon river which in most of its parts has a gentle slope of several centimetres per kilometre e g birkett et al 2002 therefore the river altimetry slope bias appears to be of minor importance to the best of authors knowledge the first study to suggest and apply a correction for the bias described above was the work of santos da silva et al 2010 who studied the ers 2 and envisat altimetry over the amazon basin the authors applied a correction by manually entering a slope value and correcting for the height difference between the mean location of the pass and the location retained for the virtual station the correction for most of the altimetry time series was characterized as a second order correction also boergens et al 2016 identified the river altimetry slope bias the authors corrected the envisat measurements over the mekong river by using the river slope described in literature however due to the lack of gradient values of the mekong river tributaries that correction was applied only to the main stream also in that work the improvement in the accuracy was called a secondary correction both santos da silva et al 2010 and boergens et al 2016 described the correction to be of second order however their studies employed altimetry data of the ers 2 and envisat satellites which operate in the low resolution mode lrm the footprint size of altimetric measurements carried out by these satellites is larger than one kilometre the new altimetry missions sentinel 3a 3b and cryosat 2 are equipped with the sar altimeters the along track resolution of which is only 300m further the sentinel 3 satellites operate in the open loop mode therefore it would be recommended to study the river altimetry slope bias based on the new altimeter data which is characterized by a higher accuracy than the ers 2 and envisat missions it is also to be mentioned that both of the previously described approaches used a priori information about the river slope which is indispensable for the calculation of the vertical difference however the gradient of a given river section can be now calculated with the use of altimetry data such calculations were performed in the amazon river using topex poseidon altimetry birkett et al 2002 and using icesat laser altimetry over the kongo river o loughlin et al 2013 the altimetry based river slope was also calculated by garambois et al 2017 and bjerklie et al 2018 for the purpose of hydrological modelling altimetry based gradient calculations were also conducted to unify or compare water levels of different vs or in situ stations e g hall et al 2012 schneider et al 2018 tourian et al 2016 villadsen et al 2015 xiang et al 2021 in our study we aim to thoroughly analyse the river altimetry slope bias we consider 16 vs of the sentinel 3 satellites located on the middle odra oder river hereinafter abbreviated as odra river we also propose a correction based on the distance between each measurement and the reference position of a vs as well as on the river slope of a given river section the gradient value will be calculated in two separate approaches 1 using water levels from neighbouring gauges which will result in the river slope value at each time of the satellite pass as well as 2 using means of water levels at vs the gauge based slope will serve as a reference since in situ readings are of very high quality using the up to date slope we will determine the contribution of the river altimetry slope bias to the overall budget of the altimetric measurement error the second approach will be performed using one river slope value fixed for the whole study period for a given river section we argue that water level time series corrected for the river altimetry slope bias will be characterized by a lower root mean square errors rmse than the uncorrected measurements the novelty of this study resides in correcting the highly accurate sentinel 3 measurements which since operating in the sar mode are characterized by a small along track resolution further we propose a fully automatic approach that allows to calculate corrections based only on satellite data without the need to use manually entered slopes santos da silva et al 2010 or slopes previously presented in the literature boergens et al 2016 our solution can be used operationally as it does not require any a priori data 2 study area odra is poland s second longest river with length of 854km it has its headwaters in czechia in the sudetes mountains but it predominantly flows through the territory of western poland odra is usually divided into the upper odra upstream from the kędzierzyn koźle city the middle odra between the kędzierzyn koźle city and the mouth of the warta river and the lower odra downstream the mouth of the warta river in its upper part odra is a narrow mountainous river on the contrary on its lower part the river is almost flat with slope values varying from 0 05m km to 0 001m km dubicki et al 2005 the upper part of the middle odra is channelled and regulated by numerous hydraulic structures considering the above described river characteristics as well as the availability of gauge and altimetry measurements the study area has been limited to the middle odra section between the ścinawa and kostrzyn nad odrą gauges fig 3 which is free of water damming structures and its slope ranges from 0 19m km to 0 28m km dubicki et al 2005 the study area can be characterized as a lowland with altitudes below 300m a s l gently sloping towards the nw direction four main tributaries along the studied reach are warta nysa łużycka bóbr and barycz with length of 795km 246km 278km and 136km respectively following the river classification based on width meybeck et al 1996 most of the middle odra river can be classified as a small river 40 200m in width the regime can be classified as nival moderately developed wrzesiński 2017 this implies that the average flow in the spring month is 130 180 of the average annual flow which is driven by snow thawing the channel of the middle odra river has undergone numerous regulations during the last two centuries kreft and parzonka 2007 in particular the river section considered in this study is characterized by the occurrence of stony groins on both sides of the channel 3 data 3 1 altimetric data sentinel 3 is an earth observation satellite mission developed by the european space agency designed to monitor open oceans as well as coastal areas and inland waters fletcher 2012 currently two satellites operate under this mission namely sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b launched in february 2016 and april 2018 respectively both operate on a sun synchronous orbit the height of which is of 814 5km the ground tracks of this constellation of satellites are spaced 52km at the equator and the repeat cycle is of 27 days one of the instruments carried by these satellites is the synthetic aperture radar altimeter sral which uses the ku band and c band frequencies it operates in the sar mode between 60 n and 60 s considering the on board tracking mode of sentinel 3 both satellites operate in the open loop mode in this study we use the non time critical ntc sentinel 3 data provided by the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat through the copernicus online data access coda https www eumetsat int coda accessed on 13 04 2022 service based on the sentinel 3 data we derived water level time series for 16 vs located on the middle odra river fig 3 11 of which are vs of the sentinel 3a and 5 of them are sentinel 3b vs table 1 the mean distance between the compared stations is of 12 53km and it ranges from 1 88km to 28 56km the river width at the studied vs measured on a basis of google earth imagery ranges from 105 to 215m with a mean of 145m 3 2 in situ data the gauge network consists of 9 in situ stations fig 3 located closer than 30km from the vs table 1 water levels from these gauges are used for two purposes to assess the accuracy of satellite measurements as well as to calculate the river slope of a given section readings from the kostrzyn nad odrą gauge are used only for the slope calculation since it is not the nearest gauge to any vs the water levels are operationally measured by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute instytut meteorologii i gospodarki wodnej państwowy instytut badawczy imgw pib and provided with a time step of 1 h the time span of in situ data ranges from april 2016 to august 2021 imgw pib provided also the gauge zero heights referenced to the kronsztadt 86 vertical datum these values are crucial for the gauge based slope calculation see section 4 2 1 in total in situ data gaps while satellite passes over vs occur in 25 situations out of 969 considered however in situ data is missing 49 times when trying to calculate the gauge based slope value since for this calculation stages from both neighbouring gauges are indispensable see section 4 2 1 all in all this is still a very low number of missing data and we do not conduct any gap interpolation for this study 4 methods 4 1 water level time series from satellite altimetry the methodology for the estimation of water level time series for 16 vs using sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b is based on the dahiti approach described in schwatke et al 2015 this approach is based on an extended outlier rejection applied retracking and a kalman filter step however for this study we added a new outlier criteria based on river centrelines taken from the swot river database sword altenau et al 2021 the sword centrelines are used to estimate the exact river crossings of each altimeter track which are later used for the river slope correction additionally a new outlier criteria is applied rejecting all altimeter measurements which are further away than 500m from the river crossings based on the remaining altimeter measurements and the dahiti approach are water level time series for 16 vs computed the water levels are given normal heights all water level time series are freely available on the dahiti webportal https dahiti dgfi tum de accessed on 13 04 2022 4 2 slope calculation 4 2 1 gauge based approach calculation of the river slope in the gauge based approach is conducted on a basis of in situ measurements gauge zeros and water levels above gauge zero for each satellite pass water levels from the upstream and the downstream adjacent gauges are juxtaposed as mentioned in section 3 2 in 49 situations there is a data gap at one of the gauges in such case we decided to compare heights from up to 24 h before or after the altimetric measurement however the compared water levels need to refer to the same time for example in case of data gaps at time t 0 we look for water surface elevations wse at t 1 h for both gauges then for the wse at t 1 h and so on up to 24 h due to this operation the calculation of the river slope is impossible only in 20 situations finally the river slope at each of the satellite passes is calculated as follows 1 g a u g e b a s e d s l o p e m km h u z u h d z d d where h u h d are the upstream and downstream water levels above gauge zero m z u z d are the upstream and downstream gauge zeros m and d is the along river distance between gauges km the result of this calculation is the mean river slope on the river section between neighbouring gauges 4 2 2 vs based approach as mentioned in the introduction the river slope calculation is now possible with the use of altimetry data the gradient can be determined if the vertical difference and the along river distance between the vs are known one of the approaches for estimating the vertical difference resides in subtracting the means of heights from two adjacent vs e g tourian et al 2016 a modified approach was presented by o loughlin et al 2013 who calculated the mean heights of selected months another approach is a subtraction of water levels from neighbouring gauges conducted at each measurement epoch which was applied in the work of garambois et al 2017 and bjerklie et al 2018 this allows a unique slope estimation for each satellite pass on contrary villadsen et al 2015 and xiang et al 2021 did not calculate the slope directly but they rather interpolated heights on different locations on the river the interpolation was a function of the distance from a given location to the river mouth or any established point on the river the parameters of which were calculated on a basis of water levels from all vs of a studied river section usually the neighbouring vs are not being observed by the satellite at the same time therefore there should be a maximum time difference between vs which are chosen for the slope calculation hall et al 2012 used only those vs pairs the measurements of which are maximally one day apart on the contrary o loughlin et al 2013 defined the threshold to be of 2 days in our study the time shift between observations on vs of one satellite sentinel 3a or sentinel 3b located on neighbouring parallel ground tracks is of 4 days although the distance between them is 104km at the equator fig 4 however in case of multiple crossing of a satellite ground track and a river channel some vs can be observed almost simultaneously within several seconds therefore they form an excellent basis for slope calculation the time shifts between measurements on neighbouring vs of two different satellites or between readings from adjacent vs located on non parallel tracks are not stable fig 4 therefore before using such pairs for the slope calculation the actual time shift should be verified considering the above mentioned time delays between vs measurements as well as knowing the accuracy of altimetry based wse on rivers of an order of decimetre we do not calculate the river slope at each measurement time for a river section between two vs one slope value is estimated using the vertical difference between those stations calculated on a basis of mean wse values see eq 2 the river slope is calculated between vs the measurements of which are maximally 4 days apart so the neighbouring parallel passes are included the slope of such river section is calculated as follows 2 v s b a s e d s l o p e m km h u h d d where h u h d are the upstream and downstream means of vs water levels m and d is the along river distance between vs km this value represents the slope of the river section between the two vs 4 3 distance calculation and water levels correction the second essential value for the proposed correction is the distance from the altimetric measurement to the vs reference position in this study we used the river centreline from the map of the hydrographic division of poland mapa podziału hydrograficznego polski in most cases the satellite track crossed the river at each of its passes for such situations the altimetric measurement location is defined as the intersection between the river line and the current satellite pass however on several vs in some cases the satellite did not pass exactly over the river in these situations the off nadir correction is applied boergens et al 2016 and the measurement location is defined as the point on the river located closest to the current satellite pass finally the distance is being determined as the length of the river section between the current altimetric measurement and the reference position of the vs having established the river slope and the distance from the reference it is possible to calculate the corrected water levels which is conducted as follows 3 c o r r e c t e d w s e w s e r s d where w s e is the water surface elevation on a vs m r s is the river slope m km and d is the along river distance from the current altimetry measurement to the reference position of the vs km the value of the correction is subtracted from wse since the distance value is set a positive number for measurements upstream and as a negative number for measurements downstream the reference position therefore if the satellite passes downstream the reference position the measurement is likely to be underestimated therefore the shift should increase wse on the other hand for measurements taken upstream the reference position the correction should lower wse as it is likely to be overestimated fig 5 presents the workflow of data processing carried out in this study after retrieving sentinel 3a 3b ntc data from eumetsat this data is being processed and corrected in the modified dahiti approach these water levels are then corrected for the measurements non stationarity with the use of the gauge based slope calculated for each measurement time separately and the vs based slope calculated once for the entire study area finally all three time series uncorrected corrected with gauge based slope approach 1 and corrected with vs based slope approach 2 are compared with wse from the adjacent gauges the comparison is conducted taking into account the time lag between the compared stations which is thoroughly described in halicki and niedzielski 2022 4 4 statistical methods to check if errors of the estimated water levels are reduced as a result of applying slope corrections along the lines of the approach 1 and 2 numerous statistical tests are employed three data sets are analysed 1 rmse at 16 vs before correction 2 rmse at 16 vs after correction based on the approach 1 and 3 rmse at 16 vs after correction based on the approach 2 to evaluate the significance of the above mentioned reduction in rmse two pairs of data sets are considered 1 uncorrected data vs corrected data using approach 1 2 uncorrected data vs corrected data using approach 2 the welch two sample student s t test is utilized in which the null hypothesis of equal means of rmse in two samples is tested against the one sided alternative that mean rmse of the corrected water level is significantly lower than mean rmse of the uncorrected river stages the choice of the two sample student s t test is due to its considerable power to carry out the statistical inference using the two sample student s t test numerous assumptions must be fulfilled 1 each of three data sets must be internally statistically independent 2 each of three data sets must be normally distributed 3 variances of data sets juxtaposed in the aforementioned pairs must be equal first the hypothesis of independence within each data set is verified using the ljung box test ljung and box 1978 second the normality hypothesis is checked using the shapiro wilk test royston 1995 third the f test for comparing variances of normally distributed samples is used 5 results since rivers are water bodies characterized by an inclined water surface and the satellite ground track can shift up to one kilometre towards both sides the altimetric measurements are subject to be biased this can be observed in fig 6 which presents the amount of bias of every altimetry measurement at all studied vs the bias is calculated as the difference between the altimetry based water level anomaly compared to the corresponding water level anomaly from the neighbouring gauge each subfigure shows the river the nominal ground track the reference position of the vs and the altimetric measurement locations see section 4 3 the colour of which depends on the bias size the subfigures present also the arrows which show the flow direction on almost every vs the bias of measurements conducted downstream the reference position is negative which suggests an underestimation of wse the opposite effect occurs for measurements conducted upstream the reference position fig 6 the only vs for which this trend is ambiguous is vs 13659 it is also worth noting that the geographical setting of the vs determines the maximum distances between the measurements and the reference position if the satellite pass is quite parallel to the river channel e g vs 18753 vs 23410 the furthest measurements might be even 2 3 km away from the reference position for such points the bias may exceed 0 5 m fig 6 allows also for the identification of vs with measurements taken not exactly over the river channel vs 18752 and vs 38366 for these measurements we apply the off nadir correction boergens et al 2016 the river slope did not undergo significant changes during the study period considering the 6 year period and all the studied river sections the river slope values calculated with the gauge based approach ranged from 0 24 to 0 30 m km table 2 the mean values of the slope ranged from 0 26 to 0 29 m km this confirms that the river slope along the middle odra river is stable interestingly the vs based approach reveals very similiar slopes the values range from 0 26 to 0 28 m km and they do not differ from the gauge based mean slope values by more than 0 02 m km this proves the high efficiency of this method which is based only on satellite data however it has to be mentioned that the slope values are calculated for river sections with lengths varying from 15 315km to 59 645km for the gauge approach and from 10 07km to 86 361km for the vs approach this method would not be applicable on river sections where waterfalls or dams occur the accuracy of three wse time series are presented in table 3 the rmse of the uncorrected wse ranges from 14 cm to 34 cm with mean of 22 cm almost half of studied vs 7 out of 16 are characterized by rmse lower than 20 cm after applying the correction using the gauge based slope the mean rmse amounts to 16 cm which is a reduction of 25 46 only in one situation the applied correction does not improve the accuracy vs 13659 the decrease is of 0 4 cm which is 2 26 of the primary accuracy for other vs the improvement ranges from 0 7 cm to 13 4 cm while the improvement percentages vary from 4 99 to 53 23 the lowest rmse is of 9 cm vs 13660 while the highest rmse occurs for vs 23408 31 cm interestingly the correction using the vs based slope results in a very similiar improvement the mean rmse is even 0 1 cm lower than the rmse of wse calculated using the approach 1 the maximum difference between those two approaches is of 0 7 cm which is only 6 02 difference however the mean difference between these time series is of 0 64 therefore both approaches seem to have a very similiar high efficiency in order to check if the reduction in rmse of water level determination attained as a result of applying corrections known as the approaches 1 and 2 is statistically significant the welch two sample student s t test has been utilized the rmse values juxtaposed in table 3 have been paired uncorrected data vs corrected using approach 1 uncorrected data vs corrected using approach 2 to check if there is a statistically significant reduction in mean rmse in all statistical tests the significance level of 0 05 has been assumed table 4 shows that p values of the above mentioned test with the one sided alternative which says that after the correction mean rmse is lower than before the correction are of 0 0061 and 0 0054 for approach 1 and 2 respectively it means that at the pre assumed significance level the difference between rmse averages is statistically significant the one sided two sample student s t test is powerful i e in our case 16 elements in each group significance level of 0 05 standard deviation of approximately 6 difference in means of approximately 5 5 its power is of approximately 0 81 it legitimates the inference based on only 16 elements in each group to perform the two sample student s t test appropriately a number of assumptions must be fulfilled see section 4 4 it is apparent from table 4 that all the investigated rmse data are internally independent as inferred on a basis of the ljung box test and the associated high p values exceeding 0 4 also the shapiro wilk test suggests that it is impossible to reject the null hypothesis of normality at the pre defined significance level p values are greater than 0 08 therefore three data tests each representing 16 rmse values obtained using or not different slope correction approaches are highly likely to follow the normal samples which is needed to apply the two sample student s t test properly in addition variances in groups uncorrected data vs corrected data with approach 1 as well as uncorrected data vs corrected data with approach 2 do not vary significantly that is confirmed by the f test the p values of which exceed 0 7 thus the assumptions required for the two sample student s t test to be used are met the statistical independence quantified by the ljung box test show that neither the accuracy of the uncorrected wse time series nor the correction improvement do not show any spatial dependencies the lack of dependency is also apparent from fig 7 interestingly the only vs with a decrease in accuracy vs 13659 is the most downstream located site on the other hand the two vs located in the vicinity of this vs are characterized by an increase of accuracy greater than 30 fig 7 shows that the improvement in the accuracy after applying the approach 1 and approach 2 correction is very similiar the only tributary which flows into the odra river on a section between a vs and an in situ station is the barycz river the two vs located on this section are vs 18754 and vs 23409 but despite this tributary wse time series from both vs correspond well with the wse time series from the głogów gauge due to the correction of the river altimetry slope bias the corrected wse anomalies from almost all vs correspond better to the water level anomalies from the neighbouring gauges than the uncorrected wse the correspondence with daily averages of gauge water levels is presented in fig 8 as example we present data from two vs one vs of the sentinel 3a fig 8a and one vs of the sentinel 3b satellite fig 8b although in some cases the correction increases the difference between altimetry and gauge data in most cases the correction moves the water levels closer to the gauge values considering the presented graphs the correction improves the accuracy both during low and high water periods all graphs showing the corrected in the approach 1 heights uncorrected heights and daily averages of gauge water level anomalies are presented in the supplementary material fig s1 6 discussion determination of the river slope is a key point in the proposed river altimetry slope bias correction since for the studied river section the accurate gauge readings are referenced to a common vertical datum kronsztadt 86 it was possible to calculate the river slope at each section for every time of the satellite observation however this approach cannot be applied for numerous rivers with missing in situ measurements therefore it is essential to propose an alternative for the river slope calculation this problem can be solved by calculating river gradients using altimetry measurements that cover most of the globe and are publicly available further this approach proved its accuracy in numerous studies e g garambois et al 2017 schneider et al 2018 villadsen et al 2015 in our study we calculated one slope value for each river section which was based on the difference between mean height values of the vs the same approach was applied by tourian et al 2016 also santos da silva et al 2010 used this method however only on crossovers of two satellite ground tracks since satellites pass over the virtual stations on different days we decided to calculate the river slope on a basis of vs with measurements maximally 4 days apart we choose this threshold because this is the time difference between two neighbouring either ascending or descending passes of a satellite sentinel 3a or sentinel 3b on the contrary hall et al 2012 compared vs with measurements maximally two days apart and o loughlin et al 2013 maximally one day apart however these authors used data from different altimetric missions the slope values of river sections of the middle odra river obtained in the vs based approach agree well with mean slopes calculated with the gauge readings the maximum difference between the mean slopes for a given vs is of 0 02m km it is also worth noting that the mean gradient ranges 0 26 0 29 and 0 26 0 28m km for the gauge based and vs based approaches respectively agree with the slope range of the middle odra river 0 19 0 28 m km presented by dubicki et al 2005 an evaluation of the vs based approach for the river slope calculation was also performed by bjerklie et al 2018 who used jason 2 altimetry over the yukon river the authors estimated the slope separately for each satellite measurement time to verify the obtained gradients the authors compared them with slopes calculated with the use of laser altimetry from the icesat mission as well as with values presented in the literature both comparisons confirmed the high accuracy of this approach although these approaches show promising results it is to be mentioned that the slope values refer sometimes to river sections with length of several dozens of kilometres in our study the longest section was of 86 36km the longer the section is the greater the generalization of the obtained slope becomes also this approach would not be applicable on river sections with dams or waterfalls as the slope is not constant along these sections the wse values at vs of the sentinel 3 satellites on the middle odra river calculated with the modified dahiti approach are characterized by high accuracy the mean rmse of vs water level anomalies compared with anomalies from the neighbouring gauges is of 22 cm which is comparable with the mean rmse for the corresponding vs from the hydroweb database which were studied by halicki and niedzielski 2022 comparing 9 vs of the sentinel 3a satellite considered in both studies the mean rmse is of 22 cm and 20 cm for the dahiti and hydroweb water levels respectively both results show the high quality of sentinel 3 data and they are comparable to other studies which assessed the sentinel 3 accuracy over rivers see table 5 in the paper by halicki and niedzielski 2022 to the best of our knowledge the only two studies to apply a correction of the river altimetry slope bias are the works of boergens et al 2016 and santos da silva et al 2010 both authors describe the improvement in accuracy to be of several centimetres in the mean rmse although this is a value comparable with the mean improvement obtained in our work 5 64 cm and 5 74 cm for the approach 1 and approach 2 respectively there are several differences which have to be mentioned first of all both authors used a priori data for the river slope borrowed from literature therefore their approaches are not applicable along ungauged rivers further these studies used envisat and ers 2 altimeters operating in the lrm mode which are characterized by a significantly larger footprint than the sentinel 3 altimeter operating in sar mode therefore the accuracy of water levels estimated by these altimeters vary significantly both boergens et al 2016 and santos da silva et al 2010 obtained rmse values ranging from decimetres up to several metres therefore an improvement in the accuracy of a few centimetres did not seem as a key correction on contrary due to the development of the sar altimeters and the open loop mode the accuracy of the sentinel 3 river altimetry can be of 20 40 cm in rmse e g bogning et al 2018 halicki and niedzielski 2022 kittel et al 2021 zaidi et al 2021 therefore in our study the correction by more than 5 centimetres represents more than 25 of rmse and for some of the vs the improvement was about 50 the research in this study was carried out on the middle odra river with slopes varying from 0 24m km to 0 30m km the proposed correction strongly depends on this value so it will certainly be smaller on rivers characterized by a more gentle gradient for example the slope of most of the amazon river is only of 0 01 0 04m km e g birkett et al 2002 however there are many stretches of rivers that are wide enough to be monitored by satellites but also located in mountainous areas it is in these rivers that first of all the correction suggested in this study should be applied as the slope of these rivers is much greater which increases the river altimetry slope bias the occurrence of the river altimetry slope bias is clearly visible in fig 9a taking into account all of the altimetric measurements the bias clearly correlates with the distance from a measurement to the reference position the pearson correlation coefficient between the biases before correction and the distances from the reference position is of 0 65 which is a strong and statistically significant correlation at the significance level of 0 05 after applying the gauge based correction the biases are deprived of a clear trend fig 9b and they do not correlate to the distance from the reference position the pearson correlation coefficient is weak and equal to 0 16 the occurrence of the river altimetry slope bias is also confirmed by the slope of the regression line presented in fig 9a for the uncorrected data the slope is of 0 218m km after applying the correction the slope of the regression line is reduced to 0 041m km this can suggest even a slight overcorrection of the river altimetry slope bias however this bias is not the only source of the altimetry error therefore no inference should be made on a basis of such small correlation coefficient 0 16 and the associated slope of the regression line 0 041m km in conclusion since both approaches proposed in this study showed a very similiar performance it can be stated that both allow for the elimination of the river altimetry slope bias 7 conclusions due to orbit perturbations satellite ground tracks do never perfectly superimpose since rivers are inclined water bodies a non exact location of water level measurements might lead to certain bias in previous altimetry missions the bias was often overlooked because there were factors that contributed to the measurement budget error on a much larger scale the sentinel 3 satellites are equipped with the sar radar altimeter and operate in the open loop mode therefore they provide water level elevations of rivers the accuracy of which is in the order of decimetres in this study we aimed to assess the contribution of the river altimetry slope bias to the overall altimetry measurement error budget as well as to propose a fully automated approach that allows to calculate corrections based only on satellite data we studied water levels from 16 vs of the sentinel 3 satellites located on the middle odra river and calculated in the modified dahiti approach the accuracy was determined by comparing the water level anomalies from the vs with anomalies from the neighbouring gauges the contribution to the overall error budget was estimated using in situ measurements which allowed for an individual slope determination for each satellite measurement the second approach was based on river gradients estimated on a basis of the mean heights of vs the following conclusions can be drawn rmse of the uncorrected water level anomalies are characterized by a mean value of 22 cm ranging from 14 cm to 34 cm the river slope calculation with the use of satellite data provided accurate values almost identical to those calculated with the in situ data the correction with the gauge based slope allowed for a mean reduction in rmse by 5 64 cm which is an improvement of about 25 the correction with the vs based slope performed very similarly reducing rmse by 5 74 cm the decrease in rmse for the 16 vs is statistically significant for both approaches only on one vs the correction resulted in a slight decrease of accuracy less than 1 cm in the remaining stations the improvement ranged from 0 7 cm to 13 4 cm which stands for a percentage from 4 99 to 53 23 the findings of this study confirm that applying the correction of the river altimetry slope bias can lead to a significant improvement in accuracy this correction is suggested especially for 1 altimetry observations carried out in the sar mode since they are characterized by a small along track resolution and high accuracy and for 2 altimetry observations over mountainous rivers where the measurement biases should be greater due to the higher river gradients however it has to be mentioned that the proposed approach is only applicable to river sections without dams or waterfalls since they disallow a proper river slope determination the problem in question might soon be resolved with the launch of the surface water and ocean topography swot mission thanks to the wide swath technology the mission is planned to provide accurate river slope values which could serve the purpose of the correction of the river altimetry slope bias credit authorship contribution statement michał halicki conceived the study
