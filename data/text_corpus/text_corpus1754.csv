8770,the effects of mining apart from surface subsidences and deformations are forced flows of surface and underground waters lasting many decades in the mining areas natural water flows should be restored by mining entities and or their legal successors in the process of the mine closures such action is tantamount to a restoration of the previous state in the sense of repair of damage to the environment and surface infrastructure then under natural water flows conditions such mining areas may become flooded often quite extensively this paper describes a comprehensive method for flood threat assessment of artificially drained mining and post mining areas after the restoration of natural water flows the subject of this research is the surface of a single mine subsidence area the term mine subsidence area msa is defined as that part of the rock mass containing solid mineral deposits and the above surface affected by continuous and discountinuous deformation as currently legally defined in terms of range and intensity this method together with simultaneous measurements of water levels at outflow places at the msa boundary allows for an useful way of mapping the msa surface this has been developed to fully identify the true extent of mining induced damage to the msa aquatic environment it introduces innovative hydromorphological elements of the msa these allow zoning of the msa surface while taking into consideration future drainage works and or projected mining subsidences inside the msa these spatial hydromorphological maps of the msa identify the framework of permanent and occasional flooding and constitute the final result of this method it is an universal tool for sustainable water management and quantitative evaluation for extraction of minerals keywords flood hazard mining area mine subsidence area mining induced damage hydromorphological element water management zoning 1 introduction subsidence and deformation of the msa surface along with damage to surface infrastructure is a direct result of the impact of underground mining they have been described many times by authors from different countries throughout the world 1 4 also forced groundwater and surface water flows are a common consequence of mining they accompany the extraction of minerals but they can often last much longer decades or even centuries as a result the msa water environment is inseparably subject to forced changes they were described among others by 5 11 the main reason for the necessity of artificial drainage of mining areas is the mining exploitation of minerals which requires drainage of deposits and mining excavations in cases where mineral deposit are covered with a hydrogeologically non insulating overburden a large part of the surface water infiltrates into mine works causing the surface to dry out an additional reason for the occurrence of artificial drainage of mining areas may be preventive works involving the transfer of surface water by means of pumping stations the need for this may result from underground mining exploitation the voids in the rock mass formed after mining generate a collapse of nearby rocks the effect of this is that the rock mass settles at the place level of mineral extraction up to the land surface the resulting deformations of the mining area surface take the form of morphological basins in cases where water stagnating in these basins threatens to inrush into the mine works and or floods the surface infrastructure of the mining area mining entities limit this flooding by using forced water transfer by pumping such pumping stations provide temporary protection of surface infrastructure and allow mining exploitation under specific hydrological and hydrogeological conditions in a mine subsidence area msa environment the existence of forced water flows pumping is the main reason why the true extent of mining induced damage is not fully revealed including damage to the msa aquatic environment in connection with the above commercial mining enterprises repair only revealed visible damages on an ongoing basis the mine closure process should be accompanied by restoration of natural free water flows after discontinuance of mine dewatering underground pumping of hydraulically connected mines and turning off surface pumping stations such conditions will cause inevitable new damage to appear in msas 12 only then will the true extent of mining induced damage be fully revealed in particular damages to the aquatic environment instead of the previously drained elements of the msa environment the rock mass may become saturated by water and the surface may become flooded but this state rarely occurs due to the need to safeguard hydraulically connected active mines against the danger of uncontrolled water incursions and or inflows this is the reason for continuous use of forced pumping systems of water in closed mines in the upper silesian coal basin uscb in poland fig 1 transformation of the aquatic environment has been going on for well over 200 years in more than one hundred mining and post mining areas this aspect is particularly important due to the closure and or abandonment of the majority of mines and the closure of commercial mining entities whose mining induced damages were not repaired hence there is a lack of not only construction projects for drainage works limitation and or elimination of flooding and or the threat of flooding but even worst lack of any planning in this field this fact is of paramount importance for hydrological modelling of surface waters in mining areas today transformations of the aquatic environment affect countless mineral resource basins around the world 13 this is evidenced by the example of a single basin the uscb in poland where the range of hydrogeologically and hydrologically transformed surfaces of mining areas cover an area of several hundred square kilometers the surface subsidence of the mining area of the underground knurow szczyglowice coal mine where the author of this article worked exceeded 25 m such a scale of subsidence means that a single morphological basin potential reservoir can even cover the entire msa in the uscb the average msa span diameter is about 7 km there are known cases of mining areas in the world where these basins are many times as large the surfaces of many potential reservoirs are often highly urbanized limited flooding of their bottoms is directly caused by artificial transfer of water by using pumping stations and or mining drainage the dimensions of these potential reservoirs in active mining areas change recurrently over time these changes are often characterized by increased depth and diameter sometimes even connecting to neighboring basins inside them the extent of surface infrastructure threatened by flooding increases mining induced damage in the form of flooding and or the threat of flooding is the most determinant factor in the transformation of mining and post mining areas in general they cause irreversible degradation of the surface occasional flooding may necessitate changes in some goals of spatial development and land use permanent flooding may necessitate the need to completely change future spatial planning strategies if there is no plan for permanent artificial drainage of msas and depending on local law such areas will require the dismantling of the infrastructure not adapted for flooding both above and below ground and reclamation of the land surface for the above mentioned reasons artificial drying of the surface of mining and post mining areas as permitted by the local water law in force first requires assessing the threat of flooding in such areas such assessments are especially needed to clarify the objectives of this method which are as follows restoring natural water flows in mining areas and responsibly limiting the need of permanent pumping by future owners or caretakers in these areas identification of mining induced damage in the form of a threat of flooding for which restoration of natural water conditions may prove impossible thus necessitating the use forced pumping in perpetuity eventual compensation monetary payment for mining induced damage repair to be paid by mining entities for infrastructure threatened by flooding in areas where this threat cannot be eliminated and in areas where such elimination is not planned identification mining induced damage in the form of a threat of flooding requiring reclamation by planned inundation and or through infilling of these areas using mining waste materials legal differentiation of the changes to the true extent of mining induced damage in the msa aquatic environment caused by current commercial mining entity as opposed to the damage caused by previous mining entities quantitative evaluation for extraction of mineral deposits with special emphasis on sustainable management of the msa aquatic environment 14 the subject of this paper is a description of the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in mining areas for such areas surface flooding is modeled in a specific way i e without detailed drainage plans and refers to the possibility of limiting the flooding through preventive actions such as projected mining subsidences and or construction of hydrotechnical works inside the msa in the content of this article it is important to keep in mind that the use of the term the threat of flooding to the surfaces of the msas is directly linked to the restoration of natural water flow discontinuance of pumping 2 materials and methods currently known hydrological methods of assessing the flood hazard of land surfaces consist in modeling surface water flows and determining the extent of flooding of surface watercourse valleys with flood waves of appropriate probability of occurrence 15 25 most of these methods allow examination of the state of the surface relief current archival and forecast and identification of any potential flooding with its appropriate probability of occurrence it should be noted that in active underground hard coal mines the msa s surface relief is permanently subsided on the basis of the author s experiences the size of these subsidences often exceeds 0 2 m per day and in some areas of the surface may exceed 3 0 m during the year therefore in such msa s the identified surfaces characterized by different flood hazards only have short term validity and relevance a separate issue is the fact that hydrogeological recognition of the msa rock mass characterized by large transformations of the aquatic environment may by itself be very inadequate the shallow mining exploitation of minerals i e characterized by a depth of up to 100 m carried out earlier usually more than 150 years ago e g in uscb in poland is often poorly documented the lack of mining maps does not allow for assessing the scale range and depth of rock mass transformations these results in large modeling errors for groundwater flows and those surface water flows remaining in a hydraulic relationship with groundwater the above is the underlying reason for the development of this specifically defined method for assessing the threat of flooding in mining areas which additionally identifies those parts of potential reservoirs that can possibly be drained repair of mining induced damage hence known hydrological modeling methods are a complement the described method 2 1 the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in the msa the subject of research in this method is the surface of a single msa whose boundaries were determined separately by the mining concession decision for a single mining entity by the term mine subsidence area msa for solid mineral deposits the author understands those parts of the rock mass and the surface in the vicinity of exploited deposits in particular those parts subject to continuous and discontinuous deformations as currently legally defined in terms of range and intensity for a full understanding of the content of this article it should be mentioned that the above definition of msa is not a concept commonly used in the global mining community this should be distinguished from the term commonly used in english language hydrogeology mining subsidence area which may refer to many neighboring msas many mines and sometimes the entire mining sub region the specificity of the terminology referred to in this article also distinguishes the concept of msa from another commonly used term mining area the author drew the understanding of the last term mining area from polish geological and mining law which specifically and unequivocally describes 3d volumes not the surface area of the rock mass in which mining works can be carried out exploitation of mineral resources fig 2 the detailed subject of this analysis may be a numerical model of terrain nmt and or a situational contour map and orthophotomaps that project the analyzed state of a surface relief archival or current or forecasted the necessary materials for analysis also include data on storm water drainage gravitationally dewatering the surface of the analyzed msa in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of flood threat assessment it is necessary to separately analyze each individual catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa by the term the main watercourses draining the msa the author understands each naturally flowing watercourse that crosses the boundary of the msa at the place of outflow 26 in special cases it may also be a channeled surface and or an underground stream on surfaces located inside the msa separate studies are carried out on their state and environmental changes by means of newly formulated and innovative hydromorphological elements of the msa environment relative to the adopted reference system the hydrometric reference point by hydromorphological elements of the msa environment the author understands the inanimate components of the environment the characteristics of which allow the identification of the state and changes of the aquatic environment of the msa special elements of research on the surface of the msa are morphological basins in the environment of artificially drained msas morphological basins are characterized by the threat of flooding that may occur after the restoration of natural water flows if mining and post mining areas are girdled hemmed in by the boundary of a morphological basin as a result of surface subsidence then the threat of flooding occurring inside them is a tangible form of mining induced damage hence the main purpose of this method of assessing the threat of flooding is to identify the morphological basins and all types of potential reservoirs within them this article describes commonly known elements of the environment related to water or possible flooding and or significantly affecting water in particular there are surface waters natural ponds lakes watercourses and artificial inundated areas watersheds water facilities ditches artificial riverbeds embankments and levies locks valves water pumping stations waterlogging of the mining areas and the depth of the first aquifer the innovative hydromorphological elements of the msa environment are base level of natural outflow of water normal hydrometric reference point conditional hydrometric reference point relative elevation of the surface of the msa 26 closed basin lake and four ranges boundaries of flooding inundated area boundary of artificially drained area boundary of extreme flood water level the boundary of potential backwater the subject of the analyses also includes detailed information on separate catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa consisting of the necessary meteorological geological hydrogeological and mining data this data should in particular enable the use of selected hydrological models for modeling strips of lands threatened by 100 and 500 year water 2 2 algorithm for the hydromorphological and cartographic method for assessing the threat of flooding in msas the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding of the msa 27 is a cartographic method of researching analyzing and modeling of the completed and forecasted changes in the hydromorphological elements of the msa by means of special so called spatial hydromorphological maps reflecting the range of these elements relative to the identified and adopted reference systems this method was formulated on the basis gained through first hand experience with flooding on the surface of szczyglowice msa located in uscb in poland the author during his work on the mine participated in all cyclical monitoring of surface waters carried out throughout the period of mining impact this monitoring included measurements of the levels of normal and occasional flood waters in five artificially drained regions of the msa the effect of large scale mine subsidence experienced by the lower section of the bierawka river bed in the szczyglowice msa is a reduction of the initial longitudinal slope of water level to a critical value of 0 01 at a bump in the riverbed on the boundary of the msa such a minimal slope currently occurs on a 2600 m section of the riverbed between the 39 0th and 41 6th km of the river in this section the water is constantly silting the bottom of the riverbed with material sand transported by the water the depth of the river has been constant for 30 observed years and is about 0 6 m similar stability of normal water levels occurred historically in a section about 1 km longer both in the riverbed and its tributaries current changes in the river s slope resulted among others from regulation of the riverbed a similar decrease in the slopes of surface watercourses above their outflow points from the msa s occurs in the riverbeds of many main watercourses draining such areas which have experienced significant mining impacts and still maintain gravitational water flows similar permanent flooding of the valleys of surface watercourses in the uscb were also identified among others on the section of 2000 m from 917 5th to 919 5th km of the vistula river and the section of 3500 m from 0 0th to 3 5th km of the pszemsza river a tributary of the vistula river in the bierun ii mining area the section of 3300 m from 55 7th to 59 0th km of the klodnica river a tributary of the odra river in the makoszowy post mining area on the 1200 m section from 6 6th to 7 8th km of the bielszowicki stream a tributary of the klodnica river in the halemba i ii mining area and on the 2400 m section from 3 0th to 5 4th km of the bolina stream in the janow post mining area on these sections of the main watercourses draining the msa the level of the water table is close to the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa the above allowed the author to schematize the hydrological modeling of the surface water of the msa which usually constitute small parts of the overall catchment areas the essence of this method is the constancy of the msa aquatic environment s two main elements the elevation of the hydrometric reference point and the elevation of the extreme flood water level 26 chapter 2 3 1 this method was developed as a tool to study the threat of flooding in mining areas characterized by different hydrogeological types of overburden of deposits both isolating and non isolating fig 1 it was then repeatedly used to study many mining and post mining areas msas in polish coal zinc and lead mines selected examples along with a description of the local geological structure under study are provided in chapter 2 3 1 the algorithm of the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding of artificially drained msa consists on performing the following steps in each separate catchment area of the main watercourses draining the msa described below there are identification of the main watercourses draining the msa and the extent of their catchment areas designation of hydrometric reference points in catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa either normal or conditional mapping of the relief of the msa by means of the relative elevations of the surface relative to the adopted hydrometric reference points identification of historical extreme flood stages on the surface of the msa identification of the ranges of the following three types ranges of potential reservoirs the inundated area the boundary of potential backwater and the boundary of extreme flood water level in each identified morphological basin modeling strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by a 100 year water final zoning the entire surface of the msa with regards to limiting the threat of flooding referring to the reasons for developing this method this specific way of identifying all types of potential reservoirs and final zoning the msa surface takes into account the worst case flooding scenario after the restoration of natural water flows full hydraulic relationship of surface and underground waters catchment analysis is conducted on the surface of mining and post mining areas msa this is done separately in individual catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa and then in each artificially drained morphological basin the described method requires distinguishing 4 ranges of possible flooding boundaries of 4 of 5 types of potential reservoirs the boundary of the inundated area the boundary of potential backwater the boundary of extreme flood water level either the boundary of the artificially drained area or the boundary of the closed basin lake individual types of potential reservoirs have been distinguished owing to the purpose of the method which is management of the msa aquatic environment the following steps of the algorithm will be discussed below 2 2 1 identification of one of two types of morphological basins in msas the boundary of the artificially drained area the closed basin lake and additionally the inundated area inside from the point of view of identification of mining induced damage in the msa aquatic environment the following important analyses must always be performed identification of the transformation of the msa surface relief in the form of morphological basins resulting from mining subsidence identification the mining induced transformation of the msa which caused changes in the hydroisolating features of the layer which was but is not now and or cannot be in the future the aquifer bottom identification of the changes in surface water flows identification of the changes in groundwater flows in order to identify the above aspects it is necessary to carry out hydrological and hydrogeological analyzes as well as geological and mining analyzes of msas the first goal of these analyzes is identification of artificially drained morphological basins potential reservoirs the second goal is to qualify them to one of two types 1 the closed basin lake or the morphological basin covered by 2 the boundary of the artificially drained area the third goal is to forecast 3 inundated areas inside the identified morphological basin fig 3 fig 4 the main goal of hydrogeological and geological mining analyzes is to identify the hydroisolating properties of the subsurface layers of the rock mass of the msa and in particular the bedrock of the bowls of potential reservoirs a special way to differentiate morphological basins on the surface of msas is necessary in relation to changes in surface and underground water flows revealing themselves and changing within their boundaries from the impact of mining exploitation the direct reason for distinguishing between two types of morphological basins was the need to identify mining induced damage in an aquatic environment the lack of flooding of the surface morphological basins may result from natural reasons or from artificial drainage accompanying mining discontinuance of artificial drainage will inevitably be accompanied by surface flooding which is a form of mining induced damage hence the differentiation of the types of morphological basins in msas must take this fact into account it should be emphasized that the range of both types of morphological basins is the same this range is delineated by a land contour line with an elevation equal to the overflow level of surface waters from the morphological basin characteristic for the morphology of the morphological basin bowl and the place or places of overflow of surface waters fig 3 both types of morphological basins differ only in the probability of their entire surface being flooded after the restoration of natural water flows the first type of morphological basin that is highlighted is encompassed by the boundary of the artificially drained area the innovative term the boundary of the artificially drained area is the range of possible flooding of the artificially drained morphological basin corresponding to filling it with water to the overflow and outflow level of waters characteristic for the morphology of its bowl and the place of water outflow figs 3 and 4 areas covered by the boundary of the artificially drained area are characterized by a high probability of occurrence of flooding permanent flooding after restoration of natural water flows this type of morphological basin occurs in msas characterized by the hydroisolating properties of rocks that form the reservoir s bowl it consists of a layer formed mostly of clays and loams whose thickness and lithological structure ensure hydroisolating properties despite the mining impact on it often this applies to mining areas characterized by a hydrogeologically insulating type of overburden this type of morphological basin may be characterized by the presence of insignificant subsurface outflow of surface waters that does not affect the qualification of the potential reservoir as the type the closed basin lake the flooded bottom of this morphological basin in msas is called an inundated area figs 3 fig 4 fig 5 the range of the inundated area within the boundary of the artificially drained area results only from the use of forced water transfer pumping and the location of suction bins of pumping stations fig 4 the second distinguished type of morphological basin is the closed basin lake the concept the closed basin lake is a type of morphological basin characterized by the probability of the occurrence inside its boundaries of an occasional water reservoir whose existence and the changeability of its range under natural conditions results solely from the variability of natural conditions free flows and water stages as well as atmospheric and groundwater conditions etc closed basin lakes are characterized by low probability of flooding occasional flooding of their entire surface area fig 5 this type of morphological basin occurs in msas characterized by the non hydroisolating properties of rocks that form the reservoir s bowl most often they consist of alluvial layers of sand and or gravel drainage into mining excavations cannot be the only direction of water outflow from the closed basin lake by definition closed basin lakes are not artificially drained morphological basins in which the absence and or limited flooding results only from the occurrence of water transfer by means of pumping stations and or mining drainage the basic characteristic of the closed basin lake is the occurrence of natural subsurface outflow of its surface waters in special cases coexistence of natural drainage mining induced drainage of water to mine workings and forced water flows to the surface pumping stations in closed basin lakes is possible discontinuance of mining drainage may cause a reduction in scale of subsurface outflow of waters from the closed basin lake this in turn may affect the extent of flooding of its bottom it depends on the lithology of rocks under the bowl of the closed basin lake and the hydrogeological conditions prevailing in the substratum of its bowl including the depth of the base of the first aquifer flooding in the bottom visible water table of the closed basin lake in the msa can be classified as an inundated area the commonly used term the inundated area corresponds to the accumulation of waters resulting from the impact of mining operations on the surface of the msa its range results directly from existing conditions either natural and or forced flows of surface and underground water figs 4 and 5 their range under natural conditions depends on the elevation of the base level of natural outflow of water from the closed basin lake the elevation configuration of the base of the first aquifer and the scale of natural drainage at this point it should be noted that inadequate identification of geological mining conditions regarding for example the oldest and shallowest mining operations results in a correspondingly inadequate diagnosis of hydrogeological conditions therefore in this method the rule is to adopt the most unfavorable worst case scenario for possible flooding of the msa this applies in particular to the range of the inundated area inside the closed basin lake it is projected on the numerical model of the base of the first aquifer assuming the existence of large water resources in the analyzed catchment area in cases of inadequate geological identification of the rocks forming the substratum under the bowl of morphological basin and inadequate recognition of geological and mining conditions under conditions of forced drainage of the surface waters it is more appropriate to classify this morphological basin as a potential reservoir covered by the boundary of the artificially drained area and not as a closed basin lake restoration of natural water flows in msas coupled with execution of simultaneous hydrotechnical drainage works may generally result in complete elimination of flooding when the bottom of the morphological basin is characterized by positive relative elevations and or the emergence of an inundated area within a morphological basin and or the expansion of an inundated area within a morphological basin figs 3 and 4 depending on the scale of the hydrotechnical works performed the inundated area may reach an intermediate state between the boundary of potential backwater and the boundary of the artificially drained area the boundary of the closed basin lake this topic is described in more detail in chapter 2 3 1 which contains a description of the bierun ii msa fig 2 2 2 2 introduction of hydrometric reference points and the boundaries of potential backwater according to this method the most important hydromorphological element of the artificially drained environment of mining and post mining areas msas are the hydrometric reference points designated for individual catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa hydrometric reference points normal and conditional are located at the intersections of the boundary of msa with the axis of the main watercourses draining the msa the defining condition for determining their elevation is the existence of free flow of water of this watercourse downstream from the msa the normal hydrometric reference point is a type of hydrometric reference point whose elevation corresponds to the elevation of the base level of the natural outflow of water from the msa rounded up to the value of the contour line on the spatial hydromorphological map of the msa the conditional hydrometric reference point is a type of hydrometric reference point whose elevation is the designated normal average water level after deepening as a result of hydrotechnical works and or subsidence due to mining exploitation of the neighboring mineral deposits rounded up to the value of the contour line on the spatial hydromorphological map of the msa usually they are both rounded up to the nearest whole number expressed in meters above sea level fig 6 the adoption of the above definition is a precondition for monitoring the average water levels of all main watercourses draining the msa at the gravitational outflow of their waters at the msa boundary the location of hydrometric reference points the author carried out such monitoring on the bierawka river in poland from 2001 to 2017 in a place where the riverbed experienced a subsidence of more than 18 m in this section of the riverbed there is a hydraulic balance between the erosion and sedimentation processes of material transported by water despite ongoing subsidence the introduction of a hydrometric reference point allows identifying the most important type of potential reservoir on the surface of msa this is the boundary of the potential backwater it is the range of possible flooding in the artificially drained morphological basin corresponding to filling it with water to the elevation of the hydrometric reference point specifically analyzed and determined for each catchment area of the main watercourses draining the msa this type of potential reservoir represents the minimum surface area of permanent flooding inside the msa which will arise after the restoration of natural water flows together with the simultaneous construction of necessary hydrotechnical deepening works of the beds of watercourses inside the msa the validation of the above is described in detail in a separate article 26 2 2 3 mapping the relief of the msa by means of relative elevations the adoption of a designated normal or conditional hydrometric reference point for parts of the catchment area covered by the analyzed msa allows projecting the surface of this catchment area on a map by means of elevations relative to the hydrometric reference point figs 3 fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 this clearly identifies the parts of msas threatened by permanent flooding 26 elevations of hydrometric reference points above sea level can become significant environmental protection policy aspects of msas one facet of the environmental policy in active msas may be the management of the use of relative elevations of their surface 14 28 2 2 4 identification of the boundary of extreme flood water level and strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by flooding in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in msas low probability of surface flooding occasional flooding is attributed to potential reservoirs covered by the boundary of extreme flood water level and beyond its boundaries strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by 100 year floods identification of only 100 year and 200 year waters is not enough to assess the true extent of mining induced damage to the msa aquatic environment hence for flood management of the msa surface it is better to use the innovative term the boundary of the extreme flood water level it marks the range of possible flooding of the artificially drained morphological basin not smaller than described by the boundary of the potential backwater and corresponding to the highest water stage of the main watercourse draining the msa at the place of outflow of waters from the msa figs 6 and 7 such a definition of this potential reservoir results from the hydrological conditions in the lower part of the msa and its similarity to the properties of the potential reservoir encompassed by the boundary of the potential backwater the reason for adopting such a definition of this hydromorphological element of msa is the need to monitor high water levels of the main watercourse draining the msa in place of gravitational outflow at the msa boundary the location of hydrometric reference point the author while working at the mine conducted such monitoring during the passage of flood waves on the bierawka river in szczyglowice msa in 1997 and 2010 the years of the last two major floods in poland the last of these measurements was carried out at a water gauge installed in the riverbed on an once an hour cycle due to the fact that the largest floods which concerned the majority of msas in poland took place some time ago i e in 1997 the determination of the elevation of its extreme wave will have to be made on the basis of local visual inspection by searching for traces of big water as well as conversations with the inhabitants of the area msa adjacent to the hydrometric reference point after measuring and setting the elevation of this wave using the traces of big water on surface objects it is important to increase this elevation by the amount of established mining subsidence of the measured objects a special feature of this hydromorphological element of the artificially drained environment of the msa should be emphasized it is the identification of surface water pumping stations in mining areas the rationale for locating pumping stations in local bottoms of morphological basins is the outflow of waters from the first aquifer the level of this water is lowered by means of pumping using the example of bierun ii msa fig 6 as many as 8 out of 9 surface pumping stations are located within the boundary of the extreme flood water level in special cases i e lack of archival data on floods and possible significant changes in the hydrological conditions of watercourse bed after the most recently measured big flood lack of natural water flows this potential reservoir may be set using known hydrological modeling 500 year water flowing naturally at the place of outflow from the msa such hydrological modeling applies in cases where construction of large flood retention reservoirs or other hydrotechnical works can have a significant impact on the height of the flood waves of the main watercourse draining the msa at the place of water outflow identification of the elevation of the extreme historical flood water stage becomes the basis for marking on the spatial hydromorphological map of the msa all the contour lines in the catchment area of the analyzed main watercourse draining the msa the elevation of the contour line corresponds to the elevation of the extreme historical flood stage also forming separate reservoirs they determine the boundary of the extreme flood water level in analyzed separate catchment areas of the main watercourse draining the msa figs 6 and 7 this step is repeated separately for each catchment area of the main watercourse draining the msa the scope of occasional flooding described by the boundary of the extreme flood water level was validated in chapter 2 3 1 the essence of determining the line corresponding to the boundary of the extreme flood water level identified and marked on the spatial hydromorphological map is the indication of natural or artificial places of possible water flow between potential reservoirs surrounded by contour lines with an elevation corresponding to the historical flood stage this applies to places whose lowering as a result of projected mining subsidence and or planned hydrotechnical works and or other engineering works may lead to real flows of water in these places during high water stages the indicated places of water flows may be either alluvial sediments of the permeable substratum which occur between zones covered by the boundaries of extreme flood water level or for example damaged levees and or poorly compacted road embankments which do not constitute hydraulic barriers the importance of this hydromorphological element of environment of the msa is justified by the fact that the flood crests of great catastrophic waters can only be slightly reduced as a result of hydrotechnical deepening works of the bed of watercourse the cubic volume of the extreme flood wave together with the retention capacity of morphological basins magnifying and deepening of the artificially drained surface of the msas is also important for the assessment of flood hazards this method assumes the worst possible scenario of flooding i e it assumes that the volume of the extreme flood wave will be greater than the retention capacity of morphological basins in the msa such a definition of this potential reservoir usually ensures that the boundary of extreme flood water level will encompass strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by 100 year water in all identified morphological basins this particularly applies to the lower parts of catchment areas located in the msa and characterized by low relative elevations of the surface in the upper parts of these catchment areas this type of potential reservoir may no longer encompass all areas threatened by 100 year water it should be added here that there exist msas drained by small surface watercourses characterized by small flood water culminations in which the boundaries of extreme flood water level coincide with the boundaries of potential backwater due to the above to fully present the threat of flooding in the upper those having higher relative elevations parts of catchment areas of the msa it is necessary to additionally identify strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by 100 year water strips of land threatened by such water should be identified and mapped on the spatial hydromorphological map outside the zones covered by the boundary of extreme flood water level fig 5 in the upper parts of the msa it makes no real sense to examine higher than 100 year water due to the possibility of reducing the risk of flooding through building flood embankments the flood scenario adopted for this analysis should correspond to a low probability of flooding occurrence as defined in the local water law in force in the country where this method is carried out 2 2 5 zoning of artificially drained surfaces of msas for mine planning mining damage repair and surface spatial development purposes based on the author s thirty years of first hand experiences in continuous monitoring the floods and environmental protection and management of mining damage repairs on the surface of underground hard coal mines in the uscb in poland a specific way of zoning of artificially drained surfaces of msas was developed this specifically defined way of zoning is simultaneously based on rating the flood threat and taking into account the possibilities and setting the guidelines for the elimination of this flood threat by repairing the mining induced damage to this transformed msa aquatic environment such repairs could consist of hydrotechnical deepening works and or projected mining subsidences the entire area of the analyzed msa should always be zoned figs 6 and 9 the catchment areas of individual main watercourses draining the msa are categorized separately it should be noted that the possibility of eliminating and or reducing the threat of surface flooding of the analyzed msas does not only result from the type of potential reservoir that covers these areas the relief of the surface of the morphological basin and the hydrological conditions in its vicinity determine the specific intermutual penetration of the boundaries of potential reservoirs of various types occurring in the morphological basin fig 8 hence a parameter the basis for rating the threat of this method of zoning the surface of the msas has become the probability of flooding of potential reservoirs resulting from the occurrence and or restoration of natural water flows and the future construction of drainage works the boundaries of potential reservoirs and watersheds projected on a spatial hydromorphological map of the msa most often become the boundaries of changes of flood hazard category of mining areas a four level scale is proposed for zoning msas the highest category iv concerns permanent flooding of msas the lowest category i refers to mining areas in which there were no or only insignificant transformations of the aquatic environment critically important for the needs of spatial development changes of these areas finally attention should also be paid to the rule which consists of assigning areas that lay inside a potential reservoir with lower relative elevations above the hydrometric reference point a higher probability of flooding and areas with a higher relative elevations a lower probability of flooding this fact could become a reason for additional rating to more than 4 categories of the flood hazard into such parts of potential reservoirs the complexity of the factors constituting the threat of flooding of the separated hydromorphological elements of the msa environment is a premise for the lack of additional gradation of the threat of flooding of their parts potential reservoirs characterized by different flood hazards category i flood hazard is proposed for those parts of msas which were subject to mining transformations and in which the restoration of natural water flows will cause insignificant changes in the hydrogeological conditions of the subsurface layer of the rock mass and for which there is no basis for classification higher than category i flood hazard these areas are characterized by changes to the waterlogging of the bedrock below such waterlogging is insignificant for spatial development purposes the scale of surface relief transformation as a result of mining subsidences did not lead to damage to the aquatic environment that would require repairs designation no 8 in fig 8 category ii flood hazard is proposed for those parts of msas which include mining areas that are or will be covered by the boundaries of the extreme flood water level and or the closed basin lakes others than those included in category i and or strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by flooding excluding from them areas classified higher than category ii of flood hazard these areas are characterized by a low probability of the occurrence of flooding occasional flooding designation no 9 in fig 8 category iii flood hazard is proposed for mining areas that are or will be covered by the boundaries of the artificially drained area with the exception of areas included in category iv flood hazard as well as additionally parts of inundated areas characterized by inventoried positive relative elevations of their bottom these areas are characterized by a high probability of occurrence of flooding permanent flooding designation no 10 in fig 8 mining areas proposed for category iv flood hazard designation no 11 in fig 8 are those that are or will be covered after the restoration of natural water flows by the boundaries of potential backwater and or waterlogging and or inundated areas with the exception of those parts of inundated areas classified in the category iii flood hazard the mining areas under category iv flood hazard should additionally include land strips necessary for conducting hydrotechnical gravitational drainage works these areas are and or will be flooded and or waterlogged in the future once natural free water flows have been restored and necessary hydrotechnical gravitational drainage works have been carried out to determine whether the infrastructure real estate buildings etc in mining areas have suffered damage in the form of a threat of flooding previously non existent due to the impact of mining their category of flood hazard must increase during the time period of mining impact the true extent of mining induced damage can be fully identified by comparing time oriented msa spatial hydromorphological maps of the msa surface relief for example figs 6 and 9 repair of mining induced damage to the msa aquatic environment and in particular damage in the form of a threat of flooding to real estate buildings etc despite the fact that they were not flooded requires a separate and broad discussion a preliminary reference to this issue is in chapter 2 3 1 2 3 results and discussion 2 3 1 frameworks for assessing permanent and extreme flooding in the msa in the context of drainage works the discussion of the framework of permanent and occasional flooding for the current state of surface relief will be based on the example of the bierun ii msa in uscb in poland the uscb is characterized by damp continental climatic conditions with mean temperatures of 8 c the annual mean precipitation is 650 mm precipitation occurs mainly during summer the highest precipitation totals during heavy rainfall events recorded over periods of several days were the direct cause of the biggest floods in poland in the 20th century in many cases exceeding 400 mm 29 in the central part of this msa loam disappears and the carboniferous overburden is hydrogeologically non insulating in the morphology of the surface in the central part of this msa there are hills with outcrops of the carboniferous layers the potential reservoirs identified at the southern boundary of the msa have the character of closed basin lakes where surface water largely drains to mine excavations there are no surface water pumping stations and no inundated areas fig 9 the largest subsidence basin revealed itself in the northwest corner of this msa figs 9 and 10 it generated a morphological basin in this region which currently has a depth depression of 7 m due to the miocene loam under its bowl in the carboniferous overburden this potential reservoir is marked by the boundary of the artificially drained area it has a span exceeding about 4 km once natural water flows are restored the entire surface of this potential reservoir will turn into an inundated area currently surface watercourses flowing to the bottom of this basin are collected in local inundated areas and transferred by means of 6 pumping stations to surface watercourses gravitationally flowing in the vicinity of this potential reservoir fig 9 hence the mining induced damages in the form of inundated areas revealed so far are small due to artificial drainage only the minimum surface of this potential reservoir retention reservoirs at pumping stations has become flooded inside the described potential reservoir the old beds of local watercourses have inverted longitudinal slopes and these watercourses have long lost their hydraulic relationship with their original collector of water the natural and previous collector of water from this potential reservoir the mleczna river flows on the west side of the boundary of artificially drained area normal water stages on the section of the riverbed near the potential reservoir are 7 10 m above the bottom of the described basin in this river there are occasional flood waves 1 9 m height which do not flood the river valley including this potential reservoir due to the existing flood embankments similarly the golawiecki stream flows on the eastern side of this morphological basin normal water stages on the section of the watercourse bad in the vicinity of this basin are from 2 5 to 10 m above the bottom of the described basin characterizing the described potential reservoir by attributes the relative elevations of the bowl s shoreline overflow level is 12 5 m and its bottom 5 0 m above the hydrometric reference point hence within this basin the boundary of potential backwater is not marked the normal hydrometric reference point mapped on the msa boundary at the place of the vistula river outflow is about 7 7 km away from the analyzed basin bottom fig 9 the spatial hydromorphological map of this msa fig 9 indicates the presence of natural hills south of the boundary of this potential reservoir between them the terrain rises to a relative elevation of 16 m in turn the lowest relative elevation of the watershed line that occurs beyond the eastern boundary of this potential reservoir has a relative elevation of 13 7 m i e only 1 2 m above its shoreline the latter data indicates that the progressing mining subsidence may lead to the connection of the described reservoir with another occurring in the central part of the northern boundary of msa this other large potential reservoir lies in the catchment area of the golawiecki stream fig 10 boundaries of extreme flood water level have been identified in many potential reservoirs of this msa fig 9 because the golawiedzki stream flows gravitationally into the vistula river the backflow of the vistula flows into it this forced the need to build levees along the golawiecki stream they divide this basin into two separate potential reservoirs fig 10 wishing to characterize the range of mining areas threatened by occasional flooding it should be stated that due to the large volume of vistula river flood waves the backflow of this largest polish river will always flood the valleys of all its tributaries that are hydraulically connected with it the justification for the above thesis is a comparison of the capacity of these parts of all post mining morphological basins that may be flooded by the vistula backflow about 25 million cubic meters with the volume of the extreme flood wave of the vistula river at this point of the catchment area during last big flood about 2500 million cubic meters between july 07 1997 and july 21 1997 29 the capacity of potential reservoirs in this msa is incomparably smaller than the volumes of extreme flood waves at this point it is worth discussing the details of determining the elevation of the extreme flood water level for the bierun ii msa it is no accident that cyclic hydrometric measurements of the biggest polish river the vistula flowing along the boundary of this msa are conducted by the polish institute of meteorology and water management at the nowy bierun water gauge section the catchment area of this river in the place of the water gauge is 1748 square km analysis of measured changes in river water stages from 1981 to 2019 confirms that there is a hydraulic balance between the erosion and sedimentation processes of material transported by water floods identified during this time period which were not the largest recorded were characterized by the following extremes 246 cm 1994 325 cm 1998 327 cm 2013 the largest floods in this msa occurred in 1997 and 2010 the culmination wave of 09 07 1997 was about 3 m higher than mentioned above and reached 597 cm while the peak of 20 05 2010 was very similar and differed only by 12 cm and amounted to 585 cm fig 11 the elevation of the extreme flood wave from 1997 was used to identify the range of this msa s occasional flooding the boundary of extreme flood water level it is worth showing the extent of backflow of the big water in the vistula valley in the region where another large river flows into it the przemsza river the national water management authority in warsaw has developed flood hazard maps that cover the valleys of both rivers in the analyzed msa they identified the table of 500 year water of the vistula river at the place of water outflow from this msa km 921 250 which was 232 43 m above sea level as well as the table of 500 year water of the przemsza river the tributary of the vistula at the place of inflow of the river s waters to the analyzed msa km 6 200 amounted to 232 62 m above sea level these measurements about 6 5 km distant from each other differ only by 19 cm www isok gov pl field surveys conducted by the author in this msa confirmed that the 500 year water of 2010 flooded all the boundaries of extreme flood water levels the above confirms the validity of the concept of the boundary of extreme flood water level adopted to describe occasional floods in this method this method assumption is of key importance for assessing the relationship between possible flood damage and mining impact adopting the largest of the great waters in the method allows for good identification of areas under threat of occasional flooding and identification of mining damage in the form of a threat of flooding to either developed and or undeveloped real estate in the lower part of the msa that is those having low relative elevations of the surface all smaller floods will mostly be within the boundary of extreme flood water level this is well illustrated by fig 11 it depends of course on the morphing of the msa surface fig 9 it is worth emphasizing here that a different approach to the assessment of flood threat in the lower part of msa than in the upper part of msa does not pose special problems in terms of repairing mining induced damage referring to chapter 2 2 4 in the upper part of the msa that is those having higher relative elevations of the surface the occurrence of large watercourses with large fluctuations in water stages requires the use of standard hydrological modeling of 100 year water if the identified threat of such a flood concerns construction objects and infrastructure flood embankments are being built as part of preventive and repair works fig 10 in the case of breaking the close hydraulic relationship of the water behind the levies with the previous collector of water these waters can always flow away from there and or be directed through hydrotechnical works to the lower part of the msa the spatial hydromorphological map of the current state of the bierun ii msa indicates that within the largest of the analyzed basins no boundaries of potential backwater have been identified fig 10 due to the above it is theoretically possible to gravitationally drain the analyzed basin in a way that eliminates the occurrence of an inundated area positive relative elevations of the bottom however one should be aware that such a direction of possible repairs of mining induced damage would require the construction of a new water channel and or deep storm drainage systems each method and direction of gravitational drainage of this potential reservoir results in the occurrence of such occasional flooding inside it the boundaries of extreme flood water level any plans for draining this potential reservoir west to the bed of the mleczna river or east to the golawiecki stream will always result in an inundated area within it it is worth emphasizing that the range of an inundated area and or areas will result from possible plans for deepening the beds of these watercourses in this identified potential reservoir the range of future inundated areas will not be less than the boundaries of extreme flood water level this allows the assessment of the feasibility and the setting of legal guidelines for mining induced damage repairs by future hydrotechnical and reclamation works 3 conclusion flooding is the most determinant factor of the impact of mining on the environment due to the occurrence of artificial drainage during exploitation of minerals the true extent of mining induced damage in the aquatic environment is not fully revealed on the surface of msas this can result in the lack of ongoing repairs of the true extent of mining induced damage in the form of a threat of flooding by mining entities the use of the term the threat of flooding is directly linked to the surface of the msa which are threatened by flooding after restoration of natural surface and underground water flows applicable local water laws allow artificial drainage of mining and post mining areas but in many countries existing laws require that natural water flows should be restored by mining entities or their legal successors in the process of mine closures such action is tantamount to a restoration of the previous state in the sense of repair of damage to the environment and to real estate either developed and or undeveloped however the scale of aquatic environment transformations can be so large that it will not be possible to restore natural water flows in all regions of post mining areas for this reason in mining and post mining areas where forced drainage takes place it should be necessary to supervise and control the range of flooding and the threat of flooding simultaneously with appropriate spatial planning this method of assessing the threat of flooding of artificially drained msas is a hydromorphological and cartographic method of hydrological modeling based on a special mapping of the surface area of a single msa where 5 types of potential reservoirs were identified in a schematic manner schematization of hydrological modeling of water in the catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa is based on the characteristic water stages at the place of surface water outflow from the msa it takes into account different hydrogeological conditions in these parts of separate catchment areas of main watercourses draining the mining post mining areas which are located inside the msa the essence of this method is the constancy of the msa aquatic environment s two main elements the elevation of the hydrometric reference point and the elevation of the extreme flood water level this approach makes it possible to identify both permanent and occasional flooding on the msa surface after the restoration of natural water flows and after the process of limiting the threat of flooding on the msa surface limiting the threat of flooding consists of hydrotechnical deepening works and projected mining subsidences of the base level of natural outflow of water from potential reservoirs the end result of this method is a spatial hydromorphological map of the msa which identifies the true extent of mining induced damage to the aquatic environment in the form of a threat of flooding resulting from cessation of artificial drainage of the msa based on the ranges of potential reservoirs four categories of the threat of flooding are proposed for zoning the entire area of the msa elements of this method in particular the hydrometric reference points can and should become significant aspects of environmental policy for water management governing bodies environmental managers local government and state authorities responsible for issuing mining concessions as well as for mining supervisory authorities and commercial mining entities the relative elevation of the surface better describes the possibility of natural drainage of the msa surface than the absolute elevation above the sea level method used until now relative elevations of the surface of the msa are a simple and effective management tool for planning inevitable flooding granting legal consent to fixed scale mining operations as well as monitoring and controlling the process of the subsidence of the msas relative elevations simplify the definition of a permissible framework for excessive mining subsidence i e those that cause permanent surface flooding after restoration of natural water flows using relative elevations in the processes of quantitative evaluation for extraction of mineral resources allows for balancing the transformation of msa aquatic environment with the needs of spatial development and environmental protection the principle is to allow for mining subsidence of any point of the msa s surface but it must not exceed its relative elevation above the adopted hydrometric reference point reduced by the difference of the surface elevations between this point and the hydrometric reference point this is necessary to ensure gravitational drainage of this surface point this topic requires a separate and broader discussion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8770,the effects of mining apart from surface subsidences and deformations are forced flows of surface and underground waters lasting many decades in the mining areas natural water flows should be restored by mining entities and or their legal successors in the process of the mine closures such action is tantamount to a restoration of the previous state in the sense of repair of damage to the environment and surface infrastructure then under natural water flows conditions such mining areas may become flooded often quite extensively this paper describes a comprehensive method for flood threat assessment of artificially drained mining and post mining areas after the restoration of natural water flows the subject of this research is the surface of a single mine subsidence area the term mine subsidence area msa is defined as that part of the rock mass containing solid mineral deposits and the above surface affected by continuous and discountinuous deformation as currently legally defined in terms of range and intensity this method together with simultaneous measurements of water levels at outflow places at the msa boundary allows for an useful way of mapping the msa surface this has been developed to fully identify the true extent of mining induced damage to the msa aquatic environment it introduces innovative hydromorphological elements of the msa these allow zoning of the msa surface while taking into consideration future drainage works and or projected mining subsidences inside the msa these spatial hydromorphological maps of the msa identify the framework of permanent and occasional flooding and constitute the final result of this method it is an universal tool for sustainable water management and quantitative evaluation for extraction of minerals keywords flood hazard mining area mine subsidence area mining induced damage hydromorphological element water management zoning 1 introduction subsidence and deformation of the msa surface along with damage to surface infrastructure is a direct result of the impact of underground mining they have been described many times by authors from different countries throughout the world 1 4 also forced groundwater and surface water flows are a common consequence of mining they accompany the extraction of minerals but they can often last much longer decades or even centuries as a result the msa water environment is inseparably subject to forced changes they were described among others by 5 11 the main reason for the necessity of artificial drainage of mining areas is the mining exploitation of minerals which requires drainage of deposits and mining excavations in cases where mineral deposit are covered with a hydrogeologically non insulating overburden a large part of the surface water infiltrates into mine works causing the surface to dry out an additional reason for the occurrence of artificial drainage of mining areas may be preventive works involving the transfer of surface water by means of pumping stations the need for this may result from underground mining exploitation the voids in the rock mass formed after mining generate a collapse of nearby rocks the effect of this is that the rock mass settles at the place level of mineral extraction up to the land surface the resulting deformations of the mining area surface take the form of morphological basins in cases where water stagnating in these basins threatens to inrush into the mine works and or floods the surface infrastructure of the mining area mining entities limit this flooding by using forced water transfer by pumping such pumping stations provide temporary protection of surface infrastructure and allow mining exploitation under specific hydrological and hydrogeological conditions in a mine subsidence area msa environment the existence of forced water flows pumping is the main reason why the true extent of mining induced damage is not fully revealed including damage to the msa aquatic environment in connection with the above commercial mining enterprises repair only revealed visible damages on an ongoing basis the mine closure process should be accompanied by restoration of natural free water flows after discontinuance of mine dewatering underground pumping of hydraulically connected mines and turning off surface pumping stations such conditions will cause inevitable new damage to appear in msas 12 only then will the true extent of mining induced damage be fully revealed in particular damages to the aquatic environment instead of the previously drained elements of the msa environment the rock mass may become saturated by water and the surface may become flooded but this state rarely occurs due to the need to safeguard hydraulically connected active mines against the danger of uncontrolled water incursions and or inflows this is the reason for continuous use of forced pumping systems of water in closed mines in the upper silesian coal basin uscb in poland fig 1 transformation of the aquatic environment has been going on for well over 200 years in more than one hundred mining and post mining areas this aspect is particularly important due to the closure and or abandonment of the majority of mines and the closure of commercial mining entities whose mining induced damages were not repaired hence there is a lack of not only construction projects for drainage works limitation and or elimination of flooding and or the threat of flooding but even worst lack of any planning in this field this fact is of paramount importance for hydrological modelling of surface waters in mining areas today transformations of the aquatic environment affect countless mineral resource basins around the world 13 this is evidenced by the example of a single basin the uscb in poland where the range of hydrogeologically and hydrologically transformed surfaces of mining areas cover an area of several hundred square kilometers the surface subsidence of the mining area of the underground knurow szczyglowice coal mine where the author of this article worked exceeded 25 m such a scale of subsidence means that a single morphological basin potential reservoir can even cover the entire msa in the uscb the average msa span diameter is about 7 km there are known cases of mining areas in the world where these basins are many times as large the surfaces of many potential reservoirs are often highly urbanized limited flooding of their bottoms is directly caused by artificial transfer of water by using pumping stations and or mining drainage the dimensions of these potential reservoirs in active mining areas change recurrently over time these changes are often characterized by increased depth and diameter sometimes even connecting to neighboring basins inside them the extent of surface infrastructure threatened by flooding increases mining induced damage in the form of flooding and or the threat of flooding is the most determinant factor in the transformation of mining and post mining areas in general they cause irreversible degradation of the surface occasional flooding may necessitate changes in some goals of spatial development and land use permanent flooding may necessitate the need to completely change future spatial planning strategies if there is no plan for permanent artificial drainage of msas and depending on local law such areas will require the dismantling of the infrastructure not adapted for flooding both above and below ground and reclamation of the land surface for the above mentioned reasons artificial drying of the surface of mining and post mining areas as permitted by the local water law in force first requires assessing the threat of flooding in such areas such assessments are especially needed to clarify the objectives of this method which are as follows restoring natural water flows in mining areas and responsibly limiting the need of permanent pumping by future owners or caretakers in these areas identification of mining induced damage in the form of a threat of flooding for which restoration of natural water conditions may prove impossible thus necessitating the use forced pumping in perpetuity eventual compensation monetary payment for mining induced damage repair to be paid by mining entities for infrastructure threatened by flooding in areas where this threat cannot be eliminated and in areas where such elimination is not planned identification mining induced damage in the form of a threat of flooding requiring reclamation by planned inundation and or through infilling of these areas using mining waste materials legal differentiation of the changes to the true extent of mining induced damage in the msa aquatic environment caused by current commercial mining entity as opposed to the damage caused by previous mining entities quantitative evaluation for extraction of mineral deposits with special emphasis on sustainable management of the msa aquatic environment 14 the subject of this paper is a description of the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in mining areas for such areas surface flooding is modeled in a specific way i e without detailed drainage plans and refers to the possibility of limiting the flooding through preventive actions such as projected mining subsidences and or construction of hydrotechnical works inside the msa in the content of this article it is important to keep in mind that the use of the term the threat of flooding to the surfaces of the msas is directly linked to the restoration of natural water flow discontinuance of pumping 2 materials and methods currently known hydrological methods of assessing the flood hazard of land surfaces consist in modeling surface water flows and determining the extent of flooding of surface watercourse valleys with flood waves of appropriate probability of occurrence 15 25 most of these methods allow examination of the state of the surface relief current archival and forecast and identification of any potential flooding with its appropriate probability of occurrence it should be noted that in active underground hard coal mines the msa s surface relief is permanently subsided on the basis of the author s experiences the size of these subsidences often exceeds 0 2 m per day and in some areas of the surface may exceed 3 0 m during the year therefore in such msa s the identified surfaces characterized by different flood hazards only have short term validity and relevance a separate issue is the fact that hydrogeological recognition of the msa rock mass characterized by large transformations of the aquatic environment may by itself be very inadequate the shallow mining exploitation of minerals i e characterized by a depth of up to 100 m carried out earlier usually more than 150 years ago e g in uscb in poland is often poorly documented the lack of mining maps does not allow for assessing the scale range and depth of rock mass transformations these results in large modeling errors for groundwater flows and those surface water flows remaining in a hydraulic relationship with groundwater the above is the underlying reason for the development of this specifically defined method for assessing the threat of flooding in mining areas which additionally identifies those parts of potential reservoirs that can possibly be drained repair of mining induced damage hence known hydrological modeling methods are a complement the described method 2 1 the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in the msa the subject of research in this method is the surface of a single msa whose boundaries were determined separately by the mining concession decision for a single mining entity by the term mine subsidence area msa for solid mineral deposits the author understands those parts of the rock mass and the surface in the vicinity of exploited deposits in particular those parts subject to continuous and discontinuous deformations as currently legally defined in terms of range and intensity for a full understanding of the content of this article it should be mentioned that the above definition of msa is not a concept commonly used in the global mining community this should be distinguished from the term commonly used in english language hydrogeology mining subsidence area which may refer to many neighboring msas many mines and sometimes the entire mining sub region the specificity of the terminology referred to in this article also distinguishes the concept of msa from another commonly used term mining area the author drew the understanding of the last term mining area from polish geological and mining law which specifically and unequivocally describes 3d volumes not the surface area of the rock mass in which mining works can be carried out exploitation of mineral resources fig 2 the detailed subject of this analysis may be a numerical model of terrain nmt and or a situational contour map and orthophotomaps that project the analyzed state of a surface relief archival or current or forecasted the necessary materials for analysis also include data on storm water drainage gravitationally dewatering the surface of the analyzed msa in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of flood threat assessment it is necessary to separately analyze each individual catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa by the term the main watercourses draining the msa the author understands each naturally flowing watercourse that crosses the boundary of the msa at the place of outflow 26 in special cases it may also be a channeled surface and or an underground stream on surfaces located inside the msa separate studies are carried out on their state and environmental changes by means of newly formulated and innovative hydromorphological elements of the msa environment relative to the adopted reference system the hydrometric reference point by hydromorphological elements of the msa environment the author understands the inanimate components of the environment the characteristics of which allow the identification of the state and changes of the aquatic environment of the msa special elements of research on the surface of the msa are morphological basins in the environment of artificially drained msas morphological basins are characterized by the threat of flooding that may occur after the restoration of natural water flows if mining and post mining areas are girdled hemmed in by the boundary of a morphological basin as a result of surface subsidence then the threat of flooding occurring inside them is a tangible form of mining induced damage hence the main purpose of this method of assessing the threat of flooding is to identify the morphological basins and all types of potential reservoirs within them this article describes commonly known elements of the environment related to water or possible flooding and or significantly affecting water in particular there are surface waters natural ponds lakes watercourses and artificial inundated areas watersheds water facilities ditches artificial riverbeds embankments and levies locks valves water pumping stations waterlogging of the mining areas and the depth of the first aquifer the innovative hydromorphological elements of the msa environment are base level of natural outflow of water normal hydrometric reference point conditional hydrometric reference point relative elevation of the surface of the msa 26 closed basin lake and four ranges boundaries of flooding inundated area boundary of artificially drained area boundary of extreme flood water level the boundary of potential backwater the subject of the analyses also includes detailed information on separate catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa consisting of the necessary meteorological geological hydrogeological and mining data this data should in particular enable the use of selected hydrological models for modeling strips of lands threatened by 100 and 500 year water 2 2 algorithm for the hydromorphological and cartographic method for assessing the threat of flooding in msas the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding of the msa 27 is a cartographic method of researching analyzing and modeling of the completed and forecasted changes in the hydromorphological elements of the msa by means of special so called spatial hydromorphological maps reflecting the range of these elements relative to the identified and adopted reference systems this method was formulated on the basis gained through first hand experience with flooding on the surface of szczyglowice msa located in uscb in poland the author during his work on the mine participated in all cyclical monitoring of surface waters carried out throughout the period of mining impact this monitoring included measurements of the levels of normal and occasional flood waters in five artificially drained regions of the msa the effect of large scale mine subsidence experienced by the lower section of the bierawka river bed in the szczyglowice msa is a reduction of the initial longitudinal slope of water level to a critical value of 0 01 at a bump in the riverbed on the boundary of the msa such a minimal slope currently occurs on a 2600 m section of the riverbed between the 39 0th and 41 6th km of the river in this section the water is constantly silting the bottom of the riverbed with material sand transported by the water the depth of the river has been constant for 30 observed years and is about 0 6 m similar stability of normal water levels occurred historically in a section about 1 km longer both in the riverbed and its tributaries current changes in the river s slope resulted among others from regulation of the riverbed a similar decrease in the slopes of surface watercourses above their outflow points from the msa s occurs in the riverbeds of many main watercourses draining such areas which have experienced significant mining impacts and still maintain gravitational water flows similar permanent flooding of the valleys of surface watercourses in the uscb were also identified among others on the section of 2000 m from 917 5th to 919 5th km of the vistula river and the section of 3500 m from 0 0th to 3 5th km of the pszemsza river a tributary of the vistula river in the bierun ii mining area the section of 3300 m from 55 7th to 59 0th km of the klodnica river a tributary of the odra river in the makoszowy post mining area on the 1200 m section from 6 6th to 7 8th km of the bielszowicki stream a tributary of the klodnica river in the halemba i ii mining area and on the 2400 m section from 3 0th to 5 4th km of the bolina stream in the janow post mining area on these sections of the main watercourses draining the msa the level of the water table is close to the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa the above allowed the author to schematize the hydrological modeling of the surface water of the msa which usually constitute small parts of the overall catchment areas the essence of this method is the constancy of the msa aquatic environment s two main elements the elevation of the hydrometric reference point and the elevation of the extreme flood water level 26 chapter 2 3 1 this method was developed as a tool to study the threat of flooding in mining areas characterized by different hydrogeological types of overburden of deposits both isolating and non isolating fig 1 it was then repeatedly used to study many mining and post mining areas msas in polish coal zinc and lead mines selected examples along with a description of the local geological structure under study are provided in chapter 2 3 1 the algorithm of the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding of artificially drained msa consists on performing the following steps in each separate catchment area of the main watercourses draining the msa described below there are identification of the main watercourses draining the msa and the extent of their catchment areas designation of hydrometric reference points in catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa either normal or conditional mapping of the relief of the msa by means of the relative elevations of the surface relative to the adopted hydrometric reference points identification of historical extreme flood stages on the surface of the msa identification of the ranges of the following three types ranges of potential reservoirs the inundated area the boundary of potential backwater and the boundary of extreme flood water level in each identified morphological basin modeling strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by a 100 year water final zoning the entire surface of the msa with regards to limiting the threat of flooding referring to the reasons for developing this method this specific way of identifying all types of potential reservoirs and final zoning the msa surface takes into account the worst case flooding scenario after the restoration of natural water flows full hydraulic relationship of surface and underground waters catchment analysis is conducted on the surface of mining and post mining areas msa this is done separately in individual catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa and then in each artificially drained morphological basin the described method requires distinguishing 4 ranges of possible flooding boundaries of 4 of 5 types of potential reservoirs the boundary of the inundated area the boundary of potential backwater the boundary of extreme flood water level either the boundary of the artificially drained area or the boundary of the closed basin lake individual types of potential reservoirs have been distinguished owing to the purpose of the method which is management of the msa aquatic environment the following steps of the algorithm will be discussed below 2 2 1 identification of one of two types of morphological basins in msas the boundary of the artificially drained area the closed basin lake and additionally the inundated area inside from the point of view of identification of mining induced damage in the msa aquatic environment the following important analyses must always be performed identification of the transformation of the msa surface relief in the form of morphological basins resulting from mining subsidence identification the mining induced transformation of the msa which caused changes in the hydroisolating features of the layer which was but is not now and or cannot be in the future the aquifer bottom identification of the changes in surface water flows identification of the changes in groundwater flows in order to identify the above aspects it is necessary to carry out hydrological and hydrogeological analyzes as well as geological and mining analyzes of msas the first goal of these analyzes is identification of artificially drained morphological basins potential reservoirs the second goal is to qualify them to one of two types 1 the closed basin lake or the morphological basin covered by 2 the boundary of the artificially drained area the third goal is to forecast 3 inundated areas inside the identified morphological basin fig 3 fig 4 the main goal of hydrogeological and geological mining analyzes is to identify the hydroisolating properties of the subsurface layers of the rock mass of the msa and in particular the bedrock of the bowls of potential reservoirs a special way to differentiate morphological basins on the surface of msas is necessary in relation to changes in surface and underground water flows revealing themselves and changing within their boundaries from the impact of mining exploitation the direct reason for distinguishing between two types of morphological basins was the need to identify mining induced damage in an aquatic environment the lack of flooding of the surface morphological basins may result from natural reasons or from artificial drainage accompanying mining discontinuance of artificial drainage will inevitably be accompanied by surface flooding which is a form of mining induced damage hence the differentiation of the types of morphological basins in msas must take this fact into account it should be emphasized that the range of both types of morphological basins is the same this range is delineated by a land contour line with an elevation equal to the overflow level of surface waters from the morphological basin characteristic for the morphology of the morphological basin bowl and the place or places of overflow of surface waters fig 3 both types of morphological basins differ only in the probability of their entire surface being flooded after the restoration of natural water flows the first type of morphological basin that is highlighted is encompassed by the boundary of the artificially drained area the innovative term the boundary of the artificially drained area is the range of possible flooding of the artificially drained morphological basin corresponding to filling it with water to the overflow and outflow level of waters characteristic for the morphology of its bowl and the place of water outflow figs 3 and 4 areas covered by the boundary of the artificially drained area are characterized by a high probability of occurrence of flooding permanent flooding after restoration of natural water flows this type of morphological basin occurs in msas characterized by the hydroisolating properties of rocks that form the reservoir s bowl it consists of a layer formed mostly of clays and loams whose thickness and lithological structure ensure hydroisolating properties despite the mining impact on it often this applies to mining areas characterized by a hydrogeologically insulating type of overburden this type of morphological basin may be characterized by the presence of insignificant subsurface outflow of surface waters that does not affect the qualification of the potential reservoir as the type the closed basin lake the flooded bottom of this morphological basin in msas is called an inundated area figs 3 fig 4 fig 5 the range of the inundated area within the boundary of the artificially drained area results only from the use of forced water transfer pumping and the location of suction bins of pumping stations fig 4 the second distinguished type of morphological basin is the closed basin lake the concept the closed basin lake is a type of morphological basin characterized by the probability of the occurrence inside its boundaries of an occasional water reservoir whose existence and the changeability of its range under natural conditions results solely from the variability of natural conditions free flows and water stages as well as atmospheric and groundwater conditions etc closed basin lakes are characterized by low probability of flooding occasional flooding of their entire surface area fig 5 this type of morphological basin occurs in msas characterized by the non hydroisolating properties of rocks that form the reservoir s bowl most often they consist of alluvial layers of sand and or gravel drainage into mining excavations cannot be the only direction of water outflow from the closed basin lake by definition closed basin lakes are not artificially drained morphological basins in which the absence and or limited flooding results only from the occurrence of water transfer by means of pumping stations and or mining drainage the basic characteristic of the closed basin lake is the occurrence of natural subsurface outflow of its surface waters in special cases coexistence of natural drainage mining induced drainage of water to mine workings and forced water flows to the surface pumping stations in closed basin lakes is possible discontinuance of mining drainage may cause a reduction in scale of subsurface outflow of waters from the closed basin lake this in turn may affect the extent of flooding of its bottom it depends on the lithology of rocks under the bowl of the closed basin lake and the hydrogeological conditions prevailing in the substratum of its bowl including the depth of the base of the first aquifer flooding in the bottom visible water table of the closed basin lake in the msa can be classified as an inundated area the commonly used term the inundated area corresponds to the accumulation of waters resulting from the impact of mining operations on the surface of the msa its range results directly from existing conditions either natural and or forced flows of surface and underground water figs 4 and 5 their range under natural conditions depends on the elevation of the base level of natural outflow of water from the closed basin lake the elevation configuration of the base of the first aquifer and the scale of natural drainage at this point it should be noted that inadequate identification of geological mining conditions regarding for example the oldest and shallowest mining operations results in a correspondingly inadequate diagnosis of hydrogeological conditions therefore in this method the rule is to adopt the most unfavorable worst case scenario for possible flooding of the msa this applies in particular to the range of the inundated area inside the closed basin lake it is projected on the numerical model of the base of the first aquifer assuming the existence of large water resources in the analyzed catchment area in cases of inadequate geological identification of the rocks forming the substratum under the bowl of morphological basin and inadequate recognition of geological and mining conditions under conditions of forced drainage of the surface waters it is more appropriate to classify this morphological basin as a potential reservoir covered by the boundary of the artificially drained area and not as a closed basin lake restoration of natural water flows in msas coupled with execution of simultaneous hydrotechnical drainage works may generally result in complete elimination of flooding when the bottom of the morphological basin is characterized by positive relative elevations and or the emergence of an inundated area within a morphological basin and or the expansion of an inundated area within a morphological basin figs 3 and 4 depending on the scale of the hydrotechnical works performed the inundated area may reach an intermediate state between the boundary of potential backwater and the boundary of the artificially drained area the boundary of the closed basin lake this topic is described in more detail in chapter 2 3 1 which contains a description of the bierun ii msa fig 2 2 2 2 introduction of hydrometric reference points and the boundaries of potential backwater according to this method the most important hydromorphological element of the artificially drained environment of mining and post mining areas msas are the hydrometric reference points designated for individual catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa hydrometric reference points normal and conditional are located at the intersections of the boundary of msa with the axis of the main watercourses draining the msa the defining condition for determining their elevation is the existence of free flow of water of this watercourse downstream from the msa the normal hydrometric reference point is a type of hydrometric reference point whose elevation corresponds to the elevation of the base level of the natural outflow of water from the msa rounded up to the value of the contour line on the spatial hydromorphological map of the msa the conditional hydrometric reference point is a type of hydrometric reference point whose elevation is the designated normal average water level after deepening as a result of hydrotechnical works and or subsidence due to mining exploitation of the neighboring mineral deposits rounded up to the value of the contour line on the spatial hydromorphological map of the msa usually they are both rounded up to the nearest whole number expressed in meters above sea level fig 6 the adoption of the above definition is a precondition for monitoring the average water levels of all main watercourses draining the msa at the gravitational outflow of their waters at the msa boundary the location of hydrometric reference points the author carried out such monitoring on the bierawka river in poland from 2001 to 2017 in a place where the riverbed experienced a subsidence of more than 18 m in this section of the riverbed there is a hydraulic balance between the erosion and sedimentation processes of material transported by water despite ongoing subsidence the introduction of a hydrometric reference point allows identifying the most important type of potential reservoir on the surface of msa this is the boundary of the potential backwater it is the range of possible flooding in the artificially drained morphological basin corresponding to filling it with water to the elevation of the hydrometric reference point specifically analyzed and determined for each catchment area of the main watercourses draining the msa this type of potential reservoir represents the minimum surface area of permanent flooding inside the msa which will arise after the restoration of natural water flows together with the simultaneous construction of necessary hydrotechnical deepening works of the beds of watercourses inside the msa the validation of the above is described in detail in a separate article 26 2 2 3 mapping the relief of the msa by means of relative elevations the adoption of a designated normal or conditional hydrometric reference point for parts of the catchment area covered by the analyzed msa allows projecting the surface of this catchment area on a map by means of elevations relative to the hydrometric reference point figs 3 fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 this clearly identifies the parts of msas threatened by permanent flooding 26 elevations of hydrometric reference points above sea level can become significant environmental protection policy aspects of msas one facet of the environmental policy in active msas may be the management of the use of relative elevations of their surface 14 28 2 2 4 identification of the boundary of extreme flood water level and strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by flooding in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in msas low probability of surface flooding occasional flooding is attributed to potential reservoirs covered by the boundary of extreme flood water level and beyond its boundaries strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by 100 year floods identification of only 100 year and 200 year waters is not enough to assess the true extent of mining induced damage to the msa aquatic environment hence for flood management of the msa surface it is better to use the innovative term the boundary of the extreme flood water level it marks the range of possible flooding of the artificially drained morphological basin not smaller than described by the boundary of the potential backwater and corresponding to the highest water stage of the main watercourse draining the msa at the place of outflow of waters from the msa figs 6 and 7 such a definition of this potential reservoir results from the hydrological conditions in the lower part of the msa and its similarity to the properties of the potential reservoir encompassed by the boundary of the potential backwater the reason for adopting such a definition of this hydromorphological element of msa is the need to monitor high water levels of the main watercourse draining the msa in place of gravitational outflow at the msa boundary the location of hydrometric reference point the author while working at the mine conducted such monitoring during the passage of flood waves on the bierawka river in szczyglowice msa in 1997 and 2010 the years of the last two major floods in poland the last of these measurements was carried out at a water gauge installed in the riverbed on an once an hour cycle due to the fact that the largest floods which concerned the majority of msas in poland took place some time ago i e in 1997 the determination of the elevation of its extreme wave will have to be made on the basis of local visual inspection by searching for traces of big water as well as conversations with the inhabitants of the area msa adjacent to the hydrometric reference point after measuring and setting the elevation of this wave using the traces of big water on surface objects it is important to increase this elevation by the amount of established mining subsidence of the measured objects a special feature of this hydromorphological element of the artificially drained environment of the msa should be emphasized it is the identification of surface water pumping stations in mining areas the rationale for locating pumping stations in local bottoms of morphological basins is the outflow of waters from the first aquifer the level of this water is lowered by means of pumping using the example of bierun ii msa fig 6 as many as 8 out of 9 surface pumping stations are located within the boundary of the extreme flood water level in special cases i e lack of archival data on floods and possible significant changes in the hydrological conditions of watercourse bed after the most recently measured big flood lack of natural water flows this potential reservoir may be set using known hydrological modeling 500 year water flowing naturally at the place of outflow from the msa such hydrological modeling applies in cases where construction of large flood retention reservoirs or other hydrotechnical works can have a significant impact on the height of the flood waves of the main watercourse draining the msa at the place of water outflow identification of the elevation of the extreme historical flood water stage becomes the basis for marking on the spatial hydromorphological map of the msa all the contour lines in the catchment area of the analyzed main watercourse draining the msa the elevation of the contour line corresponds to the elevation of the extreme historical flood stage also forming separate reservoirs they determine the boundary of the extreme flood water level in analyzed separate catchment areas of the main watercourse draining the msa figs 6 and 7 this step is repeated separately for each catchment area of the main watercourse draining the msa the scope of occasional flooding described by the boundary of the extreme flood water level was validated in chapter 2 3 1 the essence of determining the line corresponding to the boundary of the extreme flood water level identified and marked on the spatial hydromorphological map is the indication of natural or artificial places of possible water flow between potential reservoirs surrounded by contour lines with an elevation corresponding to the historical flood stage this applies to places whose lowering as a result of projected mining subsidence and or planned hydrotechnical works and or other engineering works may lead to real flows of water in these places during high water stages the indicated places of water flows may be either alluvial sediments of the permeable substratum which occur between zones covered by the boundaries of extreme flood water level or for example damaged levees and or poorly compacted road embankments which do not constitute hydraulic barriers the importance of this hydromorphological element of environment of the msa is justified by the fact that the flood crests of great catastrophic waters can only be slightly reduced as a result of hydrotechnical deepening works of the bed of watercourse the cubic volume of the extreme flood wave together with the retention capacity of morphological basins magnifying and deepening of the artificially drained surface of the msas is also important for the assessment of flood hazards this method assumes the worst possible scenario of flooding i e it assumes that the volume of the extreme flood wave will be greater than the retention capacity of morphological basins in the msa such a definition of this potential reservoir usually ensures that the boundary of extreme flood water level will encompass strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by 100 year water in all identified morphological basins this particularly applies to the lower parts of catchment areas located in the msa and characterized by low relative elevations of the surface in the upper parts of these catchment areas this type of potential reservoir may no longer encompass all areas threatened by 100 year water it should be added here that there exist msas drained by small surface watercourses characterized by small flood water culminations in which the boundaries of extreme flood water level coincide with the boundaries of potential backwater due to the above to fully present the threat of flooding in the upper those having higher relative elevations parts of catchment areas of the msa it is necessary to additionally identify strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by 100 year water strips of land threatened by such water should be identified and mapped on the spatial hydromorphological map outside the zones covered by the boundary of extreme flood water level fig 5 in the upper parts of the msa it makes no real sense to examine higher than 100 year water due to the possibility of reducing the risk of flooding through building flood embankments the flood scenario adopted for this analysis should correspond to a low probability of flooding occurrence as defined in the local water law in force in the country where this method is carried out 2 2 5 zoning of artificially drained surfaces of msas for mine planning mining damage repair and surface spatial development purposes based on the author s thirty years of first hand experiences in continuous monitoring the floods and environmental protection and management of mining damage repairs on the surface of underground hard coal mines in the uscb in poland a specific way of zoning of artificially drained surfaces of msas was developed this specifically defined way of zoning is simultaneously based on rating the flood threat and taking into account the possibilities and setting the guidelines for the elimination of this flood threat by repairing the mining induced damage to this transformed msa aquatic environment such repairs could consist of hydrotechnical deepening works and or projected mining subsidences the entire area of the analyzed msa should always be zoned figs 6 and 9 the catchment areas of individual main watercourses draining the msa are categorized separately it should be noted that the possibility of eliminating and or reducing the threat of surface flooding of the analyzed msas does not only result from the type of potential reservoir that covers these areas the relief of the surface of the morphological basin and the hydrological conditions in its vicinity determine the specific intermutual penetration of the boundaries of potential reservoirs of various types occurring in the morphological basin fig 8 hence a parameter the basis for rating the threat of this method of zoning the surface of the msas has become the probability of flooding of potential reservoirs resulting from the occurrence and or restoration of natural water flows and the future construction of drainage works the boundaries of potential reservoirs and watersheds projected on a spatial hydromorphological map of the msa most often become the boundaries of changes of flood hazard category of mining areas a four level scale is proposed for zoning msas the highest category iv concerns permanent flooding of msas the lowest category i refers to mining areas in which there were no or only insignificant transformations of the aquatic environment critically important for the needs of spatial development changes of these areas finally attention should also be paid to the rule which consists of assigning areas that lay inside a potential reservoir with lower relative elevations above the hydrometric reference point a higher probability of flooding and areas with a higher relative elevations a lower probability of flooding this fact could become a reason for additional rating to more than 4 categories of the flood hazard into such parts of potential reservoirs the complexity of the factors constituting the threat of flooding of the separated hydromorphological elements of the msa environment is a premise for the lack of additional gradation of the threat of flooding of their parts potential reservoirs characterized by different flood hazards category i flood hazard is proposed for those parts of msas which were subject to mining transformations and in which the restoration of natural water flows will cause insignificant changes in the hydrogeological conditions of the subsurface layer of the rock mass and for which there is no basis for classification higher than category i flood hazard these areas are characterized by changes to the waterlogging of the bedrock below such waterlogging is insignificant for spatial development purposes the scale of surface relief transformation as a result of mining subsidences did not lead to damage to the aquatic environment that would require repairs designation no 8 in fig 8 category ii flood hazard is proposed for those parts of msas which include mining areas that are or will be covered by the boundaries of the extreme flood water level and or the closed basin lakes others than those included in category i and or strips of land along the main watercourses and their tributaries in valleys threatened by flooding excluding from them areas classified higher than category ii of flood hazard these areas are characterized by a low probability of the occurrence of flooding occasional flooding designation no 9 in fig 8 category iii flood hazard is proposed for mining areas that are or will be covered by the boundaries of the artificially drained area with the exception of areas included in category iv flood hazard as well as additionally parts of inundated areas characterized by inventoried positive relative elevations of their bottom these areas are characterized by a high probability of occurrence of flooding permanent flooding designation no 10 in fig 8 mining areas proposed for category iv flood hazard designation no 11 in fig 8 are those that are or will be covered after the restoration of natural water flows by the boundaries of potential backwater and or waterlogging and or inundated areas with the exception of those parts of inundated areas classified in the category iii flood hazard the mining areas under category iv flood hazard should additionally include land strips necessary for conducting hydrotechnical gravitational drainage works these areas are and or will be flooded and or waterlogged in the future once natural free water flows have been restored and necessary hydrotechnical gravitational drainage works have been carried out to determine whether the infrastructure real estate buildings etc in mining areas have suffered damage in the form of a threat of flooding previously non existent due to the impact of mining their category of flood hazard must increase during the time period of mining impact the true extent of mining induced damage can be fully identified by comparing time oriented msa spatial hydromorphological maps of the msa surface relief for example figs 6 and 9 repair of mining induced damage to the msa aquatic environment and in particular damage in the form of a threat of flooding to real estate buildings etc despite the fact that they were not flooded requires a separate and broad discussion a preliminary reference to this issue is in chapter 2 3 1 2 3 results and discussion 2 3 1 frameworks for assessing permanent and extreme flooding in the msa in the context of drainage works the discussion of the framework of permanent and occasional flooding for the current state of surface relief will be based on the example of the bierun ii msa in uscb in poland the uscb is characterized by damp continental climatic conditions with mean temperatures of 8 c the annual mean precipitation is 650 mm precipitation occurs mainly during summer the highest precipitation totals during heavy rainfall events recorded over periods of several days were the direct cause of the biggest floods in poland in the 20th century in many cases exceeding 400 mm 29 in the central part of this msa loam disappears and the carboniferous overburden is hydrogeologically non insulating in the morphology of the surface in the central part of this msa there are hills with outcrops of the carboniferous layers the potential reservoirs identified at the southern boundary of the msa have the character of closed basin lakes where surface water largely drains to mine excavations there are no surface water pumping stations and no inundated areas fig 9 the largest subsidence basin revealed itself in the northwest corner of this msa figs 9 and 10 it generated a morphological basin in this region which currently has a depth depression of 7 m due to the miocene loam under its bowl in the carboniferous overburden this potential reservoir is marked by the boundary of the artificially drained area it has a span exceeding about 4 km once natural water flows are restored the entire surface of this potential reservoir will turn into an inundated area currently surface watercourses flowing to the bottom of this basin are collected in local inundated areas and transferred by means of 6 pumping stations to surface watercourses gravitationally flowing in the vicinity of this potential reservoir fig 9 hence the mining induced damages in the form of inundated areas revealed so far are small due to artificial drainage only the minimum surface of this potential reservoir retention reservoirs at pumping stations has become flooded inside the described potential reservoir the old beds of local watercourses have inverted longitudinal slopes and these watercourses have long lost their hydraulic relationship with their original collector of water the natural and previous collector of water from this potential reservoir the mleczna river flows on the west side of the boundary of artificially drained area normal water stages on the section of the riverbed near the potential reservoir are 7 10 m above the bottom of the described basin in this river there are occasional flood waves 1 9 m height which do not flood the river valley including this potential reservoir due to the existing flood embankments similarly the golawiecki stream flows on the eastern side of this morphological basin normal water stages on the section of the watercourse bad in the vicinity of this basin are from 2 5 to 10 m above the bottom of the described basin characterizing the described potential reservoir by attributes the relative elevations of the bowl s shoreline overflow level is 12 5 m and its bottom 5 0 m above the hydrometric reference point hence within this basin the boundary of potential backwater is not marked the normal hydrometric reference point mapped on the msa boundary at the place of the vistula river outflow is about 7 7 km away from the analyzed basin bottom fig 9 the spatial hydromorphological map of this msa fig 9 indicates the presence of natural hills south of the boundary of this potential reservoir between them the terrain rises to a relative elevation of 16 m in turn the lowest relative elevation of the watershed line that occurs beyond the eastern boundary of this potential reservoir has a relative elevation of 13 7 m i e only 1 2 m above its shoreline the latter data indicates that the progressing mining subsidence may lead to the connection of the described reservoir with another occurring in the central part of the northern boundary of msa this other large potential reservoir lies in the catchment area of the golawiecki stream fig 10 boundaries of extreme flood water level have been identified in many potential reservoirs of this msa fig 9 because the golawiedzki stream flows gravitationally into the vistula river the backflow of the vistula flows into it this forced the need to build levees along the golawiecki stream they divide this basin into two separate potential reservoirs fig 10 wishing to characterize the range of mining areas threatened by occasional flooding it should be stated that due to the large volume of vistula river flood waves the backflow of this largest polish river will always flood the valleys of all its tributaries that are hydraulically connected with it the justification for the above thesis is a comparison of the capacity of these parts of all post mining morphological basins that may be flooded by the vistula backflow about 25 million cubic meters with the volume of the extreme flood wave of the vistula river at this point of the catchment area during last big flood about 2500 million cubic meters between july 07 1997 and july 21 1997 29 the capacity of potential reservoirs in this msa is incomparably smaller than the volumes of extreme flood waves at this point it is worth discussing the details of determining the elevation of the extreme flood water level for the bierun ii msa it is no accident that cyclic hydrometric measurements of the biggest polish river the vistula flowing along the boundary of this msa are conducted by the polish institute of meteorology and water management at the nowy bierun water gauge section the catchment area of this river in the place of the water gauge is 1748 square km analysis of measured changes in river water stages from 1981 to 2019 confirms that there is a hydraulic balance between the erosion and sedimentation processes of material transported by water floods identified during this time period which were not the largest recorded were characterized by the following extremes 246 cm 1994 325 cm 1998 327 cm 2013 the largest floods in this msa occurred in 1997 and 2010 the culmination wave of 09 07 1997 was about 3 m higher than mentioned above and reached 597 cm while the peak of 20 05 2010 was very similar and differed only by 12 cm and amounted to 585 cm fig 11 the elevation of the extreme flood wave from 1997 was used to identify the range of this msa s occasional flooding the boundary of extreme flood water level it is worth showing the extent of backflow of the big water in the vistula valley in the region where another large river flows into it the przemsza river the national water management authority in warsaw has developed flood hazard maps that cover the valleys of both rivers in the analyzed msa they identified the table of 500 year water of the vistula river at the place of water outflow from this msa km 921 250 which was 232 43 m above sea level as well as the table of 500 year water of the przemsza river the tributary of the vistula at the place of inflow of the river s waters to the analyzed msa km 6 200 amounted to 232 62 m above sea level these measurements about 6 5 km distant from each other differ only by 19 cm www isok gov pl field surveys conducted by the author in this msa confirmed that the 500 year water of 2010 flooded all the boundaries of extreme flood water levels the above confirms the validity of the concept of the boundary of extreme flood water level adopted to describe occasional floods in this method this method assumption is of key importance for assessing the relationship between possible flood damage and mining impact adopting the largest of the great waters in the method allows for good identification of areas under threat of occasional flooding and identification of mining damage in the form of a threat of flooding to either developed and or undeveloped real estate in the lower part of the msa that is those having low relative elevations of the surface all smaller floods will mostly be within the boundary of extreme flood water level this is well illustrated by fig 11 it depends of course on the morphing of the msa surface fig 9 it is worth emphasizing here that a different approach to the assessment of flood threat in the lower part of msa than in the upper part of msa does not pose special problems in terms of repairing mining induced damage referring to chapter 2 2 4 in the upper part of the msa that is those having higher relative elevations of the surface the occurrence of large watercourses with large fluctuations in water stages requires the use of standard hydrological modeling of 100 year water if the identified threat of such a flood concerns construction objects and infrastructure flood embankments are being built as part of preventive and repair works fig 10 in the case of breaking the close hydraulic relationship of the water behind the levies with the previous collector of water these waters can always flow away from there and or be directed through hydrotechnical works to the lower part of the msa the spatial hydromorphological map of the current state of the bierun ii msa indicates that within the largest of the analyzed basins no boundaries of potential backwater have been identified fig 10 due to the above it is theoretically possible to gravitationally drain the analyzed basin in a way that eliminates the occurrence of an inundated area positive relative elevations of the bottom however one should be aware that such a direction of possible repairs of mining induced damage would require the construction of a new water channel and or deep storm drainage systems each method and direction of gravitational drainage of this potential reservoir results in the occurrence of such occasional flooding inside it the boundaries of extreme flood water level any plans for draining this potential reservoir west to the bed of the mleczna river or east to the golawiecki stream will always result in an inundated area within it it is worth emphasizing that the range of an inundated area and or areas will result from possible plans for deepening the beds of these watercourses in this identified potential reservoir the range of future inundated areas will not be less than the boundaries of extreme flood water level this allows the assessment of the feasibility and the setting of legal guidelines for mining induced damage repairs by future hydrotechnical and reclamation works 3 conclusion flooding is the most determinant factor of the impact of mining on the environment due to the occurrence of artificial drainage during exploitation of minerals the true extent of mining induced damage in the aquatic environment is not fully revealed on the surface of msas this can result in the lack of ongoing repairs of the true extent of mining induced damage in the form of a threat of flooding by mining entities the use of the term the threat of flooding is directly linked to the surface of the msa which are threatened by flooding after restoration of natural surface and underground water flows applicable local water laws allow artificial drainage of mining and post mining areas but in many countries existing laws require that natural water flows should be restored by mining entities or their legal successors in the process of mine closures such action is tantamount to a restoration of the previous state in the sense of repair of damage to the environment and to real estate either developed and or undeveloped however the scale of aquatic environment transformations can be so large that it will not be possible to restore natural water flows in all regions of post mining areas for this reason in mining and post mining areas where forced drainage takes place it should be necessary to supervise and control the range of flooding and the threat of flooding simultaneously with appropriate spatial planning this method of assessing the threat of flooding of artificially drained msas is a hydromorphological and cartographic method of hydrological modeling based on a special mapping of the surface area of a single msa where 5 types of potential reservoirs were identified in a schematic manner schematization of hydrological modeling of water in the catchment areas of the main watercourses draining the msa is based on the characteristic water stages at the place of surface water outflow from the msa it takes into account different hydrogeological conditions in these parts of separate catchment areas of main watercourses draining the mining post mining areas which are located inside the msa the essence of this method is the constancy of the msa aquatic environment s two main elements the elevation of the hydrometric reference point and the elevation of the extreme flood water level this approach makes it possible to identify both permanent and occasional flooding on the msa surface after the restoration of natural water flows and after the process of limiting the threat of flooding on the msa surface limiting the threat of flooding consists of hydrotechnical deepening works and projected mining subsidences of the base level of natural outflow of water from potential reservoirs the end result of this method is a spatial hydromorphological map of the msa which identifies the true extent of mining induced damage to the aquatic environment in the form of a threat of flooding resulting from cessation of artificial drainage of the msa based on the ranges of potential reservoirs four categories of the threat of flooding are proposed for zoning the entire area of the msa elements of this method in particular the hydrometric reference points can and should become significant aspects of environmental policy for water management governing bodies environmental managers local government and state authorities responsible for issuing mining concessions as well as for mining supervisory authorities and commercial mining entities the relative elevation of the surface better describes the possibility of natural drainage of the msa surface than the absolute elevation above the sea level method used until now relative elevations of the surface of the msa are a simple and effective management tool for planning inevitable flooding granting legal consent to fixed scale mining operations as well as monitoring and controlling the process of the subsidence of the msas relative elevations simplify the definition of a permissible framework for excessive mining subsidence i e those that cause permanent surface flooding after restoration of natural water flows using relative elevations in the processes of quantitative evaluation for extraction of mineral resources allows for balancing the transformation of msa aquatic environment with the needs of spatial development and environmental protection the principle is to allow for mining subsidence of any point of the msa s surface but it must not exceed its relative elevation above the adopted hydrometric reference point reduced by the difference of the surface elevations between this point and the hydrometric reference point this is necessary to ensure gravitational drainage of this surface point this topic requires a separate and broader discussion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

for cod and nitrates was 34 84 and 28 11 mg g when adsorption temperature was 318 k the results of thermodynamic studies δg δh and δs showed the spontaneous endothermic and randomness in the adsorption process desorption studies showed excellent regenerative efficiency up to the 10th cycle of nanocomposites using 0 01 m naoh so this wastewater treatment system for the food industry is promising to implement for the sake of using wastewater as a circular economy component graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment magnetic nanoparticles clay wastewater reuse irrigation water 1 introduction due to demographic urban growth and demand for products added to the drought scenarios in several areas of the world and the release of wastewater in lakes coasts and rivers the pressure on the water resource has been growing in recent times causing severe complications for both ecosystems and human life 1 2 additionally water availability in some areas of the planet is low according to a recent study a 40 global deficit can occur between the expected demand and the available supply by 2030 3 an example is colombia which despite having a high water supply for average hydrological conditions 53 hydrographic subzones have been identified that have high vulnerability to shortages of which about 30 are in a very high category that is with very high pressures to use regarding the available supply and a very low water retention and regulation capacity 4 one of the sectors with the highest water consumption is the agriculture sector according to the united nations irrigation represents 70 of the extractions of this resource at the same time food production consumes approximately 30 of the energy in the world which is mainly produced hydraulically according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao water extraction in colombia is over 11 767 km3 of which more than 50 of the total is derived from the agricultural sector and much of it uses untreated water residuals this sector consumes the most water in the country compared to others such as energy domestic aquaculture livestock industrial and services 5 this situation has led governments to increasingly consider innovative water management strategies including wastewater reuse as water plays an essential role as an ecological sustainability factor for socio economic systems at all scales 6 in this sense the reuse of treated wastewater is presented as one of the alternatives that could be reliable and highly beneficial for water security especially in the agricultural sector in irrigation matters 7 treated wastewater can be an alternative to the use of clean water for agriculture leaving freshwater used for other purposes including the supply of drinking water 8 to achieve this goal of water reuse materials and technologies such as activated carbon oxidation reverse osmosis ro and activated sludge processes are commonly used however these processes are usually not suitable for eliminating different pollutants of a complex nature such as pharmaceuticals surfactants and heavy metals found in wastewater from industries that use these compounds or in waters currently used for irrigation 9 thus researchers have been studying the application of nanotechnology in the environmental field extensively since it provides potential advantages that include low cost reuse and high competition to eliminate and recover contaminants many nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes nanomembranes metal oxides zeolites and dendrimers are helping to improve the most competent treatment pathways among the improved aquatic method 10 within the variety of possibilities that nanotechnology provides magnetic nanoparticles mnps have long been a subject of scientific and technological interest because apart from their large extraction capacity high surface area volume ratio and or ease of functionalization it has an important property magnetism 11 with these properties it is expected that magnetic separation could be an efficient and convenient method cheaper for the separation of such tiny particles than membrane filtration in addition to providing application control to prevent the release of nanomaterials to the environment and generate a problematic worse than the one you want to deal with although there are many studies on the use of magnetic nanoparticles as agents for removing heavy metals and other emerging pollutants most do not consider the combination with conventional treatment techniques so that they are applied in real conditions such as wastewater from the food industry 12 in addition a few studies have been conducted regarding the functionalization of these compounds with agents of excellent adsorbent properties for metal ions such as clays under sewage conditions of the food industry which have dissolved organic material that can affect the removal processes of ions 13 14 additionally the combination of water pretreatment techniques that alleviate the burden of pollutants to increase the performance of tertiary treatments such as the implementation of nanotechnology has attracted the attention of researchers this because processes such as coagulation flocculation eliminate compounds or agents that cause interference in the affinity of adsorption or oxidation processes leading to lower implementation costs 15 16 examples of these are the combination of bentonite with magnetic nanoparticles 17 used fe3o4 nanoparticles combined with bentonite to remove zinc ii from synthetic wastewater obtaining an adsorption capacity of 22 50 mg g similarly 18 used magnetic bentonite to remove cod bod and nitrates from industrial wastewater where the concentrations of these three parameters in the treated water could be reduced by 70 or more similarly other studies have applied this combination of bentonite with magnetic nanoparticles to treat acid mine drainage 19 heavy metals 20 21 persistent organic compounds 22 among others therefore this work aims to evaluate the treatment and reuse in agricultural irrigation of wastewater derived from the guava paste production process through a system that combines pretreatment processes and conventional treatments with green magnetic nanoparticles modified with clays 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for the synthesis of magnetically modified clay nanoparticles bentonite clay iron chloride fecl3 glucose c6h12o6 and sodium hydroxide naoh were used in the treatment processes aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 and anthracite were used all chemicals were analytical grade and were used without further purification the wastewater used was obtained from the sandwich factory located in the municipality of vélez cundinamarca colombia which were generated from washing utensils for sandwich production stored under refrigeration at 4 c 2 2 synthesis of bentonite mnps to develop the synthesis of bentonite mnps a modification of the green co precipitation method developed by ref 12 was used briefly a 0 36 m aqueous solution of ferric chloride fecl3 was prepared which was heated to a temperature of 70 c and then a glucose solution was added a ph adjustment was made by adding sodium hydroxide to reach a value greater than 8 5 where the solution takes a black color it is brought to a temperature of 85 c 5 c for 15 min the clay is added and kept at 85 c 5 c for 30 min with continuous mechanical stirring at 100 rpm finally the modified nanoparticles were separated by magnetic field application by washing them three times with deionized water and alcohol for subsequent drying at 60 c for 12 h 2 3 characterization the magnetic properties of the nanomaterial were studied using vibratory sample magnetometer measurements vsm lakeshore model 665 at a temperature established by the method and with magnetization measurements depending on the field applied in a range between 30 koe to 30 koe the functional groups exposed on the surface of the material and which were responsible for the removal of contaminants were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in a shimadzu ir prestige21 ftir spectrometer where the sample was diluted in kbr and 150 scans were read by a liquid nitrogen detector in the transmittance method the physical particle size was measured by sem scanning electron microscopy in a carl zeiss model evo hd ma 15 crystallographic characterization was carried out through an x ray diffraction analysis in an x pert pro mpd panalytical project where the material obtained was subjected to bombardment with x rays emitted from a cu anode with a wavelength in a range of 10 90 with a step size of 0 026 and a step time of 20 s the surface electro kinetic potential of the particles and the hydrodynamic size were determined by zeta potential measurements in a malvern zvernizer nano zs90 the reported values were the average of 5 measurements which each was performed in an aqueous medium and under a potential at different ph values in the case of wastewater used they were analyzed according to standard methods for the chemical oxygen demand cod mgo2 l by colorimeter method standard method 5220c for biochemical oxygen demand bod5 mg l standard methods 5210b bod 5 day test for ph potentiometric method nitrate in water by colorimetry and cadmium reduction standard methods 4500 no3 e the ionic concentrations of chloride cl nitrate no3 nitrite no2 phosphate po4 3 and sulfate so4 2 were determined by ion chromatography 850 professional ic metrohm after the proposed treatments the textile wastewater was again characterized using the same parameters the concentration of iron and aluminum was determined by the standard methods 3500b and 3500b respectively 2 4 pilot scale treatability tests to have a water quality close to that required by the regulations pretreatment processes were carried out to reduce the organic and solids load contained in the wastewater these pretreatment processes consisted of sedimentation and subsequent aeration the sedimentation was carried out in sedimentation cones of 1l for 4 h after this time the water was separated from the settable solids they were transferred to an aeration system with a capacity of 4l and constant aeration for 2 h to oxidize suspended and dissolved organic matter subsequently the primary coagulation flocculation sedimentation cfs treatment processes were carried out using a conventional jar test system consisting of four beakers each with a volume of 1 l as coagulant sulfate was used aluminum according to the standard procedure astm d2035 2008 consisting of three steps i the coagulant was added to the wastewater 0 5 1 5 g l under a rapid mixing of 180 rpm for 5 min ii after coagulation the ph of the water samples was adjusted to neutral and coagulant was added with slow mixing for 20 min iii the samples were allowed to settle for 30 min finally the supernatant for turbidity iron and aluminum analysis was collected as process efficiency indicator parameters those experiments were conducted in duplicate with the best result of the cfs treatment bentonite mnps are implemented to treat a 250 ml residual water volume with 200 mg l of the nanomaterial and constant stirring for 2 h after the time has elapsed a low gradient magnetic field is applied to separate the nanomaterial and subsequent treatment in the rapid filtration system the filtration system costs a multimedia system activated carbon sand gravel the dimensions of the filtration column were 10x10 80 cm and the workflow was 0 3l hour this was done in order to be able to retain the material that has not been removed by the primary system or the nanoparticle system as well as to remove the nanoparticles that were not removed by the magnetic field 2 5 kinectic and isotherm study nitrate and cod removal by bentonite mnps was carried out in 100 ml batches the effect of time 3 120 min and the amount of nanomaterial 200 800 mg l on adsorption efficiency was investigated based on the results the efficiency and adsorption capacity of the cod and sulfate by bentonite mnps were calculated using 23 r c i c e c i 100 q v m c i c e where r is adsorption percentage q is the amount of adsorption at equilibrium mg g ce and ci are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of doc and sulphates mg l respectively v is the liquid volume l and m is the amount of used adsorbent g 2 6 adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption experiments at different temperatures were also performed to evaluate the influence of temperature 283 313 k the thermodynamic property of the adsorbent ion nitrate bentonite mnps system was calculated using the following equations 24 l n k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where δs 0 δg⁰ and δh 0 are the values of the entropy change free energy and the enthalpy change during the process r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant t k is the absolute temperature and kd is the distribution coefficient 2 7 desorption and reusability of nanomaterial desorption and reusability of adsorbents are essential and effective parameters in their design to reduce the process cost in desorption processes different solutions such as hydrochloric acid nitric acid sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride can be used in this study sodium hydroxide solution with a concentration of 0 01 m was used for the desorption process determination of the desorption percentage of ions from the adsorbent was made by ref 25 d e s o

diffractogram of the bentonite modified with magnetic nanoparticles peaks with intensity at angles of 36 42 and 62 can be appreciated which refer to the magnetite of cubic spinel structure with indices of 311 400 and 440 26 27 the calculations associated with the network constant yielded a value of 8 30å which is close to the theoretical value of the magnetite 8 39 å the presence of bentonite is represented at a high intensity peak near 27 40 with the miller index 220 28 in addition this structure is recognized for having a peak 311 with high intensity 29 31 the diffractogram also shows peaks near the sides of the 220 and a minimum peak width 511 which allows establishing the low presence of maghemite since mixtures of maghemite magnetite compounds express low intensity peaks at 25 27 and 57 5 32 although the material is susceptible to oxidation in environmental conditions it still responds to an external magnetic force and can be used for ecological remediation tasks the average crystallite size of the crystalline magnetite nanoparticles analyzed by xrd was estimated using the scherrer equation d q λ β cos θ where d is the crystallite size q is the form factor that can be assumed to be 1 1 for spherical particles λ is the incident x ray wavelength θ is the bragg angle and β is the widening of the diffraction line measured in radians at half the maximum intensity the calculated crystallite size was found to be 13 1 nm in relatively good agreement with the size of nanoparticles observed under sem 60 80 nm fig 4 fig 1b shows the magnetic character of the nanomaterial it is observed that the magnetization that the conventional magnetic saturation nanoparticles reached a value of 82 67 emu g which is an approximate value to the theoretical one that is 90 emu g on the other hand the orange line corresponds to the magnetization of bentonite clay with magnetic nanoparticles which undergoes a reduction to 48 77 emu g because the nanoparticles contain clay due to the lack of magnetic behavior therefore this decrease is observed this means that there was a 46 reduction to the theoretical value of magnetization sem test fig 1 c and f was performed by the emission and detection of electrons where the size of the nanoparticles was obtained with agglomerates of approximately 200 nm but with an individual particle size of 60 80 nm according to the xrd analysis according to the eds analysis fig 1d it is observed that the percentage of iron fe is 20 and of the silica si is 25 confirming the presence of magnetite and bentonite clay in the synthesized nanomaterial likewise it is shown that the presence of average peaks which is referring to the impurities contained in the nanomaterial sample in this case the highest peaks are titanium ti calcium ca and potassium k although these impurities should not significantly influence the affinity of the contaminants in the wastewater with the nanocomposite surface they influence the reduction of the magnetic character of the nanoparticles low temperature saturation magnetization decreases as does magnetic susceptibility when impurities are present in the spinel ferrite crystal structure in this sense it would be desirable to improve the synthesis to reduce impurities since it would facilitate separating the pollutant nanomaterial complex from the treated wastewater 33 34 ftir spectrum of pure bentonite and bentonita mnps are shown in fig 1e for pure clay the characteristic absorption peak of the stretching vibrations of si o si o al is observed at 555 cm 1 a typical absorption band of the si o stretch vibration at 1045 cm 1 is observed similarly the characteristic absorption peak at 900 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of si o si o al while the peak at cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of o si o 35 the band at 1631 cm 1 results from the stretching vibration of si o si a strong peak at 1195 cm 1 indicates the stretching vibration so 36 the absorption band between 3425 and 3620 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibrations of the h2o molecules present within the clay matrix ftir spectrum of bentonite mnps shows the characteristic absorption band of fe o at 659 cm 1 37 38 due to fe3o4 interactions the typical bands of si o and si o al shifted from 555 to 503 cm 1 the c o h group peaks have 1150 cm 1 the c o c group has 1080 cm 1 and 1016 cm 1 appeared which are characteristic of the organic glucose layer that was used for the stabilization of the particles as well as the adsorption of co2 in the atmosphere these findings were consistent with those observed by refs 39 40 using modified bentonite with magnetite nanoparticles for the adsorption of heavy metals and the methyl orange dye from the aqueous solution respectively there it could be evidenced the bands at 531 797 916 and 1030 cm 1 corresponded to the simple bonding of fe o with respect to fe3o4 41 42 however the relative transmittance values decreased to lower values indicating the reaction of fe3o4 and glucose with the active groups on the bentonite surface overall ftir results complemented well with xrd data confirming the successful incorporation of fe3o4 and glucose into the bentonite 3 2 initial characterization of wastewater to define the pretreatment and primary treatment processes before implementing bentonite mnps the characterization of the wastewater to be treated was performed table 1 shows the physicochemical characteristics of wastewater from the production processes of the sandwich factory it can be seen that the wastewater has a large amount of total suspended solids from the fruit washing processes likewise given the acid character of guava wastewater has an acidic nature that must be pretreated to affect the efficiency of primary treatments in this sense pretreatment processes of preliminary sedimentation and neutralization are necessary regarding the design of the processes necessary to achieve water quality the comparison is made with what is established in resolution 1207 of 2014 by which provisions related to the use of treated wastewater are adopted the comparison demonstrates that the parameters of conductivity chlorides sulfates iron aluminum and total suspended solids comply with the regulations so the proposed treatment should not be addressed to these parameters but to the remaining ones thus the parameters of ph cod bod5 nitrates turbidity and suspended solids were those of interest 3 3 pretreatment of wastewater to reduce the values in the parameters of interest sedimentation aeration neutralization and cfs pretreatments were carried out visualizing the function of type ii aluminum sulfate as a coagulant it is obtained that the one with a concentration of 1 3 g l in which there was a better formation of flocs both in form and in sedimentable character fig 2 the values of the water quality parameters after each of these processes are observed in table 2 it can be seen that there was an appreciable reduction in turbidity in these processes of 85 which referred to the particulate material of fruit cultivation such as soil and organic matter this also has a lot to do with the initial characterization of the wastewater since although it is a productive process with natural organic material the bod is only 48 of the cod and such material on the surface of the fruit must contain hardly biodegradable organic compounds such as pesticides and fertilizers on the other hand there is an increase in dissolved solids after the cfs process associated with residual coagulant material used in operation likewise the decrease in ph values is characteristic of coagulation processes even more when the initial wastewater had an acidic ph that expresses an absence of alkalinity however the final ph value of 7 07 is appropriate for the application of the nanomaterial as well as for agricultural irrigation processes 3 4 treatment tests with bentonite mnps and rapid filtration the application of the nanomaterial as a tertiary treatment had good effectiveness for the elimination of dissolved material this can be seen since there was a reduction in the concentrations of chlorides sulfates and nitrates as well as in the cod table 3 this is explained because at a ph below 8 8 the surface of the bentonite is positively charged and therefore negative ions such as nitrates chlorides and sulfates will be electrostatically adsorbed to the surface of the bentonite 43 in this sense research has suggested that at a neutral ph or under the adsorption of negative ions the ligand exchange mechanism follows 40 these negative ions sulfates chlorides nitrates etc and the organic matter of the wastewater are chemical species that exert oxygen consumption so the decrease in these compounds is reflected in reducing the cod therefore the application of this material may be favored if the neutralization pretreatment process is not carried up to alkaline values but acid values close to neutral where adsorption is favored but the cfs process is not disadvantaged based on this adsorption capacities were obtained for nitrates chlorides and sulfates of 40 0 mg g 248 4 mg g and 29 15 mg g respectively which are good adsorption capacities for real water and simultaneously although there was a reduction in the parameters of interest turbidity and conductivity presented equal or higher values this issue was caused because the separation of the material after applying the low gradient magnetic field was not complete which causes the incident light to be absorbed at the time of the turbidity measurement test similarly it is presumed that there was a release of nanoparticles from the clay by the agitation force for the treatment since an increase in iron values in the treated water was found for this reason it is necessary to optimize either the synthesis method to obtain a greater interaction force between the bentonite and the magnetic nanoparticles either through the use of another reducing agent such as cysteine or glutathione that can create covalent bonds of greater strength and thus prevent detachment another way is to use a magnetic separation system where the applied field affects a smaller volume of water leading to the separation of both the magnetic clay and the magnetite nanoparticles in the solution for the final rapid filtration process a 14 ntu reduction in turbidity was obtained where the sand and activated carbon layer carried out the material removal process that could not be removed by the magnetic field in addition to removal of dissolved ions by the action of activated carbon table 4 shows the final characteristics of the treated water see table 5 from the previous table and comparing with the regulations established by the united states environmental protection agency epa the treatment process carried out complies with most of the parameters studied and of greater interest in agricultural irrigation such as nitrates chlorides sulfates and cod however it is necessary to perform an optimization in the magnetic separation process or in the final filtration in such a way that the turbidity parameter can be met since the value range stipulated in the standard provided by epa for superficial irrigation of crops of foods for human consumption that is ingested raw must be less than or equal to 2 0 ntu and in this case a value of 2 2 ntu was reached this due to the stability provided by the organic layer provided by glucose which prevents the oxidation of the iron atoms and therefore the loss of the magnetic character but causes the nanoparticles that are detached from the clay matrix to be weakly affected by the force of gravity due to its electrostatic repulsion the use of wastewater can be made for the local level based on the water quality index wqi for calculating the water quality index the importance values and normalization factors were taken into account according to the values of the physicochemical parameters estimated in the water treatment performed the results of the water quality index are observed below based on the preceding and according to the institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam and the ministry of environment and sustainable development the water coming from the sandwich factory after being treated is classified as acceptable the implementation of magnetic nanomaterials can be planted as an alternative for treating and reusing wastewater of this type 3 5 time contact effect and kinetic study to investigate the time required to complete the adsorption process and its velocity batch tests were conducted fig 3 the solution ph and the concentration of bentonita mnps were fixed at 7 0 and 500 mg l respectively and samples were measured for the residual amount of cod and nitrates for a contact time of 3 120 min fig 3 shows that the equilibrium was attained after 60 min however the adsorption capacity continued to increase for another hour but insignificantly p 0 01 the adsorbed amount of cod and nitrates increased significantly with an increase in contact time from 0 to 60 min cod shows a lower equilibrium time because the concentration in the wastewater is smaller than nitrates but the equilibrium time for nitrates is not too large the obtained data demonstrated that removing cod and nitrates from aqueous solutions by different soils was the three step kinetic process the first step i corresponds to the transfer of the molecules from the wastewater to the external surface of the adsorbent the second stage ii is relatively rapid this step corresponds to the adsorption of the adsorbant at the most accessible sites probably located on the outer surfaces of soil particles then in the third stage iii the adsorption of nitrates or cod continues but slowly to well understand the adsorption behavior of cod and nitrates on bentinite mnps surface and explore the adsorption mechanism two standard kinetic models including pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso were applied to evaluate the kinetics of the adsorption of cod and nitrates on bentinite mnps surface 48 49 the values of kinetic parameters of the adsorption process are summarized in table 6 the cod removal was better adjusted to the pseudo second order model with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 in contrast the nitrate removal was better adapted to the pseudo first order model with an r2 of 0 98 3 6 adsorption isotherms model the equilibrium adsorption isotherms are one of the promising data to understand the mechanism of the adsorption various isotherm equations are well known and two different isotherms are selected in this study which are the langmuir freundlich temkin and sips isotherms therefore according to results shown in supplementary figs 1 4 and table 7 the langmuir isotherm was the best fitted model for experimental data of cod adsorption onto nanocomposite implying monolayer adsorption of this ion on the surface of the nanocomposite in contrast the freundlich was the best fitted model for experimental data of nitrates adsorption see table 8 when comparing the results obtained with similar studies it can be noted that there is an improvement in the cod reduction capacity concerning bentonite chemically modified by ref 44 in this study the maximum adsorption capacity was 32 2 mg g for initial conditions of cod of 2000 mg l on the other hand 18 used magnetite nanoparticles obtained by the conventional co precipitation method which showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 416 mg l although this value is higher than that obtained in this study it was under acidic conditions and a much higher initial cod concentration 1875 mg l if we use the approach established by refs 45 46 to compare adsorption capacities the initial concentration of the adsorbate must be taken into account the present study expresses a q m c i value of 0 44 while in ref 18 the value would be 0 22 3 7 effect of temperature and adsorption thermodynamics the temperature dependence of the adsorption capacity of nitrates onto bentonite mnps was investigated at 30 40 and 50 c the results obtained in this work are shown in fig 4 as shown in this figure the amounts of nitrates adsorbed on the surface of the two adsorbents increased with increasing solution temperature which indicates an endothermic process increases in nitrates mobility can explain this behavior and also adequate energy could be required for more molecules to affect the interaction of surface active site 47 48 negative values of δg in table 6 confirmed the feasibility of and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process with a high preference for nitrate ions on the absorbent the value of δh was positive 19 97 kj mol indicating that the adsorption reaction was endothermic these results agree with the results obtained where adsorption increases with rising temperature indicating that the adsorption of this adsorbate is an endothermic process as seen in table 7 the positive value of δs 0 05 kj mol k reflected the affinity of the actives sites of bentonite mnps for nitrates ions in addition a positive value of δs also showed an increase of randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption of nitrates on the nanomaterial 49 50 3 8 desorption and recycle use of adsorbents reuse tests showed a decrease in adsorption percentage higher than 20 after the tenth cycle of contaminants adsorption fig 5 these results could be an indicator of the favourability in applying this material in the process at scale 4 conclusions implementing a method of green synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles using glucose as a reducing stabilizing and cohesion agent with bentonite was conducive to obtaining a magnetic nanomaterial with saturation magnetization close to 48 emu g which allowed its use in processes of wastewater treatment of the food industry results of xrd ftir sem edx and vsm showed that a combination of sonochemical and co precipitation method was a cost effective higher yield short reaction time procedure thus a facile route to produce nano adsorbent nitrate removal was best described by a pseudo first order kinetic model and freundlich isothermal model in contrast cod removal was better adjusted to pseudo second order and langmuir with adsorption capacities of 23 5 and 24 5 mg g respectively additionally the thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption process with the implementation of bentonite mnps is sporadic and endothermic a rapid filtration process improved the remaining parameters of turbidity and conductivity but it is required to enhance either the magnetic separation by obtaining a nanomaterial of better magnetic properties or the final filtration with a medium of smaller size so that water quality regulations for reuse have fully complied to implement the system finally it was established that the combination of coagulation flocculation sedimentation pretreatment processes with bentonite mnps is a potentially applicable process for the treatment and reuse of wastewater from the food industry since pretreatments lower the organic load and the nanomaterial has an affinity for dissolved material up to 10 reuse cycles credit author statement wilfredo marimon conceptualization

8771,combining natural materials and pretreatment processes with nanomaterials is an alternative to be evaluated for the increase in efficiency and cost reduction of water treatment processes this work aimed to study the combination of pretreatment processes and primary treatments with bentonite impregnated with magnetic nanoparticles bentonite mnps to reuse wastewater from the food indust ry bentonite mnps were obtained by green synthesis using glucose as a reducing stabilizing agent and the nanocomposite was characterized by sem eds ftir vsm and xrd analysis the synthesized nanocomposite was used to remove nitrates and cod from wastewater from the production of guava bars that had been pretreated with coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes batch adsorption experiments were conducted where the influence of several parameters such as contact time adsorbent amount and the temperature was studied according to the results the wastewater treated with the coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes was still outside the standards for agricultural reuse after applying the treatment with bentonite mnps a reduction of cod nitrates chlorides and sulfates of 82 75 4 98 18 and 70 respectively was achieved the adsorption isotherm data were best explained by the langmuir model for cod and frendluich model for nitrates and the adsorption capacity of bentonite mnps for cod and nitrates was 34 84 and 28 11 mg g when adsorption temperature was 318 k the results of thermodynamic studies δg δh and δs showed the spontaneous endothermic and randomness in the adsorption process desorption studies showed excellent regenerative efficiency up to the 10th cycle of nanocomposites using 0 01 m naoh so this wastewater treatment system for the food industry is

on the use of magnetic nanoparticles as agents for removing heavy metals and other emerging pollutants most do not consider the combination with conventional treatment techniques so that they are

the combination of water pretreatment techniques that alleviate the burden of pollutants to increase the performance of tertiary treatments such as the implementation of nanotechnology has attracted the attention of researchers this because processes such as coagulation flocculation eliminate compounds or agents that cause interference in the affinity of adsorption or oxidation processes leading to lower implementation costs 15 16 examples of these are the combination of bentonite with magnetic nanoparticles 17 used fe3o4 nanoparticles combined with bentonite to remove zinc ii from synthetic wastewater obtaining an adsorption capacity of 22 50 mg g similarly 18 used magnetic bentonite to remove cod bod and nitrates from industrial wastewater where the concentrations of these three parameters in the treated water could be reduced by 70 or more similarly other studies have applied this combination of bentonite with magnetic nanoparticles to treat acid mine drainage 19 heavy metals 20 21 persistent organic compounds 22 among others therefore this work aims to evaluate the treatment and reuse in agricultural irrigation of wastewater derived from the guava paste production process through a system that combines pretreatment processes and conventional treatments with green magnetic nanoparticles modified with clays 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for the synthesis of magnetically modified clay nanoparticles bentonite clay iron chloride fecl3 glucose c6h12o6 and sodium hydroxide naoh were used in the treatment processes aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 and anthracite were used all chemicals were analytical grade and were used without further purification the wastewater used was obtained from the sandwich factory located in the municipality of vélez cundinamarca colombia which were generated from washing utensils for sandwich production stored under refrigeration at 4 c 2 2 synthesis of bentonite mnps to develop the synthesis of bentonite mnps a modification of the green co precipitation method developed by ref 12 was used briefly a 0 36 m aqueous solution of ferric chloride fecl3 was prepared which was heated to a temperature of 70 c and then a glucose solution was added a ph adjustment was made by adding sodium hydroxide to reach a value greater than 8 5 where the solution takes a black color it is brought to a temperature of 85 c 5 c for 15 min the clay is added and kept at 85 c 5 c for 30 min with continuous mechanical stirring at 100 rpm finally the modified nanoparticles were separated by magnetic field application by washing them three times with deionized water and alcohol for subsequent drying at 60 c for 12 h 2 3 characterization the magnetic properties of the nanomaterial were studied using vibratory sample magnetometer measurements vsm lakeshore model 665 at a temperature established by the method and with magnetization measurements depending on the field applied in a range between 30 koe to 30 koe the functional groups exposed on the surface of the material and which were responsible for the removal of contaminants were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in a shimadzu ir prestige21 ftir spectrometer where the sample was diluted in kbr and 150 scans were read by a liquid nitrogen detector in the transmittance method the physical particle size was measured by sem scanning electron microscopy in a carl zeiss model evo hd ma 15 crystallographic characterization was carried out through an x ray diffraction analysis in an x pert pro mpd panalytical project where the material obtained was subjected to bombardment with x rays emitted from a cu anode with a wavelength in a range of 10 90 with a step size of 0 026 and a step time of 20 s the surface electro kinetic potential of the particles and the hydrodynamic size were determined by zeta potential measurements in a malvern zvernizer nano zs90 the reported values were the average of 5 measurements which each was performed in an aqueous medium and under a potential at different ph values in the case of wastewater used they were analyzed according to standard methods for the chemical oxygen demand cod mgo2 l by colorimeter method standard method 5220c for biochemical oxygen demand bod5 mg l standard methods 5210b bod 5 day test for ph potentiometric method nitrate in water by colorimetry and cadmium reduction standard methods 4500 no3 e the ionic concentrations of chloride cl nitrate no3 nitrite no2 phosphate po4 3 and sulfate so4 2 were determined by ion chromatography 850 professional ic metrohm after the proposed treatments the textile wastewater was again characterized using the same parameters the concentration of iron and aluminum was determined by the standard methods 3500b and 3500b respectively 2 4 pilot scale treatability tests to have a water quality close to that required by the regulations pretreatment processes were carried out to reduce the organic and solids load contained in the wastewater these pretreatment processes consisted of sedimentation and subsequent aeration the sedimentation was carried out in sedimentation cones of 1l for 4 h after this time the water was separated from the settable solids they were transferred to an aeration system with a capacity of 4l and constant aeration for 2 h to oxidize suspended and dissolved organic matter subsequently the primary coagulation flocculation sedimentation cfs treatment processes were carried out using a conventional jar test system consisting of four beakers each with a volume of 1 l as coagulant sulfate was used aluminum according to the standard procedure astm d2035 2008 consisting of three steps i the coagulant was added to the wastewater 0 5 1 5 g l under a rapid mixing of 180 rpm for 5 min ii after coagulation the ph of the water samples was adjusted to neutral and coagulant was added with slow mixing for 20 min iii the samples were allowed to settle for 30 min finally the supernatant for turbidity iron and aluminum analysis was collected as process efficiency indicator parameters those experiments were conducted in duplicate with the best result of the cfs treatment bentonite mnps are implemented to treat a 250 ml residual water volume with 200 mg l of the nanomaterial and constant stirring for 2 h after the time has elapsed a low gradient magnetic field is applied to separate the nanomaterial and subsequent treatment in the rapid filtration system the filtration system costs a multimedia system activated carbon sand gravel the dimensions of the filtration column were 10x10 80 cm and the workflow was 0 3l hour this was done in order to be able to retain the material that has not been removed by the primary system or the nanoparticle system as well as to remove the nanoparticles that were not removed by the magnetic field 2 5 kinectic and isotherm study nitrate and cod removal by bentonite mnps was carried out in 100 ml batches the effect of time 3 120 min and the amount of nanomaterial 200 800 mg l on adsorption efficiency was investigated based on the results the efficiency and adsorption capacity of the cod and sulfate by bentonite mnps were calculated using 23 r c i c e c i 100 q v m c i c e where r is adsorption percentage q is the amount of adsorption at equilibrium mg g ce and ci are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of doc and sulphates mg l respectively v is the liquid volume l and m is the amount of used adsorbent g 2 6 adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption experiments at different temperatures were also performed to evaluate the influence of temperature 283 313 k the thermodynamic property of the adsorbent ion nitrate bentonite mnps system was calculated using the following equations 24 l n k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where δs 0 δg⁰ and δh 0 are the values of the entropy change free energy and the enthalpy change during the process r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant t k is the absolute temperature and kd is the distribution coefficient 2 7 desorption and reusability of nanomaterial desorption and reusability of adsorbents are essential and effective parameters in their design to reduce the process cost in desorption processes different solutions such as hydrochloric acid nitric acid sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride can be used in this study sodium hydroxide solution with a concentration of 0 01 m was used for the desorption process determination of the desorption percentage of ions from the adsorbent was made by ref 25 d e s o r p t i o n a m o u n t o f c o n t a m i n a n t d e s o r b e d a m o u n t o f c o n t a m i n a n t a d s r o b e d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization fig 1a shows the diffractogram of the bentonite modified with magnetic nanoparticles peaks with intensity at angles of 36 42 and 62 can be appreciated which refer to the magnetite of cubic spinel structure with indices of 311 400 and 440 26 27 the calculations associated with the network constant yielded a value of 8 30å which is close to the theoretical value of the magnetite 8 39 å the presence of bentonite is represented at a high intensity peak near 27 40 with the miller index 220 28 in addition this structure is recognized for having a peak 311 with high intensity 29 31 the diffractogram also shows peaks near the sides of the 220 and a minimum peak width 511 which allows establishing the low presence of maghemite since mixtures of maghemite magnetite compounds express low intensity peaks at 25 27 and 57 5 32 although the material is susceptible to oxidation in environmental conditions it still responds to an external magnetic force and can be used for ecological remediation tasks the average crystallite size of the crystalline magnetite nanoparticles analyzed by xrd was estimated using the scherrer equation d q λ β cos θ where d is the crystallite size q is the form factor that can be assumed to be 1 1 for spherical particles λ is the incident x ray wavelength θ is the bragg angle and β is the widening of the diffraction line measured in radians at half the maximum intensity the calculated crystallite size was found to be 13 1 nm in relatively good agreement with the size of nanoparticles observed under sem 60 80 nm fig 4 fig 1b shows the magnetic character of the nanomaterial it is observed that the magnetization that the conventional magnetic saturation nanoparticles reached a value of 82 67 emu g which is an approximate value to the theoretical one that is 90 emu g on the other hand the orange line corresponds to the magnetization of bentonite clay with magnetic nanoparticles which undergoes a reduction to 48 77 emu g because the nanoparticles contain clay due to the lack of magnetic behavior therefore this decrease is observed this means that there was a 46 reduction to the theoretical value of magnetization sem test fig 1 c and f was performed by the emission and detection of electrons where the size of the nanoparticles was obtained with agglomerates of approximately 200 nm but with an individual particle size of 60 80 nm according to the xrd analysis according to the eds analysis fig 1d it is observed that the percentage of iron fe is 20 and of the silica si is 25 confirming the presence of magnetite and bentonite clay in the synthesized nanomaterial likewise it is shown that the presence of average peaks which is referring to the impurities contained in the nanomaterial sample in this case the highest peaks are titanium ti calcium ca and potassium k although these impurities should not significantly influence the affinity of the contaminants in the wastewater with the nanocomposite surface they influence the reduction of the magnetic character of the nanoparticles low temperature saturation magnetization decreases as does magnetic susceptibility when impurities are present in the spinel ferrite crystal structure in this sense it would be desirable to improve the synthesis to reduce impurities since it would facilitate separating the pollutant nanomaterial complex from the treated wastewater 33 34 ftir spectrum of pure bentonite and bentonita mnps are shown in fig 1e for pure clay the characteristic absorption peak of the stretching vibrations of si o si o al is observed at 555 cm 1 a typical absorption band of the si o stretch vibration at 1045 cm 1 is observed similarly the characteristic absorption peak at 900 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of si o si o al while the peak at cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of o si o 35 the band at 1631 cm 1 results from the stretching vibration of si o si a strong peak at 1195 cm 1 indicates the stretching vibration so 36 the absorption band between 3425 and 3620 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibrations of the h2o molecules present within the clay matrix ftir spectrum of bentonite mnps shows the characteristic absorption band of fe o at 659 cm 1 37 38 due to fe3o4 interactions the typical bands of si o and si o al shifted from 555 to 503 cm 1 the c o h group peaks have 1150 cm 1 the c o c group has 1080 cm 1 and 1016 cm 1 appeared which are characteristic of the organic glucose layer that was used for the stabilization of the particles as well as the adsorption of co2 in the atmosphere these findings were consistent with those observed by refs 39 40 using modified bentonite with magnetite nanoparticles for the adsorption of heavy metals and the methyl orange dye from the aqueous solution respectively there it could be evidenced the bands at 531 797 916 and 1030 cm 1 corresponded to the simple bonding of fe o with respect to fe3o4 41 42 however the relative transmittance values decreased to lower values indicating the reaction of fe3o4 and glucose with the active groups on the bentonite surface overall ftir results complemented well with xrd data confirming the successful incorporation of fe3o4 and glucose into the bentonite 3 2 initial characterization of wastewater to define the pretreatment and primary treatment processes before implementing bentonite mnps the characterization of the wastewater to be treated was performed table 1 shows the physicochemical characteristics of wastewater from the production processes of the sandwich factory it can be seen that the wastewater has a large amount of total suspended solids from the fruit washing processes likewise given the acid character of guava wastewater has an acidic nature that must be pretreated to affect the efficiency of primary treatments in this sense pretreatment processes of preliminary sedimentation and neutralization are necessary regarding the design of the processes necessary to achieve water quality the comparison is made with what is established in resolution 1207 of 2014 by which provisions related to the use of treated wastewater are adopted the comparison demonstrates that the parameters of conductivity chlorides sulfates iron aluminum and total suspended solids comply with the regulations so the proposed treatment should not be addressed to these parameters but to the remaining ones thus the parameters of ph cod bod5 nitrates turbidity and suspended solids were those of interest 3 3 pretreatment of wastewater to reduce the values in the parameters of interest sedimentation aeration neutralization and cfs pretreatments were carried out visualizing the function of type ii aluminum sulfate as a coagulant it is obtained that the one with a concentration of 1 3 g l in which there was a better formation of flocs both in form and in sedimentable character fig 2 the values of the water quality parameters after each of these processes are observed in table 2 it can be seen that there was an appreciable reduction in turbidity in these processes of 85 which referred to the particulate material of fruit cultivation such as soil and organic matter this also has a lot to do with the initial characterization of the wastewater since although it is a productive process with natural organic material the bod is only 48 of the cod and such material on the surface of the fruit must contain hardly biodegradable organic compounds such as pesticides and fertilizers on the other hand there is an increase in dissolved solids after the cfs process associated with residual coagulant material used in operation likewise the decrease in ph values is characteristic of coagulation processes even more when the initial wastewater had an acidic ph that expresses an absence of alkalinity however the final ph value of 7 07 is appropriate for the application of the nanomaterial as well as for agricultural irrigation processes 3 4 treatment tests with bentonite mnps and rapid filtration the application of the nanomaterial as a tertiary treatment had good effectiveness for the elimination of dissolved material this can be seen since there was a reduction in the concentrations of chlorides sulfates and nitrates as well as in the cod table 3 this is explained because at a ph below 8 8 the surface of the bentonite is positively charged and therefore negative ions such as nitrates chlorides and sulfates will be electrostatically adsorbed to the surface of the bentonite 43 in this sense research has suggested that at a neutral ph or under the adsorption of negative ions the ligand exchange mechanism follows 40 these negative ions sulfates chlorides nitrates etc and the organic matter of the wastewater are chemical species that exert oxygen consumption so the decrease in these compounds is reflected in reducing the cod therefore the application of this material may be favored if the neutralization pretreatment process is not carried up to alkaline values but acid values close to neutral where adsorption is favored but the cfs process is not disadvantaged based on this adsorption capacities were obtained for nitrates chlorides and sulfates of 40 0 mg g 248 4 mg g and 29 15 mg g respectively which are good adsorption capacities for real water and simultaneously although there was a reduction in the parameters of interest turbidity and conductivity presented equal or higher values this issue was caused because the separation of the material after applying the low gradient magnetic field was not complete which causes the incident light to be absorbed at the time of the turbidity measurement test similarly it is presumed that there was a release of nanoparticles from the clay by the agitation force for the treatment since an increase in iron values in the treated water was found for this reason it is necessary to optimize either the synthesis method to obtain a greater interaction force between the bentonite and the magnetic nanoparticles either through the use of another reducing agent such as cysteine or glutathione that can create covalent bonds of greater strength and thus prevent detachment another way is to use a magnetic separation system where the applied field affects a smaller volume of water leading to the separation of both the magnetic clay and the magnetite nanoparticles in the solution for the final rapid filtration process a 14 ntu reduction in turbidity was obtained where the sand and activated carbon layer carried out the material removal process that could not be removed by the magnetic field in addition to removal of dissolved ions by the action of activated carbon table 4 shows the final characteristics of the treated water see table 5 from the previous table and comparing with the regulations established by the united states environmental protection agency epa the treatment process carried out complies with most of the parameters studied and of greater interest in agricultural irrigation such as nitrates chlorides sulfates and cod however it is necessary to perform an optimization in the magnetic separation process or in the final filtration in such a way that the turbidity parameter can be met since the value range stipulated in the standard provided by epa for superficial irrigation of crops of foods for human consumption that is ingested raw must be less than or equal to 2 0 ntu and in this case a value of 2 2 ntu was reached this due to the stability provided by the organic layer provided by glucose which prevents the oxidation of the iron atoms and therefore the loss of the magnetic character but causes the nanoparticles that are detached from the clay matrix to be weakly affected by the force of gravity due to its electrostatic repulsion the use of wastewater can be made for the local level based on the water quality index wqi for calculating the water quality index the importance values and normalization factors were taken into account according to the values of the physicochemical parameters estimated in the water treatment performed the results of the water quality index are observed below based on the preceding and according to the institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam and the ministry of environment and sustainable development the water coming from the sandwich factory after being treated is classified as acceptable the implementation of magnetic nanomaterials can be planted as an alternative for treating and reusing wastewater of this type 3 5 time contact effect and kinetic study to investigate the time required to complete the adsorption process and its velocity batch tests were conducted fig 3 the solution ph and the concentration of bentonita mnps were fixed at 7 0 and 500 mg l respectively and samples were measured for the residual amount of cod and nitrates for a contact time of 3 120 min fig 3 shows that the equilibrium was attained after 60 min however the adsorption capacity continued to increase for another hour but insignificantly p 0 01 the adsorbed amount of cod and nitrates increased significantly with an increase in contact time from 0 to 60 min cod shows a lower equilibrium time because the concentration in the wastewater is smaller than nitrates but the equilibrium time for nitrates is not too large the obtained data demonstrated that removing cod and nitrates from aqueous solutions by different soils was the three step kinetic process the first step i corresponds to the transfer of the molecules from the wastewater to the external surface of the adsorbent the second stage ii is relatively rapid this step corresponds to the adsorption of the adsorbant at the most accessible sites probably located on the outer surfaces of soil particles then in the third stage iii the adsorption of nitrates or cod continues but slowly to well understand the adsorption behavior of cod and nitrates on bentinite mnps surface and explore the adsorption mechanism two standard kinetic models including pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso were applied to evaluate the kinetics of the adsorption of cod and nitrates on bentinite mnps surface 48 49 the values of kinetic parameters of the adsorption process are summarized in table 6 the cod removal was better adjusted to the pseudo second order model with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 in contrast the nitrate removal was better adapted to the pseudo first order model with an r2 of 0 98 3 6 adsorption isotherms model the equilibrium adsorption isotherms are one of the promising data to understand the mechanism of the adsorption various isotherm equations are well known and two different isotherms are selected in this study which are the langmuir freundlich temkin and sips isotherms therefore according to results shown in supplementary figs 1 4 and table 7 the langmuir isotherm was the best fitted model for experimental data of cod adsorption onto nanocomposite implying monolayer adsorption of this ion on the surface of the nanocomposite in contrast the freundlich was the best fitted model for experimental data of nitrates adsorption see table 8 when comparing the results obtained with similar studies it can be noted that there is an improvement in the cod reduction capacity concerning bentonite chemically modified by ref 44 in this study the maximum adsorption capacity was 32 2 mg g for initial conditions of cod of 2000 mg l on the other hand 18 used magnetite nanoparticles obtained by the conventional co precipitation method which showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 416 mg l although this value is higher than that obtained in this study it was under acidic conditions and a much higher initial cod concentration 1875 mg l if we use the approach established by refs 45 46 to compare adsorption capacities the initial concentration of the adsorbate must be taken into account the present study expresses a q m c i value of 0 44 while in ref 18 the value would be 0 22 3 7 effect of temperature and adsorption thermodynamics the temperature dependence of the adsorption capacity of nitrates onto bentonite mnps was investigated at 30 40 and 50 c the results obtained in this work are shown in fig 4 as shown in this figure the amounts of nitrates adsorbed on the surface of the two adsorbents increased with increasing solution temperature which indicates an endothermic process increases in nitrates mobility can explain this behavior and also adequate energy could be required for more molecules to affect the interaction of surface active site 47 48 negative values of δg in table 6 confirmed the feasibility of and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process with a high preference for nitrate ions on the absorbent the value of δh was positive 19 97 kj mol indicating that the adsorption reaction was endothermic these results agree with the results obtained where adsorption increases with rising temperature indicating that the adsorption of this adsorbate is an endothermic process as seen in table 7 the positive value of δs 0 05 kj mol k reflected the affinity of the actives sites of bentonite mnps for nitrates ions in addition a positive value of δs also showed an increase of randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption of nitrates on the nanomaterial 49 50 3 8 desorption and recycle use of adsorbents reuse tests showed a decrease in adsorption percentage higher than 20 after the tenth cycle of contaminants adsorption fig 5 these results could be an indicator of the favourability in applying this material in the process at scale 4 conclusions implementing a method of green synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles using glucose as a reducing stabilizing and cohesion agent with bentonite was conducive to obtaining a magnetic nanomaterial with saturation magnetization close to 48 emu g which allowed its use in processes of wastewater treatment of the food industry results of xrd ftir sem edx and vsm showed that a combination of sonochemical and co precipitation method was a cost effective higher yield short reaction time procedure thus a facile route to produce nano adsorbent nitrate removal was best described by a pseudo first order kinetic model and freundlich isothermal model in contrast cod removal was better adjusted to pseudo second order and langmuir with adsorption capacities of 23 5 and 24 5 mg g respectively additionally the thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption process with the implementation of bentonite mnps is sporadic and endothermic a rapid filtration process improved the remaining parameters of turbidity and conductivity but it is required to enhance either the magnetic separation by obtaining a nanomaterial of better magnetic properties or the final filtration with a medium of smaller size so that water quality regulations for reuse have fully complied to implement the system finally it was established that the combination of coagulation flocculation sedimentation pretreatment processes with bentonite mnps is a potentially applicable process for the treatment and reuse of wastewater from the food industry since pretreatments lower the organic load and the nanomaterial has an affinity for dissolved material up to 10 reuse cycles credit author statement wilfredo marimon conceptualization

8772,the latest researches show that large amounts of humic substances hs are discharged by municipal facilities including sewage treatment plants therefore this paper covers characteristics of a soluble hs fraction i e fulvic acids fas contained in municipal sewage and balance of their amounts introduced to and discharged from a biological reactor fas were extracted from samples collected from mechanically and biologically treated sewage and from sewage and activated sewage sludge from the following cells of a biological reactor predenitrification dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification according to the flow through sewage treatment plant s section the paper discussed quantitative concentrations and 24 h loads of fas introduced to and discharged from the biological reactor and qualitative basic composition share of selected non organic pollutants including heavy metals thermo gravimetric analysis and infra red spectroscopy research additional atomic quotients c o c h c n and o h of basic composition were defined which made possible to conduct analysis of fas chemical and biochemical changes in the process of sewage treatment in the biological reactor the conducted quantitative balance of fas extracted from raw sewage and activated sewage sludge indicated that these substances are not subjects to biodegradation but to a large extent they are precipitated and absorbed on activated sewage sludge the remaining quantities are discharged from a sewage treatment plant together with treated sewage graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic substances sewage sludge biological reactor biodegradation adsorption 1 introduction humic substances hss are an important element of natural organic matter nom they are considered to be a complex mixture of a number of heterogeneous aggregates 1 hss are classified on the basis of their solubility they are divided into fulvic acids fas which are soluble across the entire ph range humic acids has which are soluble in alkaline solutions and precipitate at ph 2 humins hus which are insoluble in water irrespective of ph and hymatomelanic acids hys which are soluble in alcohols fas are complex substances without a standard chemical formula 2 they play a vital role in transportation of metals and other substances in the environment they occur universally and are present even deep underground 3 6 under irradiation hss are more toxic and reactive in soil due to the formation of environmentally persistent free radicals 7 dissolved hss extracted from leonardite are fairly effective washing agents for soils polluted with cu pb multiple heavy metals and other pollutants in high concentrations 8 hss are mainly extracted from soils surface waters and underground waters however there is no information available on the process of humification in sewage treatment plants the analysis of fas changes during the process of municipal sewage treatment is still needed research by manka rebhum 1982 showed that hss constituted the largest organic group in a municipal sewage treatment plant following various treatment stages research 9 has shown that the effluent of sewage is almost devoid of has and the hys fraction exceeded the fas according to barker stuckey 1999 hss from biological sewage treatment plants are generally considered a type of a dissolved microbiological product which may be generated in conformity with cellular auto catalysis hypotheses fas extracted from sewage in comparison with other sources of these substances brown waters soils feature a more aliphatic character which is confirmed by spectroscopic tests pointing to a lesser character of double fixation 10 research on the redox behavior changes of hss during the electrochemical oxidation process that the quinone and aromatic groups of the hss were degraded by electrochemical oxidation this led directly to decreased electron donating apability the process promoted the formation of fas and was accompanied by improved electron accepting apability 11 according to ref 12 hss present in sewage have a major influence on the quality of sewage in sewage treatment systems the main separation vector of metals and stable organic pollutants during their migration and transformation they were found to be precursors of side products of disinfection such as trichloromethanes hss have a relatively high affinity towards common pollutants such as heavy metal ions pesticides etc 13 analysis of the infrared spectrum has shown that fas extracted from landfill leachates as well as raw and treated wastewater have a similar chemical structure they are aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl and carboxylic acid groups it has been confirmed that the more aliphatic groups that are in the acids the more micropollutants they comprise 14 research of 15 indicated that the concentration of fas extracted from biologically treated sewage equalled 5 2 g m3 and was lower than the concentration of fas introduced to the biological reactor together with mechanically treated sewage 15 these substances are not subject to degradation during biological sewage treatment 16 and in a separated fermentation chamber sfc they are enriched with functional groups containing oxygen and aromatic rings 17 research has indicated that these substances may be decomposed by archaea 18 interested researches by ref 19 conducted an alternative use of hss obtained from coal tailings hss decreased the erodibility of soils in ornamental rock mining areas the stability of the discussed substances seems to be an advantage over products of easy degradation which only confer an intense effect on the initial stability of the aggregate after incorporation miranda et al 2020 meng et al tested the potential influence of hss bio refractors on the performance of a reactor and functional structure of microorganisms in anammox bioreactors the long term operation of the reactors proved that the presence of hss in inflowing sewage had no considerable influence on the rate of nitrogen removal a lower level of hss 1 mg l 1 in sewage led to an increase in genes responsible for relaying the transduction signal 20 since there is no information available about the amount and analysis of the chemical and biochemical changes in fas during the process of municipal sewage treatment the aim of this research was to conduct quantitative and qualitative studies the main objective of the work was to conduct a collective analysis and quantitative balance of fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from a biological reactor this is especially important because more research reports examining the relationship between hss related to the production and consumption of greenhouse gases which are the main driver of global warming have emerged in the last year 21 2 material and methods for the purpose of the paper the soluble hss fraction i e fas were tested due to their high solubility which facilitates their transition to surface waters together with treated sewage samples were collected according to the flow direction along the sewage treatment plant s section from the collected samples fas were extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from biological reactor s chambers which were properly marked for each chamber fig 1 predenitrification fa1 sewage fa1 sewage sludge dephosphatation fa2 sewage fa2 sewage sludge denitrification fa3 sewage fa3 sewage sludge nitrification fa4 sewage fa4 sewage sludge additionally fas were extracted from mechanically fa0 and biologically fa5 treated sewage in fig 1 a technological diagram of selected sewage treatment plant is presented with indicated locations of sample collection fas were extracted according to instructions of the international humic substances society ihss with a slight modification 22 the sewage samples were acidified with hydrochloric acid hcl a c s 1 1 to a ph value of 2 after 24 h sewage were infiltrated through average thickness filters with the use of glass beads that were 0 5 cm in diameter the infiltrated sewage were passed through a bed with hydrophobic amberlit xad 1180 resin with a speed of 1 l h desorption of fas was executed with 0 1 n naoh the obtained desorbate was directed to a highly acidic cation exchanger in the form of h lewatit monoplus 112 conversely the efflux was concentrated in vacuum evaporator at a temperature of 80 c and under the pressure of 350 mbar the sample was evaporated in a water bath at a temperature of 80 c and dried to obtain a dry remains of fas due to the low concentration of a soluble organic carbon soc 300 l of sewage were infiltrated to extract suitable amounts of fas the tested sewage sludgecollected from individual chambers of the biological reactor was dewatered in a sewage sludge depositional centrifuge and then flooded with 0 1 n naoh after 24 h the solution was decanted and the remaining part was flooded once more with the same amount of 0 1n naoh and left for another 24 h then the sewage sludge was centrifuged and the filtered fraction was merged with the rest of the solution the clear solution was acidified to the a ph value of 2 and subjected to fas extraction with the same method as in the case of fas extraction from sewage 2 1 qualitative analysis 2 1 1 determination of basic elements content the tests for basic element content included carbon oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen due to a small content of sulphur its share in tests on clear fas fraction was omitted fas are always composed of the above elements irrespective of their

cd hg ba mn and fe 2 1 3 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermogravimetric analysis tga was used for determination of ash content and the determination of mass loss at certain temperatures for the purpose of determination a thermogravimetric analyser sdt q600 from ta instruments was used a sample of 5 10 mg was weighed out and then burnt at a temperature of 550 c for 30 min the condition for the experiment included a heating rate of 10 c min up to 700 c with air flow of 100 ml min 2 1 4 determination of infrared spectrum the analysis of the infrared spectra infrared radiation absorption provides valuable information about the composition of fas infrared spectra are used for qualitative determination of hss a detailed analysis of the absorption bands of the obtained infrared spectrum makes it possible to determine the present fixations the identification of fixation was executed with the use of the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir method with the attenuated total atr attachment the spectral range was 450 4 000 cm 1 with a resolution of 1 cm 1 for the purpose of determination an ft ir is10 spectrometer from thermo nicolet and perkinelmer uatr two was used tests of the infrared spectrum were conducted in order to define the influence of the internal fas structure spectroscopic test methods are particularly important in hss research since when in connection with other chemical methods they deliver valuable information on the chemical structure of the discussed compounds 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative and qualitative analysis of extracted fas the analysis covered the results of qualitative and quantitative tests of fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge the samples were collected in 6 locations of the technological system the samples were collected 3 times and the results were averaged in fig 2 results for the content of clear fas in an ashless mass sample are presented the highest fas concentration was obtained in sewage sludge collected from the dephosphatation fa2 chamber 203 60 g m3 then from the denitrification chamber 181 59 g m3 and the nitrification chamber 143 89 g m3 and the lowest concentration was from the predenitrification chamber 132 68 g m3 concentrations of fas extracted from sewage were much lower and the highest of them was obtained for fas extracted from the dephosphatation chamber 5 92 g m3 as in the case of sewage sludge the considerable content of fas may also stem from the decomposition of suspended solid pollutants introduced to the discussed chamber in the process of mechanical sewage treatment in the methodology adopted in this paper sewage after mechanical treatment like the others wastewater collected from each chamber of a biological reactor was subject to clarification and filtration in order to remove the suspended solids it should be assumed that the suspended solids which were sedimented and separated with great efforts for the purpose of the tests in actual biological reactor at the sewage treatment plant was together with mechanically treated sewage introduced to the dephosphatation chamber dpc the suspended solids fraction consisted of to a large extent organic substances with absorbed fas as a result of the biochemical processes taking place in a given chamber fas were released to sewage and even the process of humification of organic pollutants might have occured part of the suspended solids fraction was absorbed on the activated sewage sludge thus increasing the concentration of fas in it the concentration of fas collected in dpc amounted to 5 92 g m3 in each subsequent sewage treatment stage the concentration of fas was lower in the denitrification chamber it amounted to 2 87 g m3 and in the nitrification chamber it was 2 79 g m3 the lowest concentration of fas was determined for sewage collected in the predenitrification chamber 1 93 g m3 and biologically treated sewage 2 78 g m3 23 the basic composition of the extracted fas was determined per conversion to ashless mass table 1 in the tested fa0 table 1 from mechanically treated sewage the content of carbon was higher 55 51 than in fa5 which was isolated from biologically treated sewage 46 02 fa2 extracted from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber contained 49 87 carbon the carbon content in fas obtained from activated sewage sludge was similar for all samples just like in the case of fas extracted from mechanically treated sewage containing more carbon which points to higher humification than in the case of fas extracted from sewage there was an interrelation visible that with every subsequent degree of sewage treatment the content of c was gradually lower and thus the humification degree was also lower although the difference were small the discussed fas were characterised by similar c content the lowest oxygen content in fas extracted from sewage was evident for fa0 isolated from mechanically treated sewage 36 86 and the highest for fa5 from biologically treated sewage 47 28 the oxygen content in fas extracted from sewage from predenitrification dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers may stem from processes taking place in chamber of the biological reactor the oxygen content in fa1 in the predenitrification chamber with anaerobic conditions amounted to 43 65 moreover in the dephosphatation chamber anaerobic processes taking place and for fas extracted from this chamber fa2 contained 43 62 oxygen which is slightly less than in fas from the previous chamber on the other hand the content of o in fas extracted from the denitrification chamber in which there are the so called hypoxic condition was higher than in the anaerobic chamber predenitrification chamber pdnc and denitrification chamber dnc and amounted to 44 95 the hypoxic conditions provide for the o contained in nitrates to be used by bacteria and the nitrogen is transformed into a gaseous form the content of o in fas extracted from sewage from fa4 nitrification chamber with aerobic conditions was the highest and amounted to 45 33 on the basis of the obtained test results a conclusion may be drawn that under aerobic conditions fas were characterised by higher ocontent the high content of the discussed element in the fas structure from chambers of the biological reactor may indicate the presence of aliphatic groups the higher oxygen content is connected with the higher content of aliphatic groups and thus with the lower humification degree this interrelation is confirmed by the results of the above tests the content of o in fas increased from 36 86 fa0 to 47 28 fa5 the highest oxygen content among fas extracted from sewage sludge was recorded for the discussed organic substances collected from the nitrification chamber fas extracted from sewage sludge compared to fas extracted from sewage featured a lower content of o which indicates the lower content of aliphatic groups in the discussed fas the content of o in fas increased from 30 88 sewage sludge from thepredenitrification chamber to 34 74 sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber the content of o in fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge in the sewage treatment plant may be presented in the following series f a 1 f a 2 f a 3 f a 4 f a 0 f a 2 f a 1 f a 3 f a 4 f a 5 through analysis of the above interrelation one may notice that the humification degree of the fas in sewage sludge is higher than that of fas in sewage in fas extracted from fa1 mechanically treated sewage the amount of hydrogen decreased from 5 55 fa0 to 5 13 fa5 the most hydrogen was contained by fas extracted from sewage from the denitrification chamber fa4 6 49 and the least was from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber fa2 4 85 but this requires additional tests to confirm in fas extracted from sewage sludge the hydrogen content decreased from 6 65 fa1 to 6 00 fa3 fas extracted from sewage sludge from dephosphatation chamber fa2 contained 6 61 of h and the lowest content of the discussed element was featured by fas extracted from sewage from denitrification chamber fa3 6 00 the content of h in all samples was very similar the nitrogen content in fas extracted from mechanically treated sewage fa0 equalled 2 08 comparing this with data found in the literature for this subject 10 fas extracted from sewage contained less n thus a conclusion may be drawn that they also contained less amino acids in their structure as a result of biological sewage treatment over the course of denitrification and nitrification processes nitrogen compounds are removed the nitrogen content in fas following the denitrification process fa3 equalled to 1 67 and the following the nitrification fa4 decreased to 1 4 the nitrogen content in fas extracted from sewage sludge from the predenitrification chamber fa1 was higher and amounted to 7 36 the high nitrogen content evidences large amounts of amino acids in the structure of fas the nitrogen content in fas extracted from sewage sludge following the dephosphatation process fa2 was also high and amounted to 7 33 following the denitrification process fa3 to 7 16 and following the nitrification process fa4 the nitrogen content dropped in fas to 7 12 the percentage content of nitrogen in fas is an important factor which is considered for determination of suitability of an organic material for agricultural purposes in this case fas extracted from sewage sludge in sewage treatment plant the content of n in fas extracted from sewage in sewage treatment plant may be presented with the following series f a 1 f a 2 f a 3 f a 4 f a 0 f a 1 f a 3 f a 2 f a 5 f a 4 fas may be carriers of micro pollutions and on the basis of test results one may determine that in the outcome of the sewage treatment processes fas may absorb some amounts of nitrogen fas extracted from sewage contain less amount of nitrogen than those from sewage sludge the higher value of c o atomic quotient and the lower value of o h indicates the higher degree of the humification process in fas extracted from sewage sludge for fas extracted from sewage the c o atomic quotient dropped from 2 01 fa0 to 1 30 fa5 the higher atomic quotient in fas extracted from sewage at the beginning of technological line is connected with the larger amount of functional groups containing oxygen carboxyl alcohol phenol groups etc and it indicates the lower humification degree which stems from the fact that as a result of humification a more extensive loss of oxygen or hydrogen takes place in a particle when analysing the entire treatment process it may be observed that fas following the biological treatment which is at the outflow of sewage treatment plant are characterised by less hydrophobicity on the basis of the above data it may be observed that fas at the outflow from the sewage treatment plant are characterised by higher content of carbohydrates than at the inflow to the sewage treatment plant for fas extracted from sewage sludge the c o atomic quotient dropped from 2 38 fa1 to 2 00 fa4 atomic quotients of c o in fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge in sewage treatment plant may be presented with the following series f a 1 f a 2 f a 3 f a 0 f a 4 f a 2 f a 1 f a 4 f a 3 f a 5 on the other hand the value of the atomic quotient of o h increased from 0 42 fa1 to 0 58 for fas extracted from biologically treated sewage fa5 which also confirms the lower level of humification process execution in sewage during the process of sewage treatment the atomic quotient of o h for fas extracted from sewage sludge was at a similar level fas extracted from sewage sludge were characterised by a higher level of humification in comparison to fas from sewage coming from the selected sewage treatment plant the highest c h atomic quotient and at the same time the highest degree of aromatisation and condensation was featured by fas extracted from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber fa2 0 86 and mechanically treated sewage fa0 0 83 and the lowest was for fas obtained from sewage collected from the denitrification chamber fa3 0 60 the c h atomic quotient for fas extracted from biologically treated sewage fa5 equalled 0 75 and was lower than for fas extracted from mechanically treated sewage fa0 on the basis of the above results a conclusion may be drawn that fas at the outflow from the selected sewage treatment plant fa5 were less aromatised and condensed then the sewage at the inflow to the sewage treatment plant fa0 the highest c h atomic quotient and at the same time the highest degree of aromatisation and condensation of fas isolated from sewage sludge were featured by fas extracted from the denitrification chamber fa4 0 76 and from sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber fa4 0 71 and the lowest was featured for dephosphatation chamber fa2 and the predenitrification chamber fa1 0 69 the value of c h atomic quotient for fas increased with each subsequent degree of sewage treatment the exception was the nitrification chamber nc but the difference was small the value of c n atomic quotient for fas increased for biologically treated sewage fa5 and equalled 34 2 which stems from the fact that in biologically treated sewage and as a consequence in fas the content of n was low which is a natural result of sewage treatment processes within which the content of n is decreased the highest of the discussed quotients for fas extracted from sewage sludge was featured by fas from the denitrification chamber fa3 8 92 following by the predenitrification chamber fa1 and the dephosphatation chamber fa2 8 74 the lowest c n atomic quotient was featured by fas extracted from sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber fa4 8 53 but the differences were small it is worth noticing that atomic quotients were at similar levels which may evidence the fact that fas from the tested samples are characterised by similar biological conditions according to van krevelen fig 3 the values of h c amounting to approx 0 3 are characteristic for compounds with highly condensed aromatic rings the values of approx 0 7 characterise monocyclic aromatic carbohydrates and the values in the range of 0 7 1 5 are consistent with aromatic sets fixated with aliphatic chains consisting in up to 10 atoms of carbon the values in the range of 1 5 1 7 are consistent with alicyclic carbohydrates finally values of approx 2 are characteristics for paraffins the value of h c quotient for fas extracted from sewage amounted to 1 17 1 66 which means that the samples fa0 fa1 fa2 fa3 fa5 are consistent with aromatic sets fixated with aliphatic chains consisting in up to 10 atoms of carbon and fa4 is consistent with alicyclic carbohydrates the variability in h c ratio values spurs the arrangement of the extracted fas in series with reference to the share of aliphatic structures and the condensation degree the highest share of aliphatic structures in the tested fas is featured by fas extracted from the denitrification and nitrification chambers and the lowest for fas extracted from the dephosphatation chamber the value of h c quotient for fas extracted from sewage sludge amounted to 1 32 1 45 this means that all samples are consistent with aromatic sets fixated with aliphatic chains consisting of up to 10 atoms of carbon 3 1 1 analysis of the content of the selected nonorganic pollutants in fas in table 2 the elemental composition of nonorganic pollutants in fas extracted from the selected types of sewage and activated sewage sludge is presented in the tested fas table 2 extracted from sewage 8 elements cl si ca k mg p br al were detected and in fas extracted from sewage sludge 10 elements cl si ca k mg p br al b sr were detected the analysis of elemental composition indicated that the dry remains obtained in the process of fa samples roasting at a temperature of 550 c contained considerable amounts of chlorine and silicon the rest of the elements were trace elements as an outcome of biochemical processes the decomposition of various substances different elements may be released which are absorbed on fas many of the above elements may influence the qualityof fas especially those which occurred in higher concentrations differences in content of trace elements may stem from the fact that samples were collected on different days thus the composition may have differed it should be taken into consideration that hss including fas feature the ability to generate complexes with trace elements and this is a subject of numerous scientific studies for fas extracted from sewage sludge the content of heavy metals was tested table 3 the presence of 7 heavy metals table 3 in fas extracted from sewage sludge was detected cu cr zn ni pb ba and fe it is worth noting that all heavy metals ions may generate complexes with organic substances resistant to decomposition 3 1 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir according to the figure figs 4 and 5 a clearly indicated band appeared with wavenumber 2950 cm 1 which may indicate the occurrence of asymmetric and symmetric c h extensions of ch2 group the absorption band for the discussed wavenumber occurs with the majority of samples its highest intensity was confirmed for samples fa2 fa4 fa2 fa3 fa4 in the remaining fas samples fa1 and fa1 differences between the analysed ranges were less visible the next clearly indicated signals were found in the range of 1600 1800 cm 1 which is connected with the presence of co carbonylic groups in peptides aldehydes and ketones cc fixations in aromatic rings including lignin structures and cn amide groups and others containing nitrogen 24 the most characteristic absorption zones in the analysed range are for wavenumbers 1750 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 the presence of the first one points to the occurrence of co fixations in carboxyl groups and co extending fixation of carbonylic groups in ketones and quinones absorbance in the range of 1650 cm 1 indicates on the other hand that there are cc fixations in aromatic bonds and co fixations present in quinones confirming the high maturity of the isolated fas 25 28 the highest intensity in this section of infrared spectrum was confirmed for fas extracted from sewage from the nitrification chamber and biologically treated sewage interrelation of the discussed absorption zones depends on the course of the humification process in all analysed fas extracted from sewage an absorbency band of 1000 1150 cm 1 was highlighted which may originate in och3 coh and coc groups as well as various organic compounds carboxyl acids alcohols cyclic ethers or it may be connected with mineral fraction mainly sio2 29 the highest intensity for the discussed band was determined for fas extracted from sewage from dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers as well as sewage sludge from dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers peak values occurring below 1000 cm 1 i e 950 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from the denitrification chamber 850 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber 820 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from predenitrification denitrification and nitrification chambers 620 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from dephosphatation and nitrification chambers and sewage sludge from dephosphatation and denitrification chambers 600 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from the dephosphatation chamber 580 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber confirm the presence of bending oscillations of aromatic compounds of c h alkenes in the tested fas and show deformation of nh2 plane 25 28 according to authors 30 31 the assumed heterogeneous nature of the researched substances results in quite wide observable peak values which was indicated through the analysis of the extracted fas the infrared spectroscopy for fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from the biological reactor from predenitrification dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers of sewage treatment plant indicated high similarity of the isolated fas which indicates little differentiation in their chemical structure see figs 4 and 5 4 quantitative balance of fas on the basis of our research and the data obtained from the discussed sewage treatment plant a quantitative balance of inflowing and outflowing fas from the sewage treatment plant in sewage with consideration of fas discharged with excessive sewage sludge was executed 4 1 load of fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge the following assumptions were made 24 h mean flow fd 165 000 m3 d 24 h mean outflow of treated sewage oo 161 143 m3 d oo fd fess excessive sewage sludge flow fess 3 857 m3 d excessive sewage sludge concentration cess 8 kgsm m3 ci concentration of fas in sewage at inflow 5 13 g m3 co concentration of fas in sewage at outflow 2 78 g m3 the 24 h load of fas at inflow to the biological reactor amounts to the following l d f a s f d c i 165 000 m 3 d 0 00513 k g m 3 846 45 k g d the 24 h load of fas discharged from the sewage treatment plant with the treated sewage is the following l 0 f a s f 0 c 0 161 143 0 00278 447 98 k g d the 24 h load of fas in excessive sewage sludge is the following l d f a e s s 3 857 m 3 d 8 k g m 3 0 007 k g k f k g s m 215 99 k g d the 24 h load of fas discharged with the treated sewage was almost twice as small as the introduced one as follows l d f a s l 0 f a s δ l f a s 846 45 447 98 398 47 k g d if the load of the fas discharged with the excessive sludge is taken into consideration the result is the following δ l f a s 846 45 44 98 215 99 182 48 k g d the mean 24 h outflow from the selected sewage treatment plant amounts to 161 143 m3 d and considering that the concentration of fas at the outflow from the sewage treatment plant amounts to 2 78 g m3 the daily dump of fas amounts to approx 447 98 kg day the concentration of fas extracted from the biologically treated sewage was in the range in which hs are present in natural waters with average of 1 9 mg l 32 the total 24 h load of fas fig 6 introduced into the selected sewage treatment plant 846 45 kg day was larger than the discharged load the portion of fas went through to the activated sewage sludge as the analysis of the discussed organic substances indicates that their total load in sewage and sewage sludge at the outflow from the biological reactor amounted to 663 97 kg day and it was lower than the load at the beginning of the technological line by 182 48 kg day 846 45 447 98 215 99 182 48 kg day the decrease in load of the discharged fas may stem from the fact that fas together with the recirculated sewage sludge are transferred to the pdnc the amounts due to the closed loop circulation are not taken into consideration in the balance the difference may also stem from a measurement error of the fas concentration in the sewage sludge and treated sewage as well as from the fas humification process resulting in insoluble form of has which was not extracted for the purpose of this research results of such an analysis would provide explanation to transformation processes that take place and would determine if the decrease in the load is an outcome of humidification of fas or has or whether they are subject to biodegradation as it is well known sewage sludge is the main side product of wastewater treatment plants and consists of mainly water organic substances including fas and nonorganic minerals this research has provided information on the characteristics and properties of extracted fas which can be a potential source of humic fertilisers for improving soils it should be remembered though that they may contain pathogenic microorganisms heavy metals and phytotoxic organic compounds therefore for the purpose of using them as fertilisers they must be properly neutralize 33 research has shown that fas isolated from activated sewage sludge have larger concentrations than those extracted from wastewater according to 33 hss may have different effects on the fermentation process and volatile fatty acid production research has shown that fas are present in higher concentrations in activated sludge the composition and properties of which may limit its biodegradability and hamper volatile fatty acid production 33 in the face of a serious problem which is the shortage of drinking water and the possibility of solving this problem using modern technologies transforming wastewater into drinking water it is important to constantly expand knowledge of the composition of wastewater and its impact on human health and life as previously mentioned in municipal wastewater treatment plants hss are discharged with treated sewage to surface waters it is important to determine the amount and place of occurrence of fas which was the main objective of this work the impact of hss on the use of treated municipal sewage as a source of industrially process ed water is still unclear according to the obtained results fas contained in wastewater have a typical concentration of fas that naturally occur in surface waters however it should be taken into account that they may be precursors of by products of oxidation and disinfection processes generated in water treatment plants the discussed substances are soluble in the entire ph range therefore they can easily pass from the sewage treatment plant to surface waters which are collected for drinking purposes this is an important issue for the environment and human health 5 conclusions on the basis of the obtained test results a conclusion may be drawn that under aerobic conditions fas 514 feature larger amounts of o in their structure and thus a lower humification degree the results of this 515 study demonstrated that at the outflow of the sewage treatment plant fas were characterised by lesser 516 hydrophobicity and a higher content of carbohydrates fas are good carriers of micro pollutants which 517 was confirmed during this research the difference occurred between the amount of fas introduced into 518 the selected sewage treatment plant and the amount discharged from the sewage treatment plant 519 confirming the view held by many scientists that fas are resistant to biodegradation at the same time 520 it may be assumed that there are some microorganisms e g ammonia oxidizing bacteria and or 521 archaea which are present in the sewage sludge that break down fas but this requires additional but 522

8772,the latest researches show that large amounts of humic substances hs are discharged by municipal facilities including sewage treatment plants therefore this paper covers characteristics of a soluble hs fraction i e fulvic acids fas contained in municipal sewage and balance of their amounts introduced to and discharged from a biological reactor fas were extracted from samples collected from mechanically and biologically treated sewage and from sewage and activated sewage sludge from the following cells of a biological reactor predenitrification dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification according to the flow through sewage treatment plant s section the paper discussed quantitative concentrations and 24 h loads of fas introduced to and discharged from the biological reactor and qualitative basic composition share of selected non organic pollutants including heavy metals thermo gravimetric analysis and infra red spectroscopy research additional atomic quotients c o c h c n and o h of basic composition were defined which made possible to conduct analysis of fas chemical and biochemical changes in the process of sewage treatment in the biological reactor the conducted quantitative balance of fas extracted from raw sewage and activated sewage sludge indicated that these substances are not subjects to biodegradation but to a large extent they are precipitated and absorbed on activated sewage sludge the remaining quantities are discharged from a sewage treatment plant together with treated sewage graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic substances sewage sludge biological reactor biodegradation adsorption 1 introduction humic substances hss are an important element of natural organic matter nom they are considered to be a complex mixture of a number of heterogeneous aggregates 1 hss are classified on the basis of their solubility they are divided into fulvic acids fas which are soluble across the entire ph range humic acids has which are soluble in alkaline solutions and precipitate at ph 2 humins hus which are insoluble in water irrespective of ph and hymatomelanic acids hys which are soluble in alcohols fas are complex substances without a standard chemical formula 2 they play a vital role in transportation of metals and other substances in the environment they occur universally and are present even deep underground 3 6 under irradiation hss are more toxic and reactive in soil due to the formation of environmentally persistent free radicals 7 dissolved hss extracted from leonardite are fairly effective washing agents for soils polluted with cu pb multiple heavy metals and other pollutants in high concentrations 8 hss are mainly extracted from soils surface waters and underground waters however there is no information available on the process of humification in sewage treatment plants the analysis of fas changes during the process of municipal sewage treatment is still needed research by manka rebhum 1982 showed that hss constituted the largest organic group in a municipal sewage treatment plant following various treatment stages research 9 has shown that the effluent of sewage is almost devoid of has and the hys fraction exceeded the fas according to barker stuckey 1999 hss from biological sewage treatment plants are generally considered a type of a dissolved microbiological product which may be generated in conformity with cellular auto catalysis hypotheses fas extracted from sewage in comparison with other sources of these substances brown waters soils feature a more aliphatic character which is confirmed by spectroscopic tests pointing to a lesser character of double fixation 10 research on the redox behavior changes of hss during the electrochemical oxidation process that the quinone and aromatic groups of the hss were degraded by electrochemical oxidation this led directly to decreased electron donating apability the process promoted the formation of fas and was accompanied by improved electron accepting apability 11 according to ref 12 hss present in sewage have a major influence on the quality of sewage in sewage treatment systems the main separation vector of metals and stable organic pollutants during their migration and transformation they were found to be precursors of side products of disinfection such as trichloromethanes hss have a relatively high affinity towards common pollutants such as heavy metal ions pesticides etc 13 analysis of the infrared spectrum has shown that fas extracted from landfill leachates as well as raw and treated wastewater have a similar chemical structure they are aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl and carboxylic acid groups it has been confirmed that the more aliphatic groups that are in the acids the more micropollutants they comprise 14 research of 15 indicated that the concentration of fas extracted from biologically treated sewage equalled 5 2 g m3 and was lower than the concentration of fas introduced to the biological reactor together with mechanically treated sewage 15 these substances are not subject to degradation during biological sewage treatment 16 and in a separated fermentation chamber sfc they are enriched with functional groups containing oxygen and aromatic rings 17 research has indicated that these substances may be decomposed by archaea 18 interested researches by ref 19 conducted an alternative use of hss obtained from coal tailings hss decreased the erodibility of soils in ornamental rock mining areas the stability of the discussed substances seems to be an advantage over products of easy degradation which only confer an intense effect on the initial stability of the aggregate after incorporation miranda et al 2020 meng et al tested the potential influence of hss bio refractors on the performance of a reactor and functional structure of microorganisms in anammox bioreactors the long term operation of the reactors proved that the presence of hss in inflowing sewage had no considerable influence on the rate of nitrogen removal a lower level of hss 1 mg l 1 in sewage led to an increase in genes responsible for relaying the transduction signal 20 since there is no information available about the amount and analysis of the chemical and biochemical changes in fas during the process of municipal sewage treatment the aim of this research was to conduct quantitative and qualitative studies the main objective of the work was to conduct a collective analysis and quantitative balance of fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from a biological reactor this is especially important because more research reports examining the relationship between hss related to the production and consumption of greenhouse gases which are the main driver of global warming have emerged in the last year 21 2 material and methods for the purpose of the paper the soluble hss fraction i e fas were tested due to their high solubility which facilitates their transition to surface waters together with treated sewage samples were collected according to the flow direction along the sewage treatment plant s section from the collected samples fas were extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from biological reactor s chambers which were properly marked for each chamber fig 1 predenitrification fa1 sewage fa1 sewage sludge dephosphatation fa2 sewage fa2 sewage sludge denitrification fa3 sewage fa3 sewage sludge nitrification fa4 sewage fa4 sewage sludge additionally fas were extracted from mechanically fa0 and biologically fa5 treated sewage in fig 1 a technological diagram of selected sewage treatment plant is presented with indicated locations of sample collection fas were extracted according to instructions of the international humic substances society ihss with a slight modification 22 the sewage samples were acidified with hydrochloric acid hcl a c s 1 1 to a ph value of 2 after 24 h sewage were infiltrated through average thickness filters with the use of glass beads that were 0 5 cm in diameter the infiltrated sewage were passed through a bed with hydrophobic amberlit xad 1180 resin with a speed of 1 l h desorption of fas was executed with 0 1 n naoh the obtained desorbate was directed to a highly acidic cation exchanger in the form of h lewatit monoplus 112 conversely the efflux was concentrated in vacuum evaporator at a temperature of 80 c and under the pressure of 350 mbar the sample was evaporated in a water bath at a temperature of 80 c and dried to obtain a dry remains of fas due to the low concentration of a soluble organic carbon soc 300 l of sewage were infiltrated to extract suitable amounts of fas the tested sewage sludgecollected from individual chambers of the biological reactor was dewatered in a sewage sludge depositional centrifuge and then flooded with 0 1 n naoh after 24 h the solution was decanted and the remaining part was flooded once more with the same amount of 0 1n naoh and left for another 24 h then the sewage sludge was centrifuged and the filtered fraction was merged with the rest of the solution the clear solution was acidified to the a ph value of 2 and subjected to fas extraction with the same method as in the case of fas extraction from sewage 2 1 qualitative analysis 2 1 1 determination of basic elements content the tests for basic element content included carbon oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen due to a small content of sulphur its share in tests on clear fas fraction was omitted fas are always composed of the above elements irrespective of their origin or a source of occurrence the content of basic element is provided in the form of an ashless mass determination of carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content was executed with the use of combustion method with chromatographic detection basic analysis a 5 10 mg sample was used for the test determination was executed with elementary analyser flash 2000 from thermo 2 1 2 determination of trace elements content the analysis of trace element content was executed with the use of the x ray fluorescence xrf method determination was executed in a vessel for analysis of powders on a 4 μm prolen film with the use of the s8 tiger model device from bruker the following elements were determined s cl si ca k mg p br mn ce ti i al b and sr heavy metals in samples were determined with the use of the inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms method according to the standard test procedure in compliance with pn en iso 17294 2 2006 the following elements were determined cu cr zn ni pb cd hg ba mn and fe 2 1 3 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermogravimetric analysis tga was used for determination of ash content and the determination of mass loss at certain temperatures for the purpose of determination a thermogravimetric analyser sdt q600 from ta instruments was used a sample of 5 10 mg was weighed out and then burnt at a temperature of 550 c for 30 min the condition for the experiment included a heating rate of 10 c min up to 700 c with air flow of 100 ml min 2 1 4 determination of infrared spectrum the analysis of the infrared spectra infrared radiation absorption provides valuable information about the composition of fas infrared spectra are used for qualitative determination of hss a detailed analysis of the absorption bands of the obtained infrared spectrum makes it possible to determine the present fixations the identification of fixation was executed with the use of the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir method with the attenuated total atr attachment the spectral range was 450 4 000 cm 1 with a resolution of 1 cm 1 for the purpose of determination an ft ir is10 spectrometer from thermo nicolet and perkinelmer uatr two was used tests of the infrared spectrum were conducted in order to define the influence of the internal fas structure spectroscopic test methods are particularly important in hss research since when in connection with other chemical methods they deliver valuable information on the chemical structure of the discussed compounds 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative and qualitative analysis of extracted fas the analysis covered the results of qualitative and quantitative tests of fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge the samples were collected in 6 locations of the technological system the samples were collected 3 times and the results were averaged in fig 2 results for the content of clear fas in an ashless mass sample are presented the highest fas concentration was obtained in sewage sludge collected from the dephosphatation fa2 chamber 203 60 g m3 then from the denitrification chamber 181 59 g m3 and the nitrification chamber 143 89 g m3 and the lowest concentration was from the predenitrification chamber 132 68 g m3 concentrations of fas extracted from sewage were much lower and the highest of them was obtained for fas extracted from the dephosphatation chamber 5 92 g m3 as in the case of sewage sludge the considerable content of fas may also stem from the decomposition of suspended solid pollutants introduced to the discussed chamber in the process of mechanical sewage treatment in the methodology adopted in this paper sewage after mechanical treatment like the others wastewater collected from each chamber of a biological reactor was subject to clarification and filtration in order to remove the suspended solids it should be assumed that the suspended solids which were sedimented and separated with great efforts for the purpose of the tests in actual biological reactor at the sewage treatment plant was together with mechanically treated sewage introduced to the dephosphatation chamber dpc the suspended solids fraction consisted of to a large extent organic substances with absorbed fas as a result of the biochemical processes taking place in a given chamber fas were released to sewage and even the process of humification of organic pollutants might have occured part of the suspended solids fraction was absorbed on the activated sewage sludge thus increasing the concentration of fas in it the concentration of fas collected in dpc amounted to 5 92 g m3 in each subsequent sewage treatment stage the concentration of fas was lower in the denitrification chamber it amounted to 2 87 g m3 and in the nitrification chamber it was 2 79 g m3 the lowest concentration of fas was determined for sewage collected in the predenitrification chamber 1 93 g m3 and biologically treated sewage 2 78 g m3 23 the basic composition of the extracted fas was determined per conversion to ashless mass table 1 in the tested fa0 table 1 from mechanically treated sewage the content of carbon was higher 55 51 than in fa5 which was isolated from biologically treated sewage 46 02 fa2 extracted from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber contained 49 87 carbon the carbon content in fas obtained from activated sewage sludge was similar for all samples just like in the case of fas extracted from mechanically treated sewage containing more carbon which points to higher humification than in the case of fas extracted from sewage there was an interrelation visible that with every subsequent degree of sewage treatment the content of c was gradually lower and thus the humification degree was also lower although the difference were small the discussed fas were characterised by similar c content the lowest oxygen content in fas extracted from sewage was evident for fa0 isolated from mechanically treated sewage 36 86 and the highest for fa5 from biologically treated sewage 47 28 the oxygen content in fas extracted from sewage from predenitrification dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers may stem from processes taking place in chamber of the biological reactor the oxygen content in fa1 in the predenitrification chamber with anaerobic conditions amounted to 43 65 moreover in the dephosphatation chamber anaerobic processes taking place and for fas extracted from this chamber fa2 contained 43 62 oxygen which is slightly less than in fas from the previous chamber on the other hand the content of o in fas extracted from the denitrification chamber in which there are the so called hypoxic condition was higher than in the anaerobic chamber predenitrification chamber pdnc and denitrification chamber dnc and amounted to 44 95 the hypoxic conditions provide for the o contained in nitrates to be used by bacteria and the nitrogen is transformed into a gaseous form the content of o in fas extracted from sewage from fa4 nitrification chamber with aerobic conditions was the highest and amounted to 45 33 on the basis of the obtained test results a conclusion may be drawn that under aerobic conditions fas were characterised by higher ocontent the high content of the discussed element in the fas structure from chambers of the biological reactor may indicate the presence of aliphatic groups the higher oxygen content is connected with the higher content of aliphatic groups and thus with the lower humification degree this interrelation is confirmed by the results of the above tests the content of o in fas increased from 36 86 fa0 to 47 28 fa5 the highest oxygen content among fas extracted from sewage sludge was recorded for the discussed organic substances collected from the nitrification chamber fas extracted from sewage sludge compared to fas extracted from sewage featured a lower content of o which indicates the lower content of aliphatic groups in the discussed fas the content of o in fas increased from 30 88 sewage sludge from thepredenitrification chamber to 34 74 sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber the content of o in fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge in the sewage treatment plant may be presented in the following series f a 1 f a 2 f a 3 f a 4 f a 0 f a 2 f a 1 f a 3 f a 4 f a 5 through analysis of the above interrelation one may notice that the humification degree of the fas in sewage sludge is higher than that of fas in sewage in fas extracted from fa1 mechanically treated sewage the amount of hydrogen decreased from 5 55 fa0 to 5 13 fa5 the most hydrogen was contained by fas extracted from sewage from the denitrification chamber fa4 6 49 and the least was from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber fa2 4 85 but this requires additional tests to confirm in fas extracted from sewage sludge the hydrogen content decreased from 6 65 fa1 to 6 00 fa3 fas extracted from sewage sludge from dephosphatation chamber fa2 contained 6 61 of h and the lowest content of the discussed element was featured by fas extracted from sewage from denitrification chamber fa3 6 00 the content of h in all samples was very similar the nitrogen content in fas extracted from mechanically treated sewage fa0 equalled 2 08 comparing this with data found in the literature for this subject 10 fas extracted from sewage contained less n thus a conclusion may be drawn that they also contained less amino acids in their structure as a result of biological sewage treatment over the course of denitrification and nitrification processes nitrogen compounds are removed the nitrogen content in fas following the denitrification process fa3 equalled to 1 67 and the following the nitrification fa4 decreased to 1 4 the nitrogen content in fas extracted from sewage sludge from the predenitrification chamber fa1 was higher and amounted to 7 36 the high nitrogen content evidences large amounts of amino acids in the structure of fas the nitrogen content in fas extracted from sewage sludge following the dephosphatation process fa2 was also high and amounted to 7 33 following the denitrification process fa3 to 7 16 and following the nitrification process fa4 the nitrogen content dropped in fas to 7 12 the percentage content of nitrogen in fas is an important factor which is considered for determination of suitability of an organic material for agricultural purposes in this case fas extracted from sewage sludge in sewage treatment plant the content of n in fas extracted from sewage in sewage treatment plant may be presented with the following series f a 1 f a 2 f a 3 f a 4 f a 0 f a 1 f a 3 f a 2 f a 5 f a 4 fas may be carriers of micro pollutions and on the basis of test results one may determine that in the outcome of the sewage treatment processes fas may absorb some amounts of nitrogen fas extracted from sewage contain less amount of nitrogen than those from sewage sludge the higher value of c o atomic quotient and the lower value of o h indicates the higher degree of the humification process in fas extracted from sewage sludge for fas extracted from sewage the c o atomic quotient dropped from 2 01 fa0 to 1 30 fa5 the higher atomic quotient in fas extracted from sewage at the beginning of technological line is connected with the larger amount of functional groups containing oxygen carboxyl alcohol phenol groups etc and it indicates the lower humification degree which stems from the fact that as a result of humification a more extensive loss of oxygen or hydrogen takes place in a particle when analysing the entire treatment process it may be observed that fas following the biological treatment which is at the outflow of sewage treatment plant are characterised by less hydrophobicity on the basis of the above data it may be observed that fas at the outflow from the sewage treatment plant are characterised by higher content of carbohydrates than at the inflow to the sewage treatment plant for fas extracted from sewage sludge the c o atomic quotient dropped from 2 38 fa1 to 2 00 fa4 atomic quotients of c o in fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge in sewage treatment plant may be presented with the following series f a 1 f a 2 f a 3 f a 0 f a 4 f a 2 f a 1 f a 4 f a 3 f a 5 on the other hand the value of the atomic quotient of o h increased from 0 42 fa1 to 0 58 for fas extracted from biologically treated sewage fa5 which also confirms the lower level of humification process execution in sewage during the process of sewage treatment the atomic quotient of o h for fas extracted from sewage sludge was at a similar level fas extracted from sewage sludge were characterised by a higher level of humification in comparison to fas from sewage coming from the selected sewage treatment plant the highest c h atomic quotient and at the same time the highest degree of aromatisation and condensation was featured by fas extracted from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber fa2 0 86 and mechanically treated sewage fa0 0 83 and the lowest was for fas obtained from sewage collected from the denitrification chamber fa3 0 60 the c h atomic quotient for fas extracted from biologically treated sewage fa5 equalled 0 75 and was lower than for fas extracted from mechanically treated sewage fa0 on the basis of the above results a conclusion may be drawn that fas at the outflow from the selected sewage treatment plant fa5 were less aromatised and condensed then the sewage at the inflow to the sewage treatment plant fa0 the highest c h atomic quotient and at the same time the highest degree of aromatisation and condensation of fas isolated from sewage sludge were featured by fas extracted from the denitrification chamber fa4 0 76 and from sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber fa4 0 71 and the lowest was featured for dephosphatation chamber fa2 and the predenitrification chamber fa1 0 69 the value of c h atomic quotient for fas increased with each subsequent degree of sewage treatment the exception was the nitrification chamber nc but the difference was small the value of c n atomic quotient for fas increased for biologically treated sewage fa5 and equalled 34 2 which stems from the fact that in biologically treated sewage and as a consequence in fas the content of n was low which is a natural result of sewage treatment processes within which the content of n is decreased the highest of the discussed quotients for fas extracted from sewage sludge was featured by fas from the denitrification chamber fa3 8 92 following by the predenitrification chamber fa1 and the dephosphatation chamber fa2 8 74 the lowest c n atomic quotient was featured by fas extracted from sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber fa4 8 53 but the differences were small it is worth noticing that atomic quotients were at similar levels which may evidence the fact that fas from the tested samples are characterised by similar biological conditions according to van krevelen fig 3 the values of h c amounting to approx 0 3 are characteristic for compounds with highly condensed aromatic rings the values of approx 0 7 characterise monocyclic aromatic carbohydrates and the values in the range of 0 7 1 5 are consistent with aromatic sets fixated with aliphatic chains consisting in up to 10 atoms of carbon the values in the range of 1 5 1 7 are consistent with alicyclic carbohydrates finally values of approx 2 are characteristics for paraffins the value of h c quotient for fas extracted from sewage amounted to 1 17 1 66 which means that the samples fa0 fa1 fa2 fa3 fa5 are consistent with aromatic sets fixated with aliphatic chains consisting in up to 10 atoms of carbon and fa4 is consistent with alicyclic carbohydrates the variability in h c ratio values spurs the arrangement of the extracted fas in series with reference to the share of aliphatic structures and the condensation degree the highest share of aliphatic structures in the tested fas is featured by fas extracted from the denitrification and nitrification chambers and the lowest for fas extracted from the dephosphatation chamber the value of h c quotient for fas extracted from sewage sludge amounted to 1 32 1 45 this means that all samples are consistent with aromatic sets fixated with aliphatic chains consisting of up to 10 atoms of carbon 3 1 1 analysis of the content of the selected nonorganic pollutants in fas in table 2 the elemental composition of nonorganic pollutants in fas extracted from the selected types of sewage and activated sewage sludge is presented in the tested fas table 2 extracted from sewage 8 elements cl si ca k mg p br al were detected and in fas extracted from sewage sludge 10 elements cl si ca k mg p br al b sr were detected the analysis of elemental composition indicated that the dry remains obtained in the process of fa samples roasting at a temperature of 550 c contained considerable amounts of chlorine and silicon the rest of the elements were trace elements as an outcome of biochemical processes the decomposition of various substances different elements may be released which are absorbed on fas many of the above elements may influence the qualityof fas especially those which occurred in higher concentrations differences in content of trace elements may stem from the fact that samples were collected on different days thus the composition may have differed it should be taken into consideration that hss including fas feature the ability to generate complexes with trace elements and this is a subject of numerous scientific studies for fas extracted from sewage sludge the content of heavy metals was tested table 3 the presence of 7 heavy metals table 3 in fas extracted from sewage sludge was detected cu cr zn ni pb ba and fe it is worth noting that all heavy metals ions may generate complexes with organic substances resistant to decomposition 3 1 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir according to the figure figs 4 and 5 a clearly indicated band appeared with wavenumber 2950 cm 1 which may indicate the occurrence of asymmetric and symmetric c h extensions of ch2 group the absorption band for the discussed wavenumber occurs with the majority of samples its highest intensity was confirmed for samples fa2 fa4 fa2 fa3 fa4 in the remaining fas samples fa1 and fa1 differences between the analysed ranges were less visible the next clearly indicated signals were found in the range of 1600 1800 cm 1 which is connected with the presence of co carbonylic groups in peptides aldehydes and ketones cc fixations in aromatic rings including lignin structures and cn amide groups and others containing nitrogen 24 the most characteristic absorption zones in the analysed range are for wavenumbers 1750 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 the presence of the first one points to the occurrence of co fixations in carboxyl groups and co extending fixation of carbonylic groups in ketones and quinones absorbance in the range of 1650 cm 1 indicates on the other hand that there are cc fixations in aromatic bonds and co fixations present in quinones confirming the high maturity of the isolated fas 25 28 the highest intensity in this section of infrared spectrum was confirmed for fas extracted from sewage from the nitrification chamber and biologically treated sewage interrelation of the discussed absorption zones depends on the course of the humification process in all analysed fas extracted from sewage an absorbency band of 1000 1150 cm 1 was highlighted which may originate in och3 coh and coc groups as well as various organic compounds carboxyl acids alcohols cyclic ethers or it may be connected with mineral fraction mainly sio2 29 the highest intensity for the discussed band was determined for fas extracted from sewage from dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers as well as sewage sludge from dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers peak values occurring below 1000 cm 1 i e 950 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from the denitrification chamber 850 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from the dephosphatation chamber 820 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from predenitrification denitrification and nitrification chambers 620 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage from dephosphatation and nitrification chambers and sewage sludge from dephosphatation and denitrification chambers 600 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from the dephosphatation chamber 580 cm 1 fas extracted from sewage sludge from the nitrification chamber confirm the presence of bending oscillations of aromatic compounds of c h alkenes in the tested fas and show deformation of nh2 plane 25 28 according to authors 30 31 the assumed heterogeneous nature of the researched substances results in quite wide observable peak values which was indicated through the analysis of the extracted fas the infrared spectroscopy for fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge from the biological reactor from predenitrification dephosphatation denitrification and nitrification chambers of sewage treatment plant indicated high similarity of the isolated fas which indicates little differentiation in their chemical structure see figs 4 and 5 4 quantitative balance of fas on the basis of our research and the data obtained from the discussed sewage treatment plant a quantitative balance of inflowing and outflowing fas from the sewage treatment plant in sewage with consideration of fas discharged with excessive sewage sludge was executed 4 1 load of fas extracted from sewage and sewage sludge the following assumptions were made 24 h mean flow fd 165 000 m3 d 24 h mean outflow of treated sewage oo 161 143 m3 d oo fd fess excessive sewage

load of fas at inflow to the biological reactor amounts to the following l d f a s f d c i 165 000 m 3 d 0 00513 k g m 3 846 45 k g d the 24 h load of fas discharged from the sewage treatment plant

f k g s m 215 99 k g d the 24 h load of fas discharged with the treated sewage was almost twice as small as the introduced one as follows l d f a s l 0 f a s δ l f a s 846 45 447 98 398 47 k g d if the load of the fas discharged with the excessive sludge is taken into consideration the result is the following δ l f a s 846 45 44 98 215 99 182 48 k g d the mean 24 h outflow from the selected sewage treatment plant amounts to 161 143 m3 d and considering that the concentration of fas at the outflow from the sewage treatment plant amounts to 2 78 g m3 the daily dump of fas amounts to approx 447 98 kg day the concentration of fas extracted from the biologically treated sewage was in the range in which hs are present in natural waters with average of 1 9 mg l 32 the total 24 h load of fas fig 6 introduced into the selected sewage treatment plant 846 45 kg day was larger than the discharged load the portion of fas went through to the activated sewage sludge as the analysis of the discussed organic substances indicates that their total load in sewage and sewage sludge at the outflow from the biological reactor amounted to 663 97 kg day and it was lower than the load at the beginning of the technological line by 182 48 kg day 846 45 447 98 215 99 182 48 kg day the decrease in load of the discharged fas may stem from the fact that fas together with the recirculated sewage sludge are transferred to the pdnc the amounts due to the closed loop circulation are not taken into consideration in the balance the difference may also stem from a measurement error of the fas concentration in the sewage sludge and treated sewage as well as from the fas humification process resulting in insoluble form of has which was not extracted for the purpose of this research results of such an analysis would provide explanation to transformation processes that take place and would determine if the decrease in the load is an outcome of humidification of fas or has or whether they are subject to biodegradation as it is well known sewage sludge is the main side product of wastewater treatment plants and consists of mainly water organic substances including fas and nonorganic minerals this research has provided information on the characteristics and properties of extracted fas which can be a potential source of humic fertilisers for improving soils it should be remembered though that they may contain pathogenic microorganisms heavy metals and phytotoxic organic compounds therefore for the purpose of using them as fertilisers they must be properly neutralize 33 research has shown that fas isolated from activated sewage sludge have larger concentrations than those extracted from wastewater according to 33 hss may have different effects on the fermentation process and volatile fatty acid production research has shown that fas are present in higher concentrations in activated sludge the composition and properties of which may limit its biodegradability and hamper volatile fatty acid production 33 in the face of a serious problem which is the shortage of drinking water and the possibility of solving this problem using modern technologies transforming wastewater into drinking water it is important to constantly expand knowledge of the composition of wastewater and its impact on human health and life as previously mentioned in municipal wastewater treatment plants hss are discharged with treated sewage to surface waters it is important to determine the amount and place of occurrence of fas which was the main objective of this work the impact of hss on the use of treated municipal sewage as a source of industrially process ed water is still unclear according to the obtained results fas contained in wastewater have a typical concentration of fas that naturally occur in surface waters however it should be taken into account that they may be precursors of by products of oxidation and disinfection processes generated in water treatment plants the discussed substances are soluble in the entire ph range therefore they can easily pass from the sewage treatment plant to surface waters which are collected for drinking purposes this is an important issue for the environment and human health 5 conclusions on the basis of the obtained test results a conclusion may be drawn that under aerobic conditions fas 514 feature larger amounts of o in their structure and thus a lower humification degree the results of this 515 study demonstrated that at the outflow of the sewage treatment plant fas were characterised by lesser 516 hydrophobicity and a higher content of carbohydrates fas are good carriers of micro pollutants which 517 was confirmed during this research the difference occurred between the amount of fas introduced into 518 the selected sewage treatment plant and the amount discharged from the sewage treatment plant 519 confirming the view held by many scientists that fas are resistant to biodegradation at the same time 520 it may be assumed that there are some microorganisms e g ammonia oxidizing bacteria and or 521 archaea which are present in the sewage sludge that break down fas but this requires additional but 522

8773,in this study copper present in industrial waste water with a variety of other impurities fe mg al zn as was subjected for selective electrochemical recovery the recovery was conducted directly on carbon nanostructures in order to create added value products synergistically in depth electrochemical and structural analysis showed that single multi walled carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene composites could provide an excellent substrate for cu s electrochemical recovery furthermore formulations based on them also enabled the formation of even cu deposits on the surface directly from wastewater solutions without further bath condition adjustments after just 1 h electrodeposition at 0 1v vs sce a nanocomposite based on cnts was obtained cu was recovered exclusively and accounted for 45 of the total weight of the composite graphical abstract image 1 keywords copper recovery electrodeposition circular economy waste management 1 introduction the hydrometallurgical industry plays a notable role in producing large quantities of metal containing process and waste solutions in particular acidic industrial wastewaters may contain valuable metals such as copper as well as less valuable elements such as iron aluminum magnesium cu solutions are toxic for plants inhibit photosynthesis plant growth and reproductive process 1 and aquatic organisms cause deformities diseases or death 2 the recommended safe content of cu in water for aquatic life is as low as 2 4 ppb whereas the acceptable upper level of cu for humans is 10 mg l consequently any means to reduce the concentration of cu or other elements in the environment are welcome since they are a growing concern 3 8 simultaneously there is an evident increase in demand for copper in our everyday applications increasing the need for hydrometallurgical copper operations substantially therefore efficient removal and re use of copper is attractive not only from an environmental but also from an economic point of view earlier numerous treatment techniques have been applied to obtain valuable materials from waste water typically however metals are recovered not as a product but as waste residues out of the various waste water treatment methods available chemical precipitation is the most commonly utilized industry process due to its simplicity and low cost however precipitation by forming insoluble hydroxides or sulfides is not selective and requires the use of reagents such as lime calcium oxide and hydrogen sulfide 9 following precipitation the solids are then separated from the sludge by coagulation and or sedimentation or filtration the solids are then discarded as reprocessing into new raw material is not economical adsorption is another possible method for heavy metal removal and a plethora of different adsorbents have been studied including active carbon 10 geopolymers 11 and clay 12 while these methods can remove heavy metals from solutions the removal needs to be followed by further process steps before reuse of the metals is possible if at all on the other hand electrodeposition is a method that can deposit metals selectively onto conducting materials even from solutions of low metal concentration 13 high standard electrode potential e0 0 34 v vs she of copper provides a unique feature among typical waste water impurities for electrochemical recovery as it can enable high selectivity even from multimetallic solutions this can also allow direct recovery of cu on nanomaterials avoiding the use of high quality synthetic chemicals and deposition baths typically used to make such nanocomposites direct and selective recovery leading to value added products may also pave the way for new business models related to waste water treatment one of the most outstanding nanomaterials are those made of carbon 8 14 18 they provide remarkably tunable thermal conductivity 0 028 6600 w m k 19 leading strength young s modulus 270 950 gpa 20 and adjustable surface chemistry 21 22 nowadays carbon nanotube cnt networks attain electrical conductivity up to 5000 s cm for pristine and 20 000 s cm for doped material 23 to enhance nanocarbon s electrical properties one can combine them with other conductive materials 24 cu cnt composite revealed two orders of magnitude higher current carrying capacity 25 compared to cu standard besides the thermal and mechanical properties of cu cnt are often encouraging 26 29 thus because of high thermal and electrical conductivity and the relatively good chemical stability of cu it is an attractive admixture for producing high performance composites with cnts or graphene 26 there is a vast spectrum of possible applications for such materials which spans from supercapacitors 30 31 biosensors 32 to electrical conductors 33 the low weight of composites combined with high strength and notable electrical conductivity make them particularly promising for application in overhead transmission lines 33 or automotive and aerospace industries 26 there are many ways to produce cu cnt materials depending on the process character they can be separated into powder processing electrochemical deposition and electroless deposition in powder metallurgy methods powders of nanocarbon and cu are often mixed using ball attrition milling 34 38 sonication 29 39 40 isostatic pressing 41 42 stirring 43 or vortex mixing 44 and then they are compacted in this case the process is straightforward and scalable providing a large amount of composite 33 45 an alternative is to coat one material with the other by e g electroplating 46 which is a well known electrochemical method to make cu cnt materials 13 47 49 in this work we made a direct cu recovery from waste water on thin free standing films based on cnts for the first time based on a detailed analysis of the electrochemical parameters and the microstructure of the obtained materials the critical parameters to make the electrochemical recovery of cu from waste water on cnts quick and homogeneous were established the proposed method s universal character makes it relevant for a broad spectrum of carbon materials 50 52 and other conductive substrates 2 experimental

manufacturer the graphene material is a few nm thick in the manuscript these materials are referred to as swcnts nc mwcnts and g respectively the materials were used without any post processing except for swcnts they were ground for 5 min due to our earlier observation that the process increases the electrical conductivity of the films formed from them by causing appropriate deagglomeration 55 the influence of oxidation was studied using mwcnts made in house the methodology is given in the si the product is referred to as o mwcnts thin films made of nanocarbon materials were manufactured using a previously reported method 56 the film preparation routine is described in the si a photograph of a flexible free standing nanocarbon film used in the study which can be manipulated easily fig s1 2 3 electrochemical recovery of cu for each electrochemical experiment a free standing nanocarbon film was cut into a rectangular shape of 10 mm width x 25 mm length a three electrode cell with electrodes facing each other was used for all the electrochemical experiments the film sample was used as the working electrode whereas a platinum sheet with an order of magnitude larger area served as the counter electrode the distance between the nanocarbon film and the platinum electrode was 5 cm the film sample was immersed ca 1 5 cm into the solution and the current density values were calculated after the experiment using the observed submerged geometrical area a standard calomel electrode sce placed next to the nanocarbon film surface was used as the reference electrode the electrodes were connected to an iviumstat 24 bit compactstat potentiostat ivium technologies netherlands as shown below fig 1 for cathodic polarization experiments the potential of the cathode stabilized during 60 s and the equilibrated open circuit potential of the films was set as e 0 v vs sce the potential e was then changed from 0 v to 1 v with a sweep rate of 20 mv s galvanostatic deposition i e chronoamperometry was used to deposit cu onto the nanocarbon films to observe differences in nanocarbon films surface activity a small amount of cu was deposited as separate nuclei on the cnt films by a galvanostatic deposition pulse the deposition was made at 0 v vs sce for 1 s the tests were carried out on all the nanocarbon films with and without the binder to validate the application potential longer plating experiments were also conducted for the recovery of cu from wastewater we used the following parameters deposition voltage of 0 1 v vs sce for 3600 s for these experiments 6 nanocarbon films were selected swcnts nc mwcnts mwcnts 25 o mwcnts 25 n mwcnts and 25 graphene all electrochemical processes were conducted at room temperature 2 4 characterization scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 7500fa was used to analyze the microstructure of the studied nanocarbon films the samples were investigated at 15 kv acceleration voltage at the magnification of 16 000 for powder samples and 2200 for nanocarbon cu composites raman spectroscopy renishaw germany was used to determine the quality of the parent nanocarbon materials and thin films made from

and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanocarbon substrates for cu recovery characterization of the microstructure fig s2 and purity of the parent carbon nanostructures fig s3 provided in the si revealed that these materials have diverse morphology and degree of structural perfection while the swcnts exhibited an extremely low amount of defects the other materials showed a varying content of impurities and functional groups these differences should make the materials more or less appropriate for cu recovery thin films were made from such raw materials and their properties were analyzed before and after the removal of ec binder to find the critical factors making such waste treatment process successful fig 2 demonstrates the results of raman spectroscopy which gauges the level of crystallinity in nanocarbon materials for the neat cnt materials swcnts nc mwcnts mwcnts id ig ratios indicative of the perfectness of the material the lower the purer decreased slightly after annealing during this process amorphous carbon ec and other forms of carbon were removed which caused a decrease in intensity of defect induced d peak however when o doped mwcnt materials were briefly exposed to the influence of high temperature the id ig ratios were considerably reduced the effect was more pronounced at a high content of o mwcnts 50 id ig 0 032 0 001 id ig 0 017 0 001 as compared with a low concentration of o mwcnts 10 id ig 0 018 0 001 id ig 0 010 0 001 in the composite with swcnts the decrease of id ig at high content of o mwcnts could be explained by the detachment of the most severely oxidized species during annealing which would overall improve the average degree of structural perfection of the material after annealing 57 regarding the n doped samples the id ig ratios remained at a comparable level before and after annealing 10 id ig 0 017 0 003 id ig 0 013 0 003 25 id ig 0 014 0 002 id ig 0 013 0 003 50 id ig 0 015 0 001 id ig 0 013 0 001 lastly in the case of doping of swcnts with graphene taking into account the uncertainty values the id ig ratios were not affected by the thermal processing analysis of the whole dataset revealed that every time high quality swcnts were used to form composites with other nanocarbon types the signals from swcnt dominated the spectra despite that swcnts are combined with materials of relatively high id ig ratios e g 0 434 0 518 and 0 620 for o mwcnts n mwcnts and graphene respectively the resulting id ig ratio was low it did not exceed 0 02 in virtually all cases even when up to 1 1 w w of functionalized nanocarbon was added to the swcnt matrix resonant raman scattering excites only a subset of the cnt population which may lead to a bias in interpreting results 58 in this study it appears that the intensity of signal coming from swcnts dominated that of the mwcnts because more of the swcnts were in tune with the selected laser wavelength one of the critical parameters for the successful cu recovery is the substrate s appropriate surface chemistry which ensures compatibility with the aqueous plating solution the lower the value of the water contact angle γ the higher the likelihood that the nanocarbon film which is often inherently hydrophobic will be successfully plated with cu 59 60 hence we decided to study this factor fig 3 the films from parent nanocarbon materials containing the binder had a relatively hydrophobic surface γ 90 however after its removal by annealing we observed a radical decrease in wca for these samples swcnts γwith binder 113 6 5 6 γwithout binder 39 3 6 6 fig s4 nc mwcnts γwith binder 111 6 4 8 γwithout binder 7 9 1 7 and mwcnts γwith binder 95 42 8 2 γwithout binder 9 0 2 4 this phenomenon was observed in our previous works it was possibly caused by the thermal desorption of impurities from the ambient which apparently cloaked the cnt surface s hydrophilic nature 53 61 furthermore the composite materials based on the swcnt matrix containing n mwcnts o mwcnts and graphene had less hydrophobic character ca γ 70 80 these filler materials are characterized by a relatively high level of disorder which made them more hydrophilic after annealing all these materials reached the wca of up to ca 20 the recorded values were roughly halfway between that of the swcnt matrix and the mwcnts fillers from which these composite materials were formed the elevated value of wca for swcnts was likely related to the fact that the films made from them had a different roughness than those produced from nc mwcnts or mwcnts 62 63 nanocarbon films electrical conductivity directly affects their electrochemical activity which is one of the prerequisites for successful cu recovery and thus it requires investigation fig 4 our previously published results 54 55 64 indicate that the material pre processing and presence of binder doping agents are significant factors to consider in this work the highest electrical conductivity was recorded for high quality swcnt films 1064 0 69 0 s cm conversely the electrical conductivity of mwcnt samples composed of technical grade nc mwcnts or in house made mwcnts was low 36 8 0 5 s cm and 123 9 18 3 s cm respectively this was due to the abundance of defects and inherently worse electrical conductivity of mwcnts than swcnts 65 when swcnts were used to form composite materials with o mwcnts n mwcnts or graphene these hybrids had on average 6 times lower electrical conductivity by 5 4 7 4 and 6 2 times respectively than neat swcnts deterioration of electrical conductivity can be explained by a significant content of defects in the admixed nanocarbon types as detected by raman spectroscopy due to the increased abundance of imperfections charge scattering is more pronounced which elevates the resistance unfortunately the electrical conductivity of films made exclusively from o mwcnts n mwcnts or graphene could not be determined because the films produced from them had poor mechanical integrity furthermore we examined the impact of binder removal on the electrical conductivity of the nanocarbon ensembles the annealing of the material did not seem to affect the electrical conductivity of swcnts nc mwcnts or mwcnts which stayed in accordance with raman s characterization showing no change to the structure of the material during thermal treatment 55 64 however after annealing the value of electrical conductivity for all the composites of swcnts with o mwcnts n mwcnts and graphene almost doubled e g 50 o mwcnts σwith binder 82 7 15 3 s cm σwithout binder 166 8 23 3 s cm or 25 n mwcnts σwith binder 99 3 3 3 s cm σwithout binder 148 7 8 5 s cm we believe that the surface chemistry of cnts became much more compatible with the ec structure after implanting o and n functionalities into these nanocarbon materials likely oxygen rich ec binder interacted very well with modified cnts o mwcnts and n mwcnts this in turn led to the encapsulation of o mwcnts and n mwcnts by a dielectric ec binder which impeded the electrical conductivity of the material therefore when the ec was removed by annealing the electrical conductivity increased due to the formation of new percolation pathways the same mechanism can explain the increase of electrical conductivity swcnts graphene composites upon annealing due to the abundance of graphene base material defects as determined by raman spectroscopy to sum up the electrical conductivities of all binder free nanocarbon composites of swcnts with functionalized mwcnts or graphene showed similar values of about 150 200 s cm what regards the base materials after annealing the notable exceptions were the highly conductive swcnt films conductivity of 1064 0 69 0 s cm and poorly conductive nc mwcnts conductivity of 36 8 0 5 s cm which was mainly caused by the remarkably high and low quality of the material respectively as mentioned in text before 3 2 electrochemical recovery of cu onto nanocarbon films 3 2 1 cathodic polarization experiments cathodic polarization curves were recorded for all samples in synthetic cu waste water fig 5 the results showed typical characteristics of cu recovery by electrodeposition from a high concentration solution with some notable differences in deposition kinetics between various samples two distinctive sets of behaviors were observed in all curves i slow recovery kinetics for all samples containing binder and samples consisting purely of unfunctionalized mwcnts and ii fast recovery kinetics for all binder free samples including neat swcnts and their composites with functionalized mwcnts the samples showing slow deposition kinetics i demonstrated a slow change in cu deposition current with the function of overvoltage these samples showed a cathodic deposition slope ranging from 0 06 to 0 16 ma mv the films produced from commercial mwcnts nc mwcnt exhibited the slowest deposition kinetics with or without binder which was attributed to the significantly lower electrical conductivity compared with other samples the binder presence clearly decreased cu s recovery rate due to its insulating properties leading to physical blocking of the underlying nanocarbon network furthermore as the binder containing samples were more hydrophobic it was deduced that the binder s presence made the penetration of the electrolyte into the film more difficult thus leading to less surface area exposed for deposition as shown previously 66 conversely the high polarization samples ii showed a considerably steeper cathodic slope which meant that the material polarized more easily for the deposition of cu the cathodic deposition slope was in the range of 0 18 0 45 ma mv the observed faster kinetics could not be ascribed to increases in electrical conductivity but only to the removal of binder lastly no obvious correlation between the cathodic deposition slope table 3 and electrical conductivity could be made fig 4 3 2 2 pulsed electrochemical recovery of cu to further test the performance of various nanocarbon film materials the pulsed recovery i e pulse electrodeposition of cu particles was studied from the synthetic electrolyte for this experiment the samples were electrodeposited with a single deposition pulse of 1 s at 0 0 v vs sce the purpose of using such low overvoltage for cu deposition was to examine the differences between samples with different compositions and functionalities and the effect of the binder on the very first nuclei forming in the beginning stages of cu deposition we first examined the parent materials fig 6 a the results showed that the pulse electrodeposition process was most facile on neat swcnts round cu clusters of about 2 μm in diameter were distributed evenly near the surface of the film it was noted that when the swcnts contained the binder fig 6b the cu deposition was also pronounced but the size shape and distribution of the particles were less uniform therefore the removal of the binder was found to be beneficial for the deposition of homogeneously distributed cu nuclei confirming the results from the cathodic polarization experiments on the other hand when mwcnts were employed only scarce cu clusters could be observed on the surface fig 6c and d the reason why cu s electrodeposition was inferior on these types of films could be ascribed to the low values of electrical conductivity and poor crystallinity high id ig ratio as shown in fig 2 nc mwcnts and mwcnts had an order of magnitude lower electrical conductivity than swcnts and were characterized by an abundance of defects consequently the electrodes made from them were more challenging to polarize as shown in fig 5 leading to reduced cu deposition kinetics hence only a negligible amount of cu on the surface was observed after the deposition moreover since cu deposition is favored on the defects which are abundant in these materials cu s inhomogeneous distribution was noted in the next step we wanted to find out how the incorporation of functionalized mwcnts into the swcnt matrix would affect the ability of the material to be deposited with cu fig 7 previously it has been shown that incorporating oxygen containing functionalities on the surface of cnt films improved the electrochemical response for metal electrodeposition due to higher reactivity of oxygen containing functional groups 66 giving rise to a more homogeneous distribution of smaller metal nuclei in this work the same general trend was observed to a certain degree increasing the amount of functionalized mwcnts while reducing the amount of swcnts led to smaller cu nuclei up to 25 o mwcnts at 10 25 of o mwcnts fig 7a and b only smaller cu deposits at a maximum of a few microns in diameter were detected which were distributed evenly across the sample surface however higher amounts of o mwcnts fig 7c resulted in sparsely situated ca 10 μm cu nuclei similar to the pure mwcnt material the results were in line with the polarization experiments which showed that the slope of the deposition was similar for samples consisting of only swcnts and for samples containing 10 and 25 o mwcnts conversely at 50 o mwcnts the cathodic slope showed a clear decrease which was likely related to the high amount of less conductive mwcnts that negatively affected the polarization s ability therefore only small additions of functionalized cnts were beneficial for the deposition of evenly distributed small cu nuclei compared with pure swcnt material these results prove that instead of oxidation of the bulk swcnt material a more facile strategy can be employed a certain amount of oxidized cnts can be simply admixed to the swcnt matrix to promote the process considering the composite films made of n mwcnt and graphene fillers their addition on the level of 25 in the swcnt matrix did not promote homogeneous cu deposition fig 8 for both types of these composite films the deposition was sparse and the size and distribution of the particles varied considerably no pattern of cu nuclei size could be discerned 3 2 3 cu recovery from industrial waste water authentic industrial waste water was employed to test the nanocarbon composite films applicability for the direct cu recovery from wastewater different types of films were selected for 1 h electrodeposition at 0 1v vs sce such electrodeposition potential was chosen as it was not low enough to deposit the less noble elements from the solution these conditions allowed only cu and more noble elements to be reduced selectively on the film surface the concentration of cu 428 ppm in wastewater was 100x lower than that of the synthetic cu electrolyte it contained a plethora of other metals such as fe al and mg in sulfate rich media table 2 sem micrographs in fig 9 show the morphology of the cu particles deposited on various types of nanocarbon films from this feed the sizes of cu deposits on films were swcnts 1 5 0 3 μm mwcnts 4 3 0 5 μm and 25 graphene 1 1 0 3 μm for the remaining materials the size distribution was too inhomogeneous to determine this value with any certainty generally the cu deposits size followed the same trend as noted previously with the mwcnt film showing larger particles no deposits could be discerned on the nc mwcnt film likely due to its low conductivity not being able to support deposition at such overvoltage however the even size and distribution of the cu deposits on swcnt films appeared encouraging therefore we subjected it to further analysis edx mapping and spectral analysis of the deposited particles fig 10 confirmed that they were pure cu 45 wt and no other metallic elements were present oxygen 10 wt was also detected in the areas corresponding to cu which indicated that these species are either partially oxidized or there were some deposits on the surface containing oxygen nevertheless the lack of other elements besides carbon in the spectrum proved that not only the cu deposition was successful from a complex mixture of elements but that the process also exhibited selectivity after application of appropriate conditions taken together these results illustrate that the proposed integration strategy of cu and nanocarbon is selective and can be used to manufacture high quality composites directly from waste solutions 4 conclusions this work examined the recovery of copper directly on various types of films made from nanocarbon materials used as admixed material for electrochemical recovery of cu the materials were extensively characterized to understand the electrodeposition process firstly recovery from synthetic cu electrolyte 40 g l cu was studied using cathodic polarization experiments and pulse electrodeposition to observe differences in electrochemical and cu nucleation behavior furthermore an authentic industrial multi metallic wastewater solution containing 428 ppm cu was utilized as the raw material the obtained results showed a beneficial response when using films with higher electrical conductivity and films containing different functional groups to cover the surface with cu evenly the results validate that direct recovery of copper from industrial waste water on nanocarbon substrates is possible as nanomaterials microstructure can be tuned with ease and to a large extent due to the rich chemistry of carbon it is straightforward to optimize the topography and chemical composition to make nanocarbon integrate well with cu consequently added value composite materials can be produced even when industrial waste water solution is taken as the source of metal nanoparticles this way the problematic waste is not only managed but transformed into products of high added value it is envisioned that the structures produced by this approach can show particular promise for catalytic or electrochemical applications in these scenarios the combination of a highly conductive substrate with the unique properties of size constrained metal nanoparticles paves the way towards reaching high performance on these fronts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

8773,in this study copper present in industrial waste water with a variety of other impurities fe mg al zn as was subjected for selective electrochemical recovery the recovery was conducted directly on carbon nanostructures in order to create added value products synergistically in depth electrochemical and structural analysis showed that single multi walled carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene composites could provide an excellent substrate for cu s electrochemical recovery furthermore formulations based on them also enabled the formation of even cu deposits on the surface directly from wastewater solutions without further bath condition adjustments after just 1 h electrodeposition at 0 1v vs sce a nanocomposite based on cnts was obtained cu was recovered exclusively and accounted for 45 of the total weight of the composite graphical abstract image 1 keywords copper recovery electrodeposition circular economy waste management 1 introduction the hydrometallurgical industry plays a notable role in producing large quantities of metal containing process and waste solutions in particular acidic industrial wastewaters may contain valuable metals such as copper as well as less valuable elements such as iron aluminum magnesium cu solutions are toxic for plants inhibit photosynthesis plant growth and reproductive process 1 and aquatic organisms cause deformities diseases or death 2 the recommended safe content of cu in water for aquatic life is as low as 2 4 ppb whereas the acceptable upper level of cu for humans is 10 mg l consequently any means to reduce the concentration of cu or other elements in the environment are welcome since they are a growing concern 3 8 simultaneously there is an evident increase in demand for copper in our everyday applications increasing the need for hydrometallurgical copper operations substantially therefore efficient removal and re use of copper is attractive not only from an environmental but also from an economic point of view earlier numerous treatment techniques have been applied to obtain valuable materials from waste water typically however metals are recovered not as a product but as waste residues out of the various waste water treatment methods available chemical precipitation is the most commonly utilized industry process due to its simplicity and low cost however precipitation by forming insoluble hydroxides or sulfides is not selective and requires the use of reagents such as lime calcium oxide and hydrogen sulfide 9 following precipitation the solids are then separated from the sludge by coagulation and or sedimentation or filtration the solids are then discarded as reprocessing into new raw material is not economical adsorption is another possible method for heavy metal removal and a plethora of different adsorbents have been studied including active carbon 10 geopolymers 11 and clay 12 while these methods can remove heavy metals from solutions the removal needs to be followed by further process steps before reuse of the metals is possible if at all on the other hand electrodeposition is a method that can deposit metals selectively onto conducting materials even from solutions of low metal concentration 13 high standard electrode potential e0 0 34 v vs she of copper provides a unique feature among typical waste water impurities for electrochemical recovery as it can enable high selectivity even from multimetallic solutions this can also allow direct recovery of cu on nanomaterials avoiding the use of high quality synthetic chemicals and deposition baths typically used to make such nanocomposites direct and selective recovery leading to value added products may also pave the way for new business models related to waste water treatment one of the most outstanding nanomaterials are those made of carbon 8 14 18 they provide remarkably tunable thermal conductivity 0 028 6600 w m k 19 leading strength young s modulus 270 950 gpa 20 and adjustable surface chemistry 21 22 nowadays carbon nanotube cnt networks attain electrical conductivity up to 5000 s cm for pristine and 20 000 s cm for doped material 23 to enhance nanocarbon s electrical properties one can combine them with other conductive materials 24 cu cnt composite revealed two orders of magnitude higher current carrying capacity 25 compared to cu standard besides the thermal and mechanical properties of cu cnt are often encouraging 26 29 thus because of high thermal and electrical conductivity and the relatively good chemical stability of cu it is an attractive admixture for producing high performance composites with cnts or graphene 26 there is a vast spectrum of possible applications for such materials which spans from supercapacitors 30 31 biosensors 32 to electrical conductors 33 the low weight of composites combined with high strength and notable electrical conductivity make them particularly promising for application in overhead transmission lines 33 or automotive and aerospace industries 26 there are many ways to produce cu cnt materials depending on the process character they can be separated into powder processing electrochemical deposition and electroless deposition in powder metallurgy methods powders of nanocarbon and cu are often mixed using ball attrition milling 34 38 sonication 29 39 40 isostatic pressing 41 42 stirring 43 or vortex mixing 44 and then they are compacted in this case the process is straightforward and scalable providing a large amount of composite 33 45 an alternative is to coat one material with the other by e g electroplating 46 which is a well known electrochemical method to make cu cnt materials 13 47 49 in this work we made a direct cu recovery from waste water on thin free standing films based on cnts for the first time based on a detailed analysis of the electrochemical parameters and the microstructure of the obtained materials the critical parameters to make the electrochemical recovery of cu from waste water on cnts quick and homogeneous were established the proposed method s universal character makes it relevant for a broad spectrum of carbon materials 50 52 and other conductive substrates 2 experimental

manufacturer the graphene material is a few nm thick in the manuscript these materials are referred to as swcnts nc mwcnts and g respectively the materials were used without any post processing except for swcnts they were ground for 5 min due to our earlier observation that the process increases the electrical conductivity of the films formed from them by causing appropriate deagglomeration 55 the influence of oxidation was studied using mwcnts made in house the methodology is given in the si the product is referred to as o mwcnts thin films made of nanocarbon materials were manufactured using a previously reported method 56 the film preparation routine is described in the si a photograph of a flexible free standing nanocarbon film used in the study which can be manipulated easily fig s1 2

electrodes facing each other was used for all the electrochemical experiments the film sample was used as the working electrode whereas a platinum sheet with an order of magnitude larger area served as the counter electrode the distance between the nanocarbon film and the platinum electrode was 5 cm the film sample was immersed ca 1 5 cm into the solution and the current density values were calculated after the experiment using the observed submerged geometrical area a standard calomel electrode sce placed next to the nanocarbon film surface was used as the reference electrode the electrodes were connected to an iviumstat 24 bit compactstat potentiostat ivium technologies netherlands as shown below fig 1 for cathodic polarization experiments the potential of the cathode stabilized during 60 s and the equilibrated open circuit potential of the films was set as e 0 v vs sce the potential e was then changed from 0 v to 1 v with a sweep rate of 20 mv s galvanostatic deposition i e chronoamperometry was used to deposit cu onto the nanocarbon films to observe differences in nanocarbon films surface activity a small amount of cu was deposited as separate nuclei on the cnt films by a galvanostatic deposition pulse the deposition was made at 0 v vs sce for 1 s the tests were carried out on all the nanocarbon films with and without the binder to validate the

new percolation pathways the same mechanism can explain the increase of electrical conductivity swcnts graphene composites upon annealing due to the abundance of graphene base material defects as determined by raman spectroscopy to sum up the electrical conductivities of all binder free nanocarbon composites of swcnts with functionalized mwcnts or graphene showed similar values of about 150 200 s cm what regards the base materials after annealing the notable exceptions were the highly conductive swcnt films conductivity of 1064 0 69 0 s cm and poorly conductive nc mwcnts conductivity of 36 8 0 5 s cm which was mainly caused by the remarkably high and low quality of the material respectively as mentioned in text before 3 2 electrochemical recovery of cu onto nanocarbon films 3 2 1 cathodic polarization experiments cathodic polarization curves were recorded for all samples in synthetic cu waste water fig 5 the results showed typical characteristics of cu recovery by electrodeposition from a high concentration solution with some notable differences in deposition kinetics between various samples two distinctive sets of behaviors were observed in all curves i slow recovery kinetics for all samples containing binder and samples consisting purely of unfunctionalized mwcnts and ii fast recovery kinetics for all binder free samples including neat swcnts and their composites with functionalized mwcnts the samples showing slow deposition kinetics i demonstrated a slow change in cu deposition current with the function of overvoltage these samples showed a cathodic deposition slope ranging from 0 06 to 0 16 ma mv the films produced from commercial mwcnts nc mwcnt exhibited the slowest deposition kinetics with or without binder which was attributed to the significantly lower electrical conductivity compared with other samples the binder presence clearly decreased cu s recovery rate due to its insulating properties leading to physical blocking of the underlying nanocarbon network furthermore as the binder containing samples were more hydrophobic it was deduced that the binder s presence made the penetration of the electrolyte into the film more difficult thus leading to less surface area exposed for deposition as shown previously 66 conversely the high polarization samples ii showed a considerably steeper cathodic slope which meant that the material polarized more easily for the deposition of cu the cathodic deposition slope was in the range of 0 18 0 45 ma mv the observed faster kinetics could not be ascribed to increases in electrical conductivity but only to the removal of binder lastly no obvious correlation between the cathodic deposition slope table 3 and electrical conductivity could be made fig 4 3 2 2 pulsed electrochemical recovery of cu to further test the performance of various nanocarbon film materials the pulsed recovery i e pulse electrodeposition of cu particles was studied from the synthetic electrolyte for this experiment the samples were electrodeposited with a single deposition pulse of 1 s at 0 0 v vs sce the purpose of using such low overvoltage for cu deposition was to examine the differences between samples with different compositions and functionalities and the effect of the binder on the very first nuclei forming in the beginning stages of cu deposition we first examined the parent materials fig 6 a the results showed that the pulse electrodeposition process was most facile on neat swcnts round cu clusters of about 2 μm in diameter were distributed evenly near the surface of the film it was noted that when the swcnts contained the binder fig 6b the cu deposition was also pronounced but the size shape and distribution of the particles were less uniform therefore the removal of the binder was found to be beneficial for the deposition of homogeneously distributed cu nuclei confirming the results from the cathodic polarization experiments on the other hand when mwcnts were employed only scarce cu clusters could be observed on the surface fig 6c and d the reason why cu s electrodeposition was inferior on these types of films could be ascribed to the low values of electrical conductivity and poor crystallinity high id ig ratio as shown in fig 2 nc mwcnts and mwcnts had an order of magnitude lower electrical conductivity than swcnts and were characterized by an abundance of defects consequently the electrodes made from them were more challenging to polarize as shown in fig 5 leading to reduced cu deposition kinetics hence only a negligible amount of cu on the surface was observed after the deposition moreover since cu deposition is favored on the defects which are abundant in these materials cu s inhomogeneous distribution was noted in the next step we wanted to find out how the incorporation of functionalized mwcnts into the swcnt matrix would affect the ability of the material to be deposited with cu fig 7 previously it has been shown that incorporating oxygen containing functionalities on the surface of cnt films improved the electrochemical response for metal electrodeposition due to higher reactivity of oxygen containing functional groups 66 giving rise to a more homogeneous distribution of smaller metal nuclei in this work the same general trend was observed to a certain degree increasing the amount of functionalized mwcnts while reducing the amount of swcnts led to smaller cu nuclei up to 25 o mwcnts at 10 25 of o mwcnts fig 7a and b only smaller cu deposits at a maximum of a few microns in diameter were detected which were distributed evenly across the sample surface however higher amounts of o mwcnts fig 7c resulted in sparsely situated ca 10 μm cu nuclei similar to the pure mwcnt material the results were in line with the polarization experiments which showed that the slope of the deposition was similar for samples consisting of only swcnts and for samples containing 10 and 25 o mwcnts conversely at 50 o mwcnts the cathodic slope showed a clear decrease which was likely related to the high amount of less conductive mwcnts that negatively affected the polarization s ability therefore only small additions of functionalized cnts were beneficial for the deposition of evenly distributed small cu nuclei compared with pure swcnt material these results prove that instead of oxidation of the bulk swcnt material a more facile strategy can be employed a certain amount of oxidized cnts can be simply admixed to the swcnt matrix to promote the process considering the composite films made of n mwcnt and graphene fillers their addition on the level of 25 in the swcnt matrix did not promote homogeneous cu deposition fig 8 for both types of these composite films the deposition was sparse and the size and distribution of the particles varied considerably no pattern of cu nuclei size could be discerned 3 2 3 cu recovery from industrial waste water authentic industrial waste water was employed to test the nanocarbon composite films applicability for the direct cu recovery from wastewater different types of films were selected for 1 h electrodeposition at 0 1v vs sce such electrodeposition potential was chosen as it was not low enough to deposit the less noble elements from the solution these conditions allowed only cu and more noble elements to be reduced selectively on the film surface the concentration of cu 428 ppm in wastewater was 100x lower than that of the synthetic cu electrolyte it contained a plethora of other metals such as fe al and mg in sulfate rich media table 2 sem micrographs in fig 9 show the morphology of the cu particles deposited on various types of nanocarbon films from this feed the sizes of cu deposits on films were swcnts 1 5 0 3 μm mwcnts 4 3 0 5 μm and 25 graphene 1 1 0 3 μm for the remaining materials the size distribution was too inhomogeneous to determine this value with any certainty generally the cu deposits size followed the same trend as noted previously with the mwcnt film showing larger particles no deposits could be discerned on the nc mwcnt film likely due to its low conductivity not being able to support deposition at such overvoltage however the even size and distribution of the cu deposits on swcnt films appeared encouraging therefore we subjected it to further analysis edx mapping and spectral analysis of the deposited particles fig 10 confirmed that they were pure cu 45 wt and no other metallic elements were present oxygen 10 wt was also detected in the areas corresponding to cu which indicated that these species are either partially oxidized or there were some deposits on the surface containing oxygen nevertheless the lack of other elements besides carbon in the spectrum proved that not only the cu deposition was successful from a complex mixture of elements but that the process also exhibited selectivity after application of appropriate conditions taken together these results illustrate that the proposed integration strategy of cu and nanocarbon is selective and can be used to manufacture high quality composites directly from waste solutions 4 conclusions this work examined the recovery of copper directly on various types of films made from nanocarbon materials used as admixed material for electrochemical recovery of cu the materials were extensively characterized to understand the electrodeposition process firstly recovery from synthetic cu electrolyte 40 g l cu was studied using cathodic polarization experiments and pulse electrodeposition to observe differences in electrochemical and cu nucleation behavior furthermore an authentic industrial multi metallic wastewater solution containing 428 ppm cu was utilized as the raw material the obtained results showed a beneficial response when using films with higher electrical conductivity and films containing different functional groups to cover the surface with cu evenly the results validate that direct recovery of copper from industrial waste water on nanocarbon substrates is possible as nanomaterials microstructure can be tuned with ease and to a large extent due to the rich chemistry of carbon it is straightforward to optimize the topography and chemical composition to make nanocarbon integrate well with cu consequently added value composite materials can be produced even when industrial waste water solution is taken as the source of metal nanoparticles this way the problematic waste is not only managed but transformed into products of high added value it is envisioned that the structures produced by this approach can show particular promise for catalytic or electrochemical applications in these scenarios the combination of a highly conductive substrate with the unique properties of size constrained metal nanoparticles paves the way towards reaching high performance on these fronts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

prepared with distilled water conductivity 2 4 μs cm 1 the processes were run in 120 min cycles at constant transmembrane pressure tmp and linear flow velocity which were 0 3 mpa and 5 m s 1 respectively the permeate collected in this step of the tests was returned to the feed tank in order to maintain a constant level of teaq concentration in the solution basing on the results of this part of the test the most promising module was selected to the next part of the research with industrial wastewater criteria good separation properties and good fouling resistance the main part of the experiment concerned the purification and concentration of the industrial wastewater initial volume 7 l using a microfiltration module selected on the basis of the results of the first stage of the

organic matter concentration total organic carbon toc biological oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod cationic surfactant concentration and other parameters turbidity ph conductivity surface tension suspended solids and others the purification process was conducted in concentration mode which means that the composition of the feed solution changed during the course of the process run during this stage of the experiment the process parameters were set as follow tmp 0 35 mpa linear flow velocity 3 m s 1 membrane filtration proceeded until the permeate flux declined by over 90 compared to the distilled water flux after that the regeneration step was implemented and processing was restarted the whole concentration process was run as long as the installation equipment allowed filtration to continue and it was terminated when the process parameters deteriorated drastically and could no longer be maintained at the set level during the tests permeate samples were collected for analysis after filtration was ended the collected and averaged permeate was characterized in terms of the analysis performed on raw wastewater conductivity and ph were measured with a cc 411

filtration experiments using test solutions teaq concentration of 1000 mg l 1 were performed using one ultrafiltration module cut off 150 kda pore size distribution 0 055 0 08 μm calvo et al 25 and two microfiltration modules pore sizes 0 14 and 0 45 μm fig 2 presents the effectiveness of toc removal expressed as the retention coefficient as a function of filtration time very high retention coefficients above 94 were noted for the 150 kda and 0 14 μm modules moreover the quality of the permeate seemed to be constant over all the filtration cycle retention coefficients were in the range 94 97 and 94 96 for the 150 kda and 0 14 μm modules respectively as can be seen from fig 2 the module with the greatest pore size achieved lower toc retention which can be attributed to a deterioration of the sieve effect of the surfactant particles on the membrane the quality of the permeate deteriorated within the first 45 min of operation which is an additional indication that the surfactant particles were adsorbed in the membrane structure and on its surface the increase in toc concentration in the permeate during filtration may be explained by the exhaustion of the adsorption capacity of this module when the changes in hydraulic performance of the modules are taken into account fig 3 it can be confirmed that the adsorption capacity of the 0 45 μm module was exhausted in the first 45 min of the process in general teaq proved to be a significant foulant of all the tested modules the permeate flux decreased by about 60 in comparison to the distilled water flux the most significant deterioration in permeate flux was observed in the module with the greatest pore size it should be emphasized that the surfactant particles present in the test solutions were in a micellar form that resulted in the formation of large sized structures theoretically pores of both microfiltration membranes are large enough to teaq micelles to pass through the membrane comparing the teaq micelle diameter of 116 nm with the pore diameter of the modules it can be concluded that modules with pore sizes similar to or smaller than the size of the micelles were more efficient and less prone to surfactant fouling and achieved higher retention coefficients however even when the pores of the 0 45 μm module were significantly larger than the particles being removed 80 surfactant removal was achieved according to byhlin johnson 26 during the membrane filtration of surfactant solution polarization concentration layer is mainly influenced by the presence of micelles in experiments performed certainly aggregated forms outnumbered the monomeric ones teaq surfactant is characterized by low cmc value 0 026 0 0067 mg l 1 moreover increasing surfactant concentration in the polarizing layer could result in the formation of complexed micelle forms of even greater sizes ex cylindrical micelles which can be separated by module with greater pore sizes it should be added that the intensity of these phenomenon is related with multiple exceeding of the critical concentration of micellization cmc this is also a confirmation of the dominant role of the sieve mechanism in the overall separation 3 2 industrial wastewater treatment the wastewater generated in the surfactant manufacturing plant was characterized by high content of organic compounds suspended and dissolved solids and increased turbidity and acidity due to the high bod 5 cod ratio approx 0 75 the wastewater tested is considered to be readily biodegradable the detailed characteristics of the raw wastewater are presented in table 4 based on the results obtained in the first part of the study the module with a pore size of 0 14 μm was selected for industrial wastewater treatment due to its good separation properties and its being least susceptible to teaq fouling fig 4 presents the values of selected indicators of wastewater quality cationic surfactants cod toc turbidity versus permeate recovery ratio pr as can be observed from fig 4 a slight decrease in permeate quality occurred in the first stages of the process run after that the permeate remained at a semi constant level the completed regeneration cycle for pr 36 restored the separation properties of the modules as can be seen from table 4 application of the one step process can be very effective in wastewater purification organic pollutant concentrations cod bod5 cationic surfactants toc decreased by over 93 and suspended solids were removed with high efficiency 93 microfiltration proved to be useful in turbidity removal a decrease from 1300 to 17 ntu 99 removal was observed de la casa et al 27 reported that the isoelectric point pzc for the ceramic membranes of céram inside 25 with an active zirconium dioxide layer is about ph 6 9 in our previous work 22 the influence of the ph of teaq solutions on the transport and separation properties of ceramic membranes was discussed in detail our main conclusion was that the higher the ph value the worse the permeability in alkaline solutions membrane permeability deteriorates as a result of the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged membrane surface and the positively charged teaq particles when acidic solutions are being treated the membrane surface exhibits a positive charge so the lower amount of membrane blocking observed can be ascribed to strong electrostatic repulsion it should be noted that raw wastewater is acidic in character thus it could be expected that its effect on membrane permeability would be favorable however the ph value of both the permeate and the concentrate was higher than that measured for raw wastewater and it increased progressively during the process run which may negatively affect the hydraulic performance of the process ph values in averaged concentrate and permeate samples were 4 89 and 6 12 respectively most likely the naoh used for preparing the module before the process was run was deposited inside the membrane structure and affected the ph of the solution being treated 3 3 hydraulics the hydraulic performance of the process expressed as the relationship between relative flux and pr is plotted in fig 5 deterioration in the permeability of the module was noted from the beginning of the membrane filtration as can be seen in fig 4 relative flux was less than 20 over the course of filtration although the regeneration procedure improved the separation properties of the module its hydraulic performance did not recovery significantly no visible improvement in relative flux changes were in the range from 8 to 9 can be observed after regeneration as indicated earlier no improvement in relative flux after regeneration procedure could be related due to the negative charge of the membrane surface after the contact with cleaning agent and its electrostatic attraction with surfactant particles it can be deduced acidic cleaner should be tested to avoid this phenomenon at a later stage of filtration the hydraulic efficiency of the module decreased again moreover the tmp value decreased in the final stage of membrane filtration probably due to the significant hydraulic resistance of the fouled membrane when the experiment was aborted the set up maintained the tmp at a maximum level of 0 2 mpa and the linear flow velocity was 2 2 m s 1 when the initial values of these parameters were 0 35 mpa and 2 8 m s 1 respectively the experiment was stopped when relative flux reached 6 which corresponds to a permeate flux of 7 4 lm 2h 1 surfactant fouling can be also assessed in terms of membrane hydraulic resistance the equation given below was employed to evaluate the filtration of distilled water 1 j δ p μ r m e m m 3 m 2 h where δp is transmembrane pressure tmp pa μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient pa s and r is membrane resistance m 1 to describe the filtration of solutions containing organic compounds the modified hagen poiseuille equation was used 2 j δ p μ r m e m r f r c p m 3 m 2 h where rf is membrane resistance resulting from fouling phenomena m 1 and rcp is membrane resistance resulting from polarization concentration layer m 1 the calculated values of the hydraulic resistance of the module are presented in table 5 as can be seen from this table after 90 min of filtration the module s resistance has increased by one order of magnitude from 9 63 1012 m 1 to 6 78 1013 m 1 compared to the value obtained for distilled water at the next time point which corresponds to a filtration period of 330 min and a pr of 20 a slight decrease in the resistance was noted comparing this data to fig 5 the relationship between membrane resistance and its permeability is evident further module resistance increased by another order of magnitude just before the regeneration step after 630 min when resistance amounted to 1 22 1014 m 1 implementation of the regeneration step did not have a significant effect in terms of decreasing module resistance and hence did not result in recovery of its permeability a slight decrease in resistance was observed during the last stage of the process which may be due to the aforementioned decrease in tmp in the final stages of membrane filtration 4 conclusions the presented data proved that the pressure driven membrane processes are suitable method for purification of wastewater with a very high concentration of cationic surfactants arising from a production plant ceramic microfiltration module with a pore size of 0 14 μm facilitated an over 93 reduction in organic matter expresses as cod and toc and almost complete removal of cationic surfactants and turbidity the regeneration procedure with naoh solution made it possible to recover the selectivity of the module however its permeability was not restored satisfactorily this indicates the need to modify the regeneration stage in industrial applications the use of an acidic washing agent may eliminate the electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the cationic surfactant and thus a decrease in the intensity of the blocking of the membrane filtration experiments with model solutions teab concentration of 1000 mg l 1 confirmed that the sieve effect is predominant in surfactant separation during uf and mf processes comparing the surfactant micelle diameter with the pore diameter of the modules it was shown that less prone to surfactant fouling and having higher retention coefficients above 94 are modules with pore sizes similar or smaller than the size of the micelles i e 150 kda and 0 45 μm declaration of competing interest the

three ceramic membrane modules céram inside tami industries which differed in pore size and number of channels table 3 critical micelle concentration cmc of surfactant teaq amounted to 0 026 0 0067 mg l 1 micelle size distribution was 115 9 6 9 nm the details of the characteristics of the surfactant have been discussed in previous work 22 23 highly concentrated test solutions 1000 mg teaq l were prepared with distilled water conductivity 2 4 μs cm 1 the processes were run in 120 min cycles at constant transmembrane pressure tmp and linear flow velocity which were 0 3 mpa and 5 m s 1 respectively the permeate collected in this step of the tests was returned to the feed tank in order to maintain a constant level of teaq concentration in the solution basing on the results of this part of the test the most promising module was selected to the next part of the research with industrial wastewater criteria good separation properties and good fouling resistance the main part of the experiment concerned the purification and concentration of the industrial wastewater initial volume 7 l using a microfiltration module selected on the basis of the results of the first stage of the test 0 14 μm the washing step of the teaq surfactant production line generated the wastewater that was used for the filtration experiments the industrial wastewater was characterized in terms of organic matter concentration total organic carbon toc biological oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod cationic surfactant concentration and other parameters turbidity ph conductivity surface tension suspended solids and others the purification process was conducted in concentration mode which means that the composition of the feed solution changed during the course of the process run during this stage of the experiment the process parameters were set as follow tmp 0 35 mpa linear flow velocity 3 m s 1 membrane filtration proceeded until the permeate flux declined by over 90 compared to the distilled water flux after that the regeneration step was implemented and processing was restarted the whole concentration process was run as long as the installation equipment allowed filtration to continue and it was terminated when the process parameters deteriorated drastically and could no longer be maintained at the set level during the tests permeate samples were collected for analysis after filtration was ended the collected and averaged permeate was characterized in terms of the analysis performed on raw wastewater conductivity and ph were measured with a cc 411 conductometer elmetron poland and acp 315 m ph meter elmetron poland respectively turbidity was determined with a 2100 n is turbidimeter hach usa the surface tension of the solutions was measured with an automatic easy dyne tensiometer krüss germany at 22 c using the du noüy ring method the concentrations of the surfactants in the solutions were analyzed using the 785 dmp titrino metrohm switzerland apparatus which employs the potentiometric titration method cod concentration was monitored by means of a cod dr3900 spectrophotometer hach usa bod was measured based on the

filtration experiments using test solutions teaq concentration of 1000 mg l 1 were performed using one ultrafiltration module cut off 150 kda pore size distribution 0 055 0 08 μm calvo et al 25 and two microfiltration modules pore sizes 0 14 and 0 45 μm fig 2 presents the effectiveness of toc removal expressed as the retention coefficient as a function of filtration time very high retention coefficients above 94 were noted for the 150 kda and 0 14 μm modules moreover the quality of the permeate seemed to be constant over all the filtration cycle retention coefficients were in the range 94 97 and 94 96 for the 150 kda and 0 14 μm modules respectively as can be seen from fig 2 the module with the greatest pore size achieved lower toc retention which can be attributed to a deterioration of the sieve effect of the surfactant particles on the membrane the quality of the permeate deteriorated within the first 45 min of operation which is an additional indication that the surfactant particles were adsorbed in the membrane structure and on its surface the increase in toc concentration in the permeate during filtration may be explained by the exhaustion of the adsorption capacity of this module when the changes in hydraulic performance of the modules are taken into account fig 3 it can be confirmed that the adsorption capacity of the 0 45 μm module was exhausted in the first 45 min of the process in general teaq proved to be a significant foulant of all the tested modules the permeate flux decreased by about 60 in comparison to the distilled water flux the most significant deterioration in permeate flux was observed in the module with the greatest pore size it should be emphasized that the surfactant particles present in the test solutions were in a micellar form that resulted in the formation of large sized structures theoretically pores of both microfiltration membranes are large enough to teaq micelles to pass through the membrane comparing the teaq micelle diameter of 116 nm with the pore diameter of the modules it can be concluded that modules with pore sizes similar to or smaller than the size of the micelles were more efficient and less prone to surfactant fouling and achieved higher retention coefficients however even when the pores of the 0 45 μm module were significantly larger than the particles being removed 80 surfactant removal was achieved according to byhlin johnson 26 during the membrane filtration of surfactant solution polarization concentration layer is mainly influenced by the presence of micelles in experiments performed certainly aggregated forms outnumbered the monomeric ones teaq surfactant is characterized by low cmc value 0 026 0 0067 mg l 1 moreover increasing surfactant concentration in the polarizing layer could result in the formation of complexed micelle forms of even greater sizes ex cylindrical micelles which can be separated by module with greater pore sizes it should be added that the intensity of these phenomenon is related with multiple exceeding of the critical concentration of micellization cmc this is also a confirmation of the dominant role of the sieve mechanism in the overall separation 3 2 industrial wastewater treatment the wastewater generated in the surfactant manufacturing plant was characterized by high content of organic compounds suspended and dissolved solids and increased turbidity and acidity due to the high bod 5 cod ratio approx 0 75 the wastewater tested is considered to be readily biodegradable the detailed characteristics of the raw wastewater are presented in table 4 based on the results obtained in the first part of the study the module with a pore size of 0 14 μm was selected for industrial wastewater treatment due to its good separation properties and its being least susceptible to teaq fouling fig 4 presents the values of selected indicators of wastewater quality cationic surfactants cod toc turbidity versus permeate recovery ratio pr as can be observed from fig 4 a slight decrease in permeate quality occurred in the first stages of the process run after that the permeate remained at a semi constant level the completed regeneration cycle for pr 36 restored the separation properties of the modules as can be seen from table 4 application of the one step process can be very effective in wastewater purification organic pollutant concentrations cod bod5 cationic surfactants toc decreased by over 93 and suspended solids were removed with high efficiency 93 microfiltration proved to be useful in turbidity removal a decrease from 1300 to 17 ntu 99 removal was observed de la casa et al 27 reported that the isoelectric point pzc for the ceramic membranes of céram inside 25 with an active zirconium dioxide layer is about ph 6 9 in our previous work 22 the influence of the ph of teaq solutions on the transport and separation properties of ceramic membranes was discussed in detail our main conclusion was that the higher the ph value the worse the permeability in alkaline solutions membrane permeability deteriorates as a result of the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged membrane surface and the positively charged teaq particles when acidic solutions are being treated the membrane surface exhibits a positive charge so the lower amount of membrane blocking observed can be ascribed to strong electrostatic repulsion it should be noted that raw wastewater is acidic in character thus it could be expected that its effect on membrane permeability would be favorable however the ph value of both the permeate and the concentrate was higher than that measured for raw wastewater and it increased progressively during the process run which may negatively affect the hydraulic performance of the process ph values in averaged concentrate and permeate samples were 4 89 and 6 12 respectively most likely the naoh used for preparing the module before the process was run was deposited inside the membrane structure and affected the ph of the solution being treated 3 3 hydraulics the hydraulic performance of the process expressed as the relationship between relative flux and pr is plotted in fig 5 deterioration in the permeability of the module was noted from the beginning of the membrane filtration as can be seen in fig 4 relative flux was less than 20 over the course of filtration although the regeneration procedure improved the separation properties of the module its hydraulic performance did not recovery significantly no visible improvement in relative flux changes were in the range from 8 to 9 can be observed after regeneration as indicated earlier no improvement in relative flux after regeneration procedure could be related due to the negative charge of the membrane surface after the contact with cleaning agent and its electrostatic attraction with surfactant particles it can be deduced acidic cleaner should be tested to avoid this phenomenon at a later stage of filtration the hydraulic efficiency of the module decreased again moreover the tmp value decreased in the final stage of membrane filtration probably due to the significant hydraulic resistance of the fouled membrane when the experiment was aborted the set up maintained the tmp at a maximum level of 0 2 mpa and the linear flow velocity was 2 2 m s 1 when the initial values of these parameters were 0 35 mpa and 2 8 m s 1 respectively the experiment was stopped when relative flux reached 6 which corresponds to a permeate flux of 7 4 lm 2h 1 surfactant fouling can be also assessed in terms of membrane hydraulic resistance the equation given below was employed to evaluate the filtration of distilled water 1 j δ p μ r m e m m 3 m 2 h where δp is transmembrane pressure tmp pa μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient pa s and r is membrane resistance m 1 to describe the filtration of solutions containing organic compounds the modified hagen poiseuille equation was used 2 j δ p μ r m e m r f r c p m 3 m 2 h where rf is membrane resistance resulting from fouling phenomena m 1 and rcp is membrane resistance resulting from polarization concentration layer m 1 the calculated values of the hydraulic resistance of the module are presented in table 5 as can be seen from this table after 90 min of filtration the module s resistance has increased by one order of magnitude from 9 63 1012 m 1 to 6 78 1013 m 1 compared to the value obtained for distilled water at the next time point which corresponds to a filtration period of 330 min and a pr of 20 a slight decrease in the resistance was noted comparing this data to fig 5 the relationship between membrane resistance and its permeability is evident further module resistance increased by another order of magnitude just before the regeneration step after 630 min when resistance amounted to 1 22 1014 m 1 implementation of the regeneration step did not have a significant effect in terms of decreasing module resistance and hence did not result in recovery of its permeability a slight decrease in resistance was observed during the last stage of the process which may be due to the aforementioned decrease in tmp in the final stages of membrane filtration 4 conclusions the presented data proved that the pressure driven membrane processes are suitable method for purification of wastewater with a very high concentration of cationic surfactants arising from a production plant ceramic microfiltration module with a pore size of 0 14 μm facilitated an over 93 reduction in organic matter expresses as cod and toc and almost complete removal of cationic surfactants and turbidity the regeneration procedure with naoh solution made it possible to recover the selectivity of the module however its permeability was not restored satisfactorily this indicates the need to modify the regeneration stage in industrial applications the use of an acidic washing agent may eliminate the electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the cationic surfactant and thus a decrease in the intensity of the blocking of the membrane filtration experiments with model solutions teab concentration of 1000 mg l 1 confirmed that the sieve effect is predominant in surfactant separation during uf and mf processes comparing the surfactant micelle diameter with the pore diameter of the modules it was shown that less prone to surfactant fouling and having higher retention coefficients above 94 are modules with pore sizes similar or smaller than the size of the micelles i e 150 kda and 0 45 μm declaration of competing interest the
