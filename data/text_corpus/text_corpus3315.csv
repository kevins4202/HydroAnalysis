contaminants charged groups can be exchanged onto the ix functional groups through electrostatic force whereas uncharged groups can be adsorbed onto resin surface through van der waal force or hydrophobic interaction for example polyvalent metals such as calcium magnesium copper are mainly removed through ion exchange using cation exchange cix resins edzwald 2010 while natural organic matter nom and organic micropollutants e g polyperfluoroalkyl substances and microcystins are removed through both ion exchange and adsorption using anion exchange aix resins liu et al 2020 dixit et al 2021 the use of ix resins for water treatment has numerous advantages over other treatment technologies first the operation of ix resins is flexible in terms of application scale allowing the implantation of ix resins for both small scale e g household point of use and large scale e g water treatment plants wtp applications second ix resins are simple to operate they are usually operated in fixed bed contactors with a short empty bed contact time ebct e g 2 8 min third some ix resins are reusable and can be regenerated on site using typically a highly concentrated nacl brine e g 8 12 w v to recover the ix capacity edzwald 2010 however as the majority of the regenerant ends up in the brine the ion exchange brine i e ix brine is composed of a high concentration of nacl the disposal of such brine is costly and its direct discharge to the environment adversely impacts ecosystems rokicki and boyer 2011 ness and boyer 2017 consequently the management of ix brine has become a bottleneck in the application of ix resins for water treatment with some wtp abandoning ix processes due to the lack of a proper ix brine management scheme levchuk et al 2018 in contrast to other separation processes e g membrane and distillation where residual management has been reviewed in detail in the last decade mezher et al 2011 pramanik et al 2017 panagopoulos et al 2019 no similar effort has been made to review ix processes even though a large number of studies have been devoted to overcoming barriers in ix brine management therefore the main objective of this review is to critically evaluate ix operational strategies and ix brine management that can be used to limit the negative impacts imposed by ix brine to this end first we summarize the physicochemical characteristics and chemical composition of ix brine generated from both cix and aix processes second we assess ix operational strategies and ix brine management reported in scientific literature finally we propose a novel workflow for an ix water treatment plant design that integrates ix operational strategies and ix brine management 2 ion exchange brine characteristics table 1 summarizes the reported physicochemical characteristics and chemical composition of ix brine following a single regeneration i e without multiple brine reuse generally ix brine following a single regeneration has a neutral or slightly basic ph of 7 8 and a high electrical conductivity 100 ms cm because of the use of concentrated fresh brine e g 35 150 g nacl l the chemical composition of ix brine varies widely owing to the diversity of factors coming into play first the chemical composition of ix brine depends on the target contaminants removed during the treatment cycle as well as the ix operational conditions e g ix filter run time type of fresh brine duration of rinsing cycle after regeneration a longer run time accumulates more contaminants leading to a higher concentration in the ix brine on the other hand a longer rinsing cycle post regeneration can dilute the ix brine second the physicochemical characteristics of the feed water as well as the upstream pretreatment are expected to impact the chemical composition of the brine during the treatment cycle both the target contaminants and competing ions were removed accordingly the ix brine is a mixture of brine target contaminants competing ions and other background ions present in the make up water overall given the confounding factors contributing to the chemical composition ix brine characteristics should be studied on a case by case basis in addition to ix brine from a single regeneration a number of studies have documented ix brine characteristics following multiple brine reuses as expected contaminants and non target ions e g sulfate and bicarbonate accumulated as the number of reuse cycles increased for example sulfate bicarbonate and nitrate were found to accumulate in the ix brine while using anion exchange resins to remove nitrate bae et al 2002 and arsenic clifford et al 2003 however the concentrations of non target ions tended to stabilize if no treatment was conducted during reuse lehman et al 2008 noted that sulfate and bicarbonate accumulated in the brine of aix used to remove nitrate and perchlorate until they reached stable concentrations after 13 15 cycles similarly duan et al 2020 found that the loading of bicarbonate on the aix resin used to remove nitrate reached a stable condition after 10 cycles although duan et al 2020 reported that no significant impact on the ix performance was observed for sulfate accumulation in the brine one should note that their conclusion was based on a short operation period 96 bv the accumulation of non target anions such as sulfate can deteriorate the ix treatment efficiency especially for long term operation or shorten the service time of ix resins as mentioned by liu and clifford 1996 therefore it is often recommended to apply treatment strategies for ix brine prior to multiple reuses a topic that will be discussed later in the present review 3 ion exchange operational strategies to facilitate brine management 3 1 resin selection strategies while the selection of resins first depends on the target contaminants and feed water characteristics e g ph and background ions the properties of selected resins can impact brine management for a given application for example strong basic anion exchange sba resins are usually regenerated with concentrated sodium chloride solution whereas weak basic anion exchange wba resins are mostly regenerated with caustic soda solution the brine management strategies for these two resins can be significantly different given the different brine corrosivity the resin backbone materials can also impact the regeneration strategy for example as polystyrene resins are more hydrophobic than polyacrylic ones levchuk et al 2018 they may favor the uptake of a given contaminant but negatively impact regeneration efficacy therefore resin properties should be taken into account during the selection of resins to anticipate the best brine management strategy generally bench or pilot scale tests are often conducted to identify the most efficient resin for a given application some commercial software can offer the comparison of different resins such as lewaplus lanxess wave dupont resinex design software jacobi and prsm purolite the cost associated with ix brine management can be significantly reduced by maximizing treatment efficiency and reducing regeneration frequency therefore selecting the most efficient ix resin for a given treatment objective can be the most effective solution to reduce the management cost of ix brine plummer et al 2018 furthermore modifying the resin structure to reduce brine production is also of high interest and has received attention from ix resin suppliers and researchers for example the shallow shell technology sst patented by purolite is an alternative cix for conventional ix resins used in water softening and demineralization briefly unlike conventional strong acidic cation exchange sac resins the sst resin is produced with an inert center eliminating the ix sites that are slower and more difficult to reach more difficult to regenerate and more likely to suffer from pore plugging purolite 2014 by doing so the supplier states that regeneration of sst resins requires 15 less salt and 50 less water for rinse and dilution purolite 2014 the city of chilton wisconsin usa renewed its softeners with sst resin and found that the salt usage decreased by approximately 32 and that the water consumption used for a regeneration cycle decreased by 16 compared to conventional resins wtp production capacity 2600 m3 day olsen 2015 nonetheless olsen 2015 also noted that regeneration became more frequent because of the reduced resin capacity with an average of 2 9 times per day using sst resins vs 2 5 times per day using conventional resins an increase of 16 more frequent regeneration may have an impact on equipment costs as more softeners must be provisioned if they are more often off duty in 2016 arar 2016 reported that the performance was similar between conventional ix resins and sst resins for the removal of copper but the sst resins demonstrated a higher regeneration efficiency than conventional resins 100 vs 80 using 2 m h2so4 site specific validation is still required to compare the overall costs of operating sst resins and conventional resins for a given application the application of single use resins is on the rise in the water treatment sector especially for pfas and perchlorate removal thanks to the simplified operation and maintenance and the current limitations regarding the disposal of contaminated brine choe et al 2013 dixit et al 2021 the exhausted single use resins are usually incinerated off site which eliminates the generation of ix brine a life cycle assessment study comparing the environmental impact of regenerable ix vs single use ix for perchlorate removal shows that the single use resin is more environmentally sustainable and more economic than regenerable ix choe et al 2013 additionally the authors also demonstrated that for regenerable ix systems the dominant contribution to environmental impact comes from the salt used for regeneration 80 and strategies to treat and recycle the brine significantly reduce the environmental impact of regenerable ix systems choe et al 2013 choe et al 2015 furthermore given the fact that resin manufacturing has been identified as an important contributor to the overall environmental impact of ix systems according to life cycle assessment choe et al 2013 amini et al 2015 resin reuse should always be encouraged as long as the brine management scheme is more sustainable than resin replacement a thorough life cycle assessment needs to be conducted on a case by case basis to compare the environmental impact of single use resins and regenerable resins given that the outcome is impacted by several input factors 3 2 resin contactor configuration fixed bed contactors are by far the most common configuration for ix resins due to the simple operation two variants of implementation are used in the industry 1 standard dual train configuration where one ix contactor is on line while a second contactor is standby or undergoing regeneration 2 lead lag configuration in which feed water passes through the first contactor i e lead contactor and then the second contactor i e lag contactor the lead contactor is taken offline for regeneration when the breakthrough occurs in the effluent following regeneration the lead lag reactor configuration is inverted the regenerated former lead contactor returns to the service at the lag position and the former lag contactor becomes the new lead contactor hosea et al 1988 the lead lag configuration can not only offer a higher removal than standard dual train configuration but also maximize the ix operation capacity prior to regeneration an advantage that can benefit brine management by reducing regeneration frequency moving bed contactors on the other hand offers a configuration where the resin is either fluidized or moving inside the reactor such configurations have attracted attention over the last decade due to their ability to remove nom from turbid raw waters examples of these include magnetic ion exchange miex slunjski et al 2000 fluidized ion exchange fix cornelissen et al 2009 and suspended ion exchange six metcalfe et al 2015 a life cycle assessment study comparing fixed bed ix contactors and the miex process suggested that fixed bed ix contactors consume more salt and produce more brine than the miex process amini et al 2015 nonetheless the authors attributed this observation to the improper maintenance of resins for the fixed bed contactors further investigations are still required to systematically compare fixed bed contactors and moving bed contactors in terms of brine management 3 3 novel ion exchange operational mode a novel operational mode for aix resins for nom removal was first proposed by schulz et al 2017 this strategy referred to as biological ion exchange biex involves operating aix resins with infrequent regeneration to promote the microbial colonization of resins thereby prolonging ix service time through biodegradation schulz et al 2017 in a pilot scale study where the biex filter had not been regenerated for 330 days the biex filer achieved slightly lower dissolved organic carbon doc removal compared to its weekly regenerated counterpart 62 vs 80 amini et al 2018 nom removal in the biex filter was attributed to a combination of ion exchange especially secondary ion exchange where nom exchanges with pre retained sulfate and biodegradation liu et al 2020 mass balance studies revealed that at most 30 of nom removal was attributed to the biodegradation amini et al 2018 liu et al 2020 although running ix resins in biex mode could significantly reduce brine production one should note that nom removal is lower than the conventional mode i e with regular regeneration therefore biex is only applicable when the reduced nom removal performance still meets the treatment objective the regeneration frequency for a biex filter is site specific and depends on the feed water characteristics for example in a study by amini et al 2018 water treated with biex was able to comply with the québec trihalomethane thm standard 80 μg l for one month whereas another pilot test carried out in the middle river bc canada was able to operate with biex for 1 year without regeneration while meeting the thm standard x y zimmermann et al 2020 overall source waters with low sulfate concentrations e g 3 5 mg l are ideal for the biex process 3 4 novel ion exchange regeneration strategies 3 4 1 segmented regeneration segmented regeneration patented by ionex sg is an alternative to conventional regeneration aimed at eluting the contaminant loaded on ix resins in the smallest possible volume of ix brine this technique has been mainly applied to aix resins for the removal of chromium and nitrate plummer et al 2018 briefly the segmented regeneration consists of 1 using a regenerant of low concentration e g 0 2 m nacl to first elute secondary ions e g sulfate and bicarbonate and 2 using a regenerant at high concentrations e g 2 m nacl to elute chromium or nitrate from the ix resin waite 2018 the low concentration ix brine that is the brine containing non target ions can be reused or even recycled to the head of the treatment train korak et al 2017 regarding the high concentration regeneration a chromatographic peak of the contaminant is eluted and therefore concentrated in a smaller volume of brine meanwhile high concentration ix brine that contains little contaminant can be reused for the next cycles along with the rinsing water plummer al 2018 this strategy has already been applied to full scale aix systems in california and the volume of ix brine to be discharged was reduced by 80 compared to a conventional regeneration method plummer et al 2018 however prior to full scale application this approach requires laboratory pretests on a case by case basis to investigate the elution profile achieved during regeneration 3 4 2 alternative regenerants to nacl nacl is by far the most common solution for regenerating ix resins because of the affordable and chemically inert features of nacl however given the stricter jurisdictions on wastewater discharge and concerns over ecosystem impairment many studies have pursued greener alternatives to nacl it is worth noting that the trade off between ix operation performance and ix regeneration performance should be fully considered when selecting alternative regenerant a more selective regenerant compared to nacl could offer a better contaminant elution during ix regeneration however it could also lower the ix operation performance in the following cycles due to the higher affinity to resins relative resin selectivity for ions can be found in de dardel and arden 2008 3 4 2 1 alternative regenerants for cation exchange resins potassium salts e g kcl have been suggested for the regeneration of softeners as an alternative to nacl to regenerate cix resins because of their 1 lower harmful impact on the environment 2 favorable increase of potassium in the human diet as opposed to sodium 3 value for irrigation and soil properties and 4 excellent solubility in water 254 g kcl l at 20 c birnhack et al 2019 in 2014 maul et al 2014 evaluated the regeneration efficiency and the environmental impacts of ix brine for four types of salt nacl kcl nahco3 khco3 they concluded that potassium salts kcl and khco3 have a higher efficiency than sodium salts for cix regeneration and the use of kcl brine for irrigation could offset the demand for potassium based fertilizers however the use of kcl salt may increase the environmental burden compared to nacl salt based on the study of the life cycle assessment maul et al 2014 in addition the higher cost of kcl salts 3 5 times more expensive than nacl still hinders its application especially for large water utilities birnhack et al 2019 in 2016 li et al 2016a proposed a softening process using cix resins in aluminum al3 form rather than sodium na given that the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide occurs quickly in water using aluminum form ix resins simultaneously removes hardness and alkalinity the mechanisms are expressed by eqs 1 3 1 2 r s o 3 3 a l 3 3 c a 2 3 r s o 3 2 c a 2 2 a l 3 2 2 a l 3 6 h 2 o 2 a l o h 3 s 6 h 3 6 h 6 h c o 3 6 h 2 o 6 c o 2 g although the use of aluminum form resins for softening is counterintuitive because of the trivalence of aluminum li et al 2016 demonstrated that aluminum form resins removed hardness to a 20 lower effluent concentration than the resin in sodium form in addition unlike regeneration with nacl where a high concentration must be used a lower concentration 3 w v alcl3 is sufficient for regeneration quantity of al required for regenerant hardness to be removed 1 1 demonstrating its advantage in ix brine management nevertheless aluminum hydroxide precipitation was observed on the surface of the resins both after exhaustion and after regeneration with alcl3 a phenomenon that may lower the resin performance for subsequent cycles therefore the viability of this solution for long term operation has yet to be demonstrated 3 4 2 2 alternative regenerants for anion exchange resins the most studied alternative for aix resins is sodium bicarbonate nahco3 for two reasons 1 bicarbonate has a similar affinity to chloride on aix resins rokicki and boyer 2011 and 2 bicarbonate is less environmentally detrimental than chloride and can be discharged to the environment or into the sewer jelínek et al 2004 the performance of bicarbonate form aix resins has been investigated for the removal of nom in a lab scale study walker and boyer 2011 the authors demonstrated that bicarbonate form aix had the same performance as chloride form aix for nom removal at the beginning of the test however because of the lower regeneration efficiency of the bicarbonate solution doc removal by bicarbonate form resins was 7 18 lower than their chloride form counterparts after 21 service cycles moreover bicarbonate form aix resins have also been evaluated for the removal of chromium vi matošić et al 2000 reported that bicarbonate form resins achieved a slightly lower removal of chromium vi than their chloride form counterparts whereas li et al 2016b reported a similar performance between bicarbonate and chloride form resins for the same application propose overall the lower solubility of nahco3 in water approximately 100 g l vs 360 g l for nacl at 25 c would limit the maximum concentration of regenerant that can be used and the cost of nahco3 salt is approximately 3 times more expensive than nacl salt based on the 2020 prices in montreal canada for an nsf certified product therefore the application of bicarbonate salt as an alternative regenerant for aix resins remains limited two alternative regenerants have been proposed for the recovery of perchlorate from aix resins given that the high affinity of perchlorate for aix resins makes it difficult to use nacl as a regenerant gu et al 2001 proposed using tetrachloroferrate fecl4 as an alternative and achieved approximately 100 recovery with 5 l regenerant l resin furthermore gutiettre et al 2008 suggested using iodide as an alternative to recover perchlorate from exhausted resins however the management of such brine is difficult not to mention the high cost of iodide salts and the absence of nsf certified products 3 4 3 no chemical addition regeneration discovering the chemical free regeneration technique has been a goal of ix research since the initial discovery of this technology chemical free regeneration eliminates the transport of chemicals i e salts these methods can be divided into three groups based on their mechanisms biological electrochemical and thermal regeneration which will be reviewed in detail in the following sections 3 4 3 3 biological regeneration with a biological approach the regeneration of exhausted resins and the destruction of the contaminant loaded on the resins occur simultaneously by directly contacting the spent resins with an active biomass to date this method has been mostly evaluated for perchlorate and nitrate laden ix resins given that the target contaminant must be biodegradable wang et al 2008 were the first to present this idea with the aim of regenerating a resin loaded with perchlorate and repeatedly regenerated resins loaded with perchlorate or nitrate the mechanism of biological regeneration consists of desorbing the perchlorate or nitrate from the resin prior to biodegrading perchlorate to chloride and nitrate to n2 with an acclimated biomass ebrahimi and roberts 2013 2015 sharbatmaleki et al 2015 xiao et al 2010 although biological regeneration is technically viable the long regeneration time and the need for washing procedures to remove biomass from the resin surface limit its full scale application venkatesen et al 2010 3 4 3 4 electrochemical regeneration some studies have resorted to using electrodialysis with bipolar membranes edbm to produce acid or base solutions for the on site regeneration of ix resins this method was successfully tested for cix and aix resins in full scale applications for example bolton 1992 investigated the on site generation of acids and bases via edbm and then successfully applied the generated acid and base into full scale cix and aix contactors with efficiency similar to that of conventional chemical regeneration similarly chen et al 2016 used edbm to generate hcl and naoh from a nacl solution 100 mm and then used the acid to regenerate weak acid cation wac softeners and the base was used to promote the crystallization of caco3 and mg oh 2 consequently chen et al 2016 reported that the energy required to produce the acid and the base was an order of magnitude lower than that required to purchase the chemical although chemicals e g 100 mm nacl are still needed in the process of edbm their usage can be significantly reduced compared to conventional ix regeneration with a high concentration of nacl in addition the on site production of regenerants could offer an advantage for remote communities which would otherwise depend on long distance transportation of chemicals bolton 1992 however an economic analysis comparing this method to conventional chemical regeneration is still needed as the capital expenditure for implementing edbm may prohibit the viability of this strategy furthermore xing et al 2007 evaluated electrodeionization edi for in situ regeneration of resins loaded with chromium vi and recovered it as chromic acid briefly aix resins first adsorb chromium vi during the treatment cycle and after the saturation of chromium vi on the resin phase the electricity supply is triggered in the ix chamber to regenerate resins through water electrolysis with oh in their work the regeneration cycle was maintained for 24 h using a current of 0 25 a approximately 93 of the ix capacity was recovered an efficiency similar to chemical regeneration later su et al 2013 2014 developed a novel process based on the principle of edi but without the use of ion exchange membranes and referred to it as membrane free electrodeionization this process produces high purity water and consists of i a service cycle where mixed bed resins i e cix and aix remove impurities from water and ii a regeneration cycle where resins are regenerated by h and oh generated through water electrolysis however membrane free electrodeionization has mainly been studied for the production of high purity water and has been only tested with synthetic water of high quality 10 70 μs cm in conductivity e g osmosis permeate shen et al 2014 hu et al 2015 2016 therefore the feasibility and stability of this process for municipal and industrial feed remain uncertain 3 4 3 5 thermal regeneration with thermal methods resins are regenerated at high temperatures using hot water approximately 80 c bolto et al 1978 this process was first applied to a mixed bed of weak base anion exchange wba and weak acid cation wac exchange resins battaerd et al 1973 later a novel resin material that simultaneously incorporated the functional groups of wba and wac resins i e sirotherm resin was developed bolto and jackson 1983 the sirotherm resin is thermally regenerable which means that the resin is capable of eliminating ions in an aqueous solution at room temperature and then desorbing ions at high temperatures due to unfavorable thermodynamics bolto and jackson 1983 however this process failed during trials at the industrial scale and research on this subject was suspended csiropedia 2014 in 2009 a new thermally regenerable resin crosslinked with polyacrylic acid and ethoxylated polyethyleneimine was synthesized chanda et al 2009 this resin was successfully tested for 10 cycles for the desalination of brackish water chanda et al 2010 however the results showed that the ix capacity decreased by a factor of 8 when the temperature increased from 30 c to 80 c chanda et al 2010 suggesting that the resin can only be partially regenerated to improve the efficiency of thermal regeneration chandrasekara and pashley 2015 used ammonium bicarbonate to regenerate the sirotherm resin and demonstrated the feasibility of thermally recycling ammonium bicarbonate during regeneration briefly exhausted resins were soaked in ammonium bicarbonate solution 2 m at 20 c for 15 h and then the resins were heated to 80 c for 1 h to decompose ammonium bicarbonate while returning the resins to their initial form i e tertiary amine and carboxylic acid carbon dioxide and ammonia gasses were recovered and used for subsequent regeneration however this process is still in the development phase and a full scale demonstration is needed to prove its feasibility for carbon dioxide and ammonia gas recovery overall thermal regeneration requires further development 4 ion exchange brine management 4 1 ion exchange brine reuse ix brine can potentially be reused as a regenerant because of its high salt content reusing brine for ix regeneration allows for the direct reduction of salt usage and water consumption verdickt et al 2011 flodman and dvorak 2012 therefore given the great economic and environmental benefits of reuse one should always consider ix brine reuse when designing the ix brine management scheme however it is also worth noting that a loss of treatment performance may occur if the recycled regenerant is of low quality a reduction in treatment efficiency may lead to an increase in the regeneration frequency which could completely or partially offset the benefits of reuse salt makeup and or ph adjustment may be required before the direct reuse of the ix brine in cases where direct reuse is not feasible pretreatment strategies may have to be considered prior to brine reuse in this section we summarize past studies on direct ix brine reuse with or without nacl addition and treatment strategies for the reuse of ix brine 4 1 1 direct reuse the ix brine can sometimes be reused directly without any makeup with fresh salts clifford et al 2003 investigated the direct reuse of nacl brine 117 g l for the regeneration of arsenic laden aix resins and the ix brine was successfully reused for six times without any efficiency decline similarly medina et al 2018 evaluated the direct reuse of ix brine for the regeneration of nom laden aix resins with a saturated regenerant 360 g l nacl and successfully reused the brine for three times with little impact on ix performance duan et al 2020 reused the ix brine to regenerate nitrate laden aix resins for 23 times however they reported that the nitrate removal efficiency gradually decreased from 100 to 38 overall direct reuse of ix brine without any chemical makeup is feasible but the number of reuses needs to be defined on a case by case basis make up with salt e g nacl and or ph adjustment e g with naoh are common practices to improve regeneration efficiency during the direct reuse of brine clifford et al 2003 successfully reused ix brine to regenerate arsenic laden aix resins for 14 cycles with salt compensation of 58 5 g nacl l before each reuse for the same application purpose an et al 2005 achieved 7 cycles of reuse with stable arsenic recovery 95 with ph adjustment to 9 2 10 before each reuse kim and symons 1991 reported that the total organic carbon toc in the treated effluent remained stable for nine operation cycles when reusing ix brine with readjustment each time to 2 m nacl and 1 5 m naoh however during direct brine reuse to regenerate aix resins charged with chromium plummer et al 2018 noted that the resins were not fully regenerated in the second reuse cycle even though they compensated the brine to 117 g nacl l foldman and dvorak 2012 investigated the reuse of ix brine for softener regeneration with compensation of saturated nacl solution 360 g l and concluded that the benefits of reuse came at the cost of reduced performance for the system accordingly the feasibility of reuse must be investigated on a case by case basis as its success depends on initial regenerant concentration operational mode raw water characteristics and target contaminants 4 1 2 treatment strategies for reuse in cases where direct reuse of ix brine is not feasible some studies have sought to verify whether treatment strategies would allow the reuse of ix brine the objectives of brine treatment are to 1 remove impurities e g contaminants or non target ions from ix brine to improve brine reuse efficacy or 2 recover valuable resources e g nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 from ix brine for reuse or resell substantial research has been devoted to the development of eco efficient treatment strategies for ix brine these strategies are grouped and critically reviewed in the following subsections based on the target contaminants 4 1 2 6 treatment strategies for hardness laden brine taking advantage of reverse osmosis ro brine to remove hardness from cix brine cob et al 2014 combined ro brine loaded with sodium and bicarbonate with hardness laden ix brine the authors demonstrated that more than 99 of caco3 was precipitated with a ph adjustment to 11 and the remaining ix brine loaded with sodium chloride could be reused for the regeneration of cix resins furthermore vanoppen et al 2016 demonstrated the possibility of directly using an ro brine to regenerate a cix filter with minor addition of nacl 2 5 g l however despite being economical this method is only suitable for situations where cix and ro systems simultaneously exist in the treatment process such as at a seawater desalination plant where cix is implemented prior to ro to remove hardness resource recovery by hybrid processes numerous treatment strategies have sought to recover valuable resources from hardness laden ix brine birnhack et al 2019 successfully applied a hybrid process consisting of nanofiltration nf dia nf and ro to recover potassium salt from a kcl brine gryta et al 2005 investigated the use of membrane distillation md to recover nacl from brine however they found that md performance was deteriorated due to fouling e g ca mg and si and the separation of nacl from the salt mixture was a challenge micari et al 2019a successfully extracted a pure nacl solution from the softener brine using a treatment train of nf crystallization and multi effect distillation med a techno economic assessment was conducted for the treatment train micari et al 2019a as well as the med process micari et al 2019b the authors reported that 1 the lowest treatment cost of 4 9 usd m3 brine could be achieved with an nf recovery rate of 25 2 the evaporator is the most important contributor to the process operating cost 30 of total cost and 3 plane multi effect distillation med without the use of a thermo compressor supplied with recycled heat at a pressure of 1 bar was the most economical way to operate the evaporator furthermore eutectic crystallization has been proposed as an alternative to evaporative crystallization for salt recovery from ix brine because it consumes 6 7 times less energy than evaporative crystallization van der ham et al 1998 lewis et al 2010 fernandez torres et al 2012 in a laboratory scale study cob et al 2014 investigated the use of eutectic crystallization to treat softener brine the authors were able to obtain ice and nacl crystals by lowering the temperature to 29 4 c additionally the authors concluded that a powerful scraping system was needed to avoid scaling caused by ice more recently a feasibility study was conducted by ahmad et al 2017 to investigate the potential of eutectic crystallization for the treatment of softener brine the authors reported that the presence of impurities e g ca and mg lowered the eutectic temperature for nacl crystallization but reduced scaling in the reactor which improved the efficiency of energy transfer from an economic point of view they concluded that eutectic crystallization led to a similar cost compared to evaporative crystallization due to its high capitalization costs 4 1 2 7 treatment strategies for arsenic laden brine coagulation and adsorption coagulation is a viable approach for removing arsenic from ix brine clifford et al 2003 successfully used fecl3 to remove arsenic as from ix brine and the authors reported that arsenic removal depends on the initial arsenic concentration ph of the brine and fe as ratio applied an et al 2005 also used fecl3 to remove arsenic from ix brine and the treated brine was reused for regeneration without any decline in the performance of ix pakzadeh and batista 2011b simulated the arsenic removal process in ix brine using a surface complexation model and found that alkalinity and ionic strength are expected to affect the efficiency of fecl3 in addition to coagulation an et al 2011 developed starch bridged magnetite nanoparticles to adsorb arsenic from the brine the authors concluded that arsenic was fully eliminated under optimal conditions fe as ratio 7 6 contact time 1 h nevertheless the method was only demonstrated with a synthetic brine 300 mg l as with 6 nacl w w its performance using a real ix brine and the cost of application at an industrial scale remains unknown 4 1 2 8 treatment strategies for chrome laden brine reduction coagulation filtration regarding the treatment of chromium vi loaded with ix brine a reduction coagulation filtration process is widely used with many reactants that have been evaluated for such applications including sulfite in acidic conditions siegel and clifford 1988 ferrous iron siegel and clifford 1988 li et al 2016b homan et al 2018 plummer et al 2018 hydrazine siegel and clifford 1988 polysulfides pakzadeh and batista 2011a plummer et al 2018 bisulfite and stannous sulfide plummer et al 2018 among them ferrous iron has been shown to be the most cost effective siegel and clifford 1988 plummer et al 2018 though it does not work in a bicarbonate brine homan et al 2018 4 1 2 9 treatment strategies for nom laden brine coagulation and adsorption coagulation has been proven to be an efficient method for removing nom from ix brine for example verdickt et al 2011 used fecl3 and post filtration to purify the brine before reuse subsequent to the adjustment of conductivity and ph i e adding nacl naoh the recycled brine was successfully reused 14 times with little impact on the ix performance similarly medina et al 2018 investigated the use of alum as a coagulant for nom removal in the brine although the treatment enabled three reuse cycles the authors observed that the regeneration efficiency was lower than that of brine direct reuse because of the introduction of sulfate ions from alum which are strong competitors to nom on ix resins instead of using coagulants zhang et al 2019 proposed using powdered activated carbon pac 5 g l to adsorb dissolved organic matter dom in ix brine after every 6 7 service cycles the treatment allowed a dom removal of approximately 80 in the brine and the brine was successfully reused for 50 service cycles however the pac must be filtered out from the solution prior to reusing the treated brine which makes this option more complex overall the practice of coagulation or pac adsorption is feasible for ix brine laden with nom but the requirement of post filtration the concern over other inorganic ion accumulation in the brine e g sulfate and the disposal of sludge or saturated media still need careful consideration resource recovery by thermal and or electrodialysis processes numerous studies have sought to recover nom and or salt from ix brine for reuse vaudevire et al 2013 evaluated the dynamic vapor recompression dvr process to recover salts from nf concentrated ix brine the authors reported the co precipitation of nacl na2co3 and na2so4 when the concentration factor exceeded 10 however the authors also noted that it was impossible to separate nacl from the salt mixture kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 first demonstrated the feasibility of using electrodialysis ed to recover nacl from a synthetic ix brine although a fraction of nom was shown to pass through the ix membrane and contaminate the recycled nacl solution vaudevire et al 2019 demonstrated a two step ed process to recover nom and nacl solutions the first stage consisted of recovering nacl using a selective monovalent aix membrane while the second stage consisted of separating multivalent anions from the solution loaded with nom by a standard ix membrane haddad et al 2019 compared the performance of conventional and selective monovalent ix ed membranes the results showed that selective monovalent ix membranes could recover nacl of high purity with an energy requirement of approximately 2 kwh kg nacl in addition the authors also tested the use of a pulsed electric field to intensify the separation and reduce membrane fouling but the benefit was only noted for the conventional ix membrane more recently haddad et al 2021 combined ed with membrane distillation md and they demonstrated that md was a viable option to concentrate the purified nacl produced by ed overall ed is a promising technique for nom laden brine treatment but its application is currently hindered by the capitalization costs of the equipment and the fact that the treated brine still requires a post concentration step to raise the concentration of nacl to the required level for the regeneration i e 8 12 w w resource recovery by membranes processes numerous studies have sought to use membrane processes to recover resources from nom laden ix brine wadley et al 1995 successfully applied nf to recover nacl from an ix brine generated from a decolorization process kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 evaluated six ultrafiltration membranes uf and two nf membranes to recover nacl from a nom laden brine and the results demonstrated that tight uf 5 kda and nf were capable of providing a permeate i e nacl solution of satisfactory quality however nom fouling was an important issue because the high salinity imposed an extremely high operating pressure 120 bar more recently caltran et al 2020 demonstrated that ceramic nf yielded less fouling than polymeric nf during the separation of nom from ix brine however the poor rejection of sulfate especially at high ionic strength is problematic given that sulfate may lower the performance of aix during the following service cycles overall using membrane processes to recover salt and nom from ix brine is a promising process and deserves further study 4 1 2 10 treatment strategies for trace organic pollutants laden brine electrochemical processes few studies have investigated the treatment strategies for pfas in ix brine schaefer et al 2020 reported that pfas laden ix brine is amenable to electrochemical treatment using boron doped diamond anodes but the treatment performance depends on the fresh regenerant type chloride regenerant inhibits the electrochemical treatment of pfas as chloride will also be oxidized at the anodes to perchlorate singh et al 2020 successfully degraded pfas precursors and long and short chain pfass from ix brine using a sequential plasma reactor indicating that plasma treatment is promising for pfas treatment from ix brine resource recovery organic solvents such as methanol and ethanol can be used to regenerate pfas laden resins with or without the addition of inorganic salts dixit et al 2021 the organic solvent can be recovered by distillation and reused for the next regeneration cycle singh et al 2020 one should note that such a strategy is only applicable for industrial applications where the presence of a solvent residue in treated water is not causing any health concern furthermore the feasibility and sustainability of this strategy also remain to be evaluated at full scale 4 1 2 11 treatment strategies for nitrate and perchlorate laden brine the treatment strategies for nitrate and perchlorate are similar that is the contaminants are chemically or biologically reduced to reduced forms so that the brine can be reused for the following cycles catalytic reduction catalytic reduction is a technique that has received considerable attention for this subject pintar et al 2001 first developed a catalyst pd cu γ al2o3 that successfully treated a nitrate loaded brine using h2 as an electron donor in their subsequent study pintar and batista 2006 they modified the process into a two stage treatment where the first stage was dedicated to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite with the help of pd cu γ al2o3 and the second stage reduced nitrite to nitrogen gas using the monometallic catalyst pd γ al2o3 this process reduced the production of ammonium compared to the prior designs similarly liu et al 2013 proposed a two step process to treat an ix brine loaded with nitrate and perchlorate nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas in the first stage while perchlorate was reduced to chloride using a re pd c catalyst more recently another catalyst has been successfully developed by synthesizing palladium and indium on activated carbon pd in c to reduce nitrate in ix brine choe et al 2015 meanwhile numerous reactor configurations have been proposed to increase the stability and the performance of catalytic reduction such as batch reactors choe et al 2015 fixed bed column reactors choe et al 2015 bergquist et al 2016 and trickle bed reactors bergquist et al 2017 in addition yang et al 2013 investigated the feasibility of photocatalytic reduction using tio2 as a catalyst and formic acid as an electron donor for the treatment of nitrate in ix brine they observed that the presence of sulfate in the brine is the dominant factor preventing the treatment that is there exists a competition between sulfate and nitrate on tio2 sites overall despite being feasible catalytic reduction is usually complicated to operate and a long term techno economic analysis of these processes is still lacking zero valent iron nanoparticles zero valent iron nanoparticles fe0 are capable of reducing nitrate choe et al 2000 and perchlorate moore et al 2003 to their reduced forms however the small size of the nanoparticles 1 100 nm promoted their agglomeration and thus reduced their reactivity to resolve this problem he and zhao 2005 and he et al 2007 proposed modifying the nanoparticles using soluble starch or carboxymethyl sodium cellulose cmc as stabilizers these stabilizers can increase the specific surface area physical stability and the reaction kinetics of fe0 nanoparticles in subsequent studies researchers demonstrated the feasibility of using stabilized fe0 to degrade nitrate xiong et al 2007 and perchlorate xiong et al 2009 in an ix brine even though the reaction rates were limited when the nacl concentration exceeded 60 g l further studies are needed to resolve the complex issue of the recovery and the disposal of nanoparticles before real application electrolysis some studies have assessed electrolysis as an alternative to remove nitrate from ix brine paidar et al 2004 developed an electrolysis reactor where a simulated bicarbonate brine was circulated in inert media with titanium ti as the anode and copper cu as the cathode subsequent to the reduction of nitrate to ammonium and oxygen at the cathode cu the treated brine was successfully reused for the regeneration of ix resins in another study dortsiou et al 2009 compared tin sn and bismuth bi as cathodes for the electrolysis treatment of a simulated bicarbonate brine while using platinum anode in both cases the authors reported that the type of cathode electrode had an impact on the final reduction products for nitrate the final reduction products of nitrate were mostly nitrogen gas 47 and nitrous oxide 41 when sn was used as the cathode while only 28 of nitrogen gas and 39 ammonium was produced when bi was used as the cathode more recently duan et al 2020 used an electrolysis system to treat chloride brine using iron fe as cathode and iro2 ruo2 ti as anode they found that ammonium generated by the reduction of nitrate was oxidized to nitrogen gas due to the presence of chlorine i e breakpoint chlorination a by product generated during the electrolysis of chloride at the anode overall electrolysis is an appealing technology for the treatment of nitrate laden ix brine future investigations should assess the scale up cost and the sustainability of this method for brine treatment biodegradation biodegradation allows the removal of nitrate van der hoek and klapwijk 1989 and perchlorate logan et al 2001 from ix brine the greatest challenge of this method is related to the high salinity of the brine which inhibits bacterial growth to solve this problem halophilic bacterial communities have been isolated from various high salinity environments such as seawater marine sediments salt marshes and biofilm sludge from a seawater filter logan et al 2001 okeke et al 2002 cang et al 2004 these strains were then enriched in the laboratory and acclimated to the brine environment given that biodegradation is a redox process some reactions may benefit from the addition of an electron donor such as methanol clifford and liu 1993 ethanol mcadam et al 2010 acetate lehman et al 2008 lactate and glycerol peyton et al 2001 of which the treatment efficiency depends on the ph and salinity the addition of these electron donors complicates the reuse of brine for drinking water applications due to carry over concerns several reactor configurations have been tested with varying degrees of success for the treatment of nitrate perchlorate or the simultaneous removal of these two substances such as an upflow sludge blanket van der hoek and klapwijk 1989 a sequential batch reactor clifford and liu 1993 lehman et al 2008 a fluidized bed reactor patel et al 2008 xiao et al 2010 a membrane bioreactor mcadam and judd 2008 mcadam et al 2010 and a membrane biofilm reactor with h2 as the electron donor chung et al 2007 sahu et al 2009 to optimize biological treatment lin et al 2007 reported that the addition of divalent cations ca2 mg2 stabilizes the bacterial culture and promotes perchlorate biodegradation li et al 2015 suggested using a mixture of bicarbonate and chloride regenerants to increase the alkalinity of the brine which would stabilize the denitrification process two groups of investigators also demonstrated the possibility of encapsulating bacteria trogl et al 2011 or enzymes hutchison et al 2013 to protect them from high salinity while allowing the degradation of nitrate and perchlorate in the brine so far these methods have only been demonstrated at the lab scale overall biodegradation is a promising process for the treatment of nitrate and or perchlorate laden ix brine hybrid processes finally hybrid processes were tested to remove nitrate and other impurities to improve the regeneration efficiency of the recycled brine bae et al 2002 tested a treatment system consisting of biological denitrification biological reduction of sulfate sand filtration and granular activated carbon gac filtration the brine was reused for 24 times with a performance comparable to that of the fresh brine later the authors suggested using precipitation and coagulation with bacl2 and fecl3 to replace the biological sulfate reduction process bae et al 2004 and the brine was reused for 11 times with success klas et al 2015 applied a sequential batch denitrification bioreactor followed by ozonation for suspended solids and doc removal the system operated reliably for over a year and achieved steady performance resource recovery few studies have investigated the feasibility of resource recovery from nitrate and perchlorate laden ix brine vaudevire et al 2013 investigated the use of dynamic vapor recompression dvr to recover salts from denitrified ix brine but failed to separate nacl from the salt mixture huo et al 2020 successfully used a hybrid hydrogenation md process to treat an ix brine containing a high concentration of nitrate briefly nitrate was first reduced to ammonia in the presence of a low cost catalyst ru c and the ammonia was then recovered by md as nh4 2so4 which is a valuable commercial fertilizer 4 2 ion exchange brine disposal although brine reuse is beneficial for ix brine management brine disposal is still a common management solution especially for the cases where 1 ix brine reuse is neither possible or economically viable e g small scale communities or 2 recycled brine reaches its end of life and the disposal of such brine is inevitable the choice of disposal strategy is site specific depending on costs volume of brine level of treatment required before release physicochemical characteristics of brine local hydrogeological conditions public acceptability and local regulations jensen and darby 2016 4 2 1 direct disposal direct disposal to a nearby surface water body is a simple and economical measure however this option can only be considered when no harmful contaminants are present in the brine e g arsenic laden brine mitigation measures should be considered before disposal such as the use of diffusers mixing systems or mixing zones to dilute the brine so that the discharge of brine may conform to local discharge criteria e g for chloride on site evaporation ponds are a suitable alternative for the disposal of ix brine briefly when the water evaporates due to solar heat and the wind effect in the pond the solutes in the brine precipitate at the bottom of the pond and this precipitate i e saline sludge must be periodically recovered and transported elsewhere e g landfill an improved design namely the salinity gradient solar pond has been proposed tinos and culligan 2012 for the disposal of desalination brine however the feasibility of ix brine still needs investigation in all cases building a pond is affordable when the land is available and the operation requires little maintenance jensen and darby 2016 demonstrated that the on site evaporation ponds are the cheapest solution in california among the four strategies studied when the system capacity is greater than 8 m3 h 35 gpm however it should be noted that this technique is only suitable for arid or semi arid regions where local climatic conditions are favorable e g low humidity and high rate of evaporation a popular alternative is to discharge the ix brine into sewerage systems this is particularly feasible for small water treatment facilities however brine dilution and ph adjustment are usually necessary prior to discharge to minimize the harmful impacts on water pipes as well as on the biological processes used by wastewater treatment plants rokicki and boyer 2011 liu et al 2013 for remote areas where sewer systems are not available transportation of ix brine to the wastewater treatment plant can be an economical option jensen and darby 2016 reported that transportation to a coastal wastewater treatment plant is the cheapest option when the water treatment plant has a design capacity lower than 8 m3 h 35 gpm injecting ix brine into deep aquifers 500 1500 m isolated from freshwater aquifers is suitable for inland sites however the use of this measure strongly depends on the local geological conditions e g the existence of a confined aquifer the transmissivity of the soil brine characteristics and public perception jensen and darby 2016 as well as having high costs and potential risk of groundwater contamination therefore this option is hardly realistic for small systems and this measure is an alternative for large systems when other solutions are not available finally land application in agricultural fields parks or golf courses is a potential option to dispose of ix brine especially when the brine contains beneficial nutrients such as potassium nom and nitrate however dilution with fresh water is certainly necessary prior to land application to mitigate the detrimental impact arising from high salt concentrations making this solution less attractive compared to other methods overall although direct disposal methods are simple to put in place the adverse impacts of the high salinity and harmful contaminants on the aquatic ecosystem should be fully considered before disposal treatment strategies and or dilution strategies should be considered before disposal to lower the potential negative impacts on ecosystems 4 2 2 treatment strategies for disposal fewer treatment strategies have been tested for direct disposal compared to reuse most studies have been devoted to reducing the volume of ix brine to favor the transportation to begin with nf processes have been sought to reduce the brine volume and numerous studies have demonstrated that nf can reduce the brine volume by up to 85 90 prior to its disposal depending on the operating conditions schippers et al 2004 cartier et al 1997 salehi et al 2011 korak et al 2018 however membrane fouling remains an important challenge for nf processes to alleviate this issue leong et al 2016 successfully coupled nf with a vibratory shear system to reduce the deposition of solutes on the surface of the membrane furthermore ghasemipanah 2013 successfully used ro to recover water from ix brine for irrigation purposes while reducing the brine volume arias paić and korak 2020 proposed using forward osmosis fo as an alternative to ro and nf to concentrate the brine prior to disposal briefly as the presence of a salt saturator in ix plants offers a source of chemical potential for fo ix brine can be concentrated by the saturated salt solution consequently the authors reported that fo could reduce the brine volume by 65 85 in addition to membrane processes evaporation crystallization can be used to further concentrate the brine demonstrating the possibility of zero liquid discharge for ix brine management vaudevire et al 2013 5 discussion and conclusions ion exchange ix with synthetic resins is a flexible simple to operate and cost efficient technology that can cope with a wide range of contaminants however ix brine arising from the regeneration of ix resins is still a limiting factor and the management of such by products has become a real bottleneck for the application of ix resins in the water treatment sector currently ix plant designs mainly consist of operational parameter calculations e g flow rate bed volume and running time and a proper brine management strategy is often overlooked during the ix plant design phase consequently it is of paramount importance to integrate ix operational strategies as well as brine management schemes in ix plant design to make the process more sustainable although it is easy to design an ix system based on the source water characteristics defining an optimal ix brine strategy requires treatability or pilot studies a cost that is too often difficult to justify for small projects in our opinion it would be desirable for legislators to force designers to address the issue of ix brine management many solutions reviewed e g switching from nacl to nahco3 involve higher operating costs but had much lower potential environmental impacts but it is doubtful that the industry will adopt greener alternatives unless it is required by regulation or otherwise promoted based on the ix operational strategies and ix brine management reviewed in the present paper a novel design workflow for ix plants is proposed as follows fig 1 first ix operational strategies that facilitate the management of the ix brine should be considered when choosing the resin during the design phase one should select a resin that works as efficiently as possible for the intended purpose this requires stakeholders to test different resins from different manufacturers for the same application and to choose the most efficient one second when designing the cycle length if the ix process is used for nom removal one could consider operating ix resins in biological mode biex which can fully exploit the ix capacity for nom removal and reduce the regeneration frequency third during the regeneration phases segmented regeneration has been shown to largely reduce the brine volume and its investigation is encouraged especially for chromium and nitrate removal on the other hand despite being promising chemical free regeneration i e biological electrolytic and thermal methods is still under development and more studies are needed to test the feasibility of full scale applications finally alternative regenerants such as bicarbonate salts for aix resins and potassium salts for cix resins are also encouraged to reduce the environmental impact subsequent to determining the regeneration strategy a regeneration pretest in the lab or at a pilot scale is strongly suggested to characterize the ix brine this practice would benefit the ix brine management strategy design in the following way 1 direct reuse of ix brine could be evaluated 2 treatment methods could be designed if brine direct reuse is not feasible it is worth noting that direct reuse of ix brine is the most economically beneficial approach due to its savings on water salt usage as well as operation and maintenance o m costs as long as regeneration efficiency and treatment performance are not affected ix brine treatment prior to reuse certainly increases capital costs but the reduction in salt and water consumption lowers the o m costs lehman et al 2008 nonetheless non monetary factors should also be considered when choosing the best treatment method such as process maturity operational complexity process footprint and contamination of ix vessels plummer et al 2018 overall although ix brine treatment followed by reuse for ix resin regeneration is potentially viable it is still necessary to design the treatment scheme on a case by case basis considering the local regulations and conditions ix brine disposal is still the main option for cases where 1 brine reuse strategies are not economically feasible or 2 the reused brine has reached its end of life the brine disposal methods depend on cost brine volume brine characteristics local hydrogeological conditions climate conditions public acceptability and local regulations treatment methods e g membrane or evaporation are available to reduce the brine volume or even achieve zero liquid discharge overall this review provides a vast list of options to mitigate the adverse impacts of ix brine on the environment engineers and legislators are encouraged to proactively consider these novel ideas which will help reduce the environmental footprint of ix systems declaration of competing interest the authors

16575,ion exchange ix using synthetic resins is a cost efficient technology to cope with a wide range of contaminants in water treatment however implementing ix processes is constrained by the regeneration of ix resins that generates a highly concentrated brine i e ix brine the disposal of which is costly and detrimental to ecosystems in an effort to make the application of ix resins more sustainable in water treatment substantial research has been conducted on the optimization of ix resins operation and the management of ix brine the present review critically evaluates the literature surrounding ix operational strategies and ix brine management which can be used to limit the negative impacts arising from ix brine to this end we first analyzed the physicochemical characteristics of brines from the regeneration of ix resins then we critically evaluated ix operational strategies that facilitate brine management including resin selection contactor selection operational modes and regeneration strategies furthermore we analyzed ix brine management strategies including brine reuse and brine disposal without or with treatment finally a novel workflow for the ix water treatment

contaminants charged groups can be exchanged onto the ix functional groups through electrostatic force whereas uncharged groups can be adsorbed onto resin surface through van der waal force or hydrophobic interaction for example polyvalent metals such as calcium magnesium copper are mainly removed through ion exchange using cation exchange cix resins edzwald 2010 while natural organic matter nom and organic micropollutants e g polyperfluoroalkyl substances and microcystins are removed through both ion exchange and adsorption using anion exchange aix resins liu et al 2020 dixit et al 2021 the use of ix resins for water treatment has numerous advantages over other treatment technologies first the operation of ix resins is flexible in terms of application scale allowing the implantation of ix resins for both small scale e g household point of use and large scale e g water treatment plants wtp applications second ix resins are simple to operate they are usually operated in fixed bed contactors with a short empty bed contact time ebct e g 2 8 min third some ix resins are reusable and can be regenerated on site using typically a highly concentrated nacl brine e g 8 12 w v to recover the ix capacity edzwald 2010 however as the majority of the regenerant ends up in the brine the ion exchange brine i e ix brine is composed of a high concentration of nacl the disposal of such brine is costly and its direct discharge to the environment adversely impacts ecosystems rokicki and boyer 2011 ness and boyer 2017 consequently the management of ix brine has become a bottleneck in the application of ix resins for water treatment with some wtp abandoning ix processes due to the lack of a proper ix brine management scheme levchuk et al 2018 in contrast to other separation processes e g membrane and distillation where residual management has been reviewed in detail in the last decade mezher et al 2011 pramanik et al 2017 panagopoulos et al 2019 no similar effort has been made to review ix processes even though a large number of studies have been devoted to overcoming barriers in ix brine management therefore the main objective of this review is to critically evaluate ix operational strategies and ix brine management that can be used to limit the negative impacts imposed by ix brine to this end first we summarize the physicochemical characteristics and chemical composition of ix brine generated from both cix and aix processes second we assess ix operational strategies and ix brine management reported in scientific literature finally we propose a novel workflow for an ix water treatment plant design that integrates ix operational strategies and ix brine management 2 ion exchange brine characteristics table 1 summarizes the reported physicochemical characteristics and chemical composition of ix brine following a single regeneration i e without multiple brine reuse generally ix brine following a single regeneration has a neutral or slightly basic ph of 7 8 and a high electrical conductivity 100 ms cm because of the use of concentrated fresh brine e g 35 150 g nacl l the chemical composition of ix brine varies widely owing to the diversity of factors coming into play first the chemical composition of ix brine depends on the target contaminants removed during the treatment cycle as well as the ix operational conditions e g ix filter run time type of fresh brine duration of rinsing cycle after regeneration a longer run time accumulates more contaminants leading to a higher concentration in the ix brine on the other hand a longer rinsing cycle post regeneration can dilute the ix brine second the physicochemical characteristics of the feed water as well as the upstream pretreatment are expected to impact the chemical composition of the brine during the treatment cycle both the target contaminants and competing ions were removed accordingly the ix brine is a mixture of brine target contaminants competing ions and other background ions present in the make up water overall given the confounding factors contributing to the chemical composition ix brine characteristics should be studied on a case by case basis in addition to ix brine from a single regeneration a number of studies have documented ix brine characteristics following multiple brine reuses as expected contaminants and non target ions e g sulfate and bicarbonate accumulated as the number of reuse cycles increased for example sulfate bicarbonate and nitrate were found to accumulate in the ix brine while using anion exchange resins to remove nitrate bae et al 2002 and arsenic clifford et al 2003 however the concentrations of non target ions tended to stabilize if no treatment was conducted during reuse lehman et al 2008 noted that sulfate and bicarbonate accumulated in the brine of aix used to remove nitrate and perchlorate until they reached stable concentrations after 13 15 cycles similarly duan et al 2020 found that the loading of bicarbonate on the aix resin used to remove nitrate reached a stable condition after 10 cycles although duan et al 2020 reported that no significant impact on the ix performance was observed for sulfate accumulation in the brine one should note that their conclusion was based on a short operation period 96 bv the accumulation of non target anions such as sulfate can deteriorate the ix treatment efficiency especially for long term operation or shorten the service time of ix resins as mentioned by liu and clifford 1996 therefore it is often recommended to apply treatment strategies for ix brine prior to multiple reuses a topic that will be discussed later in the present review 3 ion exchange operational strategies to facilitate brine management 3 1 resin selection strategies while the selection of resins first depends on the target contaminants and feed water characteristics e g ph and background ions the properties of selected resins can impact brine management for a given application for example strong basic anion exchange sba resins are usually regenerated with concentrated sodium chloride solution whereas weak basic anion exchange wba resins are mostly regenerated with caustic soda solution the brine management strategies for these two resins can be significantly different given the different brine corrosivity the resin backbone materials can also impact the regeneration strategy for example as polystyrene resins are more hydrophobic than polyacrylic ones levchuk et al 2018 they may favor the uptake of a given contaminant but negatively impact regeneration efficacy therefore resin properties should be taken into account during the selection of resins to anticipate the best brine management strategy generally bench or pilot scale tests are often conducted to identify the most efficient resin for a given application some commercial software can offer the comparison of different resins such as lewaplus lanxess wave dupont resinex design software jacobi and prsm purolite the cost associated with ix brine management can be significantly reduced by maximizing treatment efficiency and reducing regeneration frequency therefore selecting the most efficient ix resin for a given treatment objective can be the most effective solution to reduce the management cost of ix brine plummer et al 2018 furthermore modifying the resin structure to reduce brine production is also of high interest and has received attention from ix resin suppliers and researchers for example the shallow shell technology sst patented by purolite is an alternative cix for conventional ix resins used in water softening and demineralization briefly unlike conventional strong acidic cation exchange sac resins the sst resin is produced with an inert center eliminating the ix sites that are slower and more difficult to reach more difficult to regenerate and more likely to suffer from pore plugging purolite 2014 by doing so the supplier states that regeneration of sst resins requires 15 less salt and 50 less water for rinse and dilution purolite 2014 the city of chilton wisconsin usa renewed its softeners with sst resin and found that the salt usage decreased by approximately 32 and that the water consumption used for a regeneration cycle decreased by 16 compared to conventional resins wtp production capacity 2600 m3 day olsen 2015 nonetheless olsen 2015 also noted that regeneration became more frequent because of the reduced resin capacity with an average of 2 9 times per day using sst resins vs 2 5 times per day using conventional resins an increase of 16 more frequent regeneration may have an impact on equipment costs as more softeners must be provisioned if they are more often off duty in 2016 arar 2016 reported that the performance was similar between conventional ix resins and sst resins for the removal of copper but the sst resins demonstrated a higher regeneration efficiency than conventional resins 100 vs 80 using 2 m h2so4 site specific validation is still required to compare the overall costs of operating sst resins and conventional resins for a given application the application of single use resins is on the rise in the water treatment sector especially for pfas and perchlorate removal thanks to the simplified operation and maintenance and the current limitations regarding the disposal of contaminated brine choe et al 2013 dixit et al 2021 the exhausted single use resins are usually incinerated off site which eliminates the generation of ix brine a life cycle assessment study comparing the environmental impact of regenerable ix vs single use ix for perchlorate removal shows that the single use resin is more environmentally sustainable and more economic than regenerable ix choe et al 2013 additionally the authors also demonstrated that for regenerable ix systems the dominant contribution to environmental impact comes from the salt used for regeneration 80 and strategies to treat and recycle the brine significantly reduce the environmental impact of regenerable ix systems choe et al 2013 choe et al 2015 furthermore given the fact that resin manufacturing has been identified as an important contributor to the overall environmental impact of ix systems according to life cycle assessment choe et al 2013 amini et al 2015 resin reuse should always be encouraged as long as the brine management scheme is more sustainable than resin replacement a thorough life cycle assessment needs to be conducted on a case by case basis to compare the environmental impact of single use resins and regenerable resins given that the outcome is impacted by several input factors 3 2 resin contactor configuration fixed bed contactors are by far the most common configuration for ix resins due to the simple operation two variants of implementation are used in the industry 1 standard dual train configuration where one ix contactor is on line while a second contactor is standby or undergoing regeneration 2 lead lag configuration in which feed water passes through the first contactor i e lead contactor and then the second contactor i e lag contactor the lead contactor is taken offline for regeneration when the breakthrough occurs in the effluent following regeneration the lead lag reactor configuration is inverted the regenerated former lead contactor returns to the service at the lag position and the former lag contactor becomes the new lead contactor hosea et al 1988 the lead lag configuration can not only offer a higher removal than standard dual train configuration but also maximize the ix operation capacity prior to regeneration an advantage that can benefit brine management by reducing regeneration frequency moving bed contactors on the other hand offers a configuration where the resin is either fluidized or moving inside the reactor such configurations have attracted attention over the last decade due to their ability to remove nom from turbid raw waters examples of these include magnetic ion exchange miex slunjski et al 2000 fluidized ion exchange fix cornelissen et al 2009 and suspended ion exchange six metcalfe et al 2015 a life cycle assessment study comparing fixed bed ix contactors and the miex process suggested that fixed bed ix contactors consume more salt and produce more brine than the miex process amini et al 2015 nonetheless the authors attributed this observation to the improper maintenance of resins for the fixed bed contactors further investigations are still required to systematically compare fixed bed contactors and moving bed contactors in terms of brine management 3 3 novel ion exchange operational mode a novel operational mode for aix resins for nom removal was first proposed by schulz et al 2017 this strategy referred to as biological ion exchange biex involves operating aix resins with infrequent regeneration to promote the microbial colonization of resins thereby prolonging ix service time through biodegradation schulz et al 2017 in a pilot scale study where the biex filter had not been regenerated for 330 days the biex filer achieved slightly lower dissolved organic carbon doc removal compared to its weekly regenerated counterpart 62 vs 80 amini et al 2018 nom removal in the biex filter was attributed to a combination of ion exchange especially secondary ion exchange where nom exchanges with pre retained sulfate and biodegradation liu et al 2020 mass balance studies revealed that at most 30 of nom removal was attributed to the biodegradation amini et al 2018 liu et al 2020 although running ix resins in biex mode could significantly reduce brine production one should note that nom removal is lower than the conventional mode i e with regular regeneration therefore biex is only applicable when the reduced nom removal performance still meets the treatment objective the regeneration frequency for a biex filter is site specific and depends on the feed water characteristics for example in a study by amini et al 2018 water treated with biex was able to comply with the québec trihalomethane thm standard 80 μg l for one month whereas another pilot test carried out in the middle river bc canada was able to operate with biex for 1 year without regeneration while meeting the thm standard x y zimmermann et al 2020 overall source waters with low sulfate concentrations e g 3 5 mg l are ideal for the biex process 3 4 novel ion exchange regeneration strategies 3 4 1 segmented regeneration segmented regeneration patented by ionex sg is an alternative to conventional regeneration aimed at eluting the contaminant loaded on ix resins in the smallest possible volume of ix brine this technique has been mainly applied to aix resins for the removal of chromium and nitrate plummer et al 2018 briefly the segmented regeneration consists of 1 using a regenerant of low concentration e g 0 2 m nacl to first elute secondary ions e g sulfate and bicarbonate and 2 using a regenerant at high concentrations e g 2 m nacl to elute chromium or nitrate from the ix resin waite 2018 the low concentration ix brine that is the brine containing non target ions can be reused or even recycled to the head of the treatment train korak et al 2017 regarding the high concentration regeneration a chromatographic peak of the contaminant is eluted and therefore concentrated in a smaller volume of brine meanwhile high concentration ix brine that contains little contaminant can be reused for the next cycles along with the rinsing water plummer al 2018 this strategy has already been applied to full scale aix systems in california and the volume of ix brine to be discharged was reduced by 80 compared to a conventional regeneration method plummer et al 2018 however prior to full scale application this approach requires laboratory pretests on a case by case basis to investigate the elution profile achieved during regeneration 3 4 2 alternative regenerants to nacl nacl is by far the most common solution for regenerating ix resins because of the affordable and chemically inert features of nacl however given the stricter jurisdictions on wastewater discharge and concerns over ecosystem impairment many studies have pursued greener alternatives to nacl it is worth noting that the trade off between ix operation performance and ix regeneration performance should be fully considered when selecting alternative regenerant a more selective regenerant compared to nacl could offer a better contaminant elution during ix regeneration however it could also lower the ix operation performance in the following cycles due to the higher affinity to resins relative resin selectivity for ions can be found in de dardel and arden 2008 3 4 2 1 alternative regenerants for cation exchange resins potassium salts e g kcl have been suggested for the regeneration of softeners as an alternative to nacl to regenerate cix resins because of their 1 lower harmful impact on the environment 2 favorable increase of potassium in the human diet as opposed to sodium 3 value for irrigation and soil properties and 4 excellent solubility in water 254 g kcl l at 20 c birnhack et al 2019 in 2014 maul et al 2014 evaluated the regeneration efficiency and the environmental impacts of ix brine for four types of salt nacl kcl nahco3 khco3 they concluded that potassium salts kcl and khco3 have a higher efficiency than sodium salts for cix regeneration and the use of kcl brine for irrigation could offset the demand for potassium based fertilizers however the use of kcl salt may increase the environmental burden compared to nacl salt based on the study of the life cycle assessment maul et al 2014 in addition the higher cost of kcl salts 3 5 times more expensive than nacl still hinders its application especially for large water utilities birnhack et al 2019 in 2016 li et al 2016a proposed a softening process using cix resins in aluminum al3 form rather than sodium na given that the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide occurs quickly in water using aluminum form ix resins simultaneously removes hardness and alkalinity the mechanisms are expressed by eqs 1 3 1 2 r s o 3 3 a l 3 3 c a 2 3 r s o 3 2 c a 2 2 a l 3 2 2 a l 3 6 h 2 o 2 a l o h 3 s 6 h 3 6 h 6 h c o 3 6 h 2 o 6 c o 2 g although the use of aluminum form resins for softening is counterintuitive because of the trivalence of aluminum li et al 2016 demonstrated that aluminum form resins removed hardness to a 20 lower effluent concentration than the resin in sodium form in addition unlike regeneration with nacl where a high concentration must be used a lower concentration 3 w v alcl3 is sufficient for regeneration quantity of al required for regenerant hardness to be removed 1 1 demonstrating its advantage in ix brine management nevertheless aluminum hydroxide precipitation was observed on the surface of the resins both after exhaustion and after regeneration with alcl3 a phenomenon that may lower the resin performance for subsequent cycles therefore the viability of this solution for long term operation has yet to be demonstrated 3 4 2 2 alternative regenerants for anion exchange resins the most studied alternative for aix resins is sodium bicarbonate nahco3 for two reasons 1 bicarbonate has a similar affinity to chloride on aix resins rokicki and boyer 2011 and 2 bicarbonate is less environmentally detrimental than chloride and can be discharged to the environment or into the sewer jelínek et al 2004 the performance of bicarbonate form aix resins has been investigated for the removal of nom in a lab scale study walker and boyer 2011 the authors demonstrated that bicarbonate form aix had the same performance as chloride form aix for nom removal at the beginning of the test however because of the lower regeneration efficiency of the bicarbonate solution doc removal by bicarbonate form resins was 7 18 lower than their chloride form counterparts after 21 service cycles moreover bicarbonate form aix resins have also been evaluated for the removal of chromium vi matošić et al 2000 reported that bicarbonate form resins achieved a slightly lower removal of chromium vi than their chloride form counterparts whereas li et al 2016b reported a similar performance between bicarbonate and chloride form resins for the same application propose overall the lower solubility of nahco3 in water approximately 100 g l vs 360 g l for nacl at 25 c would limit the maximum concentration of regenerant that can be used and the cost of nahco3 salt is approximately 3 times more expensive than nacl salt based on the 2020 prices in montreal canada for an nsf certified product therefore the application of bicarbonate salt as an alternative regenerant for aix resins remains limited two alternative regenerants have been proposed for the recovery of perchlorate from aix resins given that the high affinity of perchlorate for aix resins makes it difficult to use nacl as a regenerant gu et al 2001 proposed using tetrachloroferrate fecl4 as an alternative and achieved approximately 100 recovery with 5 l regenerant l resin furthermore gutiettre et al 2008 suggested using iodide as an alternative to recover perchlorate from exhausted resins however the management of such brine is difficult not to mention the high cost of iodide salts and the absence of nsf certified products 3 4 3 no chemical addition regeneration discovering the chemical free regeneration technique has been a goal of ix research since the initial discovery of this technology chemical free regeneration eliminates the transport of chemicals i e salts these methods can be divided into three groups based on their mechanisms biological electrochemical and thermal regeneration which will be reviewed in detail in the following sections 3 4 3 3 biological regeneration with a biological approach the regeneration of exhausted resins and the destruction of the contaminant loaded on the resins occur simultaneously by directly contacting the spent resins with an active biomass to date this method has been mostly evaluated for perchlorate and nitrate laden ix resins given that the target contaminant must be biodegradable wang et al 2008 were the first to present this idea with the aim of regenerating a resin loaded with perchlorate and repeatedly regenerated resins loaded with perchlorate or nitrate the mechanism of biological regeneration consists of desorbing the perchlorate or nitrate from the resin prior to biodegrading perchlorate to chloride and nitrate to n2 with an acclimated biomass ebrahimi and roberts 2013 2015 sharbatmaleki et al 2015 xiao et al 2010 although biological regeneration is technically viable the long regeneration time and the need for washing procedures to remove biomass from the resin surface limit its full scale application venkatesen et al 2010 3 4 3 4 electrochemical regeneration some studies have resorted to using electrodialysis with bipolar membranes edbm to produce acid or base solutions for the on site regeneration of ix resins this method was successfully tested for cix and aix resins in full scale applications for example bolton 1992 investigated the on site generation of acids and bases via edbm and then successfully applied the generated acid and base into full scale cix and aix contactors with efficiency similar to that of conventional chemical regeneration similarly chen et al 2016 used edbm to generate hcl and naoh from a nacl solution 100 mm and then used the acid to regenerate weak acid cation wac softeners and the base was used to promote the crystallization of caco3 and mg oh 2 consequently chen et al 2016 reported that the energy required to produce the acid and the base was an order of magnitude lower than that required to purchase the chemical although chemicals e g 100 mm nacl are still needed in the process of edbm their usage can be significantly reduced compared to conventional ix regeneration with a high concentration of nacl in addition the on site production of regenerants could offer an advantage for remote communities which would otherwise depend on long distance transportation of chemicals bolton 1992 however an economic analysis comparing this method to conventional chemical regeneration is still needed as the capital expenditure for implementing edbm may prohibit the viability of this strategy furthermore xing et al 2007 evaluated electrodeionization edi for in situ regeneration of resins loaded with chromium vi and recovered it as chromic acid briefly aix resins first adsorb chromium vi during the treatment cycle and after the saturation of chromium vi on the resin phase the electricity supply is triggered in the ix chamber to regenerate resins through water electrolysis with oh in their work the regeneration cycle was maintained for 24 h using a current of 0 25 a approximately 93 of the ix capacity was recovered an efficiency similar to chemical regeneration later su et al 2013 2014 developed a novel process based on the principle of edi but without the use of ion exchange membranes and referred to it as membrane free electrodeionization this process produces high purity water and consists of i a service cycle where mixed bed resins i e cix and aix remove impurities from water and ii a regeneration cycle where resins are regenerated by h and oh generated through water electrolysis however membrane free electrodeionization has mainly been studied for the production of high purity water and has been only tested with synthetic water of high quality 10 70 μs cm in conductivity e g osmosis permeate shen et al 2014 hu et al 2015 2016 therefore the feasibility and stability of this process for municipal and industrial feed remain uncertain 3 4 3 5 thermal regeneration with thermal methods resins are regenerated at high temperatures using hot water approximately 80 c bolto et al 1978 this process was first applied to a mixed bed of weak base anion exchange wba and weak acid cation wac exchange resins battaerd et al 1973 later a novel resin material that simultaneously incorporated the functional groups of wba and wac resins i e sirotherm resin was developed bolto and jackson 1983 the sirotherm resin is thermally regenerable which means that the resin is capable of eliminating ions in an aqueous solution at room temperature and then desorbing ions at high temperatures due to unfavorable thermodynamics bolto and jackson 1983 however this process failed during trials at the industrial scale and research on this subject was suspended csiropedia 2014 in 2009 a new thermally regenerable resin crosslinked with polyacrylic acid and ethoxylated polyethyleneimine was synthesized chanda et al 2009 this resin was successfully tested for 10 cycles for the desalination of brackish water chanda et al 2010 however the results showed that the ix capacity decreased by a factor of 8 when the temperature increased from 30 c to 80 c chanda et al 2010 suggesting that the resin can only be partially regenerated to improve the efficiency of thermal regeneration chandrasekara and pashley 2015 used ammonium bicarbonate to regenerate the sirotherm resin and demonstrated the feasibility of thermally recycling ammonium bicarbonate during regeneration briefly exhausted resins were soaked in ammonium bicarbonate solution 2 m at 20 c for 15 h and then the resins were heated to 80 c for 1 h to decompose ammonium bicarbonate while returning the resins to their initial form i e tertiary amine and carboxylic acid carbon dioxide and ammonia gasses were recovered and used for subsequent regeneration however this process is still in the development phase and a full scale demonstration is needed to prove its feasibility for carbon dioxide and ammonia gas recovery overall thermal regeneration requires further development 4 ion exchange brine management 4 1 ion exchange brine reuse ix brine can potentially be reused as a regenerant because of its high salt content reusing brine for ix regeneration allows for the direct reduction of salt usage and water consumption verdickt et al 2011 flodman and dvorak 2012 therefore given the great economic and environmental benefits of reuse one should always consider ix brine reuse when designing the ix brine management scheme however it is also worth noting that a loss of treatment performance may occur if the recycled regenerant is of low quality a reduction in treatment efficiency may lead to an increase in the regeneration frequency which could completely or partially offset the benefits of reuse salt makeup and or ph adjustment may be required before the direct reuse of the ix brine in cases where direct reuse is not feasible pretreatment strategies may have to be considered prior to brine reuse in this section we summarize past studies on direct ix brine reuse with or without nacl addition and treatment strategies for the reuse of ix brine 4 1 1 direct reuse the ix brine can sometimes be reused directly without any makeup with fresh salts clifford et al 2003 investigated the direct reuse of nacl brine 117 g l for the regeneration of arsenic laden aix resins and the ix brine was successfully reused for six times without any efficiency decline similarly medina et al 2018 evaluated the direct reuse of ix brine for the regeneration of nom laden aix resins with a saturated regenerant 360 g l nacl and successfully reused the brine for three times with little impact on ix performance duan et al 2020 reused the ix brine to regenerate nitrate laden aix resins for 23 times however they reported that the nitrate removal efficiency gradually decreased from 100 to 38 overall direct reuse of ix brine without any chemical makeup is feasible but the number of reuses needs to be defined on a case by case basis make up with salt e g nacl and or ph adjustment e g with naoh are common practices to improve regeneration efficiency during the direct reuse of brine clifford et al 2003 successfully reused ix brine to regenerate arsenic laden aix resins for 14 cycles with salt compensation of 58 5 g nacl l before each reuse for the same application purpose an et al 2005 achieved 7 cycles of reuse with stable arsenic recovery 95 with ph adjustment to 9 2 10 before each reuse kim and symons 1991 reported that the total organic carbon toc in the treated effluent remained stable for nine operation cycles when reusing ix brine with readjustment each time to 2 m nacl and 1 5 m naoh however during direct brine reuse to regenerate aix resins charged with chromium plummer et al 2018 noted that the resins were not fully regenerated in the second reuse cycle even though they compensated the brine to 117 g nacl l foldman and dvorak 2012 investigated the reuse of ix brine for softener regeneration with compensation of saturated nacl solution 360 g l and concluded that the benefits of reuse came at the cost of reduced performance for the system accordingly the feasibility of reuse must be investigated on a case by case basis as its success depends on initial regenerant concentration operational mode raw water characteristics and target contaminants 4 1 2 treatment strategies for reuse in cases where direct reuse of ix brine is not feasible some studies have sought to verify whether treatment strategies would allow the reuse of ix brine the objectives of brine treatment are to 1 remove impurities e g contaminants or non target ions from ix brine to improve brine reuse efficacy or 2 recover valuable resources e g nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 from ix brine for reuse or resell substantial research has been devoted to the development of eco efficient treatment strategies for ix brine these strategies are grouped and critically reviewed in the following subsections based on the target contaminants 4 1 2 6 treatment strategies for hardness laden brine taking advantage of reverse osmosis ro brine to remove hardness from cix brine cob et al 2014 combined ro brine loaded with sodium and bicarbonate with hardness laden ix brine the authors demonstrated that more than 99 of caco3 was precipitated with a ph adjustment to 11 and the remaining ix brine loaded with sodium chloride could be reused for the regeneration of cix resins furthermore vanoppen et al 2016 demonstrated the possibility of directly using an ro brine to regenerate a cix filter with minor addition of nacl 2 5 g l however despite being economical this method is only suitable for situations where cix and ro systems simultaneously exist in the treatment process such as at a seawater desalination plant where cix is implemented prior to ro to remove hardness resource recovery by hybrid processes numerous treatment strategies have sought to recover valuable resources from hardness laden ix brine birnhack et al 2019 successfully applied a hybrid process consisting of nanofiltration nf dia nf and ro to recover potassium salt from a kcl brine gryta et al 2005 investigated the use of membrane distillation md to recover nacl from brine however they found that md performance was deteriorated due to fouling e g ca mg and si and the separation of nacl from the salt mixture was a challenge micari et al 2019a successfully extracted a pure nacl solution from the softener brine using a treatment train of nf crystallization and multi effect distillation med a techno economic assessment was conducted for the treatment train micari et al 2019a as well as the med process micari et al 2019b the authors reported that 1 the lowest treatment cost of 4 9 usd m3 brine could be achieved with an nf recovery rate of 25 2 the evaporator is the most important contributor to the process operating cost 30 of total cost and 3 plane multi effect distillation med without the use of a thermo compressor supplied with recycled heat at a pressure of 1 bar was the most economical way to operate the evaporator furthermore eutectic crystallization has been proposed as an alternative to evaporative crystallization for salt recovery from ix brine because it consumes 6 7 times less energy than evaporative crystallization van der ham et al 1998 lewis et al 2010 fernandez torres et al 2012 in a laboratory scale study cob et al 2014 investigated the use of eutectic crystallization to treat softener brine the authors were able to obtain ice and nacl crystals by lowering the temperature to 29 4 c additionally the authors concluded that a powerful scraping system was needed to avoid scaling caused by ice more recently a feasibility study was conducted by ahmad et al 2017 to investigate the potential of eutectic crystallization for the treatment of softener brine the authors reported that the presence of impurities e g ca and mg lowered the eutectic temperature for nacl crystallization but reduced scaling in the reactor which improved the efficiency of energy transfer from an economic point of view they concluded that eutectic crystallization led to a similar cost compared to evaporative crystallization due to its high capitalization costs 4 1 2 7 treatment strategies for arsenic laden brine coagulation and adsorption coagulation is a viable approach for removing arsenic from ix brine clifford et al 2003 successfully used fecl3 to remove arsenic as from ix brine and the authors reported that arsenic removal depends on the initial arsenic concentration ph of the brine and fe as ratio applied an et al 2005 also used fecl3 to remove arsenic from ix brine and the treated brine was reused for regeneration without any decline in the performance of ix pakzadeh and batista 2011b simulated the arsenic removal process in ix brine using a surface complexation model and found that alkalinity and ionic strength are expected to affect the efficiency of fecl3 in addition to coagulation an et al 2011 developed starch bridged magnetite nanoparticles to adsorb arsenic from the brine the authors concluded that arsenic was fully eliminated under optimal conditions fe as ratio 7 6 contact time 1 h nevertheless the method was only demonstrated with a synthetic brine 300 mg l as with 6 nacl w w its performance using a real ix brine and the cost of application at an industrial scale remains unknown 4 1 2 8 treatment strategies for chrome laden brine reduction coagulation filtration regarding the treatment of chromium vi loaded with ix brine a reduction coagulation filtration process is widely used with many reactants that have been evaluated for such applications including sulfite in acidic conditions siegel and clifford 1988 ferrous iron siegel and clifford 1988 li et al 2016b homan et al 2018 plummer et al 2018 hydrazine siegel and clifford 1988 polysulfides pakzadeh and batista 2011a plummer et al 2018 bisulfite and stannous sulfide plummer et al 2018 among them ferrous iron has been shown to be the most cost effective siegel and clifford 1988 plummer et al 2018 though it does not work in a bicarbonate brine homan et al 2018 4 1 2 9 treatment strategies for nom laden brine coagulation and adsorption coagulation has been proven to be an efficient method for removing nom from ix brine for example verdickt et al 2011 used fecl3 and post filtration to purify the brine before reuse subsequent to the adjustment of conductivity and ph i e adding nacl naoh the recycled brine was successfully reused 14 times with little impact on the ix performance similarly medina et al 2018 investigated the use of alum as a coagulant for nom removal in the brine although the treatment enabled three reuse cycles the authors observed that the regeneration efficiency was lower than that of brine direct reuse because of the introduction of sulfate ions from alum which are strong competitors to nom on ix resins instead of using coagulants zhang et al 2019 proposed using powdered activated carbon pac 5 g l to adsorb dissolved organic matter dom in ix brine after every 6 7 service cycles the treatment allowed a dom removal of approximately 80 in the brine and the brine was successfully reused for 50 service cycles however the pac must be filtered out from the solution prior to reusing the treated brine which makes this option more complex overall the practice of coagulation or pac adsorption is feasible for ix brine laden with nom but the requirement of post filtration the concern over other inorganic ion accumulation in the brine e g sulfate and the disposal of sludge or saturated media still need careful consideration resource recovery by thermal and or electrodialysis processes numerous studies have sought to recover nom and or salt from ix brine for reuse vaudevire et al 2013 evaluated the dynamic vapor recompression dvr process to recover salts from nf concentrated ix brine the authors reported the co precipitation of nacl na2co3 and na2so4 when the concentration factor exceeded 10 however the authors also noted that it was impossible to separate nacl from the salt mixture kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 first demonstrated the feasibility of using electrodialysis ed to recover nacl from a synthetic ix brine although a fraction of nom was shown to pass through the ix membrane and contaminate the recycled nacl solution vaudevire et al 2019 demonstrated a two step ed process to recover nom and nacl solutions the first stage consisted of recovering nacl using a selective monovalent aix membrane while the second stage consisted of separating multivalent anions from the solution loaded with nom by a standard ix membrane haddad et al 2019 compared the performance of conventional and selective monovalent ix ed membranes the results showed that selective monovalent ix membranes could recover nacl of high purity with an energy requirement of approximately 2 kwh kg nacl in addition the authors also tested the use of a pulsed electric field to intensify the separation and reduce membrane fouling but the benefit was only noted for the conventional ix membrane more recently haddad et al 2021 combined ed with membrane distillation md and they demonstrated that md was a viable option to concentrate the purified nacl produced by ed overall ed is a promising technique for nom laden brine treatment but its application is currently hindered by the capitalization costs of the equipment and the fact that the treated brine still requires a post concentration step to raise the concentration of nacl to the required level for the regeneration i e 8 12 w w resource recovery by membranes processes numerous studies have sought to use membrane processes to recover resources from nom laden ix brine wadley et al 1995 successfully applied nf to recover nacl from an ix brine generated from a decolorization process kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 evaluated six ultrafiltration membranes uf and two nf membranes to recover nacl from a nom laden brine and the results demonstrated that tight uf 5 kda and nf were capable of providing a permeate i e nacl solution of satisfactory quality however nom fouling was an important issue because the high salinity imposed an extremely high operating pressure 120 bar more recently caltran et al 2020 demonstrated that ceramic nf yielded less fouling than polymeric nf during the separation of nom from ix brine however the poor rejection of sulfate especially at high ionic strength is problematic given that sulfate may lower the performance of aix during the following service cycles overall using membrane processes to recover salt and nom from ix brine is a promising process and deserves further study 4 1 2 10 treatment strategies for trace organic pollutants laden brine electrochemical processes few studies have investigated the treatment strategies for pfas in ix brine schaefer et al 2020 reported that pfas laden ix brine is amenable to electrochemical treatment using boron doped diamond anodes but the treatment performance depends on the fresh regenerant type chloride regenerant inhibits the electrochemical treatment of pfas as chloride will also be oxidized at the anodes to perchlorate singh et al 2020 successfully degraded pfas precursors and long and short chain pfass from ix brine using a sequential plasma reactor indicating that plasma treatment is promising for pfas treatment from ix brine resource recovery organic solvents such as methanol and ethanol can be used to regenerate pfas laden resins with or without the addition of inorganic salts dixit et al 2021 the organic solvent can be recovered by distillation and reused for the next regeneration cycle singh et al 2020 one should note that such a strategy is only applicable for industrial applications where the presence of a solvent residue in treated water is not causing any health concern furthermore the feasibility and sustainability of this strategy also remain to be evaluated at full scale 4 1 2 11 treatment strategies for nitrate and perchlorate laden brine the treatment strategies for nitrate and perchlorate are similar that is the contaminants are chemically or biologically reduced to reduced forms so that the brine can be reused for the following cycles catalytic reduction catalytic reduction is a technique that has received considerable attention for this subject pintar et al 2001 first developed a catalyst pd cu γ al2o3 that successfully treated a nitrate loaded brine using h2 as an electron donor in their subsequent study pintar and batista 2006 they modified the process into a two stage treatment where the first stage was dedicated to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite with the help of pd cu γ al2o3 and the second stage reduced nitrite to nitrogen gas using the monometallic catalyst pd γ al2o3 this process reduced the production of ammonium compared to the prior designs similarly liu et al 2013 proposed a two step process to treat an ix brine loaded with nitrate and perchlorate nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas in the first stage while perchlorate was reduced to chloride using a re pd c catalyst more recently another catalyst has been successfully developed by synthesizing palladium and indium on activated carbon pd in c to reduce nitrate in ix brine choe et al 2015 meanwhile numerous reactor configurations have been proposed to increase the stability and the performance of catalytic reduction such as batch reactors choe et al 2015 fixed bed column reactors choe et al 2015 bergquist et al 2016 and trickle bed reactors bergquist et al 2017 in addition yang et al 2013 investigated the feasibility of photocatalytic reduction using tio2 as a catalyst and formic acid as an electron donor for the treatment of nitrate in ix brine they observed that the presence of sulfate in the brine is the dominant factor preventing the treatment that is there exists a competition between sulfate and nitrate on tio2 sites overall despite being feasible catalytic reduction is usually complicated to operate and a long term techno economic analysis of these processes is still lacking zero valent iron nanoparticles zero valent iron nanoparticles fe0 are capable of reducing nitrate choe et al 2000 and perchlorate moore et al 2003 to their reduced forms however the small size of the nanoparticles 1 100 nm promoted their agglomeration and thus reduced their reactivity to resolve this problem he and zhao 2005 and he et al 2007 proposed modifying the nanoparticles using soluble starch or carboxymethyl sodium cellulose cmc as stabilizers these stabilizers can increase the specific surface area physical stability and the reaction kinetics of fe0 nanoparticles in subsequent studies researchers demonstrated the feasibility of using stabilized fe0 to degrade nitrate xiong et al 2007 and perchlorate xiong et al 2009 in an ix brine even though the reaction rates were limited when the nacl concentration exceeded 60 g l further studies are needed to resolve the complex issue of the recovery and the disposal of nanoparticles before real application electrolysis some studies have assessed electrolysis as an alternative to remove nitrate from ix brine paidar et al 2004 developed an electrolysis reactor where a simulated bicarbonate brine was circulated in inert media with titanium ti as the anode and copper cu as the cathode subsequent to the reduction of nitrate to ammonium and oxygen at the cathode cu the treated brine was successfully reused for the regeneration of ix resins in another study dortsiou et al 2009 compared tin sn and bismuth bi as cathodes for the electrolysis treatment of a simulated bicarbonate brine while using platinum anode in both cases the authors reported that the type of cathode electrode had an impact on the final reduction products for nitrate the final reduction products of nitrate were mostly nitrogen gas 47 and nitrous oxide 41 when sn was used as the cathode while only 28 of nitrogen gas and 39 ammonium was produced when bi was used as the cathode more recently duan et al 2020 used an electrolysis system to treat chloride brine using iron fe as cathode and iro2 ruo2 ti as anode they found that ammonium generated by the reduction of nitrate was oxidized to nitrogen gas due to the presence of chlorine i e breakpoint chlorination a by product generated during the electrolysis of chloride at the anode overall electrolysis is an appealing technology for the treatment of nitrate laden ix brine future investigations should assess the scale up cost and the sustainability of this method for brine treatment biodegradation biodegradation allows the removal of nitrate van der hoek and klapwijk 1989 and perchlorate logan et al 2001 from ix brine the greatest challenge of this method is related to the high salinity of the brine which inhibits bacterial growth to solve this problem halophilic bacterial communities have been isolated from various high salinity environments such as seawater marine sediments salt marshes and biofilm sludge from a seawater filter logan et al 2001 okeke et al 2002 cang et al 2004 these strains were then enriched in the laboratory and acclimated to the brine environment given that biodegradation is a redox process some reactions may benefit from the addition of an electron donor such as methanol clifford and liu 1993 ethanol mcadam et al 2010 acetate lehman et al 2008 lactate and glycerol peyton et al 2001 of which the treatment efficiency depends on the ph and salinity the addition of these electron donors complicates the reuse of brine for drinking water applications due to carry over concerns several reactor configurations have been tested with varying degrees of success for the treatment of nitrate perchlorate or the simultaneous removal of these two substances such as an upflow sludge blanket van der hoek and klapwijk 1989 a sequential batch

with h2 as the electron donor chung et al 2007 sahu et al 2009 to optimize biological treatment lin et al 2007 reported that the addition of divalent cations ca2 mg2 stabilizes the bacterial culture and promotes perchlorate biodegradation li et al 2015 suggested using a mixture of bicarbonate and chloride regenerants to increase the alkalinity of the brine which would stabilize the denitrification process two groups of investigators also demonstrated the possibility of encapsulating bacteria trogl et al 2011 or enzymes hutchison et al 2013 to protect them from high salinity while allowing the degradation of nitrate and perchlorate in the brine so far these methods have only been demonstrated at the lab scale overall biodegradation is a promising process for the treatment of nitrate and or perchlorate laden ix brine hybrid processes finally hybrid processes were tested to remove nitrate and other impurities to improve the regeneration efficiency of the recycled brine bae et al 2002 tested a treatment system consisting of biological denitrification biological reduction of sulfate sand filtration and granular activated carbon gac filtration the brine was reused for 24 times with a performance comparable to that of the fresh brine later the authors suggested using precipitation and coagulation with bacl2 and fecl3 to replace the biological sulfate reduction process bae et al 2004 and the brine was reused for 11 times with success klas et al 2015 applied a sequential batch denitrification bioreactor followed by ozonation for suspended solids and doc removal the system operated reliably for over a year and achieved steady performance resource recovery few studies have investigated the feasibility of resource recovery from nitrate and perchlorate laden ix brine vaudevire et al 2013 investigated the use of dynamic vapor recompression dvr to recover salts from denitrified ix brine but failed to separate nacl from the salt mixture huo et al 2020 successfully used a hybrid hydrogenation md process to treat an ix brine containing a high concentration of nitrate briefly nitrate was first reduced to ammonia in the presence of a low cost catalyst ru c and the ammonia was then recovered by md as nh4 2so4 which is a valuable commercial fertilizer 4 2 ion exchange brine disposal although brine reuse is beneficial for ix brine management brine disposal is still a common management solution especially for the cases where 1 ix brine reuse is neither possible or economically viable e g small scale communities or 2 recycled brine reaches its end of life and the disposal of such brine is inevitable the choice of disposal strategy is site specific depending on costs volume of brine level of treatment required before release physicochemical characteristics of brine local hydrogeological conditions public acceptability and local regulations jensen and darby 2016 4 2 1 direct disposal direct disposal to a nearby surface water body is a simple and economical measure however this option can only be considered when no harmful contaminants are present in the brine e g arsenic laden brine mitigation measures should be considered before disposal such as the use of diffusers mixing systems or mixing zones to dilute the brine so that the discharge of brine may conform to local discharge criteria e g for chloride on site evaporation ponds are a suitable alternative for the disposal of ix brine briefly when the water evaporates due to solar heat and the wind effect in the pond the solutes in the brine precipitate at the bottom of the pond and this precipitate i e saline sludge must be periodically recovered and transported elsewhere e g landfill an improved design namely the salinity gradient solar pond has been proposed tinos and culligan 2012 for the disposal of desalination brine however the feasibility of ix brine still needs investigation in all cases building a pond is affordable when the land is available and the operation requires little maintenance jensen and darby 2016 demonstrated that the on site evaporation ponds are the cheapest solution in california among the four strategies studied when the system capacity is greater than 8 m3 h 35 gpm however it should be noted that this technique is only suitable for arid or semi arid regions where local climatic conditions are favorable e g low humidity and high rate of evaporation a popular alternative is to discharge the ix brine into sewerage systems this is particularly feasible for small water treatment facilities however brine dilution and ph adjustment are usually necessary prior to discharge to minimize the harmful impacts on water pipes as well as on the biological processes used by wastewater treatment plants rokicki and boyer 2011 liu et al 2013 for remote areas where sewer systems are not available transportation of ix brine to the wastewater treatment plant can be an economical option jensen and darby 2016 reported that transportation to a coastal wastewater treatment plant is the cheapest option when the water treatment plant has a design capacity lower than 8 m3 h 35 gpm injecting ix brine into deep aquifers 500 1500 m isolated from freshwater aquifers is suitable for inland sites however the use of this measure strongly depends on the local geological conditions e g the existence of a confined aquifer the transmissivity of the soil brine characteristics and public perception jensen and darby 2016 as well as having high costs and potential risk of groundwater contamination therefore this option is hardly realistic for small systems and this measure is an alternative for large systems when other solutions are not available finally land application in agricultural fields parks or golf courses is a potential option to dispose of ix brine especially when the brine contains beneficial nutrients such as potassium nom and nitrate however dilution with fresh water is certainly necessary prior to land application to mitigate the detrimental impact arising from high salt concentrations making this solution less attractive compared to other methods overall although direct disposal methods are simple to put in place the adverse impacts of the high salinity and harmful contaminants on the aquatic ecosystem should be fully considered before disposal treatment strategies and or dilution strategies should be considered before disposal to lower the potential negative impacts on ecosystems 4 2 2 treatment strategies for disposal fewer treatment strategies have been tested for direct disposal compared to reuse most studies have been devoted to reducing the volume of ix brine to favor the transportation to begin with nf processes have been sought to reduce the brine volume and numerous studies have demonstrated that nf can reduce the brine volume by up to 85 90 prior to its disposal depending on the operating conditions schippers et al 2004 cartier et al 1997 salehi et al 2011 korak et al 2018 however membrane fouling remains an important challenge for nf processes to alleviate this issue leong et al 2016 successfully coupled nf with a vibratory shear system to reduce the deposition of solutes on the surface of the membrane furthermore ghasemipanah 2013 successfully used ro to recover water from ix brine for irrigation purposes while reducing the brine volume arias paić and korak 2020 proposed using forward osmosis fo as an alternative to ro and nf to concentrate the brine prior to disposal briefly as the presence of a salt saturator in ix plants offers a source of chemical potential for fo ix brine can be concentrated by the saturated salt solution consequently the authors reported that fo could reduce the brine volume by 65 85 in addition to membrane processes evaporation crystallization can be used to further concentrate the brine demonstrating the possibility of zero liquid discharge for ix brine management vaudevire et al 2013 5 discussion and conclusions ion exchange ix with synthetic resins is a flexible simple to operate and cost efficient technology that can cope with a wide range of contaminants however ix brine arising from the regeneration of ix resins is still a limiting factor and the management of such by products has become a real bottleneck for the application of ix resins in the water treatment sector currently ix plant designs mainly consist of operational parameter calculations e g flow rate bed volume and running time and a proper brine management strategy is often overlooked during the ix plant design phase consequently it is of paramount importance to integrate ix operational strategies as well as brine management schemes in ix plant design to make the process more sustainable although it is easy to design an ix system based on the source water characteristics defining an optimal ix brine strategy requires treatability or pilot studies a cost that is too often difficult to justify for small projects in our opinion it would be desirable for legislators to force designers to address the issue of ix brine management many solutions reviewed e g switching from nacl to nahco3 involve higher operating costs but had much lower potential environmental impacts but it is doubtful that the industry will adopt greener alternatives unless it is required by regulation or otherwise promoted based on the ix operational strategies and ix brine management reviewed in the present paper a novel design workflow for ix plants is proposed as follows fig 1 first ix operational strategies that facilitate the management of the ix brine should be considered when choosing the resin during the design phase one should select a resin that works as efficiently as possible for the intended purpose this requires stakeholders to test different resins from different manufacturers for the same application and to choose the most efficient one second when designing the cycle length if the ix process is used for nom removal one could consider operating ix resins in biological mode biex which can fully exploit the ix capacity for nom removal and reduce the regeneration frequency third during the regeneration phases segmented regeneration has been shown to largely reduce the brine volume and its investigation is encouraged especially for chromium and nitrate removal on the other hand despite being promising chemical free regeneration i e biological electrolytic and thermal methods is still under development and more studies are needed to test the feasibility of full scale applications finally alternative regenerants such as bicarbonate salts for aix resins and potassium salts for cix resins are also encouraged to reduce the environmental impact subsequent to determining the regeneration strategy a regeneration pretest in the lab or at a pilot scale is strongly suggested to characterize the ix brine this practice would benefit the ix brine management strategy design in the following way 1 direct reuse of ix brine could be evaluated 2 treatment methods could be designed if brine direct reuse is not feasible it is worth noting that direct reuse of ix brine is the most economically beneficial approach due to its savings on water salt usage as well as operation and maintenance o m costs as long as regeneration efficiency and treatment performance are not affected ix brine treatment prior to reuse certainly increases capital costs but the reduction in salt and water consumption lowers the o m costs lehman et al 2008 nonetheless non monetary factors should also be considered when choosing the best treatment method such as process maturity operational complexity process footprint and contamination of ix vessels plummer et al 2018 overall although ix brine treatment followed by reuse for ix resin regeneration is potentially viable it is still necessary to design the treatment scheme on a case by case basis considering the local regulations and conditions ix brine disposal is still the main option for cases where 1 brine reuse strategies are not economically feasible or 2 the reused brine has reached its end of life the brine disposal methods depend on cost brine volume brine characteristics local hydrogeological conditions climate conditions public acceptability and local regulations treatment methods e g membrane or evaporation are available to reduce the brine volume or even achieve zero liquid discharge overall this review provides a vast list of options to mitigate the adverse impacts of ix brine on the environment engineers and legislators are encouraged to proactively consider these novel ideas which will help reduce the environmental footprint of ix systems declaration of competing interest the authors

16576,anaerobic digestion is the most commonly used sludge treatment technology in large scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps generating two main products i e biogas and anaerobically digested ad sludge biogas can be used as a source of renewable energy and ad sludge is often transported for agricultural land application land application of ad sludge is confronted with ever increasing economic and regulatory pressures due to its high water content high organic content and related odour and pathogen content if poorly stabilized as well as potential toxic metal and organic contaminants to address these challenges a number of technologies have been developed for the further treatment of ad sludge before final disposal this review aims to critically evaluate these state of the art technologies these technologies were categorized based on their primary aims 1 dewaterability enhancement 2 solids reduction and stabilization 3 toxic metals removal at present the goal of post treatment mainly focuses on dewaterability enhancement to reduce transport costs in future we propose that the post treatment of ad sludge should orient towards multiple aims i e an integrated approach enabling sludge volume reduction stabilization including pathogen removal and metal solubilization simultaneously two promising technical routes are suggested as examples i e physio chemical iron based advanced oxidation and biological acidic aerobic digestion while more approaches need to be developed in future studies we concluded that post treatment of ad sludge will promote the ad sludge management towards a more economically favourable socially acceptable and environmentally sustainable way however further development and rigorous evaluation are required for a wider adoption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobically digested sludge dewaterability solids reduction stabilization toxic metals removal 1 introduction the domestic wastewater treatment process removes particulates organic compounds pathogens and nutrients from sewage through physical chemical and biological approaches generating two main products treated water and sewage sludge the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge incurs up to 60 of the overall expenditures with transport costs generally dominating murthy et al 2006 among sludge treatment technologies anaerobic digestion is the most commonly adopted one in large scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps anaerobic digestion process stabilizes sludge reduces organic compounds and recovers bioenergy in the form of biogas ahring 2003 gujer and zehnder 1983 parkin and owen 1986 apart from biogas anaerobic digestion also produces a large amount of anaerobically digested ad sludge ad sludge is widely used for land application serving to improve soil water retention capability increase organics and supplement nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus beck et al 1996 epstein 1975 nevertheless the land application of ad sludge is under increasing economic pressure mainly deriving from high transportation costs to reduce transportation cost ad sludge can be dewatered to reduce sludge volume dewatering process separates solid and liquid via vacuum pressure filtration belt filtration centrifugation through which dry solids of the sludge can be increased from 2 3 to 20 30 novak 2006 wu et al 2020 through dewatering the sludge volume can be dramatically reduced by 90 hereby saving transportation costs in addition the sludge disposal costs can also be reduced through improving the quality of ad sludge without thermal pre treatment mesophilic ad sludge normally is graded as pathogen class b i e biologically stable but with odour potential and pathogens present which does not allow for unrestricted public contact us environmental protection agency 1993 compared to class b class a biosolids can be used for unrestricted agricultural reuse and public contact alvarez campos and evanylo 2019a alvarez campos and evanylo 2019b class a biosolids are sold to the public as fertilisers mainly for lawn use e g dc water s bloom milwaukee s milorganite which allows for cost recovery for the treatment operator kinter and brower 2018 therefore the economic pressures of ad sludge disposal can be eased by both enhancing dewaterability which reduces transportation costs and improving stabilization level from class b to a which potentially bring revenues from fertilisers sales the land application of ad sludge is also subject to regulatory control of chemical contaminants anaerobic digestion process does not remove metal contaminants and indeed concentrates many metals in sludge through sulfide metal precipitation zhang et al 2017 anaerobic sludge with high metals levels can contaminate groundwater reduce plant yield cause environmental contamination and accumulate in the food chain if ingested as such metals levels are highly regulated by environmental authorities particularly the levels of zinc and copper the contents of regulated metals limit the application of biosolids for agricultural reuse in terms of the application rate crop types operator competence and registration and application zones us epa australian biosolids guidelines eea historically the metal issue has been managed by source control of contaminant levels into the treatment plant rizzardini and goi 2014 but it would also be beneficial to remove metals in the treatment process rather than effectively concentrating them in view of these potential issues a number of technologies have been developed for further treatment of ad sludge before disposal the development of these technologies was mainly driven by three distinct incentives i e dewaterability enhancement further mass reduction and stabilization and regulated metals removal with the rapidly growing number of publications in this field a comprehensive review is needed to critically review and evaluate these newly developed technologies which is required to support the technological development and guide further research directions therefore this study aims to review the state of the art advances in ad sludge treatment as well as to provide perspectives for the on going development of ad sludge treatment technologies 2 current status of ad sludge post treatment in wwtps ad sludge firstly goes through dewatering process to separate the liquid and solid fractions the liquid fraction is returned to the head of wwtp and treated together with sewage or treated separately while the solid fraction is transported for land application or other final disposal destinations post ad treatment is a process between the anaerobic digestion and dewatering aiming at either further enhancing dewaterability reducing organic carbon or removing metal 2 1 technologies for improving the dewaterability 2 1 1 mechanisms of dewaterability enhancement an improvement in dewaterability can be achieved by altering sludge properties encompassing physical chemical and biological properties fig 1 physical properties include morphology hydrophobicity rheology fractal dimension particle size and zeta potential the variation in physical properties of ad sludge is the mostly considered factor underpinning the dewaterability improvement indeed nearly all technologies that improve the dewaterability of ad sludge would alter the physical properties of sludge which makes it a standard parameter to compare the effects of different technologies the chemical properties of the sludge are also closely related to dewaterability including the contents of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the distribution of water types the eps content of sludge has deleterious effects on dewaterability since the macromolecules of eps form gel like structure therefore effective eps destruction can break the gel like structure and significantly improve sludge dewaterability the water in sludge comprises free water interstitial water and bound water kopp and dichtl 2001 2000 in which only free water can be separated via mechanical dewatering process as such the dewaterability can be improved through approaches which convert bound water into free water based on these potential mechanisms various technologies using chemical physical and biological methods have been developed as illustrated in fig 1 2 1 2 chemical conditioning different chemicals have been applied to improve dewaterability of ad sludge which are divided into three categories based on the different underlying mechanisms reactive radical species such as hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 can improve dewaterability by alter the physical properties of ad sludge disrupt eps fractions and even destroy cells to release intracellular water li et al 2019 song et al 2016b wacławek et al 2016 wang et al 2019b xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 common radicals for enhancing dewaterability include hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 the production of hydroxyl radicals in traditional fenton reaction requires an acidic ph of about 3 0 song et al 2016a which could increase the operational costs significantly in comparison the sulfate radicals have a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v a longer lifetime 30 40 μs and wider ph range ph 4 0 9 0 kim et al 2014 making it a favoured option in practice indeed the generation of sulfate radicals could be achieved more easily such as combining persulfate with fe ii or zero valent iron song et al 2016b or merely elevating the reaction temperature wacławek et al 2016 however both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals require external chemical addition which inevitably increases the costs of sludge treatment in addition to hydroxyl and sulfate radicals free nitrous acid fna was also reported to generate reactive nitrogen and oxygen species rns and ros duan et al 2020 these rns and ros can release intracellular substances change eps fractions and alter protein secondary structure thus facilitating the bound water release and enhancing the flocculability and hydrophobicity li et al 2020 nevertheless it is to be noted that sludge is a strongly reducing environment which means that strong oxidizing agents are rapidly removed by reduction with non target organics and metallic species cheng et al 2019 the strongly reducing nature of sludge raises significant challenges to the above methods based on reactive radicals secondly chemicals such as iron aluminum and cationic organic polymers improve dewaterability via facilitating the coagulation and flocculation of ad sludge however this method is usually applied in conjunction with other conditioning methods due to its limited efficiency li et al 2019 song et al 2016b wang et al 2019b xiao et al 2017 for example the addition of fe ii was usually coupled with the generation of reactive species xiao et al 2017 described a two step mechanism for the conditioning method using fe ii peroxymonosulfate 1 sulfate radicals degraded organic compounds in eps transformed bound water into free water and damaged the cell membrane to release intracellular water content 2 fe iii agglomerated smaller particles into larger particles and reduced the repulsive electrostatic interactions similarly wang et al 2018 showed a two step mechanism that included skeleton building through in situ crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate and organic polymer flocculation thirdly the direct dosing of hydrolysis enzymes promotes the degradation of eps by destroying viscous bio flocs thus transforming the bound water to free ayol 2005 dursun et al 2006 enzyme treatment significantly increased the cake solid content from 18 to 27 in laboratory experiments unfortunately the same approach achieved marginal improvement in pilot trials dursun et al 2006 this might be due to the specificity of enzymes which is a major concern considering the complex nature of sludge particulates 2 1 3 physical and biological conditioning physical conditioning methods have been proposed to enhance the dewaterability of ad sludge dohányos et al 2000 murugesan et al 2016 wojciechowska 2005 zhang et al 2018b physical conditioning such as thermal and microwave treatment promotes dewaterability by altering the structure of sludge and eps wu et al 2020 however these methods generally require substantial input of energy alternatively a biological method using microorganisms to improve the dewatering performance was also demonstrated murugesan et al 2016 used an acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans culture to condition ad sludge which led to bio acidification and in situ generation of iron flocculant this biological process can promote the eps disruption and enhance the transformation of bound water to free water through which improve the sludge flocculability 2 2 technologies for enhancing sludge reduction and stabilization sludge reduction and stabilization facilitate economical and safe disposal since the majority of easily biodegradable organic compounds have been degraded in the preceding anaerobic digestion process the residual organics in ad sludge are recalcitrant to biodegradation making further reduction and stabilization extremely challenging existing reduction and stabilization driven technologies for ad sludge can be categorised into physio chemical biological approaches and their combination 2 2 1 physio chemical treatment chemicals such as lime can be directly added into ad sludge for disinfection which biologically stabilizes sludge this is due to the increased temperature ph and the free ammonia fa level in the biosolids which result from the chemical reactions between lime and water brewster et al 2002 the fly ash originating from coal combustion contains calcium sodium and magnesium which creates similar disinfection effects to lime rechcigl 1995 however fly ash requires 20 times the amount of lime to exert a comparable effect on fecal coliforms disinfection bujoczek et al 2000 while the lime and or fly ash additions can improve sludge to a class a level they result in a substantial increase in total sludge produced even lime is dosed at the 10 30 dry weight level besides cao has a significant embedded level of co2 emissions cho et al 2019 high temperatures and pressure as well as strong oxidants can be utilized for sludge reduction and stabilization by destroying the recalcitrant organics and or pathogens for example wet air oxidation destroys 80 90 of vs in ad sludge and effectively inactivates pathogens by increasing the temperatures 120 350 c under high pressures 1 10 mpa wu et al 1987 friedman et al 1988 advanced thermal hydrolysis exploits the synergistic effects of thermal hydrolysis and peroxide abelleira et al 2012 which reduce up to 92 of the organics in ad sludge thermal hydrolysis is also used on dewatered final digestate producing a hydrolysate stream to be recycled to the anaerobic digester which achieved an 87 reduction of final sludge without oxidants svennevik et al 2019 these thermal processes virtually eliminate pathogens and substantially improve dewaterability of ad sludge though they are expensive in terms of capital chemical and or energy 2 2 2 biological treatment biological treatment is generally economically competitive over the physio chemical approaches the biological post treatment of ad sludge can be conducted in anaerobic or aerobic conditions further anaerobic treatment of ad sludge only results in marginal improvement of stabilization or sludge reduction ge et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 considering ad sludge has been anaerobically digested through a competent process hence aerobic post treatment of ad sludge has been considered to be a better option for further solids reduction most aerobic post treatment processes were conducted under room temperatures or mesophilic conditions with solids retention time srt of 3 6 d kumar et al 2014 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008 tomei et al 2011b with a short srt the footprint of the aerobic treatment can be relatively small only about 1 5 to 1 3 of the size of anaerobic digester with a typical srt above 15 d mesophilic 30 c aerobic treatment with srt as short as 3 d was able to reduce vs of ad sludge by 10 kumar et al 2006 a full scale mesophilic 36 c process with srt of 6 d led to 16 vs destruction parravicini et al 2008 the vs destruction in the aerobic post treatment mainly arises from the reduction of organics which are aerobically degradable yet not anaerobically degradable the aerobic post treatment also enhances the stability of ad sludge mesophilic aerobic digestion with srt of 8 d reduced the specific oxygen uptake rate sour by 70 2 li et al 2016 similarly mesophilic aerobic digestion with srt of 12 d reduced 1 99 0 22 log of pathogens in terms of e coli tomei et al 2016a additionally aerobic post treatment of ad sludge could also improve nitrogen removal and sludge dewaterability complete nitrification is expected in most aerobic treatment with the majority of ammonium 70 being oxidized kumar et al 2006 li et al 2016 intermittent aeration with dissolved oxygen do controlled promotes denitrification which achieved a total nitrogen removal efficiency between 40 and 60 tomei et al 2016b it was reported that aerobically treated ad sludge required less total polymer for dewatering than the raw ad sludge mainly due to the reduced solids concentration subramanian et al 2007 tomei et al 2016a 2011a increasing temperatures enhances the sludge reduction and nitrogen removal during the aerobic digestion of ad sludge mesophilic temperature 37 c promoted vs destruction from 20 to 32 and ammonium removal form 64 to 99 as compared to the room temperature 20 c tomei et al 2016b thermophilic aerobic post treatment 55 c with srt of 12 d reportedly achieved vs reduction of up to 54 and effectively reduced the relative abundance of human bacterial pathogens from 2 42 to 0 77 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing jang et al 2019 besides more studies are required to identify the impacts of temperature on pathogen removal in aerobic post treatment processes acidic ph 5 aerobic post treatment is a promising alternative at ambient temperature to improve the reduction and stabilization of ad sludge wang et al 2021c the acidic condition was created based on the fact that fna can be sustained in aerobic digestion operated at a natively low ph 5 5 by ammonium oxidation wang et al 2021d duan et al 2019 fed with ad sludge acidic aerobic post treatment unit was operated at 4 8 0 2 with nitrite accumulation of 200 0 17 2 mg n l giving rise to fna of 8 5 1 8 mg n l due to the combined effect of low ph and high fna level the acidic aerobic reactor reduced the vs in the ad sludge by 29 8 4 3 compared with that of 10 4 4 3 in the control reactor operated under neutral ph in addition acidic aerobic digestion reduced the sour from 1 8 0 2 control to 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g vs h and the most probable number mpn of faecal coliforms from 103 6 0 1 control to 102 4 0 1 mpn gts meeting usepa standards for class a biosolids stabilization on sour and indicator organisms this acidic aerobic post treatment approach greatly improve ad sludge management in laboratory scale but needs to be further investigated at demonstration scales 2 2 3 physio chemical of ad sludge coupled with biological treatment due to the poor biodegradability of ad sludge a variety of physio chemical approaches have been proposed to treat ad sludge before biological post treatment physio chemical treatment methods using fna wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 fa wei et al 2018 ultrasound song et al 2017 tian et al 2016 ozone battimelli et al 2003 scheminski et al 2000 alkaline tian et al 2016 or heat sawayama et al 1996 all showed effectiveness in improving the biodegradability of ad sludge i e solubilization the solubilized ad sludge becomes more effectively degraded than raw ad sludge the chemical treatment using fna enhanced the vs destruction in aerobic digestion 4 day batch test to 32 compared to 20 in the control without fna treatment wang et al 2016 similarly fna treatment of ad sludge improved the vs destruction in anaerobic post treatment process 4 day batch test from 5 to 10 zhang et al 2016 ultrasound treatment led to 30 40 of vs destruction in aerobic post treatment process song et al 2017 and thermo treatment through thermochemical liquefaction 175 c 4 mpa significantly promoted vs destruction efficiency in the anaerobic post treatment process 8 d batch test from 27 to 41 sawayama et al 1996 despite the encouraging results of the coupled physio chemical and biological treatment strategies its limitations need to be recognized the physio chemical approaches above were mostly demonstrated in batch wise studies long term continuous operation and larger scale tests need to be conducted to further evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed methods moreover these physio chemical approaches inevitably incur extra energy and chemical costs chemical based methods require the addition of external chemicals e g ammonium nitrite and lime which increase operational costs and nutrient loading to the following biological treatment process ultrasound ozone and heat methods are energy intensive in addition all these physio chemical strategies require an additional unit that incurs capital investments and complicates the process control 2 3 technologies for removing toxic metals contaminants metals in ad sludge predominately exist in the form of precipitates sulfides oxides hydroxides silicates or organic chelate complexes the solubility of precipitates is primarily governed by ph the majority of precipitated metals are solubilized under ph 2 4 such a low ph level is attainable either via chemical or biological approaches known as chemical leaching and bioleaching respectively 2 3 1 chemical leaching chemical leaching uses inorganic acids hcl hno3 h2so4 bayat and sari 2010 or organic acids oxalic acid citric acid marchioretto et al 2002 veeken and hamelers 1999 the commercialized seaborne process is a chemical leaching technology that utilizes sulfuric acid to extract metals from ad sludge and has been applied in some full scale wwtps dichtl et al 2007 for the organically bound metals chelating agents such as ethylene di amine tetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetic acid nta are efficient in the extraction lo and chen 1990 besides fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 were demonstrated to achieve higher extraction efficiencies than anionic acids because the ferric ions can not only acidify the sludge but also oxidize metallic compounds which enhances the metal elution ito et al 2000 strasser et al 1995 despite its high metal solubilization efficiency the practical application of chemical leaching is limited due to high operational costs and potential secondary pollution blais et al 2005 this is because chemical leaching relies on an intensive dosage of chemicals to overcome the alkalinity in ad sludge 2 3 2 bioleaching compared to chemical leaching bioleaching represents an economically favourable and environmentally friendly alternative tyagi et al 1988 bioleaching employs the metabolic activities of acidophilic microorganisms to leach metals from ad sludge narayan and sahana 2009 therefore circumventing the extra costs and secondary pollution arising from external chemical addition 2 3 2 1 sulfur iron and ammonium based bioleaching in ad sludge metal complexing agents include oxides carbonates phosphates silicates and sulfides these compounds can be divided into acid soluble and acid insoluble for acid soluble mineral compounds the bioleaching mechanism is similar to chemical leaching except that the acid is generated via microbial metabolism rather than external chemical dosing generally the microbially acid producing processes are sulfur eq 1 and or iron ii oxidation eq 2 chan et al 2003 jain and tyagi 1992 carried out by autotrophic microorganisms at thiooxidans and at ferrooxidans since both at thiooxidans and at ferrooxidans are acidophilic organisms with an optimal ph at 1 0 3 5 the ph can be microbially driven to around 2 0 as long as sufficient substrate s 0 and f e 2 are provided blais et al 1993 bosecker 1997 kelly and wood 2000 1 s 0 1 5 o 2 h 2 o a t t h i o o x i d a n s o r a t f e r r o o x i d a n s so 4 2 2 h 2 2 f e 2 0 5 o 2 2 h a t f e r r o o x i d a n s 2

can only be broken by redox reactions as shown in eq 3 iron iii ions firstly oxidize the disulfide moiety of mes2 the transformation leads to the cleavage of the bond between metal and sulfur forming metal ions and thiosulfate the thiosulfate is then oxidized to sulfate via multiple intermediate sulfur compounds luther iii 1987 moses et al 1987 3 me s 2 6 f e 3 3 h 2 o 6 f e 2 s 2 o 3 2 6 h m e 2

al 2021b 4 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o this acid generating process was carried out by a newly discovered acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacterium aob candidatus ca nitrosoglobus the ammonium based bioleaching could bear economic advantages over iron and sulfur based bioleaching because high level ammonium is already present in ad sludge therefore no external chemical is needed 2 3 2 2 organic acids based bioleaching bioleaching can also be performed under anaerobic conditions anaerobic bioleaching leverages the volatile fatty acids vfas which are produced via sludge fermentation to leach metals molaey et al 2021 for instance aspergillus niger exploits organic compounds as energy sources and produces a variety of organic acids such as citric oxalic and gluconic acids which have been shown highly effective in solubilizing silicates drever and stillings 1997 duff et al 1963 vandevivere et al 1994 welch and ullman 1993 the lowest ph ph 4 5 of organic acid based bioleaching is higher than that of sulfur and iron based bioleaching processes ph 3 resulting in a relatively lower metal leaching efficiency bosshard et al 1996 muddanna and baral 2019 ren et al 2009 anaerobic bioleaching does not require external chemical addition and is hence economically attractive however the generation of vfas needs readily biodegradable cod which is not available in ad sludge as it has been converted to biogas in the preceding anaerobic digestion process 3 future prospect of ad sludge treatment multiple benefits achieved in an integrated process the abovementioned advanced ad sludge treatment technologies are summarized in table 1 in terms of their effectiveness in dewaterability improvement sludge reduction and stabilization metal solubilization and others e g n removal n p solubilization as shown in table 1 the existing technologies are mainly focused on dewaterability improvement the technologies for dewaterability enhancement mainly utilize physio chemical approaches table 1 however whether those approaches could achieve other parallel aims i e solids reduction stabilization and metal solubilization was rarely investigated and demonstrated likewise ad sludge reduction and stabilization have been successfully achieved in full scale via aerobic digestion parravicini et al 2008 yet the effectiveness of aerobic digestion in enhancing dewaterability and solubilizing metals is still unclear therefore the future ad sludge treatment requires a more balanced approach oriented towards multiple aims simultaneously among the three aims metal solubilization is the least explored field with only lab scale demonstrations so far hence constituting a bottleneck for developing an integrated treatment strategy among the existing treatment technologies we anticipate that physio chemical iron based advanced oxidation and biological acidic aerobic digestion can be two promising technologies with the potential to achieve multiple benefits simultaneously in an integrated process 3 1 physio chemical approach iron based advanced oxidation fenton technique combines h2o2 and fe2 generating highly reactive radicals oh along with the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 masihi and gholikandi 2018 fig 2 a shows how the iron based advanced oxidation could potentially achieve multiple goals simultaneously the reactive radicals can destroy eps structure dai et al 2017 he et al 2017 wang et al 2019a release bound water masihi and gholikandi 2018 zhang et al 2015 oxidize the refractory organic substances nie et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 and inactivate pathogens gholikandi et al 2017 thereby improving the dewaterability and stabilization level of ad sludge the produced fe3 as a coagulate also helps improve the dewaterability meanwhile the fe3 and the resulted low ph facilitate metal solubilization as well fontmorin and sillanpää 2017 2015 rumky et al 2018 although the iron based advanced oxidation bears these potentials no studies has investigated them comprehensively an integrated process using iron based advanced oxidation is needed to achieve dewaterability improvement stabilization and metal removal from ad sludge since the optimal conditions for different aims could vary future studies are expected to optimize the operating conditions e g ph concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 based on multiple criteria assessment in addition a major problem of radicals is that peroxide and oh radicals are rapidly removed by reduction with non target organics and metallic species in the strongly reducing environment of ad sludge cheng et al 2019 it remains to be further investigated whether the specificity of radicals can be improved lastly despite the enormous potential benefits the iron based advanced oxidation may inevitably incur extra costs of external chemical addition as such rigorous cost benefit analysis should be undertaken to assess the economic feasibility of this technology pilot and full scale studies should be further conducted under diverse circumstances 3 2 biological approach acidic aerobic digestion it is well known that aerobic digestion of ad sludge can further reduce the solids concentration and improve the stabilization level yet its effectiveness in dewaterability enhancement and metal solubilization is rarely reported however if aerobic digestion is operated at acidic ph as a low ph is beneficial to improving dewaterability cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 and solubilizing metals it is possible to achieve the three aims at the same time fig 2b in ad sludge three inorganic components i e reduced iron fe2 reduced sulfur s2 and ammonium nh4 can be microbially oxidized which meanwhile produce acid iron salts the most commonly used chemical in a wastewater treatment system are dosed to enhance performance and finally transferred into the anaerobic digester calderon et al 2021 rebosura et al 2018 park and novak 2013 prot et al 2020 during the ad process most of the dosed iron is reduced to fe2 and bonded with s2 in the form of fes during anaerobic digestion roussel and carliell marquet 2016 nh4 is released from sludge as a result of protein hydrolysis during anaerobic digestion conceptually the acids generated by microbial oxidation of fe2 s2 and nh4 can neutralize the alkalinity in ad sludge and lead to acidification in the recent reports by wang et al 2021b and 2021c acidic aerobic digestion of ad sludge was able to decrease ph in ad sludge to 2 the acidification was mainly attributed to microbial ammonium oxidation however the transformation of fe and s during aerobic digestion was not investigated further understanding of fe s transformation would promote the synergy between ammonium and fe s oxidation which allows the acidic aerobic digestion process to be operated at a higher process rate in addition the incorporation of fe s oxidation would introduce more versatility to acidic aerobic digestion process adding to the robustness of the system therefore the integration of ammonium fe s transformation in acidic aerobic digestion system would be of both scientific interests and practical significance while acidic aerobic sludge technology has been proven effective in reducing solids inactivating pathogens wang et al 2021c and solubilizing metals wang et al 2021b the impacts on sludge dewaterability has not been investigated the effect of acidic ph on sludge dewaterability involves contradictory mechanisms on one hand low ph could facilitate the densification and aggregation of sludge flocs by neutralizing negatively charged sludge flocs sheng et al 2010 wei et al 2019 and reducing the repulsive force among flocs cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 on the other hand under acidic conditions ad sludge would release dissolved organic matters such as proteins and polysaccharides and form sticky biopolymers xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2018 both of which can deteriorate dewaterability consequently more future studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between ph and dewaterability based on that it is possible to optimize the dewaterability performance by altering the operating conditions of acidic aerobic digestion process e g srt ph solid concentration etc despite the potential to generate multiple benefits a critical limitation of the acidic microbial ammonium process is the low growth rate of the pivotal microorganism ca nitrosoglobus the net growth rate of ca nitrosoglobus was characterized to be 0 15 d 1 at ph 5 0 wang et al 2021a considering its optimum ph lies in 5 6 the net growth rate at ph 2 0 could be even lower the low growth rate entails a long srt i e 10 days which is coupled to hydraulic retention time hrt in a sludge treatment system long hrt severely limits the capacity of acidic aerobic digestion system as such future studies are expected to increase the capacity e g via cultivating ca nitrosoglobus on carriers through which the srt of ca nitrosoglobus is decoupled from the hrt additionally a rigorous cost benefit analysis of the acidic aerobic digestion process is anticipated in future scaling up studies to assess the economic viability acidic aerobic digestion incurs extra operational expenditures such as aeration costs for maintaining high dissolved oxygen and chemical costs for adjusting the ph back to neutral before land application these extra costs need to be traded off against the benefits of acidic aerobic digestion e g lowered expenditures on sludge transportation and disposal furthermore the acidic aerobic digestion process involving ammonium oxidation potentially emits nitrous oxide n2o which is a potent greenhouse gas however n2o emission has been rarely reported in aerobic post treatment processes where future studies are required 3 3 emerging contaminants removal recently a number of emerging contaminants have raised widespread concerns such as pharmaceutical personal care products ppcps antibiotic resistance genes args microplastics per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfass although these emerging contaminants are not regulated in biosolids they may threaten human and environmental health when biosolids are applied to agricultural lands in particular some emerging contaminants are marginally removed in anaerobic digestion process e g pfas li et al 2021 which means these emerging contaminants remain in ad sludge as such further post treatment is needed to remove them before land application currently the behaviours of emerging contaminants in post treatment processes have not be well studied it was reported that aerobic post treatment removed micropollutants including extractable organic halogens eoxs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and alkylphenolethoxylates tomei et al 2019 ahmad et al 2019 aerobic post treatment also efficiently reduced the abundances of args in ad sludge lin et al 2021 nevertheless in light of the complicated nature and the wide spectrum of emerging contaminants more future studies are anticipated to develop efficient post treatment technologies for removing emerging contaminants from ad sludge 4 conclusions the current convention of ad sludge management i e dewatering followed by land application is confronted with ever increasing economic social and regulatory pressures the issues can be potentially solved via implementing post treatment on ad sludge the existing post treatment technologies are mainly oriented towards three aims namely to enhance dewaterability to reduce solids and stabilize sludge to facilitate metal solubilization the latest advances in achieving the three aims are reviewed and evaluated in this study respectively it was found that current studies predominantly focus on the dewaterability enhancement while overlooking the other two in view of the current status the future ad sludge treatment technologies are prospected to orient towards multiple aims as examples two promising technological routes are proposed and discussed in detail i e iron based advanced oxidation and acidic aerobic digestion the two approaches bear the potentials to achieve the three aims in a single process yet are both confronted with several limitations based on which future studies are suggested for iron based advanced oxidation the appropriate condition needs to be explored to achieve the three goals simultaneously in addition the economic feasibility are to be assessed in up scaling studies for acidic sludge digestion process the dewaterability has never been evaluated before besides increasing capacity and coupling fe s n oxidation are of both fundamental interests and practical significance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this study is sponsored by

16576,anaerobic digestion is the most commonly used sludge treatment technology in large scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps generating two main products i e biogas and anaerobically digested ad sludge biogas can be used as a source of renewable energy and ad sludge is often transported for agricultural land application land application of ad sludge is confronted with ever increasing economic and regulatory pressures due to its high water content high organic content and related odour and pathogen content if poorly stabilized as well as potential toxic metal and organic contaminants to address these challenges a number of technologies have been developed for the further treatment of ad sludge before final disposal this review aims to critically evaluate these state of the art technologies these technologies were categorized based on their primary aims 1 dewaterability enhancement 2 solids reduction and stabilization 3 toxic metals removal at present the goal of post treatment mainly focuses on dewaterability enhancement to reduce transport costs in future we propose that the post treatment of ad sludge should orient towards multiple aims i e an integrated approach enabling sludge volume reduction stabilization including pathogen removal and metal solubilization simultaneously two promising technical routes are suggested as examples i e physio chemical iron based advanced oxidation and biological acidic aerobic digestion while more approaches need to be developed in future studies we concluded that post treatment of ad sludge will promote the ad sludge management towards a more economically favourable socially acceptable and environmentally sustainable way however further development and rigorous evaluation are required for a wider adoption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobically digested sludge dewaterability solids reduction stabilization toxic metals removal 1 introduction the domestic wastewater treatment process removes particulates organic compounds pathogens and nutrients from sewage through physical chemical and biological approaches generating two main products treated water and sewage sludge the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge incurs up to 60 of the overall expenditures with transport costs generally dominating murthy et al 2006 among sludge treatment technologies anaerobic digestion is the most commonly adopted one in large scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps anaerobic digestion process stabilizes sludge reduces organic compounds and recovers bioenergy in the form of biogas ahring 2003 gujer and zehnder 1983 parkin and owen 1986 apart from biogas anaerobic digestion also produces a large amount of anaerobically digested ad sludge ad sludge is widely used for land application serving to improve soil water retention capability increase organics and supplement nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus beck et al 1996 epstein 1975 nevertheless the land application of ad sludge is under increasing economic pressure mainly deriving from high transportation costs to reduce transportation cost ad sludge can be dewatered to reduce sludge volume dewatering process separates solid and liquid via vacuum pressure filtration belt filtration centrifugation through which dry solids of the sludge can be increased from 2 3 to 20 30 novak 2006 wu et al 2020 through dewatering the sludge volume can be dramatically reduced by 90 hereby saving transportation costs in addition the sludge disposal costs can also be reduced through improving the quality of ad sludge without thermal pre treatment mesophilic ad sludge normally is graded as pathogen class b i e biologically stable but with odour potential and pathogens present which does not allow for unrestricted public contact us environmental protection agency 1993 compared to class b class a biosolids can be used for unrestricted agricultural reuse and public contact alvarez campos and evanylo 2019a alvarez campos and evanylo 2019b class a biosolids are sold to the public as fertilisers mainly for lawn use e g dc water s bloom milwaukee s milorganite which allows for cost recovery for the treatment operator kinter and brower 2018 therefore the economic pressures of ad sludge disposal can be eased by both enhancing dewaterability which reduces transportation costs and improving stabilization level from class b to a which potentially bring revenues from fertilisers sales the land application of ad sludge is also subject to regulatory control of chemical contaminants anaerobic digestion process does not remove metal contaminants and indeed concentrates many metals in sludge through sulfide metal precipitation zhang et al 2017 anaerobic sludge with high metals levels can contaminate groundwater reduce plant yield cause environmental contamination and accumulate in the food chain if ingested as such metals levels are highly regulated by environmental authorities particularly the levels of zinc and copper the contents of regulated metals limit the application of biosolids for agricultural reuse in terms of the application rate crop types operator competence and registration and application zones us epa australian biosolids guidelines eea historically the metal issue has been managed by source control of contaminant levels into the treatment plant rizzardini and goi 2014 but it would also be beneficial to remove metals in the treatment process rather than effectively concentrating them in view of these potential issues a number of technologies have been developed for further treatment of ad sludge before disposal the development of these technologies was mainly driven by three distinct incentives i e dewaterability enhancement further mass reduction and stabilization and regulated metals removal with the rapidly growing number of publications in this field a comprehensive review is needed to critically review and evaluate these newly developed technologies which is required to support the technological development and guide further research directions therefore this study aims to review the state of the art advances in ad sludge treatment as well as to provide perspectives for the on going development of ad sludge treatment technologies 2 current status of ad sludge post treatment in wwtps ad sludge firstly goes through dewatering process to separate the liquid and solid fractions the liquid fraction is returned to the head of wwtp and treated together with sewage or treated separately while the solid fraction is transported for land application or other final disposal destinations post ad treatment is a process between the anaerobic digestion and dewatering aiming at either further enhancing dewaterability reducing organic carbon or removing metal 2 1 technologies for improving the dewaterability 2 1 1 mechanisms of dewaterability enhancement an improvement in dewaterability can be achieved by altering sludge properties encompassing physical chemical and biological properties fig 1 physical properties include morphology hydrophobicity rheology fractal dimension particle size and zeta potential the variation in physical properties of ad sludge is the mostly considered factor underpinning the dewaterability improvement indeed nearly all technologies that improve the dewaterability of ad sludge would alter the physical properties of sludge which makes it a standard parameter to compare the effects of different technologies the chemical properties of the sludge are also closely related to dewaterability including the contents of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the distribution of water types the eps content of sludge has deleterious effects on dewaterability since the macromolecules of eps form gel like structure therefore effective eps destruction can break the gel like structure and significantly improve sludge dewaterability the water in sludge comprises free water interstitial water and bound water kopp and dichtl 2001 2000 in which only free water can be separated via mechanical dewatering process as such the dewaterability can be improved through approaches which convert bound water into free water based on these potential mechanisms various technologies using chemical physical and biological methods have been developed as illustrated in fig 1 2 1 2 chemical conditioning different chemicals have been applied to improve dewaterability of ad sludge which are divided into three categories based on the different underlying mechanisms reactive radical species such as hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 can improve dewaterability by alter the physical properties of ad sludge disrupt eps fractions and even destroy cells to release intracellular water li et al 2019 song et al 2016b wacławek et al 2016 wang et al 2019b xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 common radicals for enhancing dewaterability include hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 the production of hydroxyl radicals in traditional fenton reaction requires an acidic ph of about 3 0 song et al 2016a which could increase the operational costs significantly in comparison the sulfate radicals have a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v a longer lifetime 30 40 μs and wider ph range ph 4 0 9 0 kim et al 2014 making it a favoured option in practice indeed the generation of sulfate radicals could be achieved more easily such as combining persulfate with fe ii or zero valent iron song et al 2016b or merely elevating the reaction temperature wacławek et al 2016 however both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals require external chemical addition which inevitably increases the costs of sludge treatment in addition to hydroxyl and sulfate radicals free nitrous acid fna was also reported to generate reactive nitrogen and oxygen species rns and ros duan et al 2020 these rns and ros can release intracellular substances change eps fractions and alter protein secondary structure thus facilitating the bound water release and enhancing the flocculability and hydrophobicity li et al 2020 nevertheless it is to be noted that sludge is a strongly reducing environment which means that strong oxidizing agents are rapidly removed by reduction with non target organics and metallic species cheng et al 2019 the strongly reducing nature of sludge raises significant challenges to the above methods based on reactive radicals secondly chemicals such as iron aluminum and cationic organic polymers improve dewaterability via facilitating the coagulation and flocculation of ad sludge however this method is usually applied in conjunction with other conditioning methods due to its limited efficiency li et al 2019 song et al 2016b wang et al 2019b xiao et al 2017 for example the addition of fe ii was usually coupled with the generation of reactive species xiao et al 2017 described a two step mechanism for the conditioning method using fe ii peroxymonosulfate 1 sulfate radicals degraded organic compounds in eps transformed bound water into free water and damaged the cell membrane to release intracellular water content 2 fe iii agglomerated smaller particles into larger particles and reduced the repulsive electrostatic interactions similarly wang et al 2018 showed a two step mechanism that included skeleton building through in situ crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate and organic polymer flocculation thirdly the direct dosing of hydrolysis enzymes promotes the degradation of eps by destroying viscous bio flocs thus transforming the bound water to free ayol 2005 dursun et al 2006 enzyme treatment significantly increased the cake solid content from 18 to 27 in laboratory experiments unfortunately the same approach achieved marginal improvement in pilot trials dursun et al 2006 this might be due to the specificity of enzymes which is a major concern considering the complex nature of sludge particulates 2 1 3 physical and biological conditioning physical conditioning methods have been proposed to enhance the dewaterability of ad sludge dohányos et al 2000 murugesan et al 2016 wojciechowska 2005 zhang et al 2018b physical conditioning such as thermal and microwave treatment promotes dewaterability by altering the structure of sludge and eps wu et al 2020 however these methods generally require substantial input of energy alternatively a biological method using microorganisms to improve the dewatering performance was also demonstrated murugesan et al 2016 used an acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans culture to condition ad sludge which led to bio acidification and in situ generation of iron flocculant this biological process can promote the eps disruption and enhance the transformation of bound water to free water through which improve the sludge flocculability 2 2 technologies for enhancing sludge reduction and stabilization sludge reduction and stabilization facilitate economical and safe disposal since the majority of easily biodegradable organic compounds have been degraded in the preceding anaerobic digestion process the residual organics in ad sludge are recalcitrant to biodegradation making further reduction and stabilization extremely challenging existing reduction and stabilization driven technologies for ad sludge can be categorised into physio chemical biological approaches and their combination 2 2 1 physio chemical treatment chemicals such as lime can be directly added into ad sludge for disinfection which biologically stabilizes sludge this is due to the increased temperature ph and the free ammonia fa level in the biosolids which result from the chemical reactions between lime and water brewster et al 2002 the fly ash originating from coal combustion contains calcium sodium and magnesium which creates similar disinfection effects to lime rechcigl 1995 however fly ash requires 20 times the amount of lime to exert a comparable effect on fecal coliforms disinfection bujoczek et al 2000 while the lime and or fly ash additions can improve sludge to a class a level they result in a substantial increase in total sludge produced even lime is dosed at the 10 30 dry weight level besides cao has a significant embedded level of co2 emissions cho et al 2019 high temperatures and pressure as well as strong oxidants can be utilized for sludge reduction and stabilization by destroying the recalcitrant organics and or pathogens for example wet air oxidation destroys 80 90 of vs in ad sludge and effectively inactivates pathogens by increasing the temperatures 120 350 c under high pressures 1 10 mpa wu et al 1987 friedman et al 1988 advanced thermal hydrolysis exploits the synergistic effects of thermal hydrolysis and peroxide abelleira et al 2012 which reduce up to 92 of the organics in ad sludge thermal hydrolysis is also used on dewatered final digestate producing a hydrolysate stream to be recycled to the anaerobic digester which achieved an 87 reduction of final sludge without oxidants svennevik et al 2019 these thermal processes virtually eliminate pathogens and substantially improve dewaterability of ad sludge though they are expensive in terms of capital chemical and or energy 2 2 2 biological treatment biological treatment is generally economically competitive over the physio chemical approaches the biological post treatment of ad sludge can be conducted in anaerobic or aerobic conditions further anaerobic treatment of ad sludge only results in marginal improvement of stabilization or sludge reduction ge et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 considering ad sludge has been anaerobically digested through a competent process hence aerobic post treatment of ad sludge has been considered to be a better option for further solids reduction most aerobic post treatment processes were conducted under room temperatures or mesophilic conditions with solids retention time srt of 3 6 d kumar et al 2014 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008 tomei et al 2011b with a short srt the footprint of the aerobic treatment can be relatively small only about 1 5 to 1 3 of the size of anaerobic digester with a typical srt above 15 d mesophilic 30 c aerobic treatment with srt as short as 3 d was able to reduce vs of ad sludge by 10 kumar et al 2006 a full scale mesophilic 36 c process with srt of 6 d led to 16 vs destruction parravicini et al 2008 the vs destruction in the aerobic post treatment mainly arises from the reduction of organics which are aerobically degradable yet not anaerobically degradable the aerobic post treatment also enhances the stability of ad sludge mesophilic aerobic digestion with srt of 8 d reduced the specific oxygen uptake rate sour by 70 2 li et al 2016 similarly mesophilic aerobic digestion with srt of 12 d reduced 1 99 0 22 log of pathogens in terms of e coli tomei et al 2016a additionally aerobic post treatment of ad sludge could also improve nitrogen removal and sludge dewaterability complete nitrification is expected in most aerobic treatment with the majority of ammonium 70 being oxidized kumar et al 2006 li et al 2016 intermittent aeration with dissolved oxygen do controlled promotes denitrification which achieved a total nitrogen removal efficiency between 40 and 60 tomei et al 2016b it was reported that aerobically treated ad sludge required less total polymer for dewatering than the raw ad sludge mainly due to the reduced solids concentration subramanian et al 2007 tomei et al 2016a 2011a increasing temperatures enhances the sludge reduction and nitrogen removal during the aerobic digestion of ad sludge mesophilic temperature 37 c promoted vs destruction from 20 to 32 and ammonium removal form 64 to 99 as compared to the room temperature 20 c tomei et al 2016b thermophilic aerobic post treatment 55 c with srt of 12 d reportedly achieved vs reduction of up to 54 and effectively reduced the relative abundance of human bacterial pathogens from 2 42 to 0 77 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing jang et al 2019 besides more studies are required to identify the impacts of temperature on pathogen removal in aerobic post treatment processes acidic ph 5 aerobic post treatment is a promising alternative at ambient temperature to improve the reduction and stabilization of ad sludge wang et al 2021c the acidic condition was created based on the fact that fna can be sustained in aerobic digestion operated at a natively low ph 5 5 by ammonium oxidation wang et al 2021d duan et al 2019 fed with ad sludge acidic aerobic post treatment unit was operated at 4 8 0 2 with nitrite accumulation of 200 0 17 2 mg n l giving rise to fna of 8 5 1 8 mg n l due to the combined effect of low ph and high fna level the acidic aerobic reactor reduced the vs in the ad sludge by 29 8 4 3 compared with that of 10 4 4 3 in the control reactor operated under neutral ph in addition acidic aerobic digestion reduced the sour from 1 8 0 2 control to 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g vs h and the most probable number mpn of faecal coliforms from 103 6 0 1 control to 102 4 0 1 mpn gts meeting usepa standards for class a biosolids stabilization on sour and indicator organisms this acidic aerobic post treatment approach greatly improve ad sludge management in laboratory scale but needs to be further investigated at demonstration scales 2 2 3 physio chemical of ad sludge coupled with biological treatment due to the poor biodegradability of ad sludge a variety of physio chemical approaches have been proposed to treat ad sludge before biological post treatment physio chemical treatment methods using fna wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 fa wei et al 2018 ultrasound song et al 2017 tian et al 2016 ozone battimelli et al 2003 scheminski et al 2000 alkaline tian et al 2016 or heat sawayama et al 1996 all showed effectiveness in improving the biodegradability of ad sludge i e solubilization the solubilized ad sludge becomes more effectively degraded than raw ad sludge the chemical treatment using fna enhanced the vs destruction in aerobic digestion 4 day batch test to 32 compared to 20 in the control without fna treatment wang et al 2016 similarly fna treatment of ad sludge improved the vs destruction in anaerobic post treatment process 4 day batch test from 5 to 10 zhang et al 2016 ultrasound treatment led to 30 40 of vs destruction in aerobic post treatment process song et al 2017 and thermo treatment through thermochemical liquefaction 175 c 4 mpa significantly promoted vs destruction efficiency in the anaerobic post treatment process 8 d batch test from 27 to 41 sawayama et al 1996 despite the encouraging results of the coupled physio chemical and biological treatment strategies its limitations need to be recognized the physio chemical approaches above were mostly demonstrated in batch wise studies long term continuous operation and larger scale tests need to be conducted to further evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed methods moreover these physio chemical approaches inevitably incur extra energy and chemical costs chemical based methods require the addition of external chemicals e g ammonium nitrite and lime which increase operational costs and nutrient loading to the following biological treatment process ultrasound ozone and heat methods are energy intensive in addition all these physio chemical strategies require an additional unit that incurs capital investments and complicates the process control 2 3 technologies for removing toxic metals contaminants metals in ad sludge predominately exist in the form of precipitates sulfides oxides hydroxides silicates or organic chelate complexes the solubility of precipitates is primarily governed by ph the majority of precipitated metals are solubilized under ph 2 4 such a low ph level is attainable either via chemical or biological approaches known as chemical leaching and bioleaching respectively 2 3 1 chemical leaching chemical leaching uses inorganic acids hcl hno3 h2so4 bayat and sari 2010 or organic acids oxalic acid citric acid marchioretto et al 2002 veeken and hamelers 1999 the commercialized seaborne process is a chemical leaching technology that utilizes sulfuric acid to extract metals from ad sludge and has been applied in some full scale wwtps dichtl et al 2007 for the organically bound metals chelating agents such as ethylene di amine tetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetic acid nta are efficient in the extraction lo and chen 1990 besides fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 were demonstrated to achieve higher extraction efficiencies than anionic acids because the ferric ions can not only acidify the sludge but also oxidize metallic compounds which enhances the metal elution ito et al 2000 strasser et al 1995 despite its high metal solubilization efficiency the practical application of chemical leaching is limited due to high operational costs and potential secondary pollution blais et al 2005 this is because chemical leaching relies on an intensive dosage of chemicals to overcome the alkalinity in ad sludge 2 3 2 bioleaching compared to chemical leaching bioleaching represents an economically favourable and environmentally friendly alternative tyagi et al 1988 bioleaching employs the metabolic activities of acidophilic microorganisms to leach metals from ad sludge narayan and sahana 2009 therefore circumventing the extra costs and secondary pollution arising from external chemical addition 2 3 2 1 sulfur iron and ammonium based bioleaching in ad sludge metal complexing agents include oxides carbonates phosphates silicates and sulfides these compounds can be divided into acid soluble and acid insoluble for acid soluble mineral compounds the bioleaching mechanism is similar to chemical leaching except that the acid is generated via microbial metabolism rather than external chemical dosing generally the microbially acid producing processes are sulfur eq 1 and or iron ii oxidation eq 2 chan et al 2003 jain and tyagi 1992 carried out by autotrophic microorganisms at thiooxidans and at ferrooxidans since both at thiooxidans and at ferrooxidans are acidophilic organisms with an optimal ph at 1 0 3 5 the ph can be microbially driven to around 2 0 as long as sufficient substrate s 0 and f e 2 are provided blais et al 1993 bosecker 1997 kelly and wood 2000 1 s 0 1 5 o 2 h 2 o a t t h i o o x i d a n s o r a t f e r r o o x i d a n s so 4 2 2 h 2 2 f e 2 0 5 o 2 2 h a t f e r r o o x i d a n s 2

can only be broken by redox reactions as shown in eq 3 iron iii ions firstly oxidize the disulfide moiety of mes2 the transformation leads to the cleavage of the bond between metal and sulfur forming metal ions and thiosulfate the thiosulfate is then oxidized to sulfate via multiple intermediate sulfur compounds luther iii 1987 moses et al 1987 3 me s 2 6 f e 3 3 h 2 o 6 f e 2 s 2 o 3 2 6 h m e 2

al 2021b 4 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o this acid generating process was carried out by a newly discovered acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacterium aob candidatus ca nitrosoglobus the ammonium based bioleaching could bear economic advantages over iron and sulfur based bioleaching because high level ammonium is already present in ad sludge therefore no external chemical is needed 2 3 2 2 organic acids based bioleaching bioleaching can also be performed under anaerobic conditions anaerobic bioleaching leverages the volatile fatty acids vfas which are produced via sludge fermentation to leach metals molaey et al 2021 for instance aspergillus niger exploits organic compounds as energy sources and produces a variety of organic acids such as citric oxalic and gluconic acids which have been shown highly effective in solubilizing silicates drever and stillings 1997 duff et al 1963 vandevivere et al 1994 welch and ullman 1993 the lowest ph ph 4 5 of organic acid based bioleaching is higher than that of sulfur and iron based bioleaching processes ph 3 resulting in a relatively lower metal leaching efficiency bosshard et al 1996 muddanna and baral 2019 ren et al 2009 anaerobic bioleaching does not require external chemical addition and is hence economically attractive however the generation of vfas needs readily biodegradable cod which is not available in ad sludge as it has been converted to biogas in the preceding anaerobic digestion process 3 future prospect of ad sludge treatment multiple benefits achieved in an integrated process the abovementioned advanced ad sludge treatment technologies are summarized in table 1 in terms of their effectiveness in dewaterability improvement sludge reduction and stabilization metal solubilization and others e g n removal n p solubilization as shown in table 1 the existing technologies are mainly focused on dewaterability improvement the technologies for dewaterability enhancement mainly utilize physio chemical approaches table 1 however whether those approaches could achieve other parallel aims i e solids reduction stabilization and metal solubilization was rarely investigated and demonstrated likewise ad sludge reduction and stabilization have been successfully achieved in full scale via aerobic digestion parravicini et al 2008 yet the effectiveness of aerobic digestion in enhancing dewaterability and solubilizing metals is still unclear therefore the future ad sludge treatment requires a more balanced approach oriented towards multiple aims simultaneously among the three aims metal solubilization is the least explored field with only lab scale demonstrations so far hence constituting a bottleneck for developing an integrated treatment strategy among the existing treatment technologies we anticipate that physio chemical iron based advanced oxidation and biological acidic aerobic digestion can be two promising technologies with the potential to achieve multiple benefits simultaneously in an integrated process 3 1 physio chemical approach iron based advanced oxidation fenton technique combines h2o2 and fe2 generating highly reactive radicals oh along with the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 masihi and gholikandi 2018 fig 2 a shows how the iron based advanced oxidation could potentially achieve multiple goals simultaneously the reactive radicals can destroy eps structure dai et al 2017 he et al 2017 wang et al 2019a release bound water masihi and gholikandi 2018 zhang et al 2015 oxidize the refractory organic substances nie et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 and inactivate pathogens gholikandi et al 2017 thereby improving the dewaterability and stabilization level of ad sludge the produced fe3 as a coagulate also helps improve the dewaterability meanwhile the fe3 and the resulted low ph facilitate metal solubilization as well fontmorin and sillanpää 2017 2015 rumky et al 2018 although the iron based advanced oxidation bears these potentials no studies has investigated them comprehensively an integrated process using iron based advanced oxidation is needed to achieve dewaterability improvement stabilization and metal removal from ad sludge since the optimal conditions for different aims could vary future studies are expected to optimize the operating conditions e g ph concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 based on multiple criteria assessment in addition a major problem of radicals is that peroxide and oh radicals are rapidly removed by reduction with non target organics and metallic species in the strongly reducing environment of ad sludge cheng et al 2019 it remains to be further investigated whether the specificity of radicals can be improved lastly despite the enormous potential benefits the iron based advanced oxidation may inevitably incur extra costs of external chemical addition as such rigorous cost benefit analysis should be undertaken to assess the economic feasibility of this technology pilot and full scale studies should be further conducted under diverse circumstances 3 2 biological approach acidic aerobic digestion it is well known that aerobic digestion of ad sludge can further reduce the solids concentration and improve the stabilization level yet its effectiveness in dewaterability enhancement and metal solubilization is rarely reported however if aerobic digestion is operated at acidic ph as a low ph is beneficial to improving dewaterability cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 and solubilizing metals it is possible to achieve the three aims at the same time fig 2b in ad sludge three inorganic components i e reduced iron fe2 reduced sulfur s2 and ammonium nh4 can be microbially oxidized which meanwhile produce acid iron salts the most commonly used chemical in a wastewater treatment system are dosed to enhance performance and finally transferred into the anaerobic digester calderon et al 2021 rebosura et al 2018 park and novak 2013 prot et al 2020 during the ad process most of the dosed iron is reduced to fe2 and bonded with s2 in the form of fes during anaerobic digestion roussel and carliell marquet 2016 nh4 is released from sludge as a result of protein hydrolysis during anaerobic digestion conceptually the acids generated by microbial oxidation of fe2 s2 and nh4 can neutralize the alkalinity in ad sludge and lead to acidification in the recent reports by wang et al 2021b and 2021c acidic aerobic digestion of ad sludge was able to decrease ph in ad sludge to 2 the acidification was mainly attributed to microbial ammonium oxidation however the transformation of fe and s during aerobic digestion was not investigated further understanding of fe s transformation would promote the synergy between ammonium and fe s oxidation which allows the acidic aerobic digestion process to be operated at a higher process rate in addition the incorporation of fe s oxidation would introduce more versatility to acidic aerobic digestion process adding to the robustness of the system therefore the integration of ammonium fe s transformation in acidic aerobic digestion system would be of both scientific interests and practical significance while acidic aerobic sludge technology has been proven effective in reducing solids inactivating pathogens wang et al 2021c and solubilizing metals wang et al 2021b the impacts on sludge dewaterability has not been investigated the effect of acidic ph on sludge dewaterability involves contradictory mechanisms on one hand low ph could facilitate the densification and aggregation of sludge flocs by neutralizing negatively charged sludge flocs sheng et al 2010 wei et al 2019 and reducing the repulsive force among flocs cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 on the other hand under acidic conditions ad sludge would release dissolved organic matters such as proteins and polysaccharides and form sticky biopolymers xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2018 both of which can deteriorate dewaterability consequently more future studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between ph and dewaterability based on that it is possible to optimize the dewaterability performance by altering the operating conditions of acidic aerobic digestion process e g srt ph solid concentration etc despite the potential to generate multiple benefits a critical limitation of the acidic microbial ammonium process is the low growth rate of the pivotal microorganism ca nitrosoglobus the net growth rate of ca nitrosoglobus was characterized to be 0 15 d 1 at ph 5 0 wang et al 2021a considering its optimum ph lies in 5 6 the net growth rate at ph 2 0 could be even lower the low growth rate entails a long srt i e 10 days which is coupled to hydraulic retention time hrt in a sludge treatment system long hrt severely limits the capacity of acidic aerobic digestion system as such future studies are expected to increase the capacity e g via cultivating ca nitrosoglobus on carriers through which the srt of ca nitrosoglobus is decoupled from the hrt additionally a rigorous cost benefit analysis of the acidic aerobic digestion process is anticipated in future scaling up studies to assess the economic viability acidic aerobic digestion incurs extra operational expenditures such as aeration costs for maintaining high dissolved oxygen and chemical costs for adjusting the ph back to neutral before land application these extra costs need to be traded off against the benefits of acidic aerobic digestion e g lowered expenditures on sludge transportation and disposal furthermore the acidic aerobic digestion process involving ammonium oxidation potentially emits nitrous oxide n2o which is a potent greenhouse gas however n2o emission has been rarely reported in aerobic post treatment processes where future studies are required 3 3 emerging contaminants removal recently a number of emerging contaminants have raised widespread concerns such as pharmaceutical personal care products ppcps antibiotic resistance genes args microplastics per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfass although these emerging contaminants are not regulated in biosolids they may threaten human and environmental health when biosolids are applied to agricultural lands in particular some emerging contaminants are marginally removed in anaerobic digestion process e g pfas li et al 2021 which means these emerging contaminants remain in ad sludge as such further post treatment is needed to remove them before land application currently the behaviours of emerging contaminants in post treatment processes have not be well studied it was reported that aerobic post treatment removed micropollutants including extractable organic halogens eoxs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and alkylphenolethoxylates tomei et al 2019 ahmad et al 2019 aerobic post treatment also efficiently reduced the abundances of args in ad sludge lin et al 2021 nevertheless in light of the complicated nature and the wide spectrum of emerging contaminants more future studies are anticipated to develop efficient post treatment technologies for removing emerging contaminants from ad sludge 4 conclusions the current convention of ad sludge management i e dewatering followed by land application is confronted with ever increasing economic social and regulatory pressures the issues can be potentially solved via implementing post treatment on ad sludge the existing post treatment technologies are mainly oriented towards three aims namely to enhance dewaterability to reduce solids and stabilize sludge to facilitate metal solubilization the latest advances in achieving the three aims are reviewed and evaluated in this study respectively it was found that current studies predominantly focus on the dewaterability enhancement while overlooking the other two in view of the current status the future ad sludge treatment technologies are prospected to orient towards multiple aims as examples two promising technological routes are proposed and discussed in detail i e iron based advanced oxidation and acidic aerobic digestion the two approaches bear the potentials to achieve the three aims in a single process yet are both confronted with several limitations based on which future studies are suggested for iron based advanced oxidation the appropriate condition needs to be explored to achieve the three goals simultaneously in addition the economic feasibility are to be assessed in up scaling studies for acidic sludge digestion process the dewaterability has never been evaluated before besides increasing capacity and coupling fe s n oxidation are of both fundamental interests and practical significance declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16577,hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid genx has been marketed as a substitute for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa to reduce environmental and health risks genx and pfoa have been detected in various natural water sources and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for pfoa removal in this paper comparisons of genx and pfoa adsorption are evaluated including adsorption potential adsorption mechanisms and associated costs a detailed literature review suggests that anion exchange resins are more effective in removing genx than activated carbon genx removal efficiency through activated carbon 30 is lower than that of pfoa 80 95 while genx and pfoa removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar 99 unconventional adsorbents such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove genx from water the review reveals that genx adsorption is more challenging requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor pfoa annual operation and maintenance costs for genx adsorption initial concentration of genx and pfoa 0 2 µg l 1 by gac for treating 10 000 m3 per day is almost us 1 000 000 per year but only around us 240 000 per year for pfoa desorption of genx in the presence of pfoa highlights genx s inferior treatability by adsorption it is believed that genx is a more environmentally friendly compound than pfoa but this environmental friendliness comes with the price graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated carbon drinking water emerging contaminants remediation technologies water treatment 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been used as water and stain repellents for containers leather and fabrics as well as the main ingredients for firefighting foams and photographic emulsifiers bolan et al 2021 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are the most studied compounds among pfas kim et al 2019 they are chemically stable compounds that have been proven to be bioaccumulative and toxic in humans and fauna chen et al 2021 in 2016 the united states environmental protection agency usepa issued a lifetime health advisory level for combined pfoa and pfos in drinking water and mandated municipalities inform their water customers of levels over 70 ng l 1 boone et al 2019 with reductions in pfos and pfoa c8 production short chain pfas c2 c7 have served as substitutes gewurtz et al 2019 hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid also known as genx c6 was developed as a pfoa substitute by dupont in 2009 due to the usepa s pfoa stewardship program and later trademarked by chemours a dupont spinoff usepa 2019a the massive applications of genx in the industry as a less toxic substitute has increased its importance more than other short chain pfas increased applications of genx in oil repellent coatings have led to higher detections of genx in natural waters near production facilities brandsma et al 2019 gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 a toxicity study suggested that genx has weaker epigenetic toxicity than pfoa with milder symptoms including liver damage while they have similar effects on cell metabolism rates and viability wen et al 2020 the state of north carolina department of health and human services set a 140 ng l 1 non obligatory health advisory on genx in drinking water in 2017 cahoon 2019 the annual production of genx is on the rise and genx is the pfas of the future gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 semerád et al 2020 considering genx as a distinct compound rather than a member of short chain pfas is helpful when addressing the importance of genx the critical distinction between genx and short chain pfas is the ether functional group in genx it is believed that the ether functional group makes genx a more environmentally friendly compound genx shares many similarities with short chain pfas but has significant differences with pfoa including the ether functional group as well as lower chain length less hydrophobicity and more mobility concentrations of short chain pfas in runoff and landfill leachates have increased after the phasing out of long chain pfas masoner et al 2020 xiao et al 2012 decomposition of long chain pfas contributes to short chain pfas detected in water and wastewater treatment systems glover et al 2018 kim et al 2019 genx and short chain pfas share primary analogous attributes with long chain pfas such as c f bonds researchers have tried to apply advanced removal and degradation technologies such as activated carbon ac and self assembled micelle chen et al 2020 murray et al 2019 wang et al 2019a ion exchange dixit et al 2020a zaggia et al 2016 nanofiltration pica et al 2019 reverse osmosis appleman et al 2014 and advanced oxidation ahmed et al 2020 pica et al 2019 to remove or degrade short chain pfas including genx adsorption is the most common treatment method for pfas removal phong vo et al 2020 bolan et al 2021 low cost targeted and non targeted removal through dispersion induction or electrostatic interaction or a combination of these forces are among the features that make adsorption a favorable treatment option for genx and other pfas removal acquiring knowledge solely on genx and its adsorption characteristics is insufficient because genx is mostly found with other pfas especially pfoa in groundwater and other aquatic environments gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 previous reviews on pfas treatment focused on long chain pfas especially pfoa and pfos however long chain pfas reviews lack inclusiveness some covered a single technology while others covered several technologies but only addressed a subset of pfas and did not discuss pfas treatment costs dixit et al 2021b du et al 2014 li et al 2020 merino et al 2016 rahman et al 2014 trojanowicz et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for instance zhang et al 2019 solely focused on the adsorption technologies for removing short chain pfas but not genx later f dixit et al 2021b published the most recent review on pfas exclusively focusing on treatment by ionic exchange resins they focused on comparing various ionic exchange resins for pfas removal along with resin regeneration procedures although the review touched on genx it did not look exclusively at genx this review aims to critically analyze and synthesize currently available knowledge from the published literature on genx adsorption compared with other pfas especially pfoa genx was manufactured as a chemical more susceptible to disintegrate in the environment than pfoa however it is unclear whether genx is a better choice than pfoa in other important aspects such as treatability and the associated cost several questions need to be answered is genx more or less susceptible to adsorption technologies does adsorption of genx cost more than that of pfoa in other words are there prices to pay for genx as a more environmentally friendly substitute for pfoa in this review by analyzing and synthesizing existing study data collected from genx and pfoa adsorption isotherms and kinetics the breakthrough of ac is predicted to showcase the differences in genx and pfoa treatability this review synthesizes the data obtained from the genx isotherm and other pfas to estimate their treatment costs the review covers both traditional and modified adsorbents the efficacy of genx removal is compared to that of pfoa as well as examined with pfoa as a co contaminant the review also utilizes a molecular simulation tool to predict the nature of interactions among genx pfoa ac and anion exchange resins aes it will help determine the nature of interactions between genx and pfoa with ac and functional groups as well as ions present in an ae resin the review also identifies research gaps and recommends future work related to genx adsorption such as using advanced adsorbents and modified traditional adsorbents it serves as a comprehensive reference that addresses both the technical and economic aspects of genx removal from water and wastewater by adsorption 2 granular activated carbon and powdered activated carbon the non polarity nature of ac facilitates the removal of hydrophobic compounds such as genx and other pfas longer chain pfas have more affinity toward granular ac gac than genx and short chain pfas du et al 2015 table 1 provides a summary of the gac and powdered ac pac removal capabilities for genx and pfas it details experimental conditions such as ph equilibrium time and equilibrium adsorption capacity as well as adsorbent and adsorbate characteristics such as adsorbent dosage and initial adsorbate concentration 2 1 kinetics and isotherm of pfas adsorption on ac adsorption kinetic studies describe genx adsorption dynamics and equilibrium contact time pac and gac have different brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas which affect genx uptake for instance wang et al 2019a reported that for treating 0 152 mmol l 1 of genx at ph 4 and 0 1 g l 1 adsorbent dosage pac achieved faster equilibrium than gac but after equilibrium the removal efficiency of genx was similar as listed in table 1 pac offered a higher initial adsorption rate of 0 416 mmol g 1 h 1 in the first 3 h the adsorption data for 96 h followed a pseudo second order model for genx removal pac had a nearly 5 fold higher initial adsorption rate than gac while intra particle diffusion influenced genx uptake to gac it was insufficient to render gac superior to pac the adsorption kinetic differences in pac and gac may be attributed to attainable binding sites and intralayer interaction pfas adsorption by pac and gac followed a pseudo second order model wang et al 2019a indicating chemical adsorption occurs electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobicity are fundamental interactions in genx adsorption by ac according to the non linear fitting curves n 2 genx and pfoa are usually found together in water bodies brandsma et al 2019 gebbink et al 2017 and they compete for available binding sites on an adsorbent wang et al 2019b thus the kinetics of adsorption is limited by the capability of genx and or pfoa to occupy binding sites the dynamics of various adsorption processes are predicted and modeled using adsorption isotherms genx studies have reported adsorption isotherms by langmuir and freundlich models zhang et al 2021 table 1 however other isotherm models such as temkin and bet have not yet been investigated the temkin isotherm model expresses the adsorption thermodynamics it would reveal that the adsorption heat of genx reduces proportional to the occupation of binding sites on the adsorbent thus the temkin model would explain the chemisorption of anionic genx on ac and aes although genx adsorption is dominated by physical adsorption the role of chemical adsorption in genx removal is not insignificant and should be elucidated the bet isotherm model would reveal the type of genx adsorption occurring on the surface of the adsorbent this model would help researchers understand the role of adsorbent composition as well as the temperature and strength of genx interaction with adsorbents on genx removal it would therefore determine how much electrostatic interaction versus hydrophobic interaction plays a role in genx adsorption the adsorption of genx on ac was consistent with both the langmuir and freundlich models r2 0 90 but the langmuir model had a better fit r2 0 98 wang et al 2019a found no difference between gac and pac for genx uptake if all adsorbent binding sites are equally available genx adsorption is non ideal and reversible according to the expressed r2 values and is most likely monolayer adsorption genx uptake by ac under the following experimental conditions 0 1 g l 1 adsorbent dosage ph 4 and initial genx concentration of 0 06 0 91 mmol l 1 for 96 h showed slow surface diffusion on the adsorbent in the first 3 h considering the slow external mass transfer of genx and its monolayer adsorption genx adsorption is homogeneous microscopically even in adsorbents with irregular and amorphous surfaces thus diffusion might be the rate limiting factor in genx adsorption genx adsorption by ac is more physical than chemical additionally the surface of ac is assumed to be homogenous and the assumption is that genx molecules do not collide with each other during adsorption suggesting that monolayer adsorption occurs the energy interaction simulated by conductor like screening model for real solvents cosmo rs below in section 5 confirms that physical adsorption is prevalent in genx uptake by ac in order to have a sound comparison it is important to evaluate the kinetics and isotherms of pfoa versus genx pfoa adsorption on ac follows the pseudo second order model similar to genx adsorption kinetics deng et al 2015 qian et al 2017 xu et al 2020 pfoa adsorption rates were slower than genx and short chain pfas reaching equilibrium on gac after at least 168 h while pac reached equilibrium in 4 h because of the higher surface area and pore content per mass pac adsorption of pfoa reached equilibrium faster than gac yu et al 2009 pfoa adsorption on ac agreed with the freundlich and or langmuir models meng et al 2019 saeidi et al 2020 xu et al 2020 2 2 factors governing pfas adsorption on ac 2 2 1 pfas characteristics because of their shorter chains and fewer c f bonds genx and short chain pfas are less hydrophobic than long chain pfas as a result they are more mobile in water matrices and have higher critical micelle concentrations zhang et al 2011 genx forms a fast weak electrostatic bond with adsorbents and can be substituted by pfoa for longer contact times long chain pfas adsorb preferentially on ac due to their higher hydrophobicity while electrostatic bonding occurs in the adsorption of short chain pfas on ac it is much less important than their hydrophobicity according to du et al 2014 due to the differences in physio chemical properties genx partitions more quickly than pfoa on adsorbents since genx and other pfas have low negative log of the acid dissociation constant pka and are usually found in their anionic form net positive charged ac have a higher adsorption ability than zero charged ac park et al 2020b the hydrophobicity of genx versus longer chain pfas and its role in adsorption was examined wang et al 2019a the competitive effects of pfoa on genx adsorption by coconut shell based gac and pac were studied using a single solute method the amount of adsorbed genx 0 1 mmol g 1 was similar to pfoa at the start of adsorption but as contact time increased the amount of adsorbed genx 0 22 mmol g 1 decreased relative to pfoa 0 57 mmol g 1 by gac since genx bindings with active sites are unstable more hydrophobic pfoa replaced the adsorbed genx indicating that active sites on adsorbents are likely to associate with more hydrophobic compounds wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019a further reported that in the presence of pfoa the adsorption of genx by pac and gac differed genx adsorption on pac increased for the first 0 5 h and then decreased while the genx removal decrease on gac began after 24 h the time difference was caused by the limited number of active sites on ac since pac has a higher pore content than gac pfoa replaced genx faster on pac the bet surface area of pac was 745 m2 g 1 while it was 656 m2 g 1 for gac the adsorbed amounts of pfoa after 24 h in the bi solute system with genx were 0 6 and 0 4 mmol g 1 for pac and gac respectively the absorbed amounts of genx on the pac in the single and bi solute systems were 0 24 to 0 09 mmol g 1 respectively while for the gac they were 0 21 to 0 12 mmol g 1 respectively more available active sites resulted in faster adsorption of pfoa on pac than gac wang et al 2019a smaller molecular sizes of short chain pfas are the reason for faster equilibrium through a weak steric effect when pfoa adsorption reached equilibrium the removal efficiency of short chain pfas decreased because of their desorption and replacement by pfoa du et al 2015 sörengård sörengård et al 2020 evaluated 44 organic and inorganic adsorbents for removing pfas c3 to c17 from water and reported on the adsorption mechanisms including micelle formation stearic hindrance and geometrical change the polar region of the pfas is exposed on the outside of the structure while the non polar region forms the center and intensifies the negative charge of genx and other pfas making it easier for them to adsorb to the adsorbents stearic hindrance affects the reactivity of genx and other pfas ions allowing for more selective pfas ion adsorption by reducing unnecessary side reactions the helical twist in genx and other pfas structures particularly long chain pfas c8 c10 is caused by a chemical shift of cf3 and cf2 moieties influencing pfas adsorption 2 2 2 ph since genx and other pfas are present in aqueous environments in the form of anions the efficiency of ac adsorbents to remove these substances from the bulk phase increases in moderately acidic environments 3 ph 5 because under such conditions the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged favoring the adsorption of anionic compounds buck et al 2011 when the ph is below or above the ph of zero point of charge phzpc the surface of ac acquires a positive or negative charge and adsorbs preferentially anionic or cationic molecules respectively london dispersion forces are responsible for the tendency of ac to adsorb large and non polar molecules due to stronger dispersion forces leite et al 2012 organic contaminants in water adsorb on ac surfaces through van der waals forces which work in short distances between two molecules pollard et al 2016 when two molecules approach each other van der waals forces maximize then become repulsive as ph increases van der waals forces turn into repulsion and the removal efficiency of carbonaceous adsorbents decreases this phenomenon happens because of the chemical properties and surface charge changes of the adsorbent however the effect of longer chain pfas is more severe than genx and short chain pfas high adsorption of genx and other pfas by most of the adsorbents at low to neutral ph is because of the electrostatic attraction between deprotonated adsorbent surfaces and anionic pfas deng et al 2012 removal of genx by ac is sensitive to ph the phzpc for acidic ac is 3 2 wang et al 2019a and at ph between 2 and 3 2 the surface of acidic ac is positively charged and favors the adsorption of anionic genx the pka of genx is 2 84 usepa 2019a suggesting its existence in a wide range of ph as an anionic compound the pka for pfoa is 3 8 burns et al 2008 fig 1 shows the ionic forms of genx and pfoa and the surface charges of acidic and neutral ac at different solution ph under neutral and alkaline conditions where the surface charges of ac are neutral genx and pfoa are in their anionic forms suggesting that electrostatic interaction is not the main driving force in genx and pfoa adsorption by ac this characteristic of genx causes a rapid decrease in the efficacy of acidic ac at ph above 3 2 2 2 3 ac characteristics the surface area of an ac adsorbent plays a critical role in removing genx and other pfas appleman et al 2013 pore size is the most influential contributor to the surface area among physical characteristics such as total pore volume zeta potential and micropore volume wu et al 2020 the pore size of the ac significantly affects the rate of adsorption smaller pore size means more available functional groups on the ac the pore size of pac is almost 10 fold smaller than that of gac which means faster adsorption due to larger external surface area yu et al 2009 although it is not conclusive park et al 2020 demonstrated that the intraparticle diffusion of pfas tends to be independent of carbon pore size the contact time adsorbent surface charge and adsorbent dose also affect pfas removal pac has higher pfoa adsorption capacities than gac due to more pore content and active sites park et al 2020b pramanik et al 2015 used pac with a bet surface area of 880 m2 g 1 total pore volume of 0 365 cm3 g 1 and micropore volume of 0 154 cm3 g 1 for the removal of pfoa and pfos in water they experimented with gac with a bet surface area of 800 m2 g 1 total pore volume of 0 865 cm3 g 1 and micropore volume of 0 354 cm3 g 1 pac removed 68 of pfoa in 10 min while the corresponding efficiency for gac was 55 pramanik et al 2015 the observed difference was due to the higher surface area of pac than gac because the smaller particle sizes of pac decrease the internal diffusion distance of pfas to the adsorbent pac has more surface functional groups than gac allowing for more interactions with pfas pac and gac were used to remove genx from water their respective particle sizes were smaller than 100 mesh and in a range of 20 35 mesh the pac provided higher initial adsorption of genx than gac after 48 h both ac had comparable adsorption capacities after 48 h and the particle size was not a significant factor in genx removal wang et al 2019a however in another study the performance of ac for genx removal varied considerably with ac particle size and contact time wu et al 2020 filtrasorb 400 m calgon carbon co pittsburgh pa with particle sizes of 1000 1700 µm 425 850 µm 125 212 µm and 10 75 µm in milli q water after 4 h of contact time removed 37 6 29 8 98 1 and 99 5 of genx respectively wu et al 2020 significant increases in filtrasorb 400 m performance with decreasing particle size indicate that intra particle diffusion is a dominant adsorption mechanism in genx removal the better efficiency of smaller particle sizes might be due to the availability of more binding sites for genx molecules on the adsorbent increasing contact time resulted in higher removal of genx filtrasorb 400 m with a particle size of 425 850 µm removed 7 9 29 8 45 0 81 4 and 92 2 of genx 1 mg l 1 at 0 5 4 8 24 and 48 h respectively the smaller ac particle size led to faster genx uptake kinetics due to higher specific external surface area 2 2 4 presence of organic and inorganic ions dissolved organic matter dom diffuses and moves faster than hydrophobic pfas due to their higher adsorption affinity and probably blocks ac pores and competes for active adsorption sites a decrease more than 2 fold in pfoa adsorption via pac and gac was observed as the dom concentration measured as dissolved organic carbon doc increased from 5 to 25 mg l 1 pramanik et al 2015 the adsorption of genx on ac decreases when other pfas especially those with longer chains are present genx is often found in the water environment with pfoa brandsma et al 2019 gebbink et al 2017 pfoa is longer and more hydrophobic than genx and replaces the genx on adsorption sites causing a decrease in genx uptake wang et al 2019a because of their molecular size genx and short chain pfas can reach ac pores faster than long chain pfas occupying the available active sites wang et al 2019a du et al 2015 dom inhibits short chain pfas adsorption on ac but the effect is less significant than that of long chain pfas park et al 2020b interestingly in another study the presence of dom increased pfas removal by gac and had a positive effect on pfas removal from two freshwater lakes in sweden kothawala et al 2017 this result contradicts the findings from prior studies mcnamara et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 yu et al 2012 that dom occupies active sites leading to a decrease in pfas adsorption a possible reason for the positive effect of dom on pfas adsorption is co adsorption as well as the formation of doc pfas complexes due to hydrophobic interactions between dom and pfas kothawala et al 2017 campos pereira et al 2018 reported that short chain pfas removal efficiency increased in an environment with added cations such as al3 2 mm ca2 5 mm ca2 3 mm and na 10 mm cations facilitate the binding of pfas to the surface of adsorbents by neutralizing the negative charge on adsorbent surfaces the presence of inorganic anions such as f cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 showed no distinct correlation with removal efficiencies of genx and other pfas although it was expected that the anions might compete with anionic genx and other pfas for the available active sites on the ac wu et al 2020 2 2 5 adsorbent dosage adsorption dosage is one of the controlling factors in determining treatment cost generally increasing the adsorbent dose increases genx and other pfas removal performance however the adsorption capacity may decrease to date there has been only one study evaluating the effects of different adsorbent dosages on genx adsorption by ac sun et al 2016 investigated the effect of adsorbent dosage on removing a wide range of pfas including genx and pfoa in cape fear river water by a wood based pac the spiked concentration of genx and pfoa in the river water was 1 mg l 1 the genx adsorption to the wood based pac at doses of 30 60 and 100 mg l 1 were 18 30 and 38 respectively after 130 h while pfoa removal increased from 55 to 85 and then 95 respectively sun et al 2016 these results indicate a more significant effect of adsorbent dosage on pfoa removal than genx removal 2 2 6 regeneration the temperature of water used for thermal regeneration of gac directly relates to the genx removal ability of the regenerated gac increasing the temperature from 25 c to 92 c improved ac reactivation by almost 28 from 32 7 to 60 8 wang et al 2019a additionally an increase in the volume of hot water improved ac reactivation gac regeneration increased by 10 when the initial volume of 100 ml of hot water was increased by 50 ml adding nacl to water containing gac previously used for genx removal has a positive effect at first however as the nacl concentration increases from 0 5 to 1 at 92 c genx water solubility decreases and reduces gac regeneration efficacy wang et al 2019a based on the effectiveness of nacl for ac regeneration and since chloride is common in most genx contaminated waters the presence of chloride could affect genx adsorption the concentration of chloride is the determining factor in this case the chloride concentration has to be very high for the regeneration while typical chloride concentrations in genx contaminated water groundwater and non saline surface water are relatively low therefore it is likely that the effect of chloride ions favorable or unfavorable on genx adsorption by ac would be minimal naoh also has an adverse effect on gac regeneration as adding 0 5 naoh to water at 92 c reduced regeneration by 33 from 75 to 50 while using 100 ethanol instead of 30 ethanol at 25 c was effective and increased the regeneration of spent gac from 80 to 95 wang et al 2019a the pfas removal capacity of reactivated gac can decrease with each regeneration cycle boone et al 2019 experimented with 29 drinking water treatment plants dwtps and discovered that dwtps that frequently regenerated their gac or used brand new gac had higher removal efficiencies versus spent gac 3 anion exchange resins aes are widely used in pfas removal due to their high removal efficiencies ae is costlier but has better removal for genx and other pfas than ac woodard et al 2017 some critical factors for genx and other pfas removal by ae such as ph regeneration time resin bead sizes resin matrix hydrophobicity and functional groups are discussed in detail below table 2 lists ae adsorbents and their performance in genx removal 3 1 kinetics and isotherms aes and ac have completely different adsorption kinetics yu et al 2009 the adsorption of genx onto aes is slower than ac at the beginning of the process wang et al 2019a the adsorption kinetics of genx in aes is a function of charge density the driving force for adsorption is the initial ion concentration as the charge density of the aes increases the adsorption occurs faster the genx adsorption kinetics for an initial concentration of 10 µg l 1 in di water best fitted to pseudo second order kinetics compared to pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics with r2 0 9 0 8 and 0 7 respectively the pseudo second order model does not specify the driving forces of adsorption it only indicates that chemical adsorption occurs dixit et al 2020b two resins polyacrylic ira67 with the functional group of polyamine alkyl group of 3 dimethylaminopropyl and exchange capacity of 5 6 meq g 1 and polystyrene ira400 with the functional group of quaternary ammonium an alkyl group of benzyl trimethyl and exchange capacity of 3 8 meq g 1 were used for the adsorption of genx in water ira67 0 237 mmol g 1 h 1 demonstrated a higher initial adsorption rate v0 than ira400 0 148 mmol g 1 h 1 table 2 ira67 had a higher affinity toward hydrophilic compounds and initial genx adsorption followed intra particle diffusion the polyacrylic matrix of ira67 can adsorb more water volume due to its hydrophilic nature than the polystyrene matrix of ira400 thus the faster rate of genx kinetics by ira67 can be justified in this way the equilibrium occurred for both resins after almost 48 h and the langmuir isotherm had higher r2 than the freundlich model despite having a lower initial adsorption kinetics aes adsorbed more genx and other pfas than ac wang et al 2019a in another study with the basic anion exchange resin purolite a860 dixit et al 2020a reported that the adsorption isotherms for different resin dosages of 10 1000 mg l 1 and initial genx concentrations of 0 1 10 µg l 1 agreed with the freundlich model r2 0 97 0 99 they also evaluated the genx isotherms in the presence of natural organic matter nom from the suwanee river and reported decreases in isotherm parameters freundlich exponent and coefficient in the presence of 5 100 mg l 1 of suwanee river nom srnom for 24 h the value of 1 n for the freundlich isotherm decreased from 0 8 to 0 6 the most affected isotherm parameter was the freundlich coefficient which dropped drastically from 776 μeq meq 1 μeq l 1 1 n in deionized water to 113 μeq meq 1 μeq l 1 1 n in the presence of srnom the uptake of genx by purolite a860 was in agreement with the release of equivalently charged chloride purolite a860 and pfas specific resin a592e polystyrenic resin with complex amino functional groups and 0 9 eq l 1 charge density removed genx at an initial concentration of 10 µg l 1 to below 10 ng l 1 in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 srnom water the a860 resin removed genx in di water to a concentration below 10 ng l 1 in 45 min while it took 140 min to achieve the same in dom rich water for the a592e resin the corresponding time periods were 15 min in di water and 50 min in dom rich water dixit et al 2021a table 2 this suggests faster kinetics of the a592e than a860 resin for adsorption of genx in di and dom rich water the drastic difference in v0 between a592e and a860 might be attributed to the polymer structure functional groups and resin s charge density polystyrene a592e attracts genx more than polyacrylic a860 because of its chemical structure the quaternary ammonium functional groups in a860 are attached to four r groups whereas complex amino functional groups in a592e are nh moieties it is easier for anionic genx to bind with nh than n r4 moieties genx is in an anionic form in water at typical ph 5 9 dixit et al 2021a thus the charge and density of the adsorbent are crucial to its adsorption capacity an adsorbent with a higher charge positive density has more capacity for genx removal 3 2 factors governing pfas adsorption by anion exchange resins 3 2 1 pfas characteristics the sulfonic and carboxylic ends of pfas play significant roles in pfas adsorption three aes with the same supporting polymeric material polystyrene but different structures macroporous and gel like were evaluated for pfas adsorption zaggia et al 2016 pfas with sulfonic functional groups such as perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs had higher adsorption than pfas with carboxylic functional groups such as perfluorobutanoic acid pfba long chain pfas such as pfoa and pfos demonstrated higher removal rates on aes than short chain pfas such as pfbs and pfba park et al 2020a zaggia et al 2016 the fact that longer chain pfas regardless of their functional groups have higher affinity than shorter chain pfas shows that functional groups only matter substantially when comparing pfas with the same chain lengths genx and short chain pfas reach equilibrium faster than long chain pfas due to their smaller molecular size and fewer cf2 moieties dixit et al 2020b genx and pfbs reach equilibrium within the first 48 h while pfos and pfoa reach equilibrium after 96 h wang et al 2019b an inverse linear relationship was observed between genx concentration at a low range 0 1 50 µg l 1 and its adsorption capacity dixit et al 2020b reported that when genx s initial concentration increases from 0 5 to 50 µg l 1 the equilibrium adsorption capacity increases significantly from 5 to 85 neq meq 1 3 2 2 ph the removal of genx and other pfas by aes is a function of pfas and ae charge anionic or cationic and or solution ph acidic or basic resins with different functional groups respond to ph differently as reported by wang et al 2019a ira67 with a polyamine functional group is not effective 0 removal for genx removal at ph 2 however as ph increases to 4 genx removal increases 60 and then returns to 0 at ph 10 table 2 the reason for 0 removal at ph 2 is that genx has a pka of 2 84 and exists as an uncharged compound at ph 2 genx removal increases in the ph range of 2 10 due to the amine functional group on the ira67 polyamine with a pka of 9 5 the polyamine protonated at ph below 9 and positively charged ira67 can adsorb anionic genx another resin ira400 with a polystyrene functional group removed more genx when increasing ph from 2 to 6 20 to 55 and slightly less genx 45 when the ph was increased to 10 wang et al 2019a dixit et al 2019 evaluated the effect of solution ph on the removal of pfoa 10 µg l 1 by an acrylic based strong basic anionic macroporous ae dosage of 100 mg l 1 as solution ph increases the removal efficiency drops significantly 99 at ph 4 7 and 12 at ph 10 this significant decrease in removal efficiency indicates that electrostatic interactions decrease as the ph increases dixit et al 2019 there is an inverse linear relationship between ph and available active sites on aes the number of accessible active sites decreases as the ph changes from acidic to basic this reduces the adsorbed amount of genx and other pfas leading to lower removal efficacy by aes wang et al 2019b 3 3 3 anion exchange resin characteristics one of the significant issues in ae adsorption is the selectivity between the adsorbent and the adsorbate this interaction allows pfas to be removed more exclusively and at a higher rate in addition functional groups on resins as well as resin core material and porosity are other factors that influence pfas adsorption deng et al 2010 hydrophobic interaction has a crucial role in adsorption by ae and thus the characteristics of coated functional groups on ae are critical to genx and other pfas adsorption resins with hydrophobic functional groups have remarkable abilities to adsorb genx and other pfas due to hydrophobic interactions gagliano et al 2020 the main limiting factors of adsorption capacity are exchange sites however ion exchange is not the only force involved in pfas adsorption if ion exchange interaction is the sole force and active sites are accessible then the capacity of resin for adsorption of all pfas should be the same wang et al 2019b besides film and pore diffusion are two mechanisms responsible for the uptake of genx and other pfas by ae film diffusion controls genx uptake by purolite a860 a microporous acrylate based resin in dom free waters while pore diffusion controls uptake in waters with low total organic carbon toc 2 5 mg l 1 dixit et al 2020b 3 3 4 co contaminant effects on adsorption of pfas concentrations of organic and inorganic ions impact the service period of aes dom has a negative impact and decreases the adsorption of pfas on aes increasing the concentration of dom from 2 to 8 mg doc l 1 only decreases the removal efficiency by 10 kothawala et al 2017 note that at a higher doc concentration 20 mg doc l 1 the breakthrough volumes for genx and pfoa were similar 9500 500 bed volume bv consequently resin binding sites at 20 mg doc l 1 9500 500 bv became saturated earlier than low doc concentrations 2 8 mg doc l 1 30 000 500 bv in the presence of genx and other pfas that occupied more active sites the charge density of dom had a negative relationship with genx removal increasing the charge density resulted in higher competition among genx and dom dixit et al 2020a the presence of srnom 5 mg doc l 1 had a significant negative impact on the pseudo second order rate constant of genx adsorption 0 65 neq meq 1 min 1 and reduced it by almost 30 the adsorption capacity of genx dropped 2 fold in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 srnom the magnitudes of freundlich distribution factor kf for genx adsorption in different water matrices were distilled water 776 42 µeq meq 1 µeq l 1 1 n srnom recycled wastewater 113 21 µeq meq 1 µeq l 1 1 n river water 102 13 µeq meq 1 µeq l 1 1 n the reason behind the different adsorption capacities of genx in the four mentioned water matrices was the nom level dixit et al 2020b genx is often found in pfoa rich waters and thus wang et al 2019a used two resins ira67 and ira400 to evaluate the competition of genx and pfoa with identical initial concentrations 0 152 mmol l 1 and resin dosages 0 04 g l 1 in a bi solute system the adsorption of genx in the presence of pfoa increased in the first 6 h due to shorter chain length and higher motility however the genx adsorption plummeted after 24 h whereas pfoa replaced genx on the adsorption sites reducing genx removal to almost 0 they also used the resins to remove genx in a single solute system and compared the adsorbed amount of genx uptake with the bi solute system in a single solute system the genx uptake decreased from 2 68 to 2 73 mmol g 1 to 0 64 and 0 50 mmol g 1 in ira400 and ira67 respectively 3 3 5 regeneration the use of a solvent or hot water as a regeneration method for genx ladened aes was investigated wang et al 2019a zaggia et al 2016 zaggia et al 2016 conducted an adsorption experiment with three highly efficient aes for pfas a532e a520e and a600e in batch and continuous pilot plants for pfos and pfoa removal and evaluated their regeneration capabilities by various inorganic and organic salts and alcohols with different concentrations such as nacl naoh kcl koh nh4oh nh4cl ch3oh nh4cl and ch3ch2oh nh4cl spent a532e showed negligible regeneration however the other two aes had high reactivation yields a520e had the best performance after three regeneration cycles its performance dropped only 15 while that of a600e decreased to half hot water has been used to regenerate aes as water temperature has a significant effect on the regeneration of aes wang et al 2019a reported that an increase in temperature from 25 c to 92 c led to a higher regeneration percentage from 80 to 100 spent ira67 and ira400 had 96 and 100 regeneration respectively when treated with 0 5 nacl at 92 c wang et al 2019a dixit et al 2021a reported that aes could be regenerated under saline conditions 10 nacl with 1 ml of resin the a860 resin removed genx to below 70 ng l 1 with a breakthrough of 23 500 500 bv and was capable of removing genx to 70 ng l 1 for six more cycles after regeneration 4 comparisons between activated carbon and anion exchange resins as adsorbents for genx and pfoa both ac and aes can treat genx and pfoa but aes are a more promising choice with higher removal efficiency the following subsections compare the effects of different factors characteristics governing genx and pfoa removal performance by ac and aes these factors characteristics include kinetics and adsorption isotherms ph co contaminant presence and regeneration 4 1 kinetics and adsorption isotherms the kinetics of genx uptake on ac is faster than aes while the adsorption of genx on ac reaches equilibrium faster than on aes the slower genx and pfoa uptake kinetics for aes under ac is attributed to the adsorption driving force and mechanism wang et al 2019a as mentioned above hydrophobic interactions are the prevalent adsorption mechanism in ac while ion exchange is the driving force of genx adsorption for aes wang et al 2019a it takes more time for aes to build up charge density while for ac intra particle diffusion starts when genx is in contact with ac genx and pfoa removal kinetics are best fitted by pseudo second order model for both types of adsorbents genx and pfoa adsorption isotherms for both types of adsorbents follow langmuir and freundlich models wang et al 2019a 4 2 ph ph affects the removal performances of genx and pfoa by ac and aes for ac genx and pfoa removal is primarily dependent on its surface charge a positive surface charge can adsorb genx and pfoa more favorably since these two contaminants are found in their anionic forms in water wang et al 2019a thus as long as the surface of ac is positively charged there are available active sites in a ph range of 3 to 5 ac provides higher removal of genx and pfoa in a moderately acidic environment the phzpc of the ac surface for instance phzpc 3 2 wang et al 2019a which determines the surface charge of ac and the solution ph which governs the forms of genx and pfoa protonated versus deprotonated are both favorable positive surface charge for ac and deprotonated form of the contaminants for contaminant removal in other ph ranges ac can remove genx and pfoa however the efficiency will drop various resin types have been used in aes for genx and pfoa removal each resin type has a distinct functional group these functional groups in ae protonates or deprotonates according to the solution ph for instance an ae with a polyamine functional group specifically 3 dimethylaminopropyl as its alkyl group has a pka of 9 79 when ph is higher than 10 3 methylaminopropyl is in its protonated form as wang et al 2019a reported the genx removal efficiency is 0 when the ph is higher than 10 ph below 10 is favorable for this resin type however genx s pka is 2 84 meaning that the ph must be higher than the pka for genx to be in its anionic form thus the optimum removal efficiency for genx with this particular resin type is in the ph range of 3 to 10 4 3 effect of co contaminant s in general organic and inorganic co contaminants in genx contaminated waters compete for the available binding sites on adsorbents and have an adverse effect on genx removal mcnamara et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 yu et al 2012 an increase in dom concentration significantly decreased pfoa removal efficiency by ac pramanik et al 2015 however there is a contradictory report by kothawala et al 2017 demonstrating a positive effect of dom on pfas due to formation of dom pfoa complexes that facilitated pfoa adsorption by ac in the same study kothawala et al 2017 reported that the presence of dom decreased the pfoa removal efficiency by aes the presence of dom negatively affects genx removal by ac but the effect was weaker than that of pfoa park et al 2020b dom had a similar impact on genx removal efficiency by aes dixit et al 2020b inorganic anions did not affect genx removal efficiency by ac campos pereira et al 2018 while inorganic cations facilitated genx uptake on the surface of ac and increased genx removal efficiency wu et al 2020 there has been no report on the effect of inorganic cations and or anions on the genx removal performance by aes the presence of other pfas especially long chain pfas negatively affects genx removal efficiency by both types of adsorbents wang et al 2019a pfoa has higher hydrophobicity 8 carbons in its structure but slower diffusion compared with genx 6 carbons in its structure hence genx showed faster diffusion on ac and aes than pfoa however pfoa replaced genx on the surface of ac or aes as the contact time increased wang et al 2019a 4 4 regeneration the binding sites of ac and aes can be regenerated by washing with solvents and hot water wang et al 2019a dixit et al 2021a increasing water temperature improves the reactivation of ac and aes in addition solvents such as nacl naoh and ethanol affected the regeneration of ac ethanol had a positive influence on ac regeneration while naoh had a negative effect nacl had mixed effects based on its concentration wang et al 2019a for aes nacl had a positive effect on aes regeneration dixit et al 2021a due to the adsorption driving force in aes solvents such as nacl naoh kcl koh nh4oh nh4cl ch3oh nh4cl and ch3ch2oh nh4cl proved to be effective in regenerating active sites on two out of three aes zaggia et al 2016 another approach for the regeneration of ac is combustion the heat from combustion can break strong c f bonds zhang and liang 2021 however there is no reported peer reviewed article on the reactivation efficiency of ac for genx removal through combustion 5 genx and pfoa treatability by adsorption breakthrough curves normalized contaminant concentration c c0 versus dimensionless time θ are used to evaluate the performance of adsorbents in removing contaminants information on adsorbent capacity and adsorption rates was analyzed to compare the treatability of genx and pfoa by ac based on the breakthrough the θ for c c0 to reach 0 5 is θm the equilibrium adsorption capacity as well as the bulk density of ac and initial concentrations of genx and pfoa obtained from wang et al 2019a were used to determine θm based on a symmetrical breakthrough curve assumption genx in single solute and bi solute with pfoa reach c c0 0 5 at θm 0 121 and 0 063 respectively while the θm of pfoa is 4 4 times later than that of genx in the bi solute the implication of the faster half breakthrough point for genx than pfoa is that ac preferentially removes pfoa over genx and the treatability of genx is more challenging than pfoa approximately 4 new regenerated sets of gac 0 08 g l 1 are required to treat genx c0 0 152 mmol l 1 while only one set of gac is required to treat the same initial concentration of pfoa note that the primary driving force of genx and pfoa adsorption by ac is their hydrophobicity and the observed breakthrough difference is attributed to less hydrophobicity of genx compared to pfoa adsorption of genx requires more ac implying a higher operating cost the interaction energies of pfoa and genx with ac and their interaction nature with ae resin were predicted by cosmo rs model in cosmo rs quantum chemistry approaches in combination with statistical thermodynamic calculations are used in cosmo rs calculations the molecules are surrounded by a virtual conductor environment and the interactions are considered to take place on segments of this perfect ideal conductor interface klamt et al 2010 klamt and eckert 2000 a distribution function achieves the complete description of the molecule screening charge density σ over the whole surface of the molecule called σ profile that describes molecular interactions fused aromatic rings were used as a model for ac to determine the interaction energies between pollutants and ac masson et al 2017 in this review ovalene 36 carbon atoms and 14 hydrogen atoms was used to model the ac s aromatic planes purolite a860 was recently used as a treatment media for pfas including genx purolite a860 is a macroporous polyacrylic resin which is crosslinked with divinylbenzene in purolite a860 quaternary ammonium and chloride ions are used as a functional group and ionic form respectively in cosmo rs cations quaternary ammonium and anions chloride are considered as separate entities therefore simulating the exact complete structure of purolite a860 is not possible to overcome this issue divinylbenzene dimethylethanolammonium a quaternary ammonium group which is used in type ii strongly basic anion exchange resin as a functional group and chloride ions were considered as separate entities for a molecular simulation the charge densities of genx pfoa ovalene dimethylethanolammonium divinylbenzene and chloride anions were first ascertained by using turbomole software negative σ represents a molecule s ability to donate hydrogen while positive σ is the hydrogen bond accepting characteristics based on surface charge densities cosmo rs was used to determine the interaction energies and σ profiles for turbomole and cosmo rs a triple zeta valence polarized basis set and the hybrid b3lyp method respectively were used for molecular surface σ and thermophysical calculations fig 2 a shows that the interactions of genx and pfoa with ac ovalene are mainly through van der waals forces as charge neutral compounds pfoa and genx were used to calculate the van der waals energies because ovalene is a charge neutral compound and the cosmo rs simulation requires the overall charge to be neutral the van der waals energy value of pfoa 9 31 kj mol 1 is higher than genx 8 31 kj mol 1 this indicates more spontaneous adsorption in the case of pfoa than that of genx the hydrogen bond energy values are lower than van der waals energy values for both pfoa 0 34 kj mol 1 and genx 0 18 kj mol 1 note that the cosmo rs model only considers surface chemistry in the calculations therefore the interaction within the pores of carbon ovalene cannot be simulated commercial genx is usually in an ammonium salt form the ammonium and proton of the carboxylic acid functional group dissociate when dissolved in water resulting in an anionic form of genx hopkins et al 2018 the anionic ester form of pfoa octanoate is dominant at typical ph values for natural water therefore the anionic forms of genx and pfoa were used to evaluate their interactions with ae resin the σ of genx pfoa and ae divinylbenzene dimethylethanol ammonium and chloride ions are shown in fig 2 b generally the sigma profile is divided into three regions the first part where σ 0 01 e å 2 shows the hydrogen bond donor region e å 2 represents a unit for electron per area in square angstrom the second part extending between 0 01 σ 0 01 e å 2 represents the non polar region and the third part where σ 0 01 e å 2 shows the hydrogen bond acceptor region any molecules with σ profiles to the left of 0 01 e å 2 will have hydrogen bond donor abilities while those to the right of 0 01 e å 2 will have hydrogen bond acceptor abilities fig 2 b indicates that the σ of both genx and pfoa have larger peaks in the non polar region and smaller peaks in hydrogen accepting regions dimethylethanolammonium is more aligned with a hydrogen bond donor than a hydrogen bond acceptor while in the case of chloride the σ shows it as a hydrogen bond accepting entity in the case of divinylbenzene none of these characteristics hydrogen bond donating and accepting were observed therefore no ionic interaction is expected between divinylbenzene and pfoa and genx however a non polar hydrophobic interaction is possible between divinylbenzene and pfoa and genx dixit et al 2019 reported that pfoa removal via ae purolite a860 involved an equivalent exchange of chloride with minimal influence of hydrophobic adsorption the chloride ions on ae are displaced by pfoa and genx which attach to the ammonium group of dimethylethanolammonium through hydrogen bonding pfoa and genx are hydrogen bond acceptor molecules while dimethylethanolammonium is a hydrogen bond donor molecule therefore the more hydrogen donating characteristics of the cationic part of the ae resin the better pfoa and genx removal will be 6 unconventional adsorbents ac and aes have an affinity for other organics and or inorganics in water so it might be challenging for them to selectively remove fluorinated chemicals including genx in the presence of humic acid for instance the capacity of aes pfa 694e purolite to remove genx was less than 20 confirming the adsorption competition between humic acid and pfas kumarasamy et al 2020 another issue is that the levels of organic contaminants in natural water are higher than those of genx and pfas and gac has more binding affinity for them than that of traditional and emerging pfas including genx resulting in pfas desorption over time for example data from the sweeney dwtp wilmington north carolina revealed that the effluent concentrations of genx and perfluoro 4 methoxybutanoic acid pfmoba 19 8 ng l 1 for genx and 7 62 ng l 1 for pfmoba were higher than those of the influent of a gac column 17 6 ng l 1 for genx and not detectable for pfmoba kumarasamy et al 2020 the higher levels of the two pfas in the treated water were due to their desorption from the gac surface hopkins et al 2018 also found that the concentration of genx in a water treatment plant effluent was 28 higher than the concentration in the influent due to genx desorption from older gac multiple adsorbents other than ac and aes have been tested and exhibited more selectivity for genx table 3 summarizes these adsorbents and their performance for genx removal 6 1 ionic fluorogel resin kumarasamy et al 2020 synthesized an ionic fluorogel resin to selectively treat a mixture of pfoa perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and genx in simulated natural water 200 mg l 1 nacl and 20 mg l 1 humic acids in di water the ionic fluorogel resin was synthesized through radical copolymerization of azobis isobutyronitrile with methacrylate chain end functionality fluorolink md 700 and 2 dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate the ionic fluorogel 100 mg l 1 containing 20 40 wt quaternary ammonium comonomer ammonium comonomer was responsible for incorporating permanent charge and efficient surface wetting during pfas removal removed 98 100 of genx pfoa and pfhxa in 21 h at an initial concentration of 50 µg l 1 for each pfas at a lower adsorbent dose 10 mg l 1 and an initial concentration of each pfas 1 µg l 1 better pfoa removal 97 was achieved than those of genx 80 88 and pfhxa 76 82 in 21 h only 25 removal of pfoa and no genx and pfhxa removal were observed without incorporating quaternary ammonium into the ionic fluorogel indicating the importance of quaternary ammonium in the removal of the three pfas the ionic fluorogel was regenerated 5 times by a methanolic ammonium acetate solution without losing adsorption capacity gac filtrasorb 400 pac picahydro mp23 lenntech and an anion exchange resin pfa 694e purolite had significantly lower genx removal compared to the ionic fluorogel when tested in a similar environment 6 2 modified poly ethylene glycol diacrylate pegda for genx removal three types of hydrogel sorbents were synthesized through the fluoridation amination and bifunctionalization amination fluoridation of pegda huang et al 2018 no genx 100 mg l 1 removal was observed using fluoridated pegda hydrogel 10 mg 5 ml in 12 h the genx adsorption capacities of aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel were 86 7 5 1 and 98 7 3 9 μmol g 1 respectively both aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel had positive surface charges 39 0 and 31 4 mv respectively whereas the charge was negative 27 1 mv for fluoridated pegda hydrogel given the hydrophobic nature and negative charge on genx electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were responsible for removing the aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel the effects of ph competing ions and other organic contaminants such as nom were not studied incubation of spent aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel sorbents with 70 methanol in 1 nacl for 12 h at 150 rpm showed 84 and 73 genx desorption respectively the ability of the regenerated hydrogels for removing genx was not tested huang et al 2018 6 3 covalent organic frameworks ji et al 2018 used covalent organic frameworks cofs with surface areas of 1000 m2 g 1 as adsorbents to remove 13 different pfas including genx azide and amine were separately coated on cofs at various loadings to increase the adsorption of genx at an initial concentration of 200 µg l 1 of genx cofs with no and maximum loadings of azide were able to remove small amounts of genx 5 efficiency while removal by amine coated cofs ranged 60 to 95 an amine coating of 10 to 28 of the maximum loading which was not clearly defined on the cofs delivered more than 90 genx removal efficiency to demonstrate the effectiveness of aminated cofs on genx removal two other adsorbents gac particle size 1000 μm and pac particle size 10 75 μm were used under similar environmental conditions aminated cofs 91 had higher removal efficiency than gac 0 and pac 72 the entities responsible for genx adsorption were polar functional groups the interaction of amine groups with the anionic end of genx and other pfas and the cofs hydrophobic surfaces 6 4 poly n 3 dimethylamino propyl acrylamide methyl chloride quaternary ateia et al 2019 introduced a new cationic polymer hydrogel n 3 dimethylamino propyl acrylamide methyl chloride quaternary dmapaa q capable of adsorbing genx and other pfas in treated wastewater and surface water with high removal efficiency 85 and high selectivity 80 this hydrogel was not ph dependent for genx or other pfas removal and had high removal efficiency in the ph range of 4 10 dmapaa q showed no attenuation in pfas removal in the presence of highly concentrated dom 2 5 0 3 106 times higher than pfas for the first 24 h although dom concentration was similar in surface water and wastewater due to the presence of anionic compounds so4 2 cl no3 in treated wastewater the removal of genx and other pfas dropped by 10 20 showing that anions compete with pfas to occupy active sites the results showed that by increasing the concentration of dom by 2 fold removal efficiency only decreased 5 10 the polymer hydrogel was regenerated for 6 cycles and retained the genx removal capacity at almost 100 after each regeneration cycle 6 5 β cyclodextrin polymers two cyclodextrin polymers cdps consisting of β cyclodextrin monomers crosslinked with rigid aromatics containing weakly basic amine cdp or permanently cationic dexsorb functional groups were used to remove genx hydrophobic interactions were the primary mechanisms for genx removal however cdps protonated crosslinkers also provided alternate active sites for anionic genx via electrostatic attraction the genx removal experiments were conducted with an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 for three water samples milli q water and two groundwater samples both cdps removed genx 93 after 4 h of contact time in milli q water the genx removal efficiency by two cdps was reduced considerably to 10 30 for the groundwater samples this decrease was due to groundwater chemistry such as cation and anion concentrations dexsorb showed better efficiency than amine cdp in genx removal in groundwater a possible reason for the higher efficiency of dexsorb might be the cationic functional groups on its surface table 3 shows the difference in removal efficiency of dexsorb and amine cdp wu et al 2020 7 treatment costs besides contaminant removal efficiency the treatment cost plays a vital role in adopting a removal technology therefore it is necessary to estimate the treatment cost for genx removal in water using the data available in the literature the cost criterion comprises the technology implementation costs and the long term operational and maintenance o m costs the detailed cost analysis includes total capital costs direct and indirect direct expenses include the cost of land construction equipment treatment transportation and disposal while engineering expenses and contingency allowances are part of indirect costs ch2m hill 2018 the usepa drinking water treatment technology unit cost model was developed using a bottom up approach known as work breakdown structure wbs for cost estimation usepa 2019b pfoa as a representative of long chain pfas was selected to compare its removal cost with genx using the wbs model in the wbs model there are two main options for determining the bed life of gac and ae resin the options are using 1 freundlich isotherm data and 2 bed volume before required regeneration the latter option was used corresponding to a 70 5 breakthrough of the sorbent gac ae resin to estimate the treatment costs of genx and pfoa the experimented data from two peer reviewed articles were used to obtain credible genx and pfoa treatment costs in the wbs model for genx it was reported that gac reached a 74 breakthrough after treating approximately 5000 bed volumes of genx contaminated water hopkins et al 2018 whereas in the case of pfoa it was 42 500 bed volumes mccleaf et al 2017 the bed volume numbers needed to achieve 68 70 of the breakthrough for genx and pfoa using anion exchange resin were 62 500 and 50 000 respectively hopkins et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 detailed input values including vessel design are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the total capital costs which include direct capital costs vessel treatment media piping and construction indirect costs geotechnical electrical and site work along with process engineering and add on costs permits pilot study and land cost are the same for the treatment of pfoa and genx by gac in contrast the annual o m costs of treating genx are about 4 15 times higher than pfoa no option is available in the wbs model for selecting a specific type brand of gac fig 3 is based on 5500 households served and 3 0 people per household the annual cost of treating almost 4 m3 of genx per year is us 1 53 while it is around three times less us 0 58 for pfoa based on 30 3 years of useful life reciprocal weighted average and a 7 discount rate the defined 7 is correspondent to the real discount rate it values marginal pretax profitability for average investments by private sectors after ignoring the projected inflation the 7 discount rate was established through an economic analysis performed by the u s office of management and budget carter and nesbitt 2016 the annual cost per household for treating genx and pfoa contaminated water per year using gac are us 224 and us 85 respectively note that the annual o m costs and annual costs are different the direct and total capital costs associated with ae resin type i strong base polystyrenic gel are the same for both genx and pfoa the annual o m costs for treating genx and pfoa using the ae resin are comparable us 156 594 for genx and us 157 482 for pfoa rinsate backwash costs are included in the o m costs the slight difference in the annual o m costs is probably due to the difference in the removal capacities of the ae resin for genx and pfoa the volumes of saturated and diluted brine provided by the wbs model are 4 and 24 m3 per vessel per regeneration respectively the regeneration frequency per vessel is 217 days since genx is a toxic compound for the characteristics of spent brine in the wbs model the hazardous option was chosen among hazardous non hazardous radioactive and radioactive hazardous options hazardous waste disposal was chosen among the five available discharge methods in the wbs model for spent brine handling including publicly owned treatment works septic tank surface water evaporation pond and hazardous waste disposal hazardous waste disposal which is the most environmentally sound option involves spent brine incineration which can break down genx and pfoa zhang and liang 2021 and turn them into less or non hazardous substances based on the wbs model backwashing occurs every 48 h at a backwash rate of 29 m3 h 1 per square meter of a vessel and a backwash duration of 10 min the usepa 2002 recommended that if there is a holding tank with or without coagulant addition the spent backwash can be directly discharged to surface water or publicly owned treatment works returning the spent backwash at 5 to 10 of the influent flow to the headend of the treatment plant is also acceptable usepa 2002 the annual cost of treating almost 4 m3 of genx and pfoa by ae is equivalent us 0 54 at a discount rate of 7 and a useful life reciprocal weighted average of 37 5 years the annual cost per household per year for treating both pfoa and genx is us 79 the wbs model shows that the annual o m costs using gac for genx and pfoa are 6 42 and 1 54 times higher than the selected ae resin the resin type is crucial in designing the aes and directly influences the cost of genx removal multiple considerations must be taken into account when using different resin types including the resin cost in addition different resin types have different optimum empty bed contact times ebcts which ultimately affect the total cost of the process furthermore the regeneration cost varies with resin type thus different types of resin have different direct capital costs and o m costs resin type has more influence on o m costs than capital costs as the resin cost makes up a very small fraction of the capital cost 0 09 the cost estimate demonstrated here is just one case based a specific ae type i strong base polystyrenic gel for example if another type of resin that is twice as expensive as the model resin is used but the backwashing and regeneration practices and ebct remain the same the annual o m costs for genx removal increase from us 156 594 to us 219 214 and the annual o m costs for pfoa removal increase from us 157 482 to us 220 225 to the best of our knowledge there is no information available in the literature on the treatment cost comparison between genx and pfoa however calgoncarbon conducted a study to evaluate the treatment costs of pfas pfoa pfos and perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa using a hypothetical ae resin calgoncarbon 2019 the reported o m cost for the ae resin was us 296 300 per year their o m annual cost was higher than that of the wbs calculated o m cost likely because of the simultaneous treatment of three pfas in water while the wbs model was used to estimate treatment costs for a single pfas 8 research gaps and future outlook genx is being developed as a more environmentally friendly alternative to pfoa based on an ether functional group in its chemical structure treatment of genx as a contaminant of emerging concern has drawn attention within the scientific community despite the more environmentally friendly nature of genx its treatability by adsorption is lower than pfoa as the most cost effective and conventional treatment method for pfoa ac has significantly lower removal efficiency and capacity for genx the following subsections identify the current research gaps and recommend future work on genx removal by ac ae other common adsorbents and emerging adsorbents 8 1 activated carbon studies have shown that the removal efficiencies of genx by ac are only 30 while those of other common pfas with 6 carbon atoms namely pfhxa and perfluorohexane sulfonate acid pfhxs are approximately 95 wang et al 2019a sun et al 2016 more studies are needed to determine the effects of co contaminants on genx removal especially short chain pfas and dom there is a possibility to increase genx adsorption by ac through various modifications applying various modified ac previously tested for pfoa or other short chain pfas such as pfhxa or pfhxs for genx removal is a logical starting point 8 1 1 effect of co contaminants existing studies regarding the impact of organic and inorganic matter on pfas adsorption in general and particularly on genx adsorption by ac showed contradicting results campos pereira et al 2018 du et al 2014 hopkins et al 2018 park et al 2020b wu et al 2020 more studies are required to find a logical trend or describe the basis of the reported conflicting effects between organic and inorganic matter and genx adsorption genx contaminated waters have been increasingly identified cui et al 2020 gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 li et al 2020 semerád et al 2020 including wastewater surface water and groundwater dom and inorganic materials are not the only co contaminants that influence genx adsorption genx is often accompanied by long chain pfas that replace genx molecules on the ac after a specific operation time existing studies have focused on the competitive effect of pfoa sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019a but given the recent increase in short chain pfas production such as pfhxa and pfhxs it is important to assess the effects of short chain pfas on genx removal by ac 8 1 2 modified ac ac have low genx removal efficiency sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019a but they are still widely used in the industry due to their cost effectiveness regeneration ability and significant removal potential of other pfas belkouteb et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 schulz et al 2020 physical increasing the surface area or chemical introducing functional groups modifications may be made to improve ac adsorption similar pfoa and pfos adsorption approaches were taken and ac was modified to increase their removal efficiencies deng et al 2015 xu et al 2020 modified ac such as extruded or pelletized ac and magnetic ac have not been explored for genx adsorption due to its ether functional group and anionic form in water genx might be more susceptible to ac modified to contain cations such as iron coated and alum coated ac several modification processes for ac such as impregnation grafting and bifunctionalization are available to immobilize cationic material into the ac pores surfaces and interstices finding available and affordable coatings that increase genx adsorption will help in reducing costs in the long run 8 1 3 pore structure there are contradicting reports regarding the effect of pore size on genx uptake by ac park et al 2020b pramanik et al 2015 wu et al 2020 the actual interaction of genx with ac as well as the mechanisms involved in binding genx to the active sites are not clear the modification effects of different functional groups on the ac pore structure for genx adsorption are ambiguous thus characterization techniques such as bet analyzer x ray powder diffraction scanning and transmission electron microscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy to comprehend the influence of inner pore structures and surfaces functional groups on genx and other pfas removal are suggested as starting points 8 2 ae the effect of dom on the removal of genx was studied to some extent future studies should focus on the effect of common co contaminants mainly competing for anions on genx removal by aes besides most studies on genx removal by aes focused on polystyrene and polyacrylic resins different resin types have different characteristics including porosity durability adsorption capacity and selectivity in removing organic contaminants polystyrene and polyacrylic resins have been used for genx removal however the applications of other potential resin types such as suspended ion exchange six chelating and silica based resins for genx removal have not been explored 8 2 1 co contaminants genx and other pfas are found in landfill leachate groundwater and wastewater which are all heterogeneous in nature the competing effect of other pfas along with genx has not been fully addressed most studies concentrated on genx and pfoa co removal the competing effect of pfas especially pfoa and pfos with other emerging contaminants including pharmaceuticals and pesticides have been investigated in 164 european groundwater sources liu et al 2019 stuart et al 2012 however genx is the pfas of the future and its mass production is on the rise as a result not recognizing the effects of other emerging pollutants on genx removal would be unwise to date no research has been done in this field the focus should be on finding co occurring emerging contaminants with genx such as metaldehyde stuart et al 2012 and exploring their impact on genx removal should be the priority 8 2 2 resin type the existing adsorption studies of genx by aes have focused on specific resin types however several existing and emerging resin types have yet to be investigated chelating six and silica based resins are the most promising resin types capable of removing ions and organic contaminants bazri and mohseni 2016 levchuk et al 2018 duan et al 2020 chelating resins are resilient as well as having one or combined donor atoms of amines amides nitriles and azo groups the presence of amines has shown promising results in genx removal by cofs therefore examining the performance and potential selectivity of chelating resins should be considered six is a novel form of ae targeting toc removal metcalfe et al 2015 its unique regeneration process along with a single pass plug flow system that minimizes resin fouling would increase the run time duration of genx adsorption and in turn make it a promising candidate for genx removal silica based resins have higher specific surface areas and higher mechanical strengths than pure resins besides they have no shrinking or swelling problems resulting in increased longevity making them viable candidates for genx removal 8 3 miscellaneous adsorption processes a rational starting point for optimizing genx treatment is applying inexpensive and reliable adsorbents proven effective for removing pfoa and other pfas due to the many similarities between them and genx zero valent iron zvi a relatively cost effective and environmentally friendly material effectively removes pfas jeen et al 2014 liu et al 2019 this technology is likely to remove and decompose genx simultaneously through adsorption and defluorination as well as hydrogen bonding reduction biochar has been used to remove a broad range of contaminants of concern including pfas liu et al 2020 the affordability and accessibility of biochar along with its highly porous characteristics make it a perfect candidate to study for genx removal molecularly imprinted polymers mips are used in locating and removing pfas al amin et al 2020 the synthetic fabrication of polymers which enhances the active sites to have higher affinity and selectivity toward the targeted contaminant genx is one of mips advantages due to their wide variety of raw materials mips have the potential to remove genx metal organic frameworks have positively charged metals in their crystalline framework along with a homogeneous pore structure resulting in larger surface areas for adsorbents because of these two characteristics they are promising candidates for removing genx through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions aris et al 2020 modified smectite clays have rarely been tested for pfas remediation even though their removal efficiency for pfas 95 99 is comparable to aes yan et al 2020 intercalating quaternary ammonium surfactants can modify low cost smectite clays into the interlayer space via ion exchanging with cations such as k na and ca2 making modified smectite clays potential candidates for genx removal 9 conclusions the treatability of genx is more complicated and difficult than pfoa genx has a lower equilibrium adsorbed amount than pfoa traditional ac provides low removal efficiency for genx approximately 30 however engineered ac designed to have significantly smaller pores can remove genx with higher efficiencies 80 99 aes outperform ac in removing genx based on molecular simulation results aes with higher hydrogen bond donating characteristics are likely to have better removal capacity for both pfoa and genx the effects of competing ions and associated mechanisms on genx adsorption remain ambiguous this review demonstrated that the genx breakthrough curve occurs considerably faster than pfoa for virgin ac it also showed that for ac the estimated treatment cost for genx is 4 4 times higher than that for pfoa while the genx treatment cost is approximately the same as pfoa for aes traditional ac is the most common type of adsorbents used in the field and the results have shown it is less effective in removing genx than pfoa hence higher amounts of genx will end up in the environment if the two contaminants are treated together or individually in the same manner considering the benefits and challenges of genx to the environment and humans the suitability of its broad adoption is questionable author contributions yong sik ok daniel c w tsang and eakalak khan conceived the presented idea eakalak khan developed the theory hamed heidari and tauqeer abbas

16577,hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid genx has been marketed as a substitute for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa to reduce environmental and health risks genx and pfoa have been detected in various natural water sources and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for pfoa removal in this paper comparisons of genx and pfoa adsorption are evaluated including adsorption potential adsorption mechanisms and associated costs a detailed literature review suggests that anion exchange resins are more effective in removing genx than activated carbon genx removal efficiency through activated carbon 30 is lower than that of pfoa 80 95 while genx and pfoa removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar 99 unconventional adsorbents such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove genx from water the review reveals that genx adsorption is more challenging requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor pfoa annual operation and maintenance costs for genx adsorption initial concentration of genx and pfoa 0 2 µg l 1 by gac for treating 10 000 m3 per day is almost us 1 000 000 per year but only around us 240 000 per year for pfoa desorption of genx in the presence of pfoa highlights genx s inferior treatability by adsorption it is believed that genx is a more environmentally friendly compound than pfoa but this environmental friendliness comes with the price graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated carbon drinking water emerging contaminants remediation technologies water treatment 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been used as water and stain repellents for containers leather and fabrics as well as the main ingredients for firefighting foams and photographic emulsifiers bolan et al 2021 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are the most studied compounds among pfas kim et al 2019 they are chemically stable compounds that have been proven to be bioaccumulative and toxic in humans and fauna chen et al 2021 in 2016 the united states environmental protection agency usepa issued a lifetime health advisory level for combined pfoa and pfos in drinking water and mandated municipalities inform their water customers of levels over 70 ng l 1 boone et al 2019 with reductions in pfos and pfoa c8 production short chain pfas c2 c7 have served as substitutes gewurtz et al 2019 hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid also known as genx c6 was developed as a pfoa substitute by dupont in 2009 due to the usepa s pfoa stewardship program and later trademarked by chemours a dupont spinoff usepa 2019a the massive applications of genx in the industry as a less toxic substitute has increased its importance more than other short chain pfas increased applications of genx in oil repellent coatings have led to higher detections of genx in natural waters near production facilities brandsma et al 2019 gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 a toxicity study suggested that genx has weaker epigenetic toxicity than pfoa with milder symptoms including liver damage while they have similar effects on cell metabolism rates and viability wen et al 2020 the state of north carolina department of health and human services set a 140 ng l 1 non obligatory health advisory on genx in drinking water in 2017 cahoon 2019 the annual production of genx is on the rise and genx is the pfas of the future gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 semerád et al 2020 considering genx as a distinct compound rather than a member of short chain pfas is helpful when addressing the importance of genx the critical distinction between genx and short chain pfas is the ether functional group in genx it is believed that the ether functional group makes genx a more environmentally friendly compound genx shares many similarities with short chain pfas but has significant differences with pfoa including the ether functional group as well as lower chain length less hydrophobicity and more mobility concentrations of short chain pfas in runoff and landfill leachates have increased after the phasing out of long chain pfas masoner et al 2020 xiao et al 2012 decomposition of long chain pfas contributes to short chain pfas detected in water and wastewater treatment systems glover et al 2018 kim et al 2019 genx and short chain pfas share primary analogous attributes with long chain pfas such as c f bonds researchers have tried to apply advanced removal and degradation technologies such as activated carbon ac and self assembled micelle chen et al 2020 murray et al 2019 wang et al 2019a ion exchange dixit et al 2020a zaggia et al 2016 nanofiltration pica et al 2019 reverse osmosis appleman et al 2014 and advanced oxidation ahmed et al 2020 pica et al 2019 to remove or degrade short chain pfas including genx adsorption is the most common treatment method for pfas removal phong vo et al 2020 bolan et al 2021 low cost targeted and non targeted removal through dispersion induction or electrostatic interaction or a combination of these forces are among the features that make adsorption a favorable treatment option for genx and other pfas removal acquiring knowledge solely on genx and its adsorption characteristics is insufficient because genx is mostly found with other pfas especially pfoa in groundwater and other aquatic environments gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 previous reviews on pfas treatment focused on long chain pfas especially pfoa and pfos however long chain pfas reviews lack inclusiveness some covered a single technology while others covered several technologies but only addressed a subset of pfas and did not discuss pfas treatment costs dixit et al 2021b du et al 2014 li et al 2020 merino et al 2016 rahman et al 2014 trojanowicz et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for instance zhang et al 2019 solely focused on the adsorption technologies for removing short chain pfas but not genx later f dixit et al 2021b published the most recent review on pfas exclusively focusing on treatment by ionic exchange resins they focused on comparing various ionic exchange resins for pfas removal along with resin regeneration procedures although the review touched on genx it did not look exclusively at genx this review aims to critically analyze and synthesize currently available knowledge from the published literature on genx adsorption compared with other pfas especially pfoa genx was manufactured as a chemical more susceptible to disintegrate in the environment than pfoa however it is unclear whether genx is a better choice than pfoa in other important aspects such as treatability and the associated cost several questions need to be answered is genx more or less susceptible to adsorption technologies does adsorption of genx cost more than that of pfoa in other words are there prices to pay for genx as a more environmentally friendly substitute for pfoa in this review by analyzing and synthesizing existing study data collected from genx and pfoa adsorption isotherms and kinetics the breakthrough of ac is predicted to showcase the differences in genx and pfoa treatability this review synthesizes the data obtained from the genx isotherm and other pfas to estimate their treatment costs the review covers both traditional and modified adsorbents the efficacy of genx removal is compared to that of pfoa as well as examined with pfoa as a co contaminant the review also utilizes a molecular simulation tool to predict the nature of interactions among genx pfoa ac and anion exchange resins aes it will help determine the nature of interactions between genx and pfoa with ac and functional groups as well as ions present in an ae resin the review also identifies research gaps and recommends future work related to genx adsorption such as using advanced adsorbents and modified traditional adsorbents it serves as a comprehensive reference that addresses both the technical and economic aspects of genx removal from water and wastewater by adsorption 2 granular activated carbon and powdered activated carbon the non polarity nature of ac facilitates the removal of hydrophobic compounds such as genx and other pfas longer chain pfas have more affinity toward granular ac gac than genx and short chain pfas du et al 2015 table 1 provides a summary of the gac and powdered ac pac removal capabilities for genx and pfas it details experimental conditions such as ph equilibrium time and equilibrium adsorption capacity as well as adsorbent and adsorbate characteristics such as adsorbent dosage and initial adsorbate concentration 2 1 kinetics and isotherm of pfas adsorption on ac adsorption kinetic studies describe genx adsorption dynamics and equilibrium contact time pac and gac have different brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas which affect genx uptake for instance wang et al 2019a reported that for treating 0 152 mmol l 1 of genx at ph 4 and 0 1 g l 1 adsorbent dosage pac achieved faster equilibrium than gac but after equilibrium the removal efficiency of genx was similar as listed in table 1 pac offered a higher initial adsorption rate of 0 416 mmol g 1 h 1 in the first 3 h the adsorption data for 96 h followed a pseudo second order model for genx removal pac had a nearly 5 fold higher initial adsorption rate than gac while intra particle diffusion influenced genx uptake to gac it was insufficient to render gac superior to pac the adsorption kinetic differences in pac and gac may be attributed to attainable binding sites and intralayer interaction pfas adsorption by pac and gac followed a pseudo second order model wang et al 2019a indicating chemical adsorption occurs electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobicity are fundamental interactions in genx adsorption by ac according to the non linear fitting curves n 2 genx and pfoa are usually found together in water bodies brandsma et al 2019 gebbink et al 2017 and they compete for available binding sites on an adsorbent wang et al 2019b thus the kinetics of adsorption is limited by the capability of genx and or pfoa to occupy binding sites the dynamics of various adsorption processes are predicted and modeled using adsorption isotherms genx studies have reported adsorption isotherms by langmuir and freundlich models zhang et al 2021 table 1 however other isotherm models such as temkin and bet have not yet been investigated the temkin isotherm model expresses the adsorption thermodynamics it would reveal that the adsorption heat of genx reduces proportional to the occupation of binding sites on the adsorbent thus the temkin model would explain the chemisorption of anionic genx on ac and aes although genx adsorption is dominated by physical adsorption the role of chemical adsorption in genx removal is not insignificant and should be elucidated the bet isotherm model would reveal the type of genx adsorption occurring on the surface of the adsorbent this model would help researchers understand the role of adsorbent composition as well as the temperature and strength of genx interaction with adsorbents on genx removal it would therefore determine how much electrostatic interaction versus hydrophobic interaction plays a role in genx adsorption the adsorption of genx on ac was consistent with both the langmuir and freundlich models r2 0 90 but the langmuir model had a better fit r2 0 98 wang et al 2019a found no difference between gac and pac for genx uptake if all adsorbent binding sites are equally available genx adsorption is non ideal and reversible according to the expressed r2 values and is most likely monolayer adsorption genx uptake by ac under the following experimental conditions 0 1 g l 1 adsorbent dosage ph 4 and initial genx concentration of 0 06 0 91 mmol l 1 for 96 h showed slow surface diffusion on the adsorbent in the first 3 h considering the slow external mass transfer of genx and its monolayer adsorption genx adsorption is homogeneous microscopically even in adsorbents with irregular and amorphous surfaces thus diffusion might be the rate limiting factor in genx adsorption genx adsorption by ac is more physical than chemical additionally the surface of ac is assumed to be homogenous and the assumption is that genx molecules do not collide with each other during adsorption suggesting that monolayer adsorption occurs the energy interaction simulated by conductor like screening model for real solvents cosmo rs below in section 5 confirms that physical adsorption is prevalent in genx uptake by ac in order to have a sound comparison it is important to evaluate the kinetics and isotherms of pfoa versus genx pfoa adsorption on ac follows the pseudo second order model similar to genx adsorption kinetics deng et al 2015 qian et al 2017 xu et al 2020 pfoa adsorption rates were slower than genx and short chain pfas reaching equilibrium on gac after at least 168 h while pac reached equilibrium in 4 h because of the higher surface area and pore content per mass pac adsorption of pfoa reached equilibrium faster than gac yu et al 2009 pfoa adsorption on ac agreed with the freundlich and or langmuir models meng et al 2019 saeidi et al 2020 xu et al 2020 2 2 factors governing pfas adsorption on ac 2 2 1 pfas characteristics because of their shorter chains and fewer c f bonds genx and short chain pfas are less hydrophobic than long chain pfas as a result they are more mobile in water matrices and have higher critical micelle concentrations zhang et al 2011 genx forms a fast weak electrostatic bond with adsorbents and can be substituted by pfoa for longer contact times long chain pfas adsorb preferentially on ac due to their higher hydrophobicity while electrostatic bonding occurs in the adsorption of short chain pfas on ac it is much less important than their hydrophobicity according to du et al 2014 due to the differences in physio chemical properties genx partitions more quickly than pfoa on adsorbents since genx and other pfas have low negative log of the acid dissociation constant pka and are usually found in their anionic form net positive charged ac have a higher adsorption ability than zero charged ac park et al 2020b the hydrophobicity of genx versus longer chain pfas and its role in adsorption was examined wang et al 2019a the competitive effects of pfoa on genx adsorption by coconut shell based gac and pac were studied using a single solute method the amount of adsorbed genx 0 1 mmol g 1 was similar to pfoa at the start of adsorption but as contact time increased the amount of adsorbed genx 0 22 mmol g 1 decreased relative to pfoa 0 57 mmol g 1 by gac since genx bindings with active sites are unstable more hydrophobic pfoa replaced the adsorbed genx indicating that active sites on adsorbents are likely to associate with more hydrophobic compounds wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019a further reported that in the presence of pfoa the adsorption of genx by pac and gac differed genx adsorption on pac increased for the first 0 5 h and then decreased while the genx removal decrease on gac began after 24 h the time difference was caused by the limited number of active sites on ac since pac has a higher pore content than gac pfoa replaced genx faster on pac the bet surface area of pac was 745 m2 g 1 while it was 656 m2 g 1 for gac the adsorbed amounts of pfoa after 24 h in the bi solute system with genx were 0 6 and 0 4 mmol g 1 for pac and gac respectively the absorbed amounts of genx on the pac in the single and bi solute systems were 0 24 to 0 09 mmol g 1 respectively while for the gac they were 0 21 to 0 12 mmol g 1 respectively more available active sites resulted in faster adsorption of pfoa on pac than gac wang et al 2019a smaller molecular sizes of short chain pfas are the reason for faster equilibrium through a weak steric effect when pfoa adsorption reached equilibrium the removal efficiency of short chain pfas decreased because of their desorption and replacement by pfoa du et al 2015 sörengård sörengård et al 2020 evaluated 44 organic and inorganic adsorbents for removing pfas c3 to c17 from water and reported on the adsorption mechanisms including micelle formation stearic hindrance and geometrical change the polar region of the pfas is exposed on the outside of the structure while the non polar region forms the center and intensifies the negative charge of genx and other pfas making it easier for them to adsorb to the adsorbents stearic hindrance affects the reactivity of genx and other pfas ions allowing for more selective pfas ion adsorption by reducing unnecessary side reactions the helical twist in genx and other pfas structures particularly long chain pfas c8 c10 is caused by a chemical shift of cf3 and cf2 moieties influencing pfas adsorption 2 2 2 ph since genx and other pfas are present in aqueous environments in the form of anions the efficiency of ac adsorbents to remove these substances from the bulk phase increases in moderately acidic environments 3 ph 5 because under such conditions the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged favoring the adsorption of anionic compounds buck et al 2011 when the ph is below or above the ph of zero point of charge phzpc the surface of ac acquires a positive or negative charge and adsorbs preferentially anionic or cationic molecules respectively london dispersion forces are responsible for the tendency of ac to adsorb large and non polar molecules due to stronger dispersion forces leite et al 2012 organic contaminants in water adsorb on ac surfaces through van der waals forces which work in short distances between two molecules pollard et al 2016 when two molecules approach each other van der waals forces maximize then become repulsive as ph increases van der waals forces turn into repulsion and the removal efficiency of carbonaceous adsorbents decreases this phenomenon happens because of the chemical properties and surface charge changes of the adsorbent however the effect of longer chain pfas is more severe than genx and short chain pfas high adsorption of genx and other pfas by most of the adsorbents at low to neutral ph is because of the electrostatic attraction between deprotonated adsorbent surfaces and anionic pfas deng et al 2012 removal of genx by ac is sensitive to ph the phzpc for acidic ac is 3 2 wang et al 2019a and at ph between 2 and 3 2 the surface of acidic ac is positively charged and favors the adsorption of anionic genx the pka of genx is 2 84 usepa 2019a suggesting its existence in a wide range of ph as an anionic compound the pka for pfoa is 3 8 burns et al 2008 fig 1 shows the ionic forms of genx and pfoa and the surface charges of acidic and neutral ac at different solution ph under neutral and alkaline conditions where the surface charges of ac are neutral genx and pfoa are in their anionic forms suggesting that electrostatic interaction is not the main driving force in genx and pfoa adsorption by ac this characteristic of genx causes a rapid decrease in the efficacy of acidic ac at ph above 3 2 2 2 3 ac characteristics the surface area of an ac adsorbent plays a critical role in removing genx and other pfas appleman et al 2013 pore size is the most influential contributor to the surface area among physical characteristics such as total pore volume zeta potential and micropore volume wu et al 2020 the pore size of the ac significantly affects the rate of adsorption smaller pore size means more available functional groups on the ac the pore size of pac is almost 10 fold smaller than that of gac which means faster adsorption due to larger external surface area yu et al 2009 although it is not conclusive park et al 2020 demonstrated that the intraparticle diffusion of pfas tends to be independent of carbon pore size the contact time adsorbent surface charge and adsorbent dose also affect pfas removal pac has higher pfoa adsorption capacities than gac due to more pore content and active sites park et al 2020b pramanik et al 2015 used pac with a bet surface area of 880 m2 g 1 total pore volume of 0 365 cm3 g 1 and micropore volume of 0 154 cm3 g 1 for the removal of pfoa and pfos in water they experimented with gac with a bet surface area of 800 m2 g 1 total pore volume of 0 865 cm3 g 1 and micropore volume of 0 354 cm3 g 1 pac removed 68 of pfoa in 10 min while the corresponding efficiency for gac was 55 pramanik et al 2015 the observed difference was due to the higher surface area of pac than gac because the smaller particle sizes of pac decrease the internal diffusion distance of pfas to the adsorbent pac has more surface functional groups than gac allowing for more interactions with pfas pac and gac were used to remove genx from water their respective particle sizes were smaller than 100 mesh and in a range of 20 35 mesh the pac provided higher initial adsorption of genx than gac after 48 h both ac had comparable adsorption capacities after 48 h and the particle size was not a significant factor in genx removal wang et al 2019a however in another study the performance of ac for genx removal varied considerably with ac particle size and contact time wu et al 2020 filtrasorb 400 m calgon carbon co pittsburgh pa with particle sizes of 1000 1700 µm 425 850 µm 125 212 µm and 10 75 µm in milli q water after 4 h of contact time removed 37 6 29 8 98 1 and 99 5 of genx respectively wu et al 2020 significant increases in filtrasorb 400 m performance with decreasing particle size indicate that intra particle diffusion is a dominant adsorption mechanism in genx removal the better efficiency of smaller particle sizes might be due to the availability of more binding sites for genx molecules on the adsorbent increasing contact time resulted in higher removal of genx filtrasorb 400 m with a particle size of 425 850 µm removed 7 9 29 8 45 0 81 4 and 92 2 of genx 1 mg l 1 at 0 5 4 8 24 and 48 h respectively the smaller ac particle size led to faster genx uptake kinetics due to higher specific external surface area 2 2 4 presence of organic and inorganic ions dissolved organic matter dom diffuses and moves faster than hydrophobic pfas due to their higher adsorption affinity and probably blocks ac pores and competes for active adsorption sites a decrease more than 2 fold in pfoa adsorption via pac and gac was observed as the dom concentration measured as dissolved organic carbon doc increased from 5 to 25 mg l 1 pramanik et al 2015 the adsorption of genx on ac decreases when other pfas especially those with longer chains are present genx is often found in the water environment with pfoa brandsma et al 2019 gebbink et al 2017 pfoa is longer and more hydrophobic than genx and replaces the genx on adsorption sites causing a decrease in genx uptake wang et al 2019a because of their molecular size genx and short chain pfas can reach ac pores faster than long chain pfas occupying the available active sites wang et al 2019a du et al 2015 dom inhibits short chain pfas adsorption on ac but the effect is less significant than that of long chain pfas park et al 2020b interestingly in another study the presence of dom increased pfas removal by gac and had a positive effect on pfas removal from two freshwater lakes in sweden kothawala et al 2017 this result contradicts the findings from prior studies mcnamara et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 yu et al 2012 that dom occupies active sites leading to a decrease in pfas adsorption a possible reason for the positive effect of dom on pfas adsorption is co adsorption as well as the formation of doc pfas complexes due to hydrophobic interactions between dom and pfas kothawala et al 2017 campos pereira et al 2018 reported that short chain pfas removal efficiency increased in an environment with added cations such as al3 2 mm ca2 5 mm ca2 3 mm and na 10 mm cations facilitate the binding of pfas to the surface of adsorbents by neutralizing the negative charge on adsorbent surfaces the presence of inorganic anions such as f cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 showed no distinct correlation with removal efficiencies of genx and other pfas although it was expected that the anions might compete with anionic genx and other pfas for the available active sites on the ac wu et al 2020 2 2 5 adsorbent dosage adsorption dosage is one of the controlling factors in determining treatment cost generally increasing the adsorbent dose increases genx and other pfas removal performance however the adsorption capacity may decrease to date there has been only one study evaluating the effects of different adsorbent dosages on genx adsorption by ac sun et al 2016 investigated the effect of adsorbent dosage on removing a wide range of pfas including genx and pfoa in cape fear river water by a wood based pac the spiked concentration of genx and pfoa in the river water was 1 mg l 1 the genx adsorption to the wood based pac at doses of 30 60 and 100 mg l 1 were 18 30 and 38 respectively after 130 h while pfoa removal increased from 55 to 85 and then 95 respectively sun et al 2016 these results indicate a more significant effect of adsorbent dosage on pfoa removal than genx removal 2 2 6 regeneration the temperature of water used for thermal regeneration of gac directly relates to the genx removal ability of the regenerated gac increasing the temperature from 25 c to 92 c improved ac reactivation by almost 28 from 32 7 to 60 8 wang et al 2019a additionally an increase in the volume of hot water improved ac reactivation gac regeneration increased by 10 when the initial volume of 100 ml of hot water was increased by 50 ml adding nacl to water containing gac previously used for genx removal has a positive effect at first however as the nacl concentration increases from 0 5 to 1 at 92 c genx water solubility decreases and reduces gac regeneration efficacy wang et al 2019a based on the effectiveness of nacl for ac regeneration and since chloride is common in most genx contaminated waters the presence of chloride could affect genx adsorption the concentration of chloride is the determining factor in this case the chloride concentration has to be very high for the regeneration while typical chloride concentrations in genx contaminated water groundwater and non saline surface water are relatively low therefore it is likely that the effect of chloride ions favorable or unfavorable on genx adsorption by ac would be minimal naoh also has an adverse effect on gac regeneration as adding 0 5 naoh to water at 92 c reduced regeneration by 33 from 75 to 50 while using 100 ethanol instead of 30 ethanol at 25 c was effective and increased the regeneration of spent gac from 80 to 95 wang et al 2019a the pfas removal capacity of reactivated gac can decrease with each regeneration cycle boone et al 2019 experimented with 29 drinking water treatment plants dwtps and discovered that dwtps that frequently regenerated their gac or used brand new gac had higher removal efficiencies versus spent gac 3 anion exchange resins aes are widely used in pfas removal due to their high removal efficiencies ae is costlier but has better removal for genx and other pfas than ac woodard et al 2017 some critical factors for genx and other pfas removal by ae such as ph regeneration time resin bead sizes resin matrix hydrophobicity and functional groups are discussed in detail below table 2 lists ae adsorbents and their performance in genx removal 3 1 kinetics and isotherms aes and ac have completely different adsorption kinetics yu et al 2009 the adsorption of genx onto aes is slower than ac at the beginning of the process wang et al 2019a the adsorption kinetics of genx in aes is a function of charge density the driving force for adsorption is the initial ion concentration as the charge density of the aes increases the adsorption occurs faster the genx adsorption kinetics for an initial concentration of 10 µg l 1 in di water best fitted to pseudo second order kinetics compared to pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics with r2 0 9 0 8 and 0 7 respectively the pseudo second order model does not specify the driving forces of adsorption it only indicates that chemical adsorption occurs dixit et al 2020b two resins polyacrylic ira67 with the functional group of polyamine alkyl group of 3 dimethylaminopropyl and exchange capacity of 5 6 meq g 1 and polystyrene ira400 with the functional group of quaternary ammonium an alkyl group of benzyl trimethyl and exchange capacity of 3 8 meq g 1 were used for the adsorption of genx in water ira67 0 237 mmol g 1 h 1 demonstrated a higher initial adsorption rate v0 than ira400 0 148 mmol g 1 h 1 table 2 ira67 had a higher affinity toward hydrophilic compounds and initial genx adsorption followed intra particle diffusion the polyacrylic matrix of ira67 can adsorb more water volume due to its hydrophilic nature than the polystyrene matrix of ira400 thus the faster rate of genx kinetics by ira67 can be justified in this way the equilibrium occurred for both resins after almost 48 h and the langmuir isotherm had higher r2 than the freundlich model despite having a lower initial adsorption kinetics aes adsorbed more genx and other pfas than ac wang et al 2019a in another study with the basic anion exchange resin purolite a860 dixit et al 2020a reported that the adsorption isotherms for different resin dosages of 10 1000 mg l 1 and initial genx concentrations of 0 1 10 µg l 1 agreed with the freundlich model r2 0 97 0 99 they also evaluated the genx isotherms in the presence of natural organic matter nom from the suwanee river and reported decreases in isotherm parameters freundlich exponent and coefficient in the presence of 5 100 mg l 1 of suwanee river nom srnom for 24 h the value of 1 n for the freundlich isotherm decreased from 0 8 to 0 6 the most affected isotherm parameter was the freundlich coefficient which dropped drastically from 776 μeq meq 1 μeq l 1 1 n in deionized water to 113 μeq meq 1 μeq l 1 1 n in the presence of srnom the uptake of genx by purolite a860 was in agreement with the release of equivalently charged chloride purolite a860 and pfas specific resin a592e polystyrenic resin with complex amino functional groups and 0 9 eq l 1 charge density removed genx at an initial concentration of 10 µg l 1 to below 10 ng l 1 in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 srnom water the a860 resin removed genx in di water to a concentration below 10 ng l 1 in 45 min while it took 140 min to achieve the same in dom rich water for the a592e resin the corresponding time periods were 15 min in di water and 50 min in dom rich water dixit et al 2021a table 2 this suggests faster kinetics of the a592e than a860 resin for adsorption of genx in di and dom rich water the drastic difference in v0 between a592e and a860 might be attributed to the polymer structure functional groups and resin s charge density polystyrene a592e attracts genx more than polyacrylic a860 because of its chemical structure the quaternary ammonium functional groups in a860 are attached to four r groups whereas complex amino functional groups in a592e are nh moieties it is easier for anionic genx to bind with nh than n r4 moieties genx is in an anionic form in water at typical ph 5 9 dixit et al 2021a thus the charge and density of the adsorbent are crucial to its adsorption capacity an adsorbent with a higher charge positive density has more capacity for genx removal 3 2 factors governing pfas adsorption by anion exchange resins 3 2 1 pfas characteristics the sulfonic and carboxylic ends of pfas play significant roles in pfas adsorption three aes with the same supporting polymeric material polystyrene but different structures macroporous and gel like were evaluated for pfas adsorption zaggia et al 2016 pfas with sulfonic functional groups such as perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs had higher adsorption than pfas with carboxylic functional groups such as perfluorobutanoic acid pfba long chain pfas such as pfoa and pfos demonstrated higher removal rates on aes than short chain pfas such as pfbs and pfba park et al 2020a zaggia et al 2016 the fact that longer chain pfas regardless of their functional groups have higher affinity than shorter chain pfas shows that functional groups only matter substantially when comparing pfas with the same chain lengths genx and short chain pfas reach equilibrium faster than long chain pfas due to their smaller molecular size and fewer cf2 moieties dixit et al 2020b genx and pfbs reach equilibrium within the first 48 h while pfos and pfoa reach equilibrium after 96 h wang et al 2019b an inverse linear relationship was observed between genx concentration at a low range 0 1 50 µg l 1 and its adsorption capacity dixit et al 2020b reported that when genx s initial concentration increases from 0 5 to 50 µg l 1 the equilibrium adsorption capacity increases significantly from 5 to 85 neq meq 1 3 2 2 ph the removal of genx and other pfas by aes is a function of pfas and ae charge anionic or cationic and or solution ph acidic or basic resins with different functional groups respond to ph differently as reported by wang et al 2019a ira67 with a polyamine functional group is not effective 0 removal for genx removal at ph 2 however as ph increases to 4 genx removal increases 60 and then returns to 0 at ph 10 table 2 the reason for 0 removal at ph 2 is that genx has a pka of 2 84 and exists as an uncharged compound at ph 2 genx removal increases in the ph range of 2 10 due to the amine functional group on the ira67 polyamine with a pka of 9 5 the polyamine protonated at ph below 9 and positively charged ira67 can adsorb anionic genx another resin ira400 with a polystyrene functional group removed more genx when increasing ph from 2 to 6 20 to 55 and slightly less genx 45 when the ph was increased to 10 wang et al 2019a dixit et al 2019 evaluated the effect of solution ph on the removal of pfoa 10 µg l 1 by an acrylic based strong basic anionic macroporous ae dosage of 100 mg l 1 as solution ph increases the removal efficiency drops significantly 99 at ph 4 7 and 12 at ph 10 this significant decrease in removal efficiency indicates that electrostatic interactions decrease as the ph increases dixit et al 2019 there is an inverse linear relationship between ph and available active sites on aes the number of accessible active sites decreases as the ph changes from acidic to basic this reduces the adsorbed amount of genx and other pfas leading to lower removal efficacy by aes wang et al 2019b 3 3 3 anion exchange resin characteristics one of the significant issues in ae adsorption is the selectivity between the adsorbent and the adsorbate this interaction allows pfas to be removed more exclusively and at a higher rate in addition functional groups on resins as well as resin core material and porosity are other factors that influence pfas adsorption deng et al 2010 hydrophobic interaction has a crucial role in adsorption by ae and thus the characteristics of coated functional groups on ae are critical to genx and other pfas adsorption resins with hydrophobic functional groups have remarkable abilities to adsorb genx and other pfas due to hydrophobic interactions gagliano et al 2020 the main limiting factors of adsorption capacity are exchange sites however ion exchange is not the only force involved in pfas adsorption if ion exchange interaction is the sole force and active sites are accessible then the capacity of resin for adsorption of all pfas should be the same wang et al 2019b besides film and pore diffusion are two mechanisms responsible for the uptake of genx and other pfas by ae film diffusion controls genx uptake by purolite a860 a microporous acrylate based resin in dom free waters while pore diffusion controls uptake in waters with low total organic carbon toc 2 5 mg l 1 dixit et al 2020b 3 3 4 co contaminant effects on adsorption of pfas concentrations of organic and inorganic ions impact the service period of aes dom has a negative impact and decreases the adsorption of pfas on aes increasing the concentration of dom from 2 to 8 mg doc l 1 only decreases the removal efficiency by 10 kothawala et al 2017 note that at a higher doc concentration 20 mg doc l 1 the breakthrough volumes for genx and pfoa were similar 9500 500 bed volume bv consequently resin binding sites at 20 mg doc l 1 9500 500 bv became saturated earlier than low doc concentrations 2 8 mg doc l 1 30 000 500 bv in the presence of genx and other pfas that occupied more active sites the charge density of dom had a negative relationship with genx removal increasing the charge density resulted in higher competition among genx and dom dixit et al 2020a the presence of srnom 5 mg doc l 1 had a significant negative impact on the pseudo second order rate constant of genx adsorption 0 65 neq meq 1 min 1 and reduced it by almost 30 the adsorption capacity of genx dropped 2 fold in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 srnom the magnitudes of freundlich distribution factor kf for genx adsorption in different water matrices were distilled water 776 42 µeq meq 1 µeq l 1 1 n srnom recycled wastewater 113 21 µeq meq 1 µeq l 1 1 n river water 102 13 µeq meq 1 µeq l 1 1 n the reason behind the different adsorption capacities of genx in the four mentioned water matrices was the nom level dixit et al 2020b genx is often found in pfoa rich waters and thus wang et al 2019a used two resins ira67 and ira400 to evaluate the competition of genx and pfoa with identical initial concentrations 0 152 mmol l 1 and resin dosages 0 04 g l 1 in a bi solute system the adsorption of genx in the presence of pfoa increased in the first 6 h due to shorter chain length and higher motility however the genx adsorption plummeted after 24 h whereas pfoa replaced genx on the adsorption sites reducing genx removal to almost 0 they also used the resins to remove genx in a single solute system and compared the adsorbed amount of genx uptake with the bi solute system in a single solute system the genx uptake decreased from 2 68 to 2 73 mmol g 1 to 0 64 and 0 50 mmol g 1 in ira400 and ira67 respectively 3 3 5 regeneration the use of a solvent or hot water as a regeneration method for genx ladened aes was investigated wang et al 2019a zaggia et al 2016 zaggia et al 2016 conducted an adsorption experiment with three highly efficient aes for pfas a532e a520e and a600e in batch and continuous pilot plants for pfos and pfoa removal and evaluated their regeneration capabilities by various inorganic and organic salts and alcohols with different concentrations such as nacl naoh kcl koh nh4oh nh4cl ch3oh nh4cl and ch3ch2oh nh4cl spent a532e showed negligible regeneration however the other two aes had high reactivation yields a520e had the best performance after three regeneration cycles its performance dropped only 15 while that of a600e decreased to half hot water has been used to regenerate aes as water temperature has a significant effect on the regeneration of aes wang et al 2019a reported that an increase in temperature from 25 c to 92 c led to a higher regeneration percentage from 80 to 100 spent ira67 and ira400 had 96 and 100 regeneration respectively when treated with 0 5 nacl at 92 c wang et al 2019a dixit et al 2021a reported that aes could be regenerated under saline conditions 10 nacl with 1 ml of resin the a860 resin removed genx to below 70 ng l 1 with a breakthrough of 23 500 500 bv and was capable of removing genx to 70 ng l 1 for six more cycles after regeneration 4 comparisons between activated carbon and anion exchange resins as adsorbents for genx and pfoa both ac and aes can treat genx and pfoa but aes are a more promising choice with higher removal efficiency the following subsections compare the effects of different factors characteristics governing genx and pfoa removal performance by ac and aes these factors characteristics include kinetics and adsorption isotherms ph co contaminant presence and regeneration 4 1 kinetics and adsorption isotherms the kinetics of genx uptake on ac is faster than aes while the adsorption of genx on ac reaches equilibrium faster than on aes the slower genx and pfoa uptake kinetics for aes under ac is attributed to the adsorption driving force and mechanism wang et al 2019a as mentioned above hydrophobic interactions are the prevalent adsorption mechanism in ac while ion exchange is the driving force of genx adsorption for aes wang et al 2019a it takes more time for aes to build up charge density while for ac intra particle diffusion starts when genx is in contact with ac genx and pfoa removal kinetics are best fitted by pseudo second order model for both types of adsorbents genx and pfoa adsorption isotherms for both types of adsorbents follow langmuir and freundlich models wang et al 2019a 4 2 ph ph affects the removal performances of genx and pfoa by ac and aes for ac genx and pfoa removal is primarily dependent on its surface charge a positive surface charge can adsorb genx and pfoa more favorably since these two contaminants are found in their anionic forms in water wang et al 2019a thus as long as the surface of ac is positively charged there are available active sites in a ph range of 3 to 5 ac provides higher removal of genx and pfoa in a moderately acidic environment the phzpc of the ac surface for instance phzpc 3 2 wang et al 2019a which determines the surface charge of ac and the solution ph which governs the forms of genx and pfoa protonated versus deprotonated are both favorable positive surface charge for ac and deprotonated form of the contaminants for contaminant removal in other ph ranges ac can remove genx and pfoa however the efficiency will drop various resin types have been used in aes for genx and pfoa removal each resin type has a distinct functional group these functional groups in ae protonates or deprotonates according to the solution ph for instance an ae with a polyamine functional group specifically 3 dimethylaminopropyl as its alkyl group has a pka of 9 79 when ph is higher than 10 3 methylaminopropyl is in its protonated form as wang et al 2019a reported the genx removal efficiency is 0 when the ph is higher than 10 ph below 10 is favorable for this resin type however genx s pka is 2 84 meaning that the ph must be higher than the pka for genx to be in its anionic form thus the optimum removal efficiency for genx with this particular resin type is in the ph range of 3 to 10 4 3 effect of co contaminant s in general organic and inorganic co contaminants in genx contaminated waters compete for the available binding sites on adsorbents and have an adverse effect on genx removal mcnamara et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 yu et al 2012 an increase in dom concentration significantly decreased pfoa removal efficiency by ac pramanik et al 2015 however there is a contradictory report by kothawala et al 2017 demonstrating a positive effect of dom on pfas due to formation of dom pfoa complexes that facilitated pfoa adsorption by ac in the same study kothawala et al 2017 reported that the presence of dom decreased the pfoa removal efficiency by aes the presence of dom negatively affects genx removal by ac but the effect was weaker than that of pfoa park et al 2020b dom had a similar impact on genx removal efficiency by aes dixit et al 2020b inorganic anions did not affect genx removal efficiency by ac campos pereira et al 2018 while inorganic cations facilitated genx uptake on the surface of ac and increased genx removal efficiency wu et al 2020 there has been no report on the effect of inorganic cations and or anions on the genx removal performance by aes the presence of other pfas especially long chain pfas negatively affects genx removal efficiency by both types of adsorbents wang et al 2019a pfoa has higher hydrophobicity 8 carbons in its structure but slower diffusion compared with genx 6 carbons in its structure hence genx showed faster diffusion on ac and aes than pfoa however pfoa replaced genx on the surface of ac or aes as the contact time increased wang et al 2019a 4 4 regeneration the binding sites of ac and aes can be regenerated by washing with solvents and hot water wang et al 2019a dixit et al 2021a increasing water temperature improves the reactivation of ac and aes in addition solvents such as nacl naoh and ethanol affected the regeneration of ac ethanol had a positive influence on ac regeneration while naoh had a negative effect nacl had mixed effects based on its concentration wang et al 2019a for aes nacl had a positive effect on aes regeneration dixit et al 2021a due to the adsorption driving force in aes solvents such as nacl naoh kcl koh nh4oh nh4cl ch3oh nh4cl and ch3ch2oh nh4cl proved to be effective in regenerating active sites on two out of three aes zaggia et al 2016 another approach for the regeneration of ac is combustion the heat from combustion can break strong c f bonds zhang and liang 2021 however there is no reported peer reviewed article on the reactivation efficiency of ac for genx removal through combustion 5 genx and pfoa treatability by adsorption breakthrough curves normalized contaminant concentration c c0 versus dimensionless time θ are used to evaluate the performance of adsorbents in removing contaminants information on adsorbent capacity and adsorption rates was analyzed to compare the treatability of genx and pfoa by ac based on the breakthrough the θ for c c0 to reach 0 5 is θm the equilibrium adsorption capacity as well as the bulk density of ac and initial concentrations of genx and pfoa obtained from wang et al 2019a were used to determine θm based on a symmetrical breakthrough curve assumption genx in single solute and bi solute with pfoa reach c c0 0 5 at θm 0 121 and 0 063 respectively while the θm of pfoa is 4 4 times later than that of genx in the bi solute the implication of the faster half breakthrough point for genx than pfoa is that ac preferentially removes pfoa over genx and the treatability of genx is more challenging than pfoa approximately 4 new regenerated sets of gac 0 08 g l 1 are required to treat genx c0 0 152 mmol l 1 while only one set of gac is required to treat the same initial concentration of pfoa note that the primary driving force of genx and pfoa adsorption by ac is their hydrophobicity and the observed breakthrough difference is attributed to less hydrophobicity of genx compared to pfoa adsorption of genx requires more ac implying a higher operating cost the interaction energies of pfoa and genx with ac and their interaction nature with ae resin were predicted by cosmo rs model in cosmo rs quantum chemistry approaches in combination with statistical thermodynamic calculations are used in cosmo rs calculations the molecules are surrounded by a virtual conductor environment and the interactions are considered to take place on segments of this perfect ideal conductor interface klamt et al 2010 klamt and eckert 2000 a distribution function achieves the complete description of the molecule screening charge density σ over the whole surface of the molecule called σ profile that describes molecular interactions fused aromatic rings were used as a model for ac to determine the interaction energies between pollutants and ac masson et al 2017 in this review ovalene 36 carbon atoms and 14 hydrogen atoms was used to model the ac s aromatic planes purolite a860 was recently used as a treatment media for pfas including genx purolite a860 is a macroporous polyacrylic resin which is crosslinked with divinylbenzene in purolite a860 quaternary ammonium and chloride ions are used as a functional group and ionic form respectively in cosmo rs cations quaternary ammonium and anions chloride are considered as separate entities therefore simulating the exact complete structure of purolite a860 is not possible to overcome this issue divinylbenzene dimethylethanolammonium a quaternary ammonium group which is used in type ii strongly basic anion exchange resin as a functional group and chloride ions were considered as separate entities for a molecular simulation the charge densities of genx pfoa ovalene dimethylethanolammonium divinylbenzene and chloride anions were first ascertained by using turbomole software negative σ represents a molecule s ability to donate hydrogen while positive σ is the hydrogen bond accepting characteristics based on surface charge densities cosmo rs was used to determine the interaction energies and σ profiles for turbomole and cosmo rs a triple zeta valence polarized basis set and the hybrid b3lyp method respectively were used for molecular surface σ and thermophysical calculations fig 2 a shows that the interactions of genx and pfoa with ac ovalene are mainly through van der waals forces as charge neutral compounds pfoa and genx were used to calculate the van der waals energies because ovalene is a charge neutral compound and the cosmo rs simulation requires the overall charge to be neutral the van der waals energy value of pfoa 9 31 kj mol 1 is higher than genx 8 31 kj mol 1 this indicates more spontaneous adsorption in the case of pfoa than that of genx the hydrogen bond energy values are lower than van der waals energy values for both pfoa 0 34 kj mol 1 and genx 0 18 kj mol 1 note that the cosmo rs model only considers surface chemistry in the calculations therefore the interaction within the pores of carbon ovalene cannot be simulated commercial genx is usually in an ammonium salt form the ammonium and proton of the carboxylic acid functional group dissociate when dissolved in water resulting in an anionic form of genx hopkins et al 2018 the anionic ester form of pfoa octanoate is dominant at typical ph values for natural water therefore the anionic forms of genx and pfoa were used to evaluate their interactions with ae resin the σ of genx pfoa and ae divinylbenzene dimethylethanol ammonium and chloride ions are shown in fig 2 b generally the sigma profile is divided into three regions the first part where σ 0 01 e å 2 shows the hydrogen bond donor region e å 2 represents a unit for electron per area in square angstrom the second part extending between 0 01 σ 0 01 e å 2 represents the non polar region and the third part where σ 0 01 e å 2 shows the hydrogen bond acceptor region any molecules with σ profiles to the left of 0 01 e å 2 will have hydrogen bond donor abilities while those to the right of 0 01 e å 2 will have hydrogen bond acceptor abilities fig 2 b indicates that the σ of both genx and pfoa have larger peaks in the non polar region and smaller peaks in hydrogen accepting regions dimethylethanolammonium is more aligned with a hydrogen bond donor than a hydrogen bond acceptor while in the case of chloride the σ shows it as a hydrogen bond accepting entity in the case of divinylbenzene none of these characteristics hydrogen bond donating and accepting were observed therefore no ionic interaction is expected between divinylbenzene and pfoa and genx however a non polar hydrophobic interaction is possible between divinylbenzene and pfoa and genx dixit et al 2019 reported that pfoa removal via ae purolite a860 involved an equivalent exchange of chloride with minimal influence of hydrophobic adsorption the chloride ions on ae are displaced by pfoa and genx which attach to the ammonium group of dimethylethanolammonium through hydrogen bonding pfoa and genx are hydrogen bond acceptor molecules while dimethylethanolammonium is a hydrogen bond donor molecule therefore the more hydrogen donating characteristics of the cationic part of the ae resin the better pfoa and genx removal will be 6 unconventional adsorbents ac and aes have an affinity for other organics and or inorganics in water so it might be challenging for them to selectively remove fluorinated chemicals including genx in the presence of humic acid for instance the capacity of aes pfa 694e purolite to remove genx was less than 20 confirming the adsorption competition between humic acid and pfas kumarasamy et al 2020 another issue is that the levels of organic contaminants in natural water are higher than those of genx and pfas and gac has more binding affinity for them than that of traditional and emerging pfas including genx resulting in pfas desorption over time for example data from the sweeney dwtp wilmington north carolina revealed that the effluent concentrations of genx and perfluoro 4 methoxybutanoic acid pfmoba 19 8 ng l 1 for genx and 7 62 ng l 1 for pfmoba were higher than those of the influent of a gac column 17 6 ng l 1 for genx and not detectable for pfmoba kumarasamy et al 2020 the higher levels of the two pfas in the treated water were due to their desorption from the gac surface hopkins et al 2018 also found that the concentration of genx in a water treatment plant effluent was 28 higher than the concentration in the influent due to genx desorption from older gac multiple adsorbents other than ac and aes have been tested and exhibited more selectivity for genx table 3 summarizes these adsorbents and their performance for genx removal 6 1 ionic fluorogel resin kumarasamy et al 2020 synthesized an ionic fluorogel resin to selectively treat a mixture of pfoa perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and genx in simulated natural water 200 mg l 1 nacl and 20 mg l 1 humic acids in di water the ionic fluorogel resin was synthesized through radical copolymerization of azobis isobutyronitrile with methacrylate chain end functionality fluorolink md 700 and 2 dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate the ionic fluorogel 100 mg l 1 containing 20 40 wt quaternary ammonium comonomer ammonium comonomer was responsible for incorporating permanent charge and efficient surface wetting during pfas removal removed 98 100 of genx pfoa and pfhxa in 21 h at an initial concentration of 50 µg l 1 for each pfas at a lower adsorbent dose 10 mg l 1 and an initial concentration of each pfas 1 µg l 1 better pfoa removal 97 was achieved than those of genx 80 88 and pfhxa 76 82 in 21 h only 25 removal of pfoa and no genx and pfhxa removal were observed without incorporating quaternary ammonium into the ionic fluorogel indicating the importance of quaternary ammonium in the removal of the three pfas the ionic fluorogel was regenerated 5 times by a methanolic ammonium acetate solution without losing adsorption capacity gac filtrasorb 400 pac picahydro mp23 lenntech and an anion exchange resin pfa 694e purolite had significantly lower genx removal compared to the ionic fluorogel when tested in a similar environment 6 2 modified poly ethylene glycol diacrylate pegda for genx removal three types of hydrogel sorbents were synthesized through the fluoridation amination and bifunctionalization amination fluoridation of pegda huang et al 2018 no genx 100 mg l 1 removal was observed using fluoridated pegda hydrogel 10 mg 5 ml in 12 h the genx adsorption capacities of aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel were 86 7 5 1 and 98 7 3 9 μmol g 1 respectively both aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel had positive surface charges 39 0 and 31 4 mv respectively whereas the charge was negative 27 1 mv for fluoridated pegda hydrogel given the hydrophobic nature and negative charge on genx electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were responsible for removing the aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel the effects of ph competing ions and other organic contaminants such as nom were not studied incubation of spent aminated and bifunctionalized pegda hydrogel sorbents with 70 methanol in 1 nacl for 12 h at 150 rpm showed 84 and 73 genx desorption respectively the ability of the regenerated hydrogels for removing genx was not tested huang et al 2018 6 3 covalent organic frameworks ji et al 2018 used covalent organic frameworks cofs with surface areas of 1000 m2 g 1 as adsorbents to remove 13 different pfas including genx azide and amine were separately coated on cofs at various loadings to increase the adsorption of genx at an initial concentration of 200 µg l 1 of genx cofs with no and maximum loadings of azide were able to remove small amounts of genx 5 efficiency while removal by amine coated cofs ranged 60 to 95 an amine coating of 10 to 28 of the maximum loading which was not clearly defined on the cofs delivered more than 90 genx removal efficiency to demonstrate the effectiveness of aminated cofs on genx removal two other adsorbents gac particle size 1000 μm and pac particle size 10 75 μm were used under similar environmental conditions aminated cofs 91 had higher removal efficiency than gac 0 and pac 72 the entities responsible for genx adsorption were polar functional groups the interaction of amine groups with the anionic end of genx and other pfas and the cofs hydrophobic surfaces 6 4 poly n 3 dimethylamino propyl acrylamide methyl chloride quaternary ateia et al 2019 introduced a new cationic polymer hydrogel n 3 dimethylamino propyl acrylamide methyl chloride quaternary dmapaa q capable of adsorbing genx and other pfas in treated wastewater and surface water with high removal efficiency 85 and high selectivity 80 this hydrogel was not ph dependent for genx or other pfas removal and had high removal efficiency in the ph range of 4 10 dmapaa q showed no attenuation in pfas removal in the presence of highly concentrated dom 2 5 0 3 106 times higher than pfas for the first 24 h although dom concentration was similar in surface water and wastewater due to the presence of anionic compounds so4 2 cl no3 in treated wastewater the removal of genx and other pfas dropped by 10 20 showing that anions compete with pfas to occupy active sites the results showed that by increasing the concentration of dom by 2 fold removal efficiency only decreased 5 10 the polymer hydrogel was regenerated for 6 cycles and retained the genx removal capacity at almost 100 after each regeneration cycle 6 5 β cyclodextrin polymers two cyclodextrin polymers cdps consisting of β cyclodextrin monomers crosslinked with rigid aromatics containing weakly basic amine cdp or permanently cationic dexsorb functional groups were used to remove genx hydrophobic interactions were the primary mechanisms for genx removal however cdps protonated crosslinkers also provided alternate active sites for anionic genx via electrostatic attraction the genx removal experiments were conducted with an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 for three water samples milli q water and two groundwater samples both cdps removed genx 93 after 4 h of contact time in milli q water the genx removal efficiency by two cdps was reduced considerably to 10 30 for the groundwater samples this decrease was due to groundwater chemistry such as cation and anion concentrations dexsorb showed better efficiency than amine cdp in genx removal in groundwater a possible reason for the higher efficiency of dexsorb might be the cationic functional groups on its surface table 3 shows the difference in removal efficiency of dexsorb and amine cdp wu et al 2020 7 treatment costs besides contaminant removal efficiency the treatment cost plays a vital role in adopting a removal technology therefore it is necessary to estimate the treatment cost for genx removal in water using the data available in the literature the cost criterion comprises the technology implementation costs and the long term operational and maintenance o m costs the detailed cost analysis includes total capital costs direct and indirect direct expenses include the cost of land construction equipment treatment transportation and disposal while engineering expenses and contingency allowances are part of indirect costs ch2m hill 2018 the usepa drinking water treatment technology unit cost model was developed using a bottom up approach known as work breakdown structure wbs for cost estimation usepa 2019b pfoa as a representative of long chain pfas was selected to compare its removal cost with genx using the wbs model in the wbs model there are two main options for determining the bed life of gac and ae resin the options are using 1 freundlich isotherm data and 2 bed volume before required regeneration the latter option was used corresponding to a 70 5 breakthrough of the sorbent gac ae resin to estimate the treatment costs of genx and pfoa the experimented data from two peer reviewed articles were used to obtain credible genx and pfoa treatment costs in the wbs model for genx it was reported that gac reached a 74 breakthrough after treating approximately 5000 bed volumes of genx contaminated water hopkins et al 2018 whereas in the case of pfoa it was 42 500 bed volumes mccleaf et al 2017 the bed volume numbers needed to achieve 68 70 of the breakthrough for genx and pfoa using anion exchange resin were 62 500 and 50 000 respectively hopkins et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 detailed input values including vessel design are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the total capital costs which include direct capital costs vessel treatment media piping and construction indirect costs geotechnical electrical and site work along with process engineering and add on costs permits pilot study and land cost are the same for the treatment of pfoa and genx by gac in contrast the annual o m costs of treating genx are about 4 15 times higher than pfoa no option is available in the wbs model for selecting a specific type brand of gac fig 3 is based on 5500 households served and 3 0 people per household the annual cost of treating almost 4 m3 of genx per year is us 1 53 while it is around three times less us 0 58 for pfoa based on 30 3 years of useful life reciprocal weighted average and a 7 discount rate the defined 7 is correspondent to the real discount rate it values marginal pretax profitability for average investments by private sectors after ignoring the projected inflation the 7 discount rate was established through an economic analysis performed by the u s office of management and budget carter and nesbitt 2016 the annual cost per household for treating genx and pfoa contaminated water per year using gac are us 224 and us 85 respectively note that the annual o m costs and annual costs are different the direct and total capital costs associated with ae resin type i strong base polystyrenic gel are the same for both genx and pfoa the annual o m costs for treating genx and pfoa using the ae resin are comparable us 156 594 for genx and us 157 482 for pfoa rinsate backwash costs are included in the o m costs the slight difference in the annual o m costs is probably due to the difference in the removal capacities of the ae resin for genx and pfoa the volumes of saturated and diluted brine provided by the wbs model are 4 and 24 m3 per vessel per regeneration respectively the regeneration frequency per vessel is 217 days since genx is a toxic compound for the characteristics of spent brine in the wbs model the hazardous option was chosen among hazardous non hazardous radioactive and radioactive hazardous options hazardous waste disposal was chosen among the five available discharge methods in the wbs model for spent brine handling including publicly owned treatment works septic tank surface water evaporation pond and hazardous waste disposal hazardous waste disposal which is the most environmentally sound option involves spent brine incineration which can break down genx and pfoa zhang and liang 2021 and turn them into less or non hazardous substances based on the wbs model backwashing occurs every 48 h at a backwash rate of 29 m3 h 1 per square meter of a vessel and a backwash duration of 10 min the usepa 2002 recommended that if there is a holding tank with or without coagulant addition the spent backwash can be directly discharged to surface water or publicly owned treatment works returning the spent backwash at 5 to 10 of the influent flow to the headend of the treatment plant is also acceptable usepa 2002 the annual cost of treating almost 4 m3 of genx and pfoa by ae is equivalent us 0 54 at a discount rate of 7 and a useful life reciprocal weighted average of 37 5 years the annual cost per household per year for treating both pfoa and genx is us 79 the wbs model shows that the annual o m costs using gac for genx and pfoa are 6 42 and 1 54 times higher than the selected ae resin the resin type is crucial in designing the aes and directly influences the cost of genx removal multiple considerations must be taken into account when using different resin types including the resin cost in addition different resin types have different optimum empty bed contact times ebcts which ultimately affect the total cost of the process furthermore the regeneration cost varies with resin type thus different types of resin have different direct capital costs and o m costs resin type has more influence on o m costs than capital costs as the resin cost makes up a very small fraction of the capital cost 0 09 the cost estimate demonstrated here is just one case based a specific ae type i strong base polystyrenic gel for example if another type of resin that is twice as expensive as the model resin is used but the backwashing and regeneration practices and ebct remain the same the annual o m costs for genx removal increase from us 156 594 to us 219 214 and the annual o m costs for pfoa removal increase from us 157 482 to us 220 225 to the best of our knowledge there is no information available in the literature on the treatment cost comparison between genx and pfoa however calgoncarbon conducted a study to evaluate the treatment costs of pfas pfoa pfos and perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa using a hypothetical ae resin calgoncarbon 2019 the reported o m cost for the ae resin was us 296 300 per year their o m annual cost was higher than that of the wbs calculated o m cost likely because of the simultaneous treatment of three pfas in water while the wbs model was used to estimate treatment costs for a single pfas 8 research gaps and future outlook genx is being developed as a more environmentally friendly alternative to pfoa based on an ether functional group in its chemical structure treatment of genx as a contaminant of emerging concern has drawn attention within the scientific community despite the more environmentally friendly nature of genx its treatability by adsorption is lower than pfoa as the most cost effective and conventional treatment method for pfoa ac has significantly lower removal efficiency and capacity for genx the following subsections identify the current research gaps and recommend future work on genx removal by ac ae other common adsorbents and emerging adsorbents 8 1 activated carbon studies have shown that the removal efficiencies of genx by ac are only 30 while those of other common pfas with 6 carbon atoms namely pfhxa and perfluorohexane sulfonate acid pfhxs are approximately 95 wang et al 2019a sun et al 2016 more studies are needed to determine the effects of co contaminants on genx removal especially short chain pfas and dom there is a possibility to increase genx adsorption by ac through various modifications applying various modified ac previously tested for pfoa or other short chain pfas such as pfhxa or pfhxs for genx removal is a logical starting point 8 1 1 effect of co contaminants existing studies regarding the impact of organic and inorganic matter on pfas adsorption in general and particularly on genx adsorption by ac showed contradicting results campos pereira et al 2018 du et al 2014 hopkins et al 2018 park et al 2020b wu et al 2020 more studies are required to find a logical trend or describe the basis of the reported conflicting effects between organic and inorganic matter and genx adsorption genx contaminated waters have been increasingly identified cui et al 2020 gebbink and van leeuwen 2020 li et al 2020 semerád et al 2020 including wastewater surface water and groundwater dom and inorganic materials are not the only co contaminants that influence genx adsorption genx is often accompanied by long chain pfas that replace genx molecules on the ac after a specific operation time existing studies have focused on the competitive effect of pfoa sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019a but given the recent increase in short chain pfas production such as pfhxa and pfhxs it is important to assess the effects of short chain pfas on genx removal by ac 8 1 2 modified ac ac have low genx removal efficiency sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019a but they are still widely used in the industry due to their cost effectiveness regeneration ability and significant removal potential of other pfas belkouteb et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 schulz et al 2020 physical increasing the surface area or chemical introducing functional groups modifications may be made to improve ac adsorption similar pfoa and pfos adsorption approaches were taken and ac was modified to increase their removal efficiencies deng et al 2015 xu et al 2020 modified ac such as extruded or pelletized ac and magnetic ac have not been explored for genx adsorption due to its ether functional group and anionic form in water genx might be more susceptible to ac modified to contain cations such as iron coated and alum coated ac several modification processes for ac such as impregnation grafting and bifunctionalization are available to immobilize cationic material into the ac pores surfaces and interstices finding available and affordable coatings that increase genx adsorption will help in reducing costs in the long run 8 1 3 pore structure there are contradicting reports regarding the effect of pore size on genx uptake by ac park et al 2020b pramanik et al 2015 wu et al 2020 the actual interaction of genx with ac as well as the mechanisms involved in binding genx to the active sites are not clear the modification effects of different functional groups on the ac pore structure for genx adsorption are ambiguous thus characterization techniques such as bet analyzer x ray powder diffraction scanning and transmission electron microscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy to comprehend the influence of inner pore structures and surfaces functional groups on genx and other pfas removal are suggested as starting points 8 2 ae the effect of dom on the removal of genx was studied to some extent future studies should focus on the effect of common co contaminants mainly competing for anions on genx removal by aes besides most studies on genx removal by aes focused on polystyrene and polyacrylic resins different resin types have different characteristics including porosity durability adsorption capacity and selectivity in removing organic contaminants polystyrene and polyacrylic resins have been used for genx removal however the applications of other potential resin types such as suspended ion exchange six chelating and silica based resins for genx removal have not been explored 8 2 1 co contaminants genx and other pfas are found in landfill leachate groundwater and wastewater which are all heterogeneous in nature the competing effect of other pfas along with genx has not been fully addressed most studies concentrated on genx and pfoa co removal the competing effect of pfas especially pfoa and pfos with other emerging contaminants including pharmaceuticals and pesticides have been investigated in 164 european groundwater sources liu et al 2019 stuart et al 2012 however genx is the pfas of the future and its mass production is on the rise as a result not recognizing the effects of other emerging pollutants on genx removal would be unwise to date no research has been done in this field the focus should be on finding co occurring emerging contaminants with genx such as metaldehyde stuart et al 2012 and exploring their impact on genx removal should be the priority 8 2 2 resin type the existing adsorption studies of genx by aes have focused on specific resin types however several existing and emerging resin types have yet to be investigated chelating six and silica based resins are the most promising resin types capable of removing ions and organic contaminants bazri and mohseni 2016 levchuk et al 2018 duan et al 2020 chelating resins are resilient as well as having one or combined donor atoms of amines amides nitriles and azo groups the presence of amines has shown promising results in genx removal by cofs therefore examining the performance and potential selectivity of chelating resins should be considered six is a novel form of ae targeting toc removal metcalfe et al 2015 its unique regeneration process along with a single pass plug flow system that minimizes resin fouling would increase the run time duration of genx adsorption and in turn make it a promising candidate for genx removal silica based resins have higher specific surface areas and higher mechanical strengths than pure resins besides they have no shrinking or swelling problems resulting in increased longevity making them viable candidates for genx removal 8 3 miscellaneous adsorption processes a rational starting point for optimizing genx treatment is applying inexpensive and reliable adsorbents proven effective for removing pfoa and other pfas due to the many similarities between them and genx zero valent iron zvi a relatively cost effective and environmentally friendly material effectively removes pfas jeen et al 2014 liu et al 2019 this technology is likely to remove and decompose genx simultaneously through adsorption and defluorination as well as hydrogen bonding reduction biochar has been used to remove a broad range of contaminants of concern including pfas liu et al 2020 the affordability and accessibility of biochar along with its highly porous characteristics make it a perfect candidate to study for genx removal molecularly imprinted polymers mips are used in locating and removing pfas al amin et al 2020 the synthetic fabrication of polymers which enhances the active sites to have higher affinity and selectivity toward the targeted contaminant genx is one of mips advantages due to their wide variety of raw materials mips have the potential to remove genx metal organic frameworks have positively charged metals in their crystalline framework along with a homogeneous pore structure resulting in larger surface areas for adsorbents because of these two characteristics they are promising candidates for removing genx through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions aris et al 2020 modified smectite clays have rarely been tested for pfas remediation even though their removal efficiency for pfas 95 99 is comparable to aes yan et al 2020 intercalating quaternary ammonium surfactants can modify low cost smectite clays into the interlayer space via ion exchanging with cations such as k na and ca2 making modified smectite clays potential candidates for genx removal 9 conclusions the treatability of genx is more complicated and difficult than pfoa genx has a lower equilibrium adsorbed amount than pfoa traditional ac provides low removal efficiency for genx approximately 30 however engineered ac designed to have significantly smaller pores can remove genx with higher efficiencies 80 99 aes outperform ac in removing genx based on molecular simulation results aes with higher hydrogen bond donating characteristics are likely to have better removal capacity for both pfoa and genx the effects of competing ions and associated mechanisms on genx adsorption remain ambiguous this review demonstrated that the genx breakthrough curve occurs considerably faster than pfoa for virgin ac it also showed that for ac the estimated treatment cost for genx is 4 4 times higher than that for pfoa while the genx treatment cost is approximately the same as pfoa for aes traditional ac is the most common type of adsorbents used in the field and the results have shown it is less effective in removing genx than pfoa hence higher amounts of genx will end up in the environment if the two contaminants are treated together or individually in the same manner considering the benefits and challenges of genx to the environment and humans the suitability of its broad adoption is questionable author contributions yong sik ok daniel c w tsang and eakalak khan conceived the presented idea eakalak khan developed the theory hamed heidari and tauqeer abbas

16578,the deep sea an oceanic layer below 200 m depths has important global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions it also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea in this review critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea we found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum following peak emission faster in young deep waters 10 years compared to older deep waters 100 years for example perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations 10 pg l 1 and vertical variations in the south pacific ocean where the ocean currents are old 1000 years steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons ridges and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas in addition we found that even though an estimated 1 2 4 2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants e g plastic monomers additives and attached organic pollutants in the deep sea is often overlooked

regulation carbon sequestration and waste detoxification da ros et al 2019 however information on the structure function and composition of the deep sea ecosystem remain scant despite its vast size partly due to the putative high costs of exploring such ecosystems danovaro et al 2020 since less than 0 0001 of the ocean floor has been explored it is difficult to predict the ecological effects of anthropogenic disturbances in the deep sea rogers 2015 deep sea ecosystems were previously considered pristine and free from anthropogenic disturbances due to their remoteness however organic

deep sea pollution fig 1 for example the presence of organic pollutants in the deep sea poses great harm to the ecosystem thus threatening the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean resources for sustainable development as required by sdg 14 although deep sea ecosystems are protected from pollution by global conventions e g convention for the international convention for the prevention of

tornero and hanke 2016 monitoring and characterizing anthropogenic disturbances and their effect on key species are essential for a robust assessment of the health of the deep sea ecosystem this review seeks to examine the literature on the distribution fate transport and trophic transfer of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems to determine their sources and transport mechanisms the key factors influencing the accumulation and transport of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems will be discussed such knowledge is essential for assessing the environmental risk of organic pollutants and developing conservation and management strategies for deep sea ecosystems 2 occurrence of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems rapid industrialization and urbanization compounded by increased demand for food security and quality life have contributed to the rise in environmental emissions of organic pollutants table 1 before their ban or their production restrictions were effected by the

perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos were produced globally between 1970 and 2002 while between 1951 and 2015 up to 21 400 tons of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas were produced wang et al 2014 2013 in 2018 it was estimated that about 400 000 and 100 000 tons of bde209 a pbde congener were in use or disposed of in waste stocks respectively abbasi et al 2019 about 30 000 tons of hbcds are produced

resource extraction e g seabed mining fishing and mariculture waste disposal tornero and hanke 2016 the entry route of the organic pollutants influences their profile i e concentration and type and the mechanism by which they transfer from the seawater column to the seafloor for example semivolatile persistent organic pollutants pops are often transported to the deep sea by long range atmospheric transport wania and mackay 1996 the semivolatile organic pollutants deposit on the ocean surface following changes in atmospheric conditions after a while some of the organic pollutants are revolatilized and carried further by atmospheric transport this type of long range transport is called the grasshopper effect jurado and dachs 2008 a study in levantine basin found sediment pcb 12 190 ng g 1 and pah 0 3 7 7 ng g 1 concentrations were linked to nearby gas well drilling and dumping sites for sediment dredge astrahan et al 2017 tables s1 and 2 show the distribution of organic pollutants in deep sea water and sediments respectively organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems can also be of natural origin for example several studies found that marine bacteria produced organobromines such as hydroxylated pbdes methoxylated pbdes polybrominated dibenzo p dioxins and polybrominated pyrroles agarwal et al 2017 agarwal et al 2017 found that marine sponges an important biodiversity hotspot in deep sea ecosystems produced various pbdes using metagenome mining techniques in the western pacific ocean the concentration of methoxylated pbdes in extractable organic matter from marine sponges i e haliclona sp and callyspongia sp were 63 500 ng g 1 and 36 500 ng g 1 respectively haraguchi et al 2011 four methoxylated pbdes were detected in endemic amphipods collected from hadal trenches 6 000 11 000 m depth in the western pacific ocean cui et al 2020 however none were detected in sediments or suspended particulate matter cui et al 2020 amphipods play an important role in regulating nutrient and energy flux in marine environments hence their species density around marine sponges is often high amsler et al 2009 gut analysis of nearshore amphipods in the antarctica peninsula revealed that some amphipods feed on marine sponges amsler et al 2009 besides amphipods organobromines can transfer indirectly to necrophagivore fish e g paraliparis bathybius notoliparis kermadecensis pachycara sp and bassozetus sp which feed primarily on amphipods and directly to megafaunal croppers e g notacanthus chemnitzii barathrites parri and chimaerids which feed on marine sponges drazen and sutton 2017 a study in the western pacific ocean found methoxylated pbdes in fish samples haraguchi et al 2011 although studies on their distribution and impact in deep sea ecosystems remain scarce due to sampling and analytical challenges previous studies have shown that naturally produced organohalogens can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine mammals thus threatening the structure and function of the deep sea ecosystems sanganyado et al 2020 weijs et al 2009 a study in the sea of japan and north pacific ocean found halogenated bipyrroles up to 4 900 000 ng kg 1 wet weight and methoxylated pbdes up to 190 000 ng kg 1 wet weight concentrations were detected in cetaceans in the order of killer whales toothed whales baleen whales demonstrating the critical role of feeding ecology on natural organobromine biomagnification fujii et al 2018 overall although naturally produced organohalogens are often present at concentrations lower than organic pollutants biosynthesis needs to be seriously considered a key source of potentially toxic organohalogens in deep sea ecosystems 3 factors influencing the transport of organic pollutants in the deep sea 3 1 biological pump the transport of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is often regulated by a complex ensemble of biophysical processes involved in transporting organic carbon from the ocean surface to the deep sea and sediments i e biological pump fig 3 galbán malagón et al 2012 the biological pump can be conceptualized as a biogeochemical system comprising primary production vertical transport and sedimentation lutz et al 2007 phytoplankton accumulate organic pollutants from the surface waters during the primary production stage driving air water disequilibrium in organic pollutant concentration a previous study found phytoplankton uptake and gravitational settling of biogenic particles increased the air water influx of pcbs galbán malagón et al 2012 primary productivity is often governed by solar physical oceanographic and climatic factors and this often results in seasonal and regional trends in the efficacy of the biological pump in sequestrating the organic pollutants lutz et al 2007 additionally physicochemical properties of the organic pollutants e g aqueous solubility hydrophobicity volatility and lipophilicity local environmental conditions in the deep water e g depth oxygen content and temperature settling particle characteristics e g size density and type climate geographical factors e g latitude ocean currents seafloor geomorphology e g topographical features and biodiversity can further influence the organic pollutant sequestration efficiency of the biological pump since phytoplankton readily uptake more hydrophobic compounds higher air water influxes have been observed for pcb congeners with higher octanol water partition coefficients log k ow in high productivity regions such as the north atlantic north pacific and arctic oceans gioia et al 2008 pcb congeners with low log k ow are often more abundant in high latitude oceans such as subtropical regions where biological pump efficiencies are often low sobek and gustafsson 2004 the air water flux of organic pollutants and changes in their export are critical determinants of the vertical profile of dissolved organic pollutants hence understanding the sequestration efficiencies and mechanisms of the biological pump is imperative since these processes impact the sink and source role of the deep sea 3 2 physical pump water masses originating from continental margins transport organic pollutants to the deep ocean through lateral diffusion eddy currents intrusion and hyperpycnal flows thermohaline currents puig et al 2014 a study in the continental margin of the gulf of mexico found a positive correlation between particle attached pahs 0 9 and 7 0 ng l 1 and particulate organic carbon 4000 131 000 ng l 1 although both variables negatively correlated with salinity adhikari et al 2019 the results suggested riverine discharge was the primary source of pahs in the deep sea adhikari et al 2019 in the south atlantic upper equatorial and indian oceans lateral ocean circulation accounted for 20 48 pcb influx wagner et al 2019 at the same time upwelling contributed up to 10 in removing pcbs from the deep sea to the ocean surface wagner et al 2019 in the fram strait a deep water channel that transports organic pollutants into the arctic ocean the west spitsbergen and the east greenland currents contributed a total mass flux for α hch of 29 tons y 1 and 67 tons y 1 respectively ma et al 2018 however the ocean currents moved in the opposite direction the west spitsbergen current moved northwards from the atlantic to the arctic ocean and the east greenland currents moving southwards along greenland in contrast there was a net influx of pcbs i e pcb 28 101 153 and 180 into the arctic ocean transported through the fram strait between 1930 and 2015 80 tons y 1 ma et al 2018 in the aegean sea cyclonic surface circulation and deep water outflows from the cretan strait were shown to be a crucial advective source of pahs and contributed to the accumulation of pahs in sediments hatzianestis et al 2020 in stratified oceans ocean currents and the seafloor interact over short timescales lasting 5 years through horizontal vertical and eddy currents i e internal solitary waves by driving processes such as sediment resuspension and transport in the seafloor internal solitary waves contribute to the outflow and inflow of organic pollutants into the deep sea jia et al 2019 hence the role of oceanic currents in the total flux of organic pollutants in the deep sea is often in a state of competition whereby the net flow may be influenced by geophysical seasonal and climatic factors global thermohaline currents driven by temperature and salinity gradients have been shown to move surface water together with organic pollutants to the deep sea in a process called deep water formation lohmann et al 2006 a study on the norwegian ross weddell and labrador seas found deep water formation was a major route of entry of pcbs to the deep sea 870 kg yr 1 compared to particle settling 320 kg yr 1 lohmann et al 2006 a study on the distribution of organic pollutants in sediments from the mediterranean sea found that the western mediterranean deep water formation increased the deposition of pops with a low air water partition coefficient log k aw of 4 0 to 2 0 such as lindane tri pcbs tetra pcbs and methylphenanthrenes salvadó et al 2019 in contrast there was a strong association between pops with an intermediate log k aw 2 0 to 0 and high octanol water partition coefficient log k ow 6 and sediment particles suggesting horizontal transport in the continental shelf salvadó et al 2019 perfluorinated compounds reached 3500 m depths in young deep water masses 10 years in the labrador sea north atlantic ocean yamashita et al 2008 but were not detected below the permanent thermocline in old deep waters 450 years in the central arctic ocean basins yeung et al 2017 the intrusion of perfluorinated compounds to deep waters is often negligible in old deep waters such as those found in the central arctic ocean basins yeung et al 2017 and fram strait joerss et al 2020 because the estimated time for deep water formation in these regions is usually more than 100 years yet perfluorinated acids were first produced and used in the 1960s yamashita et al 2008 hence deep water formation can contribute to the depletion of perfluorinated compounds from the global ocean surface particularly in the north atlantic and southern oceans lohmann et al 2006 however pfas contamination in the south pacific ocean was shown to be negligible below detection limit to 10 pg l 1 in ocean surface and the deep water compared to other oceans yamashita et al 2008 this was probably because there was no direct discharge of pfas in the south pacific ocean since the water masses comprise of 1000 years old ocean currents and antarctic circumpolar water masses previous mass flow estimates showed that pfos and pfoa flux in the deep water layer of the labrador sea was four and ten times higher than pcb flux respectively lohmann et al 2006 yamashita et al 2008 the results suggested highly soluble and less volatile organic pollutants transferred from the surface water to the deep water faster than the semi volatile and relatively more hydrophobic organic pollutants even though deep water flux of pfas in the labrador sea is relatively fast transferring the pfoas emitted globally to date into global oceans requires at least 4500 years yamashita et al 2008 in the north atlantic ocean pfos concentrations were higher and more variable in the surface water 0 10 m compared to the subsurface water 365 510 m and the water layer around the permanent thermocline 985 1335 m zhang et al 2017 the lag time between peak pfos emission and peak concentrations in subsurface and permanent thermocline layer water was 2 3 years and more than 30 years respectively this was probably because vertical mixing in the north atlantic is intense during winters and can reach 600 m depths while subduction and ventilation of water in the surface mixed layer to the permanent thermocline is slow zhang et al 2017 for that reason the distribution of perfluorinated acids in oceans is often used as chemical tracer to assess the transport of anthropogenic pollutants by oceanic currents pfas profiles and concentrations significantly vary between surface and deep water oceans except in seas that experience intense vertical mixing wei et al 2008 yeung et al 2017 a study on perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorobutanesulfonate pfbs in global oceans found distinct stratification in the sources of the compounds the north atlantic current was the major source of the perfluorinated acids in the surface waters the labrador current in the subsurface waters and the denmark strait overflow water in the deep layers below 2000 m depth yamashita et al 2008 in western mediterranean sea pfas concentrations in the deep water 141 pg l 1 were about two times lowers than those in the surface water samples 357 pg l 1 brumovský et al 2016 the western mediterranean deep water has short renewal cycles since at least two intense dense shelf water cascading and open sea convection events were observed between 2004 and 2012 the vertical profile of pfas in the mediterranean and japan seas substantially differed even though both are semi enclosed seas with deep waters isolated from the open ocean yamazaki et al 2019 yamazaki et al 2019 found that the pfas concentration in the mediterranean sea were an order of magnitude higher than in the japan sea the pfas concentrations steadily decreased with an increase in depth in the japan sea with only pfda and pfhxs having a maximum concentration in the mid deep waters 1000 1500 m in contrast pfas vertical profile was highly variable in the mediterranean sea although at some locations higher concentrations of pfda pfna pfhxa and pfhpa were detected in the deepest water columns sampled 2300 3600 m yamazaki et al 2019 this is probably because pfna pfhxa and pfhpa are legacy pfas that were extensively used in fluoropolymer products lin et al 2020 overall the pfas profiles in young deep waters such as the mediterranean sea are indicative of the pfas profiles in surface seawater of a decade earlier while those of old deep waters are associated with legacy pfas however currently missing are data on pfas profiles in deep sea waters surrounded by low income countries where several banned pfas are likely to be still in use 3 3 settling particle characteristics biogenic inorganic and anthropogenic particles are important vectors for the vertical transport of organic pollutants in oceans as the non biogenic particles sink organic pollutants may be released to the deep water column via bio transformation or dissolution of particles however the profile of organic pollutants transported can be influenced by the nature of the settling particle for example a study in the indian pacific and atlantic oceans found that the vertical flux of pfas via zooplankton fecal matter was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of pfas associated with phytoplankton gonzález gaya et al 2019 settling of large particles 50 μm in deep marine ecosystems contributes significantly to the vertical transport of pollutants through the water column while small particles are carried by water masses and may also contribute to the advective transport of the organic pollutants martí et al 2001 the primary source of organic pollutants in small particles is partitioning from water particles in contrast organic pollutants in large biogenic particles come directly from the food chain martí et al 2001 a study in mediterranean deep waters found that the concentration of halogenated organic contaminants on the small particles 0 7 μm decreased significantly with depth compared to large particles 50 μm martí et al 2001 hence particle size can influence the accumulation rate of organic pollutants in the water column and sediments microplastics are complex particles comprising of a dynamic mixture of monomers additives and processing agents galloway et al 2017 they often host microorganisms and bind organic pollutants and organic material which alters the microplastic density and surface charge resulting in a change in bioavailability of the organic pollutants galloway et al 2017 an estimated 1 2 4 2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge of which 14 4 236 thousand metric tons are floating in the global ocean jambeck et al 2015 weiss et al 2021 around 99 8 of the plastic debris discharged into the oceans since the 1950s are estimated to be below the ocean surface in the subsurface deep water layer or seafloor koelmans et al 2017 plastic particles are transferred to the deep water and seafloor through accumulation in biota following ingestion thermohaline driven currents and gravitational settling following loss of buoyancy or incorporation into fecal matter kvale et al 2020 a recent study showed that bathochordaeus stygius one of the most abundant zooplankton effectively transported microplastics from the ocean surface to the deep sea by ingesting and then excreting microplastics as part of their fecal pellets katija et al 2017 during physicochemical and biological weathering of plastic debris to form microplastics plastic monomers additives and plastic attached organic pollutants inadvertently leach to the surrounding water column thus contributing to the flux of organic pollutants in the deep sea dasgupta et al 2021 this is greatly concerning since around 10 500 compounds are used worldwide as plastic monomers additives e g antioxidants biocides flame retardants plasticizers light stabilizers and colorants and processing aids e g heat stabilizer crosslinking agent lubricant solvent and antistatic agent of which 2486 are substances of potential concern while no hazard data was available for 4100 substances wiesinger et al 2021 a previous study found polychlorinated biphenyl 127 142 ng g 1 organochlorine pesticides 4280 5350 ng g 1 and chlordane 1080 1260 ng g 1 concentrations in microplastics and plastic pellets found in the xisha trough in the south china sea dasgupta et al 2021 the concentration of organochlorine pesticides in xisha trough was higher than those found in coastal beaches 2 2 1970 ng g 1 on the south china sea while pah concentrations were an order of magnitude lower than those found on the beach 11 2 7710 ng g 1 shi et al 2020 organochlorine pesticides such as ddt are more hydrophobic than pahs and tend to have lower desorption and degradation rates during transport to the deep sea from coastal environments bakir et al 2014 however long term desorption of organic pollutants from microplastics is highly influenced by the polymer water partition coefficients of the compounds for example a previous study found light pcb congeners desorbed faster e g pcb 8 half life 14 days than heavier congeners e g pcb 209 half life 210 years endo et al 2013 hence it is expected that microplastic associated pcbs in the deep sea would be dominated by heavier congeners however the less recalcitrant and more water soluble tri pcbs were the most dominant pcb congeners 92 and the composition was consistent with the technical mixtures produced in china dasgupta et al 2021 low molecular weight pcb congeners like tri pcb have more extended atmospheric reach they are sometimes generated during the microbial transformation of high molecular weight pcbs and are preferentially exchanged during ocean air interactions due to their lightweight dasgupta et al 2021 2018 in vitro digestive models have revealed microplastic can act as a vector or cleaner extracting organic pollutants from the gut in aquatic organisms mohamed nor and koelmans 2019 however comprehensive data on the flux of organic pollutants into the deep sea through microplastic transport are still lacking 4 factors influencing the accumulation of organic pollutants in the deep sea 4 1 microbial biotransformation it is often assumed that the biotransformation mechanisms of organic pollutants in the deep sea and surface water ecosystems are similar despite the drastic differences in temperature and hydrostatic pressure louvado et al 2015 at low temperatures the enzymatic activity of organohalogen degrading microorganisms often decreases resulting in low organic pollutant degradation efficiency in contrast high hydrostatic pressure in deep sea ecosystems was shown to decrease the fungal degradation of poly β hydroxybutyric acid gonda et al 2000 previous studies showed that bacteria in deep sea ecosystems developed phenotypical characteristics such as cell membrane with a higher amount of unsaturated fatty acids and lack of genes involved in photosynthetic reactions which enabled their adaptation to the psychro peizophilic conditions louvado et al 2015 these phenotypic adaptations may reduce the permeability of the deep sea microorganisms resulting in decreased organic pollutant uptake and intracellular biotransformation the low temperatures and high hydrostatic pressure conditions can facilitate the role of deep sea ecosystems as the ultimate sink of organic pollutants however organohalogen degrading bacteria may have adapted to the psychro peizophilic conditions as they developed higher diversity in metabolic activity konstantinidis et al 2009 since studies modeling the global fate and transport are often based on the chemodynamics of the organic pollutants in surface water they may under or overestimate the global distribution of organic pollutants considering the deep sea is probably the largest environmental compartment organic pollutants partition microbial transformation of freely dissolved or particle attached organic pollutants contributes to removing organic pollutants in the deep sea next generation sequencing analysis of deep sea sediments from the great australian bight detected three genes i e alkb c23o and pmoa associated with aerobic hydrocarbon degradation van de kamp et al 2019 various studies have shown that bacteria isolated from different deep sea geomorphologies such as hydrothermal vents could degrade organohalogens bacteria isolated from hydrothermal vents have been shown to readily degrade pahs and n alkanes since they evolved to use hydrocarbons as their primary carbon source ma et al 2021 gammaproteobacteria i e fj613315 pseudomonas stutzeri strain hyss62 and actinobacteria i e hm222653 nocardioides sp 0701c5 1 that oxidize pcbs were previously isolated from deep sea sediments in the kongsfjorden papale et al 2017 the removal efficiency of p stutzeri contained the bpha gene and its removal efficiency was 10 69 at 4 c and 7 3 93 at 15 c papale et al 2017 the di and tri pcbs were more efficiently removed at both temperatures than tetra pcbs suggesting heavier congeners might be more recalcitrant than lighter congeners in the deep sea sediments the degradation of organic pollutants by deep sea bacteria might follow pathways different from those observed from coastal soil freshwater and open ocean bacteria deep sea bacteria adapted to lower oxygen nutrient and temperature and higher pressure conditions which probably altered how they use organic pollutants as food sources scoma et al 2019 studies on the biotransformation of organic pollutants other than hydrocarbons in deep sea ecosystems remain scarce 4 2 bioavailability particle associated organic pollutants often exhibit low bioavailability the extent to which depends on their hydrophobicity the bioavailability of organic pollutants often changes as the particle associated organic pollutants are transported to the deep water layer due to changes in temperature salinity oxygenation and particle characteristics this is partly because the physicochemical characteristics of the organic pollutants e g lipophilicity dipole moment and water solubility may alter as the water chemistry changes between the surface subsurface to deep water lyytikäinen et al 2003 interestingly previous studies have shown that the accumulation of pfas in biota was driven by phospholipid and protein interactions processes that are governed by the polarity and hydrophobicity of the compound ng and hungerbühler 2014 additionally changes in sediment characteristics e g particle size polarity and organic carbon content due to changes in water chemistry with depth or microbial degradation may alter the bioavailability of organic pollutants lyytikäinen et al 2003 for example sediments in the blanes submarine canyon had polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdf concentrations 754 ng kg 1 strongly correlated with soot r2 0 852 p 0 008 but not organic carbon content castro jiménez et al 2013 this was probably because pcdf strongly sorbs to soot and not to organic carbon as demonstrated by the low f oc k ow ρ oc f sc k scw ratio 0 2 1 where f oc represents the mass fraction organic carbon k ow the octanol water partition coefficient ρ oc the octanol density g l 1 f sc the mass fraction of soot content and k scw is soot water partition coefficient castro jiménez et al 2013 the partitioning of pcdfs to soot in deep sea ecosystems might reduce their bioavailability resulting in the sediments acting as an ultimate sink furthermore hadal sediments are known to have very low organic carbon content 0 22 yet high concentrations of pcbs 930 4200 ng kg 1 and pbdes 245 590 ng kg 1 have been detected in hadal sediments from the marian trench dasgupta et al 2018 the hadal sediments had high contents of clay minerals such as illite clinochlore and nontronite which are known to promote i steric effects between bulky or nonplanar organic pollutants and the clay minerals and ii the formation of complexes between weakly hydrated cations in the clay minerals and the negatively charged moieties of the organic pollutants liu et al 2015 hence there is need for additional studies on the role of sediment characteristics on the bioavailability of organic pollutants in deep sea compounds with low water solubility and high hydrophobicity often preferentially partition to the rapidly sinking particles while those with high water solubility preferentially remain in the water column the trend is probably not universal because a previous study found that there was no significant correlation between pfas flux to the deep water layer and the hydrophobicity of the compounds gonzález gaya et al 2019 in fact long chain pfcas which had a relatively higher hydrophobicity had low flux to the deep chlorophyll maximum gonzález gaya et al 2019 pfas are probably transported from the surface to the deep water through the biological pump since gonzález gaya et al 2019 demonstrated that particle settling flux negatively correlated to the dissolved phase concentration of pfas in the deep chlorophyll maximum however a previous study found that there was no significant correlation between pfas accumulation in phytoplankton and pfas hydrophobicity casal et al 2017 hence the adsorption or bioaccumulation of pfas such as pfoa to sinking particles is not primarily dependent on compound hydrophobicity but other properties such as polarity ng and hungerbühler 2014 there is a need for further studies to assess the effect of organic pollutant bioavailability on the efficacy of biological pumps in removing organic pollutants from the sea surface 4 3 water column depth biogeochemical processes in the water column influence the occurrence settling and fate of organic pollutants in the ocean galbán malagón et al 2012 in the arctic ocean pbde concentrations were an order of magnitude higher in the deep waters than in the polar mixed layer suggesting a predominancy of vertical transport of the pbdes salvadó et al 2016 the relative contribution of less brominated congeners i e tri to hepta bdes increased with depth compared to the heavier congeners salvadó et al 2016 the increase with depth of bde 71 which are not found in technical mixtures and other less brominated congeners suggest heavier congeners transformed to lighter congeners during vertical or oceanic transport salvadó et al 2016 previous studies in the central arctic ocean basin carrizo et al 2017 and fram strait ma et al 2018 found that transformation of ddts to ddes contributed to the relative increase in ddes with depth in contrast the concentration of highly chlorinated pcbs increased with depth suggesting sorption to settling particles contributed to the vertical transport of the pcbs ma et al 2018 passive sampling employed by ma et al 2018 has shown to be a valuable tool for assessing the vertical distribution of organophosphate esters opes and pbdes in the fram strait mcdonough et al 2018 and pcbs pahs and ocps in the irminger sea booij et al 2014 although little vertical trends were observed in the fram strait chlorinated opes were the most dominant opes 34 100 in the deep water mass compared to alkyl and aryl opes mcdonough et al 2018 the total concentration of the chlorinated opes 0 006 0 430 ng l 1 was an order of magnitude higher than that of the alkyl aryl compounds 0 0001 0 066 ng l 1 mcdonough et al 2018 chlorinated opes are more persistent in the deep water mass since they are less degradable via hydrolysis or indirect photolysis than the alkyl aryl opes particle sediment and water sampling challenges continue to limit our understanding of the role of particle size on the mass influx of organic contaminants in the deep ocean ecosystem passive samplers are more suitable for assessing the vertical and global distribution of organic pollutants since they are cost effective easier to handle and have high analyte enrichment potential as a result a global monitoring program for organic pollutants in global oceans including deep waters called the aquatic global passive sampling aqua gaps network was established in 2017 lohmann et al 2017 accumulation of organic pollutants in the deep sea can be influenced by ocean stratification stratification in the st lawrence maritime estuary and gulf water column occurred due to cold and oxygen rich waters from the labrador current and warm and oxygen deficient waters from the atlantic ocean isolated the surface waters and the deep waters picard et al 2021 the concentration ratios in subsurface to deep water ratios were significantly higher for current use pfas e g the ratio for pfbs was 6 1 than legacy pfas e g the pfos and pfoa ratios were 2 5 and 1 8 respectively picard et al 2021 pharmaceuticals in the gulf of cadiz exhibited a similar trend probably due to the water column stratification caused by the presence of dense mediterranean waters and less saline atlantic ocean waters biel maeso et al 2018 since the water masses in stratified seas have different physicochemical properties it is expected that the bio transformation of the organic pollutants and the settling particles will differ with depth however there are few studies on the role of water mass characteristics and the fate of organic pollutants 4 4 seafloor geomorphology recent advances in exploration and sampling technology revealed deep sea ecosystems contain distinct geomorphological features such as seamounts submerged plateaus submarine canyons trenches and hydrothermal vents mcclain and rex 2015 besides being a hotspot of faunal abundance diversity and sometimes endemism deep sea geomorphological features often alter oceanographic conditions rogers 2015 the interaction between ocean currents and a steep geomorphological feature e g valleys ridges and canyons often promotes the accumulation of organic matter and sediments that originate from the continental shelf zone astrahan et al 2017 for example castro jiménez et al 2013 found that the total 2 3 7 8 pcdd fs concentration of 17 congeners 102 680 ng kg 1 d w were three to six times higher in sediments at the deepest locations of the blanes submarine canyon 1700 m depths than at the shallow locations 500 m depths or the adjacent open slope ocean current circulations in submarine canyons promote the flushing of sediment particles and their associated organic pollutants down the slope resulting in the accumulation of the sediments and organic pollutants in the deepest locations of the canyon these ocean currents are often initiated by coastal storms and dense shelf water cascading i e movement of water masses following cooling evaporation or freezing of the ocean surface in the shelf continent resulting in dense water formation that sinks as warm and saline water rises a recent study in the gulf of cagliari revealed submarines canyons were the primary physical pathway transporting pahs and pcbs from land to the deep sea tamburrino et al 2019 astrahan et al 2017 found that the highest amounts of organic matter in bottom sediments corresponded with the locations of ridgelines and canyons the sediments with high organic carbon content had higher concentrations of highly hydrophobic pcbs and pahs astrahan et al 2017 in addition seafloor geomorphology can also affect critical ecosystem features such as population structure composition and function which drive biotransformation and bioaccumulation of pops in the deep sea costello and chaudhary 2017 a previous study found seafloor morphologies such as troughs sediment waves and furrows increased biodiversity in the deep sea which in turn influenced ecosystem processes e g biological processes involved in the biological pump mechanisms at a regional scale zeppilli et al 2016 4 5 ecological implications the fate and transport behavior of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems determine their magnitude and duration of exposure to deep sea organisms hydrophobic organic pollutants such as ddts highly chlorinated pcbs and highly brominated pbdes readily bioaccumulate in deep sea organisms due to their high lipophilicity and recalcitrant nature however biomagnification and bioaccumulation of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is influenced by the habitat niche e g pelagic benthic and demersal physicochemical properties and occurrence of the organic pollutants and metabolic capacity for example hydrophobic organic pollutants such as pcbs ddts and pbdes with log k ow of 6 0 8 0 were shown to significantly bioaccumulate in carnivorous fish such as blackbelly lanternshark etmopterus lucifer kaup s arrowtooth eel synaphobranchus kaupii snubnosed eel simenchelys parasitica and eelpout lycodes hubbsi takahashi et al 2010 this suggested that feeding habits contribute significantly to the biomagnification of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems organic pollutants with log k ow 6 0 e g hchs hcb and hbcds equilibrate relatively faster with the aqueous phase than ddts pbdes and highly chlorinated pcbs as a result while trophic magnification can be expected for highly hydrophobic organic pollutants concentrations of hchs and hcb have smaller variations across trophic levels takahashi et al 2010 in addition fish from the western north pacific ocean and along the oyashio current had higher hch concentrations than those from warmer locations along the kuroshio current due to their high vapor pressure hchs readily partition to the atmosphere under warm conditions resulting in less hch available for bioaccumulation in fish takahashi et al 2010 bioaccumulation and biomagnification of organic pollutants in deep sea biota are influenced by an interplay between interspecies traits such as habitat niche vertical mobility respiration rate lipid composition metabolic capacity and food web interconnectivity and oceanographic factors such as ocean currents castro jiménez et al 2013 romero romero et al 2017 for example a study in the avilés submarine canyon found that pcbs and pbdes biomagnified in the pelagic but not in the benthic food web romero romero et al 2017 pcb 108 118 138 153 and 180 were the most dominant congeners in deep sea biota probably due to their abundance in technical mixtures there was high inter specific variation in the distribution of the in the deep sea fish however considering the limited sampling size of the study additional studies are required to assess intra specific variations in organic pollutant bioaccumulation in the blanes submarine canyon the highest pcdd f concentrations were detected in nektobenthic crustaceans 220 795 ng kg 1 l w and fish 110 300 ng kg 1 l w castro jiménez et al 2013 since pelagic species have high vertical mobility organic pollutants bioaccumulation in pelagic species tends to be associated with the concentration of organic pollutants in primary producers and the surface water in contrast by inhabiting primarily on the seafloor benthic and nektobenthic species often have organic pollutants profiles linked to deep sea sediments and waters as well as relatively highly hydrophobic contaminants castro jiménez et al 2013 5 future directions determining the mechanisms pathways and rates of fate and transport of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is challenging as it is a multidisciplinary endeavor requiring skills in physical oceanography analytical chemistry biogeochemistry marine ecology environmental microbiology and even hydrology traditional approaches for sampling and detecting organic pollutants in environmental samples based on oceanographic cruises are often time consuming labor intensive complex and impractical for long term monitoring due to cost the depth high hydrostatic pressure and low temperatures prevalent in deep sea ecosystems limit the applicability of traditional technologies for collecting storing and manipulating samples hence the scarcity of deep sea environmental samples cario et al 2019 since deep sea conditions are difficult and expensive to replicate in the laboratory microcosm studies to investigate the bio transformation and sorption behavior of organic pollutants is challenging hence future studies should answer the research questions described in table 2 to better understand the fate transport and impact of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems we discuss these critical research topics in the subsequent passages traditional ocean monitoring approaches lack adequate spatial vertical and temporal coverage required for a multiscale multi compartment and multidisciplinary assessment of complex biogeochemical processes in the cast deep sea ecosystems biogeochemical processes controlling the chemodynamics of organic pollutants vary with space and time hence the need for multi dimensional coverage kaiser and barnes 2008 while autonomous platforms such as floats underwater vehicles and floats have been successfully used in measuring physical oceanographic processes gravitational settling of particles and mechanisms and efficiency of biological carbon pump very few studies used the platforms to understand the chemodynamics of organic pollutants chai et al 2020 autonomous underwater vehicles are often used to map seafloor geomorphologies locate ocean dumping sites track contaminant plumes and thermocline and collect environmental samples jones et al 2019 tracking the thermocline can be a powerful tool for assessing the role of deep water formation or water mass flux in the input of organic pollutants in the deep sea table 2 coupling autonomous underwater vehicles with photometry can offer a detailed ephemeral view of the seafloor and it has been previously used to identify ocean dumping of ddt containers kivenson et al 2019 a previous study used a sentry precision robotic impeller driven plankton sampler coupled with autonomous underwater vehicles successfully collected plankton and larva from the blake ridge seep 2160 m depth on the us atlantic margin billings et al 2017 therefore autonomous platforms are valuable for assessing the role of biological and physical pumps in the global dynamics of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems the difficulties in assessing biological responses following organic pollutants exposure in biota at spatial or temporal scale could be alleviated by using an autonomous underwater vehicle for sampling deep sea species linking exposure to biological response using chemical analysis combined with biomarker analysis transcriptomics lipidomics or metabolomics deleo et al 2021 and paleo ecotoxicology linking historical contamination to deep sea fossils of different biological organisms or species diversity changes using environmental dna korosi et al 2017 understanding the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is difficult due to the complexity of the mixture effect as biota are exposed to multiple threats sanganyado et al 2020 current ecotoxicological assays often disregard the potential mixture effects caused by the interaction of the organic pollutants with natural stressors such as salinity cold temperature and high hydrostatic pressure prevalent in deep sea ecosystems mestre et al 2014 in addition the bulk of the literature on organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems tend to report total concentrations while data on bioaccessibility and bioavailability which are more relevant for assessing impact of organic pollutants on ecosystem health are scarce future studies on the biological effects of organic pollutants should mimic the deep sea conditions to ensure the ecotoxicological data generated for environmental risk assessment is relevant and accurate there is a need for comprehensive studies exploring the impact of sea based activities such as deep sea mining on organic pollutants chemodynamics and deep sea biogeochemical processes the discharge of dissolved substances and nutrients due to deep sea mining activities alters the seafloor morphology benthic geochemistry deep water chemistry primary production and food web structure which may change the biological and physical pump efficiencies levin et al 2020 deep sea mining can cause habitat degradation resulting in loss of biodiversity and species connectivity thus altering the food web structure however the lack of large scale studies on the ecological consequences of deep sea mining makes it difficult for regulators such as the international seabed authority to develop toxicity thresholds that are adequate for minimizing the adverse effects caused by deep sea mining kaikkonen et al 2018 baseline studies on the biological chemical and physical condition of the deep seabed are required to ensure future environmental monitoring programs for organic pollutants can adequately determine the effect of exploration and exploitation activities ginzky et al 2020 large scale monitoring of spatial and temporal changes in mass flow of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystem is essential for understanding the impact of human activities on the deep sea while global monitoring systems have been proposed for monitoring current trends in the distribution of organic pollutants in oceans historical emissions have been widely estimated using historical usage patterns linking historical emissions data to changes in deep sea ecosystems is difficult due to uncertainties in estimating organic pollutant flux and linking exposure to biological response recent studies demonstrated that combining paleolimnology and ecotoxicology techniques by assessing changes in contaminant profile and biological proxies e g fossils and environmental dna down a dated sediment core analysis could provide critical data on historical emission and its associated ecological consequences korosi et al 2017 deep sea sediment cores have been successfully used to reconstruct past climatic and oceanographic changes artemova et al 2019 toomey et al 2013 evaluate recovery of seafloor from bottom trawling paradis et al 2021 assess changes in microbial community structure with sediment depth wang et al 2010 and estimate historical flux of mercury in the northwest pacific ocean aksentov and sattarova 2020 reconstructing past emissions of organic pollutants particularly in oceans could help in assessing the impact of chemical regulations on organic pollutant flux in deep seas transformation products should not be overlooked when monitoring the distribution of organic pollutants in deep water ecosystems in the st lawrence maritime estuary and gulf the concentration of metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid a metolachlor transformation product was nearly thirty times higher than that of the parent compound picard et al 2021 this is particularly concerning since metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid was shown to be more toxic to zebrafish larvae than s metolachlor as they caused overexpression of genes involved in the regulation of the thyroid system and cell cycle rozmánková et al 2020 additionally determination of transformation product and parent compound ratios together with congener ratios and chiral signatures can be a useful tool for source apportionment in deep seas shi et al 2020 source apportionment can aid in the development of environmental regulations that protect deep sea ecosystems 6 conclusion although organic pollutants have been detected in deep sea environments for the past 50 years more data on biogeochemical geophysical oceanographic and sedimentological processes are required to make meaningful predictions of the global fate of organic pollutants in the deep sea such data can be obtained using passive samplers as they have high analyte enrichment factor low matrix interferences provide concentrations of the bioavailable phase and can provide time weighted average concentrations however most investigations on the distribution of organic pollutants in deep sea environments were conducted using active sampling techniques while passive sampling is rarely used therefore future studies on the chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea should employ passive sampling there were significant variations in the vertical profiles of organic pollutants in particular deep seas or between regions the variations could be attributed to the pollutants e g physicochemical properties such as log k ow volatility aqueous solubility and use and production patterns oceanic currents e g deep water formation and eddy diffusion and biogeochemical processes in the water column considering much of the deep sea remains unexplored and targeted analysis was predominantly used in these studies the chemodynamics of several organic pollutants in much of the unexplored ocean remains unknown to better understand the ecological risk posed by organic pollutants future studies should explore the factors influencing their bioaccumulation and biomagnification in deep sea food webs in addition since the toxicological effects of organic pollutants on much of the deep sea biota remain poorly understood there is a need for experimental and in vitro models for understanding the toxicity mechanisms of organic pollutants in various deep sea biota autonomous underwater vehicles equipped to deploy passive samplers can help extend the region of deep seas investigated while suspect and non target screening

16578,the deep sea an oceanic layer below 200 m depths has important global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions it also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea in this review critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea we found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum following peak emission faster in young deep waters 10 years compared to older deep waters 100 years for example perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations 10 pg l 1 and vertical variations in the south pacific ocean where the ocean currents are old 1000 years steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons ridges and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas in addition we found that even though an estimated 1 2 4 2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants e g plastic monomers additives and attached organic pollutants in the deep sea is often overlooked finally we recommend assessing the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea biota large scale monitoring of organic pollutants reconstructing historical emissions using sediment cores and assessing the impact of deep sea mining on the ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords deep sea persistent organic pollutants biological pump marine pollution polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine pesticides 1 introduction deep sea layers below 200 m depth ecosystems are currently threatened by multiple anthropogenic disturbances such as chemical pollution overfishing resource extraction and climate change rogers 2015 it is the largest ecosystem on earth and is characterized by a 1 2 billion km3 volume 434 million km2 seafloor and a 4 2 km average depth rogers 2015 deep sea ecosystems play a crucial role in maintaining planetary health and function through supporting unique biodiversity essential for the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients metals carbon and nitrogen they control nutrient and energy flux across environmental compartments and ecosystem services such as water circulation co2 exchange biological control in situ primary production climate regulation carbon sequestration and waste detoxification da ros et al 2019 however information on the structure function and composition of the deep sea ecosystem remain scant despite its vast size partly due to the putative high costs of exploring such ecosystems danovaro et al 2020 since less than 0 0001 of the ocean floor has been explored it is difficult to predict the ecological effects of anthropogenic disturbances in the deep sea rogers 2015 deep sea ecosystems were previously considered pristine and free from anthropogenic disturbances due to their remoteness however organic pollutants enter the deep sea through atmospheric deposition oceanic transport and sometimes sea based anthropogenic activities e g seabed mining fishing ship traffic and accidental spillage kallenborn 2006 several studies detected organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs organochlorine pesticides ocps and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes in seawater sediments and biota from the deep sea dasgupta et al 2018 lohmann et al 2006 out of the 17 sustainable development goals set by the united nations as targets for 2030 eight are directly or indirectly impacted by deep sea pollution fig 1 for example the presence of organic pollutants in the deep sea poses great harm to the ecosystem thus threatening the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean resources for sustainable development as required by sdg 14 although deep sea ecosystems are protected from pollution by global conventions e g convention for the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships united nations convention on the law of the sea and convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter and regional conventions e g protection of the marine environment in the north east atlantic convention on the protection of the marine environment in the baltic sea convention for the protection of marine environment and the coastal region of the mediterranean convention for the protection of the black sea organic pollutants are continually discharged into the environment and subsequently reach the deep sea directly or indirectly tornero and hanke 2016 monitoring and characterizing anthropogenic disturbances and their effect on key species are essential for a robust assessment of the health of the deep sea ecosystem this review seeks to examine the literature on the distribution fate transport and trophic transfer of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems to determine their sources and transport mechanisms the key factors influencing the accumulation and transport of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems will be discussed such knowledge is essential for assessing the environmental risk of organic pollutants and developing conservation and management strategies for deep sea ecosystems 2 occurrence of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems rapid industrialization and urbanization compounded by increased demand for food security and quality life have contributed to the rise in environmental emissions of organic pollutants table 1 before their ban or their production restrictions were effected by the stockholm convention it is estimated 2 79 million metric tons of ddt and 1 51 million metric tons of pcbs were produced globally fiedler et al 2019 about 96 000 tons of chemicals based on perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos were produced globally between 1970 and 2002 while between 1951 and 2015 up to 21 400 tons of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas were produced wang et al 2014 2013 in 2018 it was estimated that about 400 000 and 100 000 tons of bde209 a pbde congener were in use or disposed of in waste stocks respectively abbasi et al 2019 about 30 000 tons of hbcds are produced globally with 238 000 tons estimated to be used in china before they are phased out li et al 2016 due to their extensive application in consumer and industrial products and a high potential for long range atmospheric oceanic transport organic pollutants are frequently detected in deep sea ecosystems the presence of organic pollutants in the global oceans especially the deep sea is linked to various sources which can be classified as land based and sea based activities fig 2 sanganyado et al 2020 their main routes of entry include inputs from coastal regions transported by oceanic currents atmospheric deposition of free or particle associated organic pollutants released from land based activities unintentional shipping discharges e g accidental oil spill and litter and deep sea resource extraction e g seabed mining fishing and mariculture waste disposal tornero and hanke 2016 the entry route of the organic pollutants influences their profile i e concentration and type and the mechanism by which they transfer from the seawater column to the seafloor for example semivolatile persistent organic pollutants pops are often transported to the deep sea by long range atmospheric transport wania and mackay 1996 the semivolatile organic pollutants deposit on the ocean surface following changes in atmospheric conditions after a while some of the organic pollutants are revolatilized and carried further by atmospheric transport this type of long range transport is called the grasshopper effect jurado and dachs 2008 a study in levantine basin found sediment pcb 12 190 ng g 1 and pah 0 3 7 7 ng g 1 concentrations were linked to nearby gas well drilling and dumping sites for sediment dredge astrahan et al 2017 tables s1 and 2 show the distribution of organic pollutants in deep sea water and sediments respectively organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems can also be of natural origin for example several studies found that marine bacteria produced organobromines such as hydroxylated pbdes methoxylated pbdes polybrominated dibenzo p dioxins and polybrominated pyrroles agarwal et al 2017 agarwal et al 2017 found that marine sponges an important biodiversity hotspot in deep sea ecosystems produced various pbdes using metagenome mining techniques in the western pacific ocean the concentration of methoxylated pbdes in extractable organic matter from marine sponges i e haliclona sp and callyspongia sp were 63 500 ng g 1 and 36 500 ng g 1 respectively haraguchi et al 2011 four methoxylated pbdes were detected in endemic amphipods collected from hadal trenches 6 000 11 000 m depth in the western pacific ocean cui et al 2020 however none were detected in sediments or suspended particulate matter cui et al 2020 amphipods play an important role in regulating nutrient and energy flux in marine environments hence their species density around marine sponges is often high amsler et al 2009 gut analysis of nearshore amphipods in the antarctica peninsula revealed that some amphipods feed on marine sponges amsler et al 2009 besides amphipods organobromines can transfer indirectly to necrophagivore fish e g paraliparis bathybius notoliparis kermadecensis pachycara sp and bassozetus sp which feed primarily on amphipods and directly to megafaunal croppers e g notacanthus chemnitzii barathrites parri and chimaerids which feed on marine sponges drazen and sutton 2017 a study in the western pacific ocean found methoxylated pbdes in fish samples haraguchi et al 2011 although studies on their distribution and impact in deep sea ecosystems remain scarce due to sampling and analytical challenges previous studies have shown that naturally produced organohalogens can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine mammals thus threatening the structure and function of the deep sea ecosystems sanganyado et al 2020 weijs et al 2009 a study in the sea of japan and north pacific ocean found halogenated bipyrroles up to 4 900 000 ng kg 1 wet weight and methoxylated pbdes up to 190 000 ng kg 1 wet weight concentrations were detected in cetaceans in the order of killer whales toothed whales baleen whales demonstrating the critical role of feeding ecology on natural organobromine biomagnification fujii et al 2018 overall although naturally produced organohalogens are often present at concentrations lower than organic pollutants biosynthesis needs to be seriously considered a key source of potentially toxic organohalogens in deep sea ecosystems 3 factors influencing the transport of organic pollutants in the deep sea 3 1 biological pump the transport of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is often regulated by a complex ensemble of biophysical processes involved in transporting organic carbon from the ocean surface to the deep sea and sediments i e biological pump fig 3 galbán malagón et al 2012 the biological pump can be conceptualized as a biogeochemical system comprising primary production vertical transport and sedimentation lutz et al 2007 phytoplankton accumulate organic pollutants from the surface waters during the primary production stage driving air water disequilibrium in organic pollutant concentration a previous study found phytoplankton uptake and gravitational settling of biogenic particles increased the air water influx of pcbs galbán malagón et al 2012 primary productivity is often governed by solar physical oceanographic and climatic factors and this often results in seasonal and regional trends in the efficacy of the biological pump in sequestrating the organic pollutants lutz et al 2007 additionally physicochemical properties of the organic pollutants e g aqueous solubility hydrophobicity volatility and lipophilicity local environmental conditions in the deep water e g depth oxygen content and temperature settling particle characteristics e g size density and type climate geographical factors e g latitude ocean currents seafloor geomorphology e g topographical features and biodiversity can further influence the organic pollutant sequestration efficiency of the biological pump since phytoplankton readily uptake more hydrophobic compounds higher air water influxes have been observed for pcb congeners with higher octanol water partition coefficients log k ow in high productivity regions such as the north atlantic north pacific and arctic oceans gioia et al 2008 pcb congeners with low log k ow are often more abundant in high latitude oceans such as subtropical regions where biological pump efficiencies are often low sobek and gustafsson 2004 the air water flux of organic pollutants and changes in their export are critical determinants of the vertical profile of dissolved organic pollutants hence understanding the sequestration efficiencies and mechanisms of the biological pump is imperative since these processes impact the sink and source role of the deep sea 3 2 physical pump water masses originating from continental margins transport organic pollutants to the deep ocean through lateral diffusion eddy currents intrusion and hyperpycnal flows thermohaline currents puig et al 2014 a study in the continental margin of the gulf of mexico found a positive correlation between particle attached pahs 0 9 and 7 0 ng l 1 and particulate organic carbon 4000 131 000 ng l 1 although both variables negatively correlated with salinity adhikari et al 2019 the results suggested riverine discharge was the primary source of pahs in the deep sea adhikari et al 2019 in the south atlantic upper equatorial and indian oceans lateral ocean circulation accounted for 20 48 pcb influx wagner et al 2019 at the same time upwelling contributed up to 10 in removing pcbs from the deep sea to the ocean surface wagner et al 2019 in the fram strait a deep water channel that transports organic pollutants into the arctic ocean the west spitsbergen and the east greenland currents contributed a total mass flux for α hch of 29 tons y 1 and 67 tons y 1 respectively ma et al 2018 however the ocean currents moved in the opposite direction the west spitsbergen current moved northwards from the atlantic to the arctic ocean and the east greenland currents moving southwards along greenland in contrast there was a net influx of pcbs i e pcb 28 101 153 and 180 into the arctic ocean transported through the fram strait between 1930 and 2015 80 tons y 1 ma et al 2018 in the aegean sea cyclonic surface circulation and deep water outflows from the cretan strait were shown to be a crucial advective source of pahs and contributed to the accumulation of pahs in sediments hatzianestis et al 2020 in stratified oceans ocean currents and the seafloor interact over short timescales lasting 5 years through horizontal vertical and eddy currents i e internal solitary waves by driving processes such as sediment resuspension and transport in the seafloor internal solitary waves contribute to the outflow and inflow of organic pollutants into the deep sea jia et al 2019 hence the role of oceanic currents in the total flux of organic pollutants in the deep sea is often in a state of competition whereby the net flow may be influenced by geophysical seasonal and climatic factors global thermohaline currents driven by temperature and salinity gradients have been shown to move surface water together with organic pollutants to the deep sea in a process called deep water formation lohmann et al 2006 a study on the norwegian ross weddell and labrador seas found deep water formation was a major route of entry of pcbs to the deep sea 870 kg yr 1 compared to particle settling 320 kg yr 1 lohmann et al 2006 a study on the distribution of organic pollutants in sediments from the mediterranean sea found that the western mediterranean deep water formation increased the deposition of pops with a low air water partition coefficient log k aw of 4 0 to 2 0 such as lindane tri pcbs tetra pcbs and methylphenanthrenes salvadó et al 2019 in contrast there was a strong association between pops with an intermediate log k aw 2 0 to 0 and high octanol water partition coefficient log k ow 6 and sediment particles suggesting horizontal transport in the continental shelf salvadó et al 2019 perfluorinated compounds reached 3500 m depths in young deep water masses 10 years in the labrador sea north atlantic ocean yamashita et al 2008 but were not detected below the permanent thermocline in old deep waters 450 years in the central arctic ocean basins yeung et al 2017 the intrusion of perfluorinated compounds to deep waters is often negligible in old deep waters such as those found in the central arctic ocean basins yeung et al 2017 and fram strait joerss et al 2020 because the estimated time for deep water formation in these regions is usually more than 100 years yet perfluorinated acids were first produced and used in the 1960s yamashita et al 2008 hence deep water formation can contribute to the depletion of perfluorinated compounds from the global ocean surface particularly in the north atlantic and southern oceans lohmann et al 2006 however pfas contamination in the south pacific ocean was shown to be negligible below detection limit to 10 pg l 1 in ocean surface and the deep water compared to other oceans yamashita et al 2008 this was probably because there was no direct discharge of pfas in the south pacific ocean since the water masses comprise of 1000 years old ocean currents and antarctic circumpolar water masses previous mass flow estimates showed that pfos and pfoa flux in the deep water layer of the labrador sea was four and ten times higher than pcb flux respectively lohmann et al 2006 yamashita et al 2008 the results suggested highly soluble and less volatile organic pollutants transferred from the surface water to the deep water faster than the semi volatile and relatively more hydrophobic organic pollutants even though deep water flux of pfas in the labrador sea is relatively fast transferring the pfoas emitted globally to date into global oceans requires at least 4500 years yamashita et al 2008 in the north atlantic ocean pfos concentrations were higher and more variable in the surface water 0 10 m compared to the subsurface water 365 510 m and the water layer around the permanent thermocline 985 1335 m zhang et al 2017 the lag time between peak pfos emission and peak concentrations in subsurface and permanent thermocline layer water was 2 3 years and more than 30 years respectively this was probably because vertical mixing in the north atlantic is intense during winters and can reach 600 m depths while subduction and ventilation of water in the surface mixed layer to the permanent thermocline is slow zhang et al 2017 for that reason the distribution of perfluorinated acids in oceans is often used as chemical tracer to assess the transport of anthropogenic pollutants by oceanic currents pfas profiles and concentrations significantly vary between surface and deep water oceans except in seas that experience intense vertical mixing wei et al 2008 yeung et al 2017 a study on perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorobutanesulfonate pfbs in global oceans found distinct stratification in the sources of the compounds the north atlantic current was the major source of the perfluorinated acids in the surface waters the labrador current in the subsurface waters and the denmark strait overflow water in the deep layers below 2000 m depth yamashita et al 2008 in western mediterranean sea pfas concentrations in the deep water 141 pg l 1 were about two times lowers than those in the surface water samples 357 pg l 1 brumovský et al 2016 the western mediterranean deep water has short renewal cycles since at least two intense dense shelf water cascading and open sea convection events were observed between 2004 and 2012 the vertical profile of pfas in the mediterranean and japan seas substantially differed even though both are semi enclosed seas with deep waters isolated from the open ocean yamazaki et al 2019 yamazaki et al 2019 found that the pfas concentration in the mediterranean sea were an order of magnitude higher than in the japan sea the pfas concentrations steadily decreased with an increase in depth in the japan sea with only pfda and pfhxs having a maximum concentration in the mid deep waters 1000 1500 m in contrast pfas vertical profile was highly variable in the mediterranean sea although at some locations higher concentrations of pfda pfna pfhxa and pfhpa were detected in the deepest water columns sampled 2300 3600 m yamazaki et al 2019 this is probably because pfna pfhxa and pfhpa are legacy pfas that were extensively used in fluoropolymer products lin et al 2020 overall the pfas profiles in young deep waters such as the mediterranean sea are indicative of the pfas profiles in surface seawater of a decade earlier while those of old deep waters are associated with legacy pfas however currently missing are data on pfas profiles in deep sea waters surrounded by low income countries where several banned pfas are likely to be still in use 3 3 settling particle characteristics biogenic inorganic and anthropogenic particles are important vectors for the vertical transport of organic pollutants in oceans as the non biogenic particles sink organic pollutants may be released to the deep water column via bio transformation or dissolution of particles however the profile of organic pollutants transported can be influenced by the nature of the settling particle for example a study in the indian pacific and atlantic oceans found that the vertical flux of pfas via zooplankton fecal matter was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of pfas associated with phytoplankton gonzález gaya et al 2019 settling of large particles 50 μm in deep marine ecosystems contributes significantly to the vertical transport of pollutants through the water column while small particles are carried by water masses and may also contribute to the advective transport of the organic pollutants martí et al 2001 the primary source of organic pollutants in small particles is partitioning from water particles in contrast organic pollutants in large biogenic particles come directly from the food chain martí et al 2001 a study in mediterranean deep waters found that the concentration of halogenated organic contaminants on the small particles 0 7 μm decreased significantly with depth compared to large particles 50 μm martí et al 2001 hence particle size can influence the accumulation rate of organic pollutants in the water column and sediments microplastics are complex particles comprising of a dynamic mixture of monomers additives and processing agents galloway et al 2017 they often host microorganisms and bind organic pollutants and organic material which alters the microplastic density and surface charge resulting in a change in bioavailability of the organic pollutants galloway et al 2017 an estimated 1 2 4 2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge of which 14 4 236 thousand metric tons are floating in the global ocean jambeck et al 2015 weiss et al 2021 around 99 8 of the plastic debris discharged into the oceans since the 1950s are estimated to be below the ocean surface in the subsurface deep water layer or seafloor koelmans et al 2017 plastic particles are transferred to the deep water and seafloor through accumulation in biota following ingestion thermohaline driven currents and gravitational settling following loss of buoyancy or incorporation into fecal matter kvale et al 2020 a recent study showed that bathochordaeus stygius one of the most abundant zooplankton effectively transported microplastics from the ocean surface to the deep sea by ingesting and then excreting microplastics as part of their fecal pellets katija et al 2017 during physicochemical and biological weathering of plastic debris to form microplastics plastic monomers additives and plastic attached organic pollutants inadvertently leach to the surrounding water column thus contributing to the flux of organic pollutants in the deep sea dasgupta et al 2021 this is greatly concerning since around 10 500 compounds are used worldwide as plastic monomers additives e g antioxidants biocides flame retardants plasticizers light stabilizers and colorants and processing aids e g heat stabilizer crosslinking agent lubricant solvent and antistatic agent of which 2486 are substances of potential concern while no hazard data was available for 4100 substances wiesinger et al 2021 a previous study found polychlorinated biphenyl 127 142 ng g 1 organochlorine pesticides 4280 5350 ng g 1 and chlordane 1080 1260 ng g 1 concentrations in microplastics and plastic pellets found in the xisha trough in the south china sea dasgupta et al 2021 the concentration of organochlorine pesticides in xisha trough was higher than those found in coastal beaches 2 2 1970 ng g 1 on the south china sea while pah concentrations were an order of magnitude lower than those found on the beach 11 2 7710 ng g 1 shi et al 2020 organochlorine pesticides such as ddt are more hydrophobic than pahs and tend to have lower desorption and degradation rates during transport to the deep sea from coastal environments bakir et al 2014 however long term desorption of organic pollutants from microplastics is highly influenced by the polymer water partition coefficients of the compounds for example a previous study found light pcb congeners desorbed faster e g pcb 8 half life 14 days than heavier congeners e g pcb 209 half life 210 years endo et al 2013 hence it is expected that microplastic associated pcbs in the deep sea would be dominated by heavier congeners however the less recalcitrant and more water soluble tri pcbs were the most dominant pcb congeners 92 and the composition was consistent with the technical mixtures produced in china dasgupta et al 2021 low molecular weight pcb congeners like tri pcb have more extended atmospheric reach they are sometimes generated during the microbial transformation of high molecular weight pcbs and are preferentially exchanged during ocean air interactions due to their lightweight dasgupta et al 2021 2018 in vitro digestive models have revealed microplastic can act as a vector or cleaner extracting organic pollutants from the gut in aquatic organisms mohamed nor and koelmans 2019 however comprehensive data on the flux of organic pollutants into the deep sea through microplastic transport are still lacking 4 factors influencing the accumulation of organic pollutants in the deep sea 4 1 microbial biotransformation it is often assumed that the biotransformation mechanisms of organic pollutants in the deep sea and surface water ecosystems are similar despite the drastic differences in temperature and hydrostatic pressure louvado et al 2015 at low temperatures the enzymatic activity of organohalogen degrading microorganisms often decreases resulting in low organic pollutant degradation efficiency in contrast high hydrostatic pressure in deep sea ecosystems was shown to decrease the fungal degradation of poly β hydroxybutyric acid gonda et al 2000 previous studies showed that bacteria in deep sea ecosystems developed phenotypical characteristics such as cell membrane with a higher amount of unsaturated fatty acids and lack of genes involved in photosynthetic reactions which enabled their adaptation to the psychro peizophilic conditions louvado et al 2015 these phenotypic adaptations may reduce the permeability of the deep sea microorganisms resulting in decreased organic pollutant uptake and intracellular biotransformation the low temperatures and high hydrostatic pressure conditions can facilitate the role of deep sea ecosystems as the ultimate sink of organic pollutants however organohalogen degrading bacteria may have adapted to the psychro peizophilic conditions as they developed higher diversity in metabolic activity konstantinidis et al 2009 since studies modeling the global fate and transport are often based on the chemodynamics of the organic pollutants in surface water they may under or overestimate the global distribution of organic pollutants considering the deep sea is probably the largest environmental compartment organic pollutants partition microbial transformation of freely dissolved or particle attached organic pollutants contributes to removing organic pollutants in the deep sea next generation sequencing analysis of deep sea sediments from the great australian bight detected three genes i e alkb c23o and pmoa associated with aerobic hydrocarbon degradation van de kamp et al 2019 various studies have shown that bacteria isolated from different deep sea geomorphologies such as hydrothermal vents could degrade organohalogens bacteria isolated from hydrothermal vents have been shown to readily degrade pahs and n alkanes since they evolved to use hydrocarbons as their primary carbon source ma et al 2021 gammaproteobacteria i e fj613315 pseudomonas stutzeri strain hyss62 and actinobacteria i e hm222653 nocardioides sp 0701c5 1 that oxidize pcbs were previously isolated from deep sea sediments in the kongsfjorden papale et al 2017 the removal efficiency of p stutzeri contained the bpha gene and its removal efficiency was 10 69 at 4 c and 7 3 93 at 15 c papale et al 2017 the di and tri pcbs were more efficiently removed at both temperatures than tetra pcbs suggesting heavier congeners might be more recalcitrant than lighter congeners in the deep sea sediments the degradation of organic pollutants by deep sea bacteria might follow pathways different from those observed from coastal soil freshwater and open ocean bacteria deep sea bacteria adapted to lower oxygen nutrient and temperature and higher pressure conditions which probably altered how they use organic pollutants as food sources scoma et al 2019 studies on the biotransformation of organic pollutants other than hydrocarbons in deep sea ecosystems remain scarce 4 2 bioavailability particle associated organic pollutants often exhibit low bioavailability the extent to which depends on their hydrophobicity the bioavailability of organic pollutants often changes as the particle associated organic pollutants are transported to the deep water layer due to changes in temperature salinity oxygenation and particle characteristics this is partly because the physicochemical characteristics of the organic pollutants e g lipophilicity dipole moment and water solubility may alter as the water chemistry changes between the surface subsurface to deep water lyytikäinen et al 2003 interestingly previous studies have shown that the accumulation of pfas in biota was driven by phospholipid and protein interactions processes that are governed by the polarity and hydrophobicity of the compound ng and hungerbühler 2014 additionally changes in sediment characteristics e g particle size polarity and organic carbon content due to changes in water chemistry with depth or microbial degradation may alter the bioavailability of organic pollutants lyytikäinen et al 2003 for example sediments in the blanes submarine canyon had polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdf concentrations 754 ng kg 1 strongly correlated with soot r2 0 852 p 0 008 but not organic carbon content castro jiménez et al 2013 this was probably because pcdf strongly sorbs to soot and not to organic carbon as demonstrated by the low f oc k ow ρ oc f sc k scw ratio 0 2 1 where f oc represents the mass fraction organic carbon k ow the octanol water partition coefficient ρ oc the octanol density g l 1 f sc the mass fraction of soot content and k scw is soot water partition coefficient castro jiménez et al 2013 the partitioning of pcdfs to soot in deep sea ecosystems might reduce their bioavailability resulting in the sediments acting as an ultimate sink furthermore hadal sediments are known to have very low organic carbon content 0 22 yet high concentrations of pcbs 930 4200 ng kg 1 and pbdes 245 590 ng kg 1 have been detected in hadal sediments from the marian trench dasgupta et al 2018 the hadal sediments had high contents of clay minerals such as illite clinochlore and nontronite which are known to promote i steric effects between bulky or nonplanar organic pollutants and the clay minerals and ii the formation of complexes between weakly hydrated cations in the clay minerals and the negatively charged moieties of the organic pollutants liu et al 2015 hence there is need for additional studies on the role of sediment characteristics on the bioavailability of organic pollutants in deep sea compounds with low water solubility and high hydrophobicity often preferentially partition to the rapidly sinking particles while those with high water solubility preferentially remain in the water column the trend is probably not universal because a previous study found that there was no significant correlation between pfas flux to the deep water layer and the hydrophobicity of the compounds gonzález gaya et al 2019 in fact long chain pfcas which had a relatively higher hydrophobicity had low flux to the deep chlorophyll maximum gonzález gaya et al 2019 pfas are probably transported from the surface to the deep water through the biological pump since gonzález gaya et al 2019 demonstrated that particle settling flux negatively correlated to the dissolved phase concentration of pfas in the deep chlorophyll maximum however a previous study found that there was no significant correlation between pfas accumulation in phytoplankton and pfas hydrophobicity casal et al 2017 hence the adsorption or bioaccumulation of pfas such as pfoa to sinking particles is not primarily dependent on compound hydrophobicity but other properties such as polarity ng and hungerbühler 2014 there is a need for further studies to assess the effect of organic pollutant bioavailability on the efficacy of biological pumps in removing organic pollutants from the sea surface 4 3 water column depth biogeochemical processes in the water column influence the occurrence settling and fate of organic pollutants in the ocean galbán malagón et al 2012 in the arctic ocean pbde concentrations were an order of magnitude higher in the deep waters than in the polar mixed layer suggesting a predominancy of vertical transport of the pbdes salvadó et al 2016 the relative contribution of less brominated congeners i e tri to hepta bdes increased with depth compared to the heavier congeners salvadó et al 2016 the increase with depth of bde 71 which are not found in technical mixtures and other less brominated congeners suggest heavier congeners transformed to lighter congeners during vertical or oceanic transport salvadó et al 2016 previous studies in the central arctic ocean basin carrizo et al 2017 and fram strait ma et al 2018 found that transformation of ddts to ddes contributed to the relative increase in ddes with depth in contrast the concentration of highly chlorinated pcbs increased with depth suggesting sorption to settling particles contributed to the vertical transport of the pcbs ma et al 2018 passive sampling employed by ma et al 2018 has shown to be a valuable tool for assessing the vertical distribution of organophosphate esters opes and pbdes in the fram strait mcdonough et al 2018 and pcbs pahs and ocps in the irminger sea booij et al 2014 although little vertical trends were observed in the fram strait chlorinated opes were the most dominant opes 34 100 in the deep water mass compared to alkyl and aryl opes mcdonough et al 2018 the total concentration of the chlorinated opes 0 006 0 430 ng l 1 was an order of magnitude higher than that of the alkyl aryl compounds 0 0001 0 066 ng l 1 mcdonough et al 2018 chlorinated opes are more persistent in the deep water mass since they are less degradable via hydrolysis or indirect photolysis than the alkyl aryl opes particle sediment and water sampling challenges continue to limit our understanding of the role of particle size on the mass influx of organic contaminants in the deep ocean ecosystem passive samplers are more suitable for assessing the vertical and global distribution of organic pollutants since they are cost effective easier to handle and have high analyte enrichment potential as a result a global monitoring program for organic pollutants in global oceans including deep waters called the aquatic global passive sampling aqua gaps network was established in 2017 lohmann et al 2017 accumulation of organic pollutants in the deep sea can be influenced by ocean stratification stratification in the st lawrence maritime estuary and gulf water column occurred due to cold and oxygen rich waters from the labrador current and warm and oxygen deficient waters from the atlantic ocean isolated the surface waters and the deep waters picard et al 2021 the concentration ratios in subsurface to deep water ratios were significantly higher for current use pfas e g the ratio for pfbs was 6 1 than legacy pfas e g the pfos and pfoa ratios were 2 5 and 1 8 respectively picard et al 2021 pharmaceuticals in the gulf of cadiz exhibited a similar trend probably due to the water column stratification caused by the presence of dense mediterranean waters and less saline atlantic ocean waters biel maeso et al 2018 since the water masses in stratified seas have different physicochemical properties it is expected that the bio transformation of the organic pollutants and the settling particles will differ with depth however there are few studies on the role of water mass characteristics and the fate of organic pollutants 4 4 seafloor geomorphology recent advances in exploration and sampling technology revealed deep sea ecosystems contain distinct geomorphological features such as seamounts submerged plateaus submarine canyons trenches and hydrothermal vents mcclain and rex 2015 besides being a hotspot of faunal abundance diversity and sometimes endemism deep sea geomorphological features often alter oceanographic conditions rogers 2015 the interaction between ocean currents and a steep geomorphological feature e g valleys ridges and canyons often promotes the accumulation of organic matter and sediments that originate from the continental shelf zone astrahan et al 2017 for example castro jiménez et al 2013 found that the total 2 3 7 8 pcdd fs concentration of 17 congeners 102 680 ng kg 1 d w were three to six times higher in sediments at the deepest locations of the blanes submarine canyon 1700 m depths than at the shallow locations 500 m depths or the adjacent open slope ocean current circulations in submarine canyons promote the flushing of sediment particles and their associated organic pollutants down the slope resulting in the accumulation of the sediments and organic pollutants in the deepest locations of the canyon these ocean currents are often initiated by coastal storms and dense shelf water cascading i e movement of water masses following cooling evaporation or freezing of the ocean surface in the shelf continent resulting in dense water formation that sinks as warm and saline water rises a recent study in the gulf of cagliari revealed submarines canyons were the primary physical pathway transporting pahs and pcbs from land to the deep sea tamburrino et al 2019 astrahan et al 2017 found that the highest amounts of organic matter in bottom sediments corresponded with the locations of ridgelines and canyons the sediments with high organic carbon content had higher concentrations of highly hydrophobic pcbs and pahs astrahan et al 2017 in addition seafloor geomorphology can also affect critical ecosystem features such as population structure composition and function which drive biotransformation and bioaccumulation of pops in the deep sea costello and chaudhary 2017 a previous study found seafloor morphologies such as troughs sediment waves and furrows increased biodiversity in the deep sea which in turn influenced ecosystem processes e g biological processes involved in the biological pump mechanisms at a regional scale zeppilli et al 2016 4 5 ecological implications the fate and transport behavior of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems determine their magnitude and duration of exposure to deep sea organisms hydrophobic organic pollutants such as ddts highly chlorinated pcbs and highly brominated pbdes readily bioaccumulate in deep sea organisms due to their high lipophilicity and recalcitrant nature however biomagnification and bioaccumulation of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is influenced by the habitat niche e g pelagic benthic and demersal physicochemical properties and occurrence of the organic pollutants and metabolic capacity for example hydrophobic organic pollutants such as pcbs ddts and pbdes with log k ow of 6 0 8 0 were shown to significantly bioaccumulate in carnivorous fish such as blackbelly lanternshark etmopterus lucifer kaup s arrowtooth eel synaphobranchus kaupii snubnosed eel simenchelys parasitica and eelpout lycodes hubbsi takahashi et al 2010 this suggested that feeding habits contribute significantly to the biomagnification of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems organic pollutants with log k ow 6 0 e g hchs hcb and hbcds equilibrate relatively faster with the aqueous phase than ddts pbdes and highly chlorinated pcbs as a result while trophic magnification can be expected for highly hydrophobic organic pollutants concentrations of hchs and hcb have smaller variations across trophic levels takahashi et al 2010 in addition fish from the western north pacific ocean and along the oyashio current had higher hch concentrations than those from warmer locations along the kuroshio current due to their high vapor pressure hchs readily partition to the atmosphere under warm conditions resulting in less hch available for bioaccumulation in fish takahashi et al 2010 bioaccumulation and biomagnification of organic pollutants in deep sea biota are influenced by an interplay between interspecies traits such as habitat niche vertical mobility respiration rate lipid composition metabolic capacity and food web interconnectivity and oceanographic factors such as ocean currents castro jiménez et al 2013 romero romero et al 2017 for example a study in the avilés submarine canyon found that pcbs and pbdes biomagnified in the pelagic but not in the benthic food web romero romero et al 2017 pcb 108 118 138 153 and 180 were the most dominant congeners in deep sea biota probably due to their abundance in technical mixtures there was high inter specific variation in the distribution of the in the deep sea fish however considering the limited sampling size of the study additional studies are required to assess intra specific variations in organic pollutant bioaccumulation in the blanes submarine canyon the highest pcdd f concentrations were detected in nektobenthic crustaceans 220 795 ng kg 1 l w and fish 110 300 ng kg 1 l w castro jiménez et al 2013 since pelagic species have high vertical mobility organic pollutants bioaccumulation in pelagic species tends to be associated with the concentration of organic pollutants in primary producers and the surface water in contrast by inhabiting primarily on the seafloor benthic and nektobenthic species often have organic pollutants profiles linked to deep sea sediments and waters as well as relatively highly hydrophobic contaminants castro jiménez et al 2013 5 future directions determining the mechanisms pathways and rates of fate and transport of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is challenging as it is a multidisciplinary endeavor requiring skills in physical oceanography analytical chemistry biogeochemistry marine ecology environmental microbiology and even hydrology traditional approaches for sampling and detecting organic pollutants in environmental samples based on oceanographic cruises are often time consuming labor intensive complex and impractical for long term monitoring due to cost the depth high hydrostatic pressure and low temperatures prevalent in deep sea ecosystems limit the applicability of traditional technologies for collecting storing and manipulating samples hence the scarcity of deep sea environmental samples cario et al 2019 since deep sea conditions are difficult and expensive to replicate in the laboratory microcosm studies to investigate the bio transformation and sorption behavior of organic pollutants is challenging hence future studies should answer the research questions described in table 2 to better understand the fate transport and impact of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems we discuss these critical research topics in the subsequent passages traditional ocean monitoring approaches lack adequate spatial vertical and temporal coverage required for a multiscale multi compartment and multidisciplinary assessment of complex biogeochemical processes in the cast deep sea ecosystems biogeochemical processes controlling the chemodynamics of organic pollutants vary with space and time hence the need for multi dimensional coverage kaiser and barnes 2008 while autonomous platforms such as floats underwater vehicles and floats have been successfully used in measuring physical oceanographic processes gravitational settling of particles and mechanisms and efficiency of biological carbon pump very few studies used the platforms to understand the chemodynamics of organic pollutants chai et al 2020 autonomous underwater vehicles are often used to map seafloor geomorphologies locate ocean dumping sites track contaminant plumes and thermocline and collect environmental samples jones et al 2019 tracking the thermocline can be a powerful tool for assessing the role of deep water formation or water mass flux in the input of organic pollutants in the deep sea table 2 coupling autonomous underwater vehicles with photometry can offer a detailed ephemeral view of the seafloor and it has been previously used to identify ocean dumping of ddt containers kivenson et al 2019 a previous study used a sentry precision robotic impeller driven plankton sampler coupled with autonomous underwater vehicles successfully collected plankton and larva from the blake ridge seep 2160 m depth on the us atlantic margin billings et al 2017 therefore autonomous platforms are valuable for assessing the role of biological and physical pumps in the global dynamics of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems the difficulties in assessing biological responses following organic pollutants exposure in biota at spatial or temporal scale could be alleviated by using an autonomous underwater vehicle for sampling deep sea species linking exposure to biological response using chemical analysis combined with biomarker analysis transcriptomics lipidomics or metabolomics deleo et al 2021 and paleo ecotoxicology linking historical contamination to deep sea fossils of different biological organisms or species diversity changes using environmental dna korosi et al 2017 understanding the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems is difficult due to the complexity of the mixture effect as biota are exposed to multiple threats sanganyado et al 2020 current ecotoxicological assays often disregard the potential mixture effects caused by the interaction of the organic pollutants with natural stressors such as salinity cold temperature and high hydrostatic pressure prevalent in deep sea ecosystems mestre et al 2014 in addition the bulk of the literature on organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystems tend to report total concentrations while data on bioaccessibility and bioavailability which are more relevant for assessing impact of organic pollutants on ecosystem health are scarce future studies on the biological effects of organic pollutants should mimic the deep sea conditions to ensure the ecotoxicological data generated for environmental risk assessment is relevant and accurate there is a need for comprehensive studies exploring the impact of sea based activities such as deep sea mining on organic pollutants chemodynamics and deep sea biogeochemical processes the discharge of dissolved substances and nutrients due to deep sea mining activities alters the seafloor morphology benthic geochemistry deep water chemistry primary production and food web structure which may change the biological and physical pump efficiencies levin et al 2020 deep sea mining can cause habitat degradation resulting in loss of biodiversity and species connectivity thus altering the food web structure however the lack of large scale studies on the ecological consequences of deep sea mining makes it difficult for regulators such as the international seabed authority to develop toxicity thresholds that are adequate for minimizing the adverse effects caused by deep sea mining kaikkonen et al 2018 baseline studies on the biological chemical and physical condition of the deep seabed are required to ensure future environmental monitoring programs for organic pollutants can adequately determine the effect of exploration and exploitation activities ginzky et al 2020 large scale monitoring of spatial and temporal changes in mass flow of organic pollutants in deep sea ecosystem is essential for understanding the impact of human activities on the deep sea while global monitoring systems have been proposed for monitoring current trends in the distribution of organic pollutants in oceans historical emissions have been widely estimated using historical usage patterns linking historical emissions data to changes in deep sea ecosystems is difficult due to uncertainties in estimating organic pollutant flux and linking exposure to biological response recent studies demonstrated that combining paleolimnology and ecotoxicology techniques by assessing changes in contaminant profile and biological proxies e g fossils and environmental dna down a dated sediment core analysis could provide critical data on historical emission and its associated ecological consequences korosi et al 2017 deep sea sediment cores have been successfully used to reconstruct past climatic and oceanographic changes artemova et al 2019 toomey et al 2013 evaluate recovery of seafloor from bottom trawling paradis et al 2021 assess changes in microbial community structure with sediment depth wang et al 2010 and estimate historical flux of mercury in the northwest pacific ocean aksentov and sattarova 2020 reconstructing past emissions of organic pollutants particularly in oceans could help in assessing the impact of chemical regulations on organic pollutant flux in deep seas transformation products should not be overlooked when monitoring the distribution of organic pollutants in deep water ecosystems in the st lawrence maritime estuary and gulf the concentration of metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid a metolachlor transformation product was nearly thirty times higher than that of the parent compound picard et al 2021 this is particularly concerning since metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid was shown to be more toxic to zebrafish larvae than s metolachlor as they caused overexpression of genes involved in the regulation of the thyroid system and cell cycle rozmánková et al 2020 additionally determination of transformation product and parent compound ratios together with congener ratios and chiral signatures can be a useful tool for source apportionment in deep seas shi et al 2020 source apportionment can aid in the development of environmental regulations that protect deep sea ecosystems 6 conclusion although organic pollutants have been detected in deep sea environments for the past 50 years more data on biogeochemical geophysical oceanographic and sedimentological processes are required to make meaningful predictions of the global fate of organic pollutants in the deep sea such data can be obtained using passive samplers as they have high analyte enrichment factor low matrix interferences provide concentrations of the bioavailable phase and can provide time weighted average concentrations however most investigations on the distribution of organic pollutants in deep sea environments were conducted using active sampling techniques while passive sampling is rarely used therefore future studies on the chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea should employ passive sampling there were significant variations in the vertical profiles of organic pollutants in particular deep seas or between regions the variations could be attributed to the pollutants e g physicochemical properties such as log k ow volatility aqueous solubility and use and production patterns oceanic currents e g deep water formation and eddy diffusion and biogeochemical processes in the water column considering much of the deep sea remains unexplored and targeted analysis was predominantly used in these studies the chemodynamics of several organic pollutants in much of the unexplored ocean remains unknown to better understand the ecological risk posed by organic pollutants future studies should explore the factors influencing their bioaccumulation and biomagnification in deep sea food webs in addition since the toxicological effects of organic pollutants on much of the deep sea biota remain poorly understood there is a need for experimental and in vitro models for understanding the toxicity mechanisms of organic pollutants in various deep sea biota autonomous underwater vehicles equipped to deploy passive samplers can help extend the region of deep seas investigated while suspect and non target screening

16579,water resources of desired quality and quantity are the foundation for human survival and sustainable development to better protect the water environment and conserve water resources efficient water management purification and transportation are of critical importance in recent years machine learning ml has exhibited its practicability reliability and high efficiency in numerous applications furthermore it has solved conventional and emerging problems in both natural and engineered water systems for example ml can predict various water quality indicators in situ and real time by considering the complex interactions among water related variables ml approaches can also solve emerging pollution problems with proven rules or universal mechanisms summarized from the related research moreover by applying image recognition technology to analyze the relationships between image information and physicochemical properties of the research object ml can effectively identify and characterize specific contaminants in view of the bright prospects of ml this review comprehensively summarizes the development of ml applications in natural and engineered water systems first the

treatment techniques assisting characterization analysis purifying and distributing drinking water and collecting and treating sewage water in engineered water systems are summarized finally the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used algorithms are analyzed according to their structures and mechanisms and recommendations on the selection of ml algorithms for different studies as well as prospects on the application and development of ml in water science are proposed this review provides references for solving a wider range of water related problems and brings further insights into the intelligent development of water science graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords machine learning natural water systems engineered water systems 1 introduction water is one of the most indispensable material resources on which the survival and development of humanity depends however the increasing amounts of pollutant discharge caused by human activities has been leading to increasing amount of water pollution which poses a threat to the sustainable development of ecosystems and human society to protect the ecological safety and human health from water pollution a range of measures have been adopted in natural water systems the qualities of various waters e g rivers lakes groundwaters and seawaters are under close monitoring for better management and utilization of water resources in addition water pollution is controlled using identification source tracking and toxicity evaluations of pollutants in engineered water systems raw water taken from natural waters is purified in drinking water treatment plants dwtps using various treatment processes e g coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection to remove the contaminants and then this supplied to users via distribution systems additionally sewage and wastewater are collected and treated in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps through a series of physical chemical and biological processes to abate pollution toward the urban and natural environment during the processes of natural water management water resource utilization and polluted water treatment a large number of corresponding studies have been conducted gradually developing into fields related to natural and engineered water systems currently the fourth industrial revolution combined with big data and artificial intelligence is expected to bring immense changes to human society machine learning ml is one of the technical approaches of artificial intelligence and it is developed using various algorithms based on mathematical and statistical knowledge ml can predict the status of new data by summarizing the underlying relationships and rules within known data and its prediction performance will improve with an increase in the data amount and the iteration of the algorithms vamathevan et al 2019 ml can solve complex problems involving massive nonlinear processes or combinatorial spaces that cannot be solved using conventional methods or only with great time and cost therefore ml has been widely used in fields such as computer vision speech recognition natural language processing robotic control and other hot topics jordan and mitchell 2015a in recent years ml has also been applied to solve a wide variety of problems in the water science field to understand the application situation of ml in these fields and the applicability and feasibility of various algorithms in solving water related problems it is necessary to review and summarize the existing studies and some papers have reviewed relevant studies for example many publications have reviewed the application of artificial neural networks anns and other algorithms such as the fuzzy inference system fis evolutionary algorithms the support vector machine svm random forest rf decision tree dt and ml coupled with wavelet transformation or optimization algorithms for modeling water quality in rivers lakes and groundwater chau 2006 che osmi et al 2016 chen et al 2020b ighalo et al 2020 maier and dandy 2000 maier et al 2010 2014 nicklow et al 2010 ostfeld and solomatine 2008 raghavendra and deka 2014 rajaee et al 2020 tiyasha tung and yaseen 2020 in addition the applications of ml in other aspects or water related research have also been reviewed such as remote sensing for monitoring water quality sagan et al 2020 wagle et al 2020 drinking water treatment dogo et al 2019 li et al 2021 seawater desalination al aani et al 2019 and wastewater treatment and pollutant removal fan et al 2018 khataee and kasiri 2011 wang et al 2021b yaseen 2021 all of these reviews are beneficial for researchers to understand and expand the application of artificial intelligence in the water science field however many other published applications of ml such as groundwater contaminant mapping podgorski and berg 2020 contaminant sources tracing balleste et al 2020 pollutant toxicity evaluating wang et al 2021d contaminant identification baek et al 2021 and others have not been summarized and discussed moreover many review papers have focused on the application of one algorithm thus lacking a comparison of its advantages and disadvantages with other algorithms as is well known plenty of ml algorithms have been developed and their performance for solving practical tasks varies therefore an analysis of the applicability scope of various algorithms for dealing with different water related problems is required this article provides a comprehensive review of ml applications in related fields of water science and summarizes the representative studies in recent years first the establishment processes of ml models including data preparation algorithm selection and model evaluation are briefly introduced in addition the representative applications of ml in water quality prediction and management in natural water systems as well as technology development and operation monitoring in engineered water systems are summarized to be specific in natural water systems ml has been used to predict water quality indicators map pollutant distribution in groundwater classify water resources trace contaminant sources and evaluate pollutant toxicities in engineered water systems ml has been applied to optimize adsorption and oxidation processes assist laboratory characterization analyses and improve the operation and management of drinking water purification and distribution as well as wastewater collection and treatment more importantly the advantages and disadvantages of representative algorithms are discussed and their applicability for different data and researches is analyzed by comparing their structures and mechanisms finally current research hotspots challenges and prospects of ml combined water utilization and pollution control are discussed 2 an overview of machine learning ml refers to a technology that uses a series of programmed algorithms to predict the future patterns of any raw data with the experience learned from the hidden associations within the given data through an automatic mathematical analysis jordan and mitchell 2015b in general to recognize the rules underlying the known data as accurately as possible the data should first be well treated to generate the dataset then an appropriate ml algorithm is determined according to the characteristics of input data and the requirements of output data the selected algorithm will then be trained with the well prepared data and evaluated to adjust the hyper parameters within thus generating the desired model afterward the proposed ml model is qualified to make predictions on new data the establishment of the ml model is briefly introduced in the subsequent sections and those who want to learn more details about ml algorithms can refer to specialized books and papers on statistics or machine learning hastie et al 2008 mohri et al 2012 2 1 date preparation an ideal ml requires appropriate and well trained models but the quality and quantity of data are also vitally important currently we can crawl data from the internet collect data from the literature search data from open source databases or record data from the experiments etc however we typically obtain raw data with missing values errors duplicates or noises that should be treated with data cleansing then feature engineering is conducted based on professional background knowledge to select or extract data features according to task demands finally the prepared data is typically divided into a training set a validation set for some algorithms and a test set the training set is used to train the model based on the selected ml algorithm while the validation set is applied to tune hyper parameters to optimize the trained model after the training process the predictive and generalization ability of the trained model is evaluated using the test set by comparing the prediction outputs with their corresponding known results 2 2 algorithm selection the rise of ml can be traced back to the 1950s when donald hebb proposed the hebbian learning theory hebb 1949 after which a wide range of ml algorithms were developed in general ml algorithms can be classified into three categories supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning a certain classification also includes semi supervised learning according to the types of data and requirements of the work moreover the applications of deep learning dl for water utilization and pollution control are also discussed due to the inseparable relationships between dl and ml fig 1 outlines the reviewed ml algorithms and their applications in the fields of natural and engineered water systems supervised learning algorithms are typically applied to treat labeled data to predict the values of a continuous set using regression or the category of a discrete set using classification for the regression analysis the least square method lsm has long been used in many algorithms as it can find the best function parameters to minimize the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values based on the lsm the simplest ml algorithm linear regression is typically applied when the dataset possesses a relatively small size and a linear relationship within data fig 2 a when dealing with nonlinear relationships polynomial regression which is also based on lsm is a better choice as it can flexibly fit nonlinear data by adjusting the power of the variables fig 2b by using linear and polynomial regressions rapid modeling intuitive interpretation and accurate sensitivity to outliers can be achieved in addition to linear and polynomial regressions the ridge regression lasso regression and elasticnet regression are also common regression algorithms used in other fields as for the classification tasks the naïve bayesian nb classifier and logistic regression lr have long been used the nb classifier can calculate the required posterior probability based on the existing prior probability of the event then the newly gained probability is updated to perform the subsequent tasks the lr applies the sigmoid function to normalize the predicted values thus calculating the probability of an event and comparing it with the selected threshold value usually 0 5 to generate the predicted binary outcomes yes or no in addition to the algorithms described above specifically developed for regression or classification many other algorithms can be used for both regression and classification the k nearest neighbors knn can predict the value or category of a sample according to its adjacent neighbors in the feature space for regression the average value of the k nearest neighbors is recognized as the prediction result while for classification the category of the most occurring in the k nearest neighbors is outputted fig 2c altman 1992 additionally the support vector machine svm aims at finding a hyperplane to segment the samples based on the principle of maximizing the interval between two categories of samples fig 2d to solve classification or regression problems svm can be divided into support vector classification svc and support vector regression svr kadyrova and pavlova 2014 the decision tree dt is also a popular algorithm that has a tree structure it is composed of a root node several internal nodes and leaf nodes that respectively represent the set of all samples attribute tests and the decision results fig 2e the dt algorithm begins its decision making process from the root node and then compares the tested data with the characteristic nodes the algorithm then selects the next comparison branch according to the result of the attribute test it finally outputs the result of the leaf node as the final decision result myles et al 2004 because the dt algorithm can solve both classification and regression problems it is also known as the classification and regression tree cart moreover to improve the performance of the dt algorithm many derived dt algorithms such as boosted decision trees bdts gradient boosted decision trees gbdts and the random forests rf have been developed in particular rf is an ensemble algorithm comprised of many dts in which each tree randomly samples from the input data to independently generate a prediction result after all the trees output their decisions they vote for the most appropriate result as the final prediction of this rf model fig 2f breiman 2001 aside from the above algorithms the artificial neural network ann was the most frequently used algorithm in the reviewed studies perceptron is the structural unit of ann and it is composed of input cells and an output cell and the weight the connections between them different input information can exert different effects on the output by adjusting the values of the weight connections fig 2g rosenblatt 1957 the perceptron algorithm is a linear classification model that is suitable for dealing with linearly separable data by combining multiple perceptrons and introducing hidden layers and activation functions the multilayer perceptron mlp algorithm was proposed and is capable of treating multi dimensional data fig 2h clark 1991 however mlp is a global approximation algorithm in which all the weights in the network should be readjusted every time the sample is learned therefore mlp has the disadvantage of a slow convergence velocity thus tending to fall into the local optimum the radial basis function neural network rbf nn is another common ann algorithm fig 2i it employs the radial basis function as the activation function and only adjusts the weights connections in the specified domain therefore rbf nn has the advantage of fast convergence and is immune to the local optimum problem lee and chang 2003 moreover the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is also a commonly used ann derived algorithm anfis can be defined as a multi layer feed forward network that employs fuzzy inference to map the input space to the output space anfis allowed the realization of a highly non linear mapping that is considered to be superior in yielding non linear time series compared with common linear methods jang 1993 unsupervised learning algorithms are often applied to reveal the intrinsic characteristics and rules of the unlabeled sample data they are typically applied in dimensionality reduction clustering and anomaly detection also known as outlier detection the principal component analysis pca is a representative method for unsupervised dimensionality reduction as its name implies pca aims to find the most essential characteristics or generate a new characteristic to describe the original dataset thus reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and increasing interpretability with minimized information loss jolliffe and cadima 2016 k means is a common method for clustering analysis it can find a partition to organize data into differentiable groupings by minimizing the squared error between the empirical mean and the points in cluster jain 2010 isolation forest gaussian distribution and local outlier factor lof are also common algorithms for anomaly detection they are typically used to detect samples that are sparsely distributed and far from the majority of data ariyaluran habeeb et al 2019 different from supervised learning algorithms that predict the data directly unsupervised learning algorithms are typically applied for data pretreatment in the studies reviewed herein 2 3 model evaluation many approaches have been proposed to evaluate the performance of ml models the evaluation parameters for regression algorithms primarily include bias variance the mean absolute error mae the mean squared error mse and r squared r2 among others bias is the difference between the predicted result and its actual value while variance represents the degree of deviation from the mean of the total sample mae is the average sum of the absolute value of the bias for each sample it can reflect the actual error of prediction by avoiding the problem where the positive and negative errors cancel each other mse is the average of the sum of the square of the bias for each sample typically to keep the evaluation indicator and the sample values are on the same order of magnitude mse uses the root to obtain the root mean squared error rmse which is also a commonly used measure of performance moreover r2 also known as the coefficient of determination describes the fitting degree of the regression function to the observed values the value of r2 is between 0 and 1 and the closer the r2 value is to 1 the better the model fits the data for classification algorithms the accuracy rate is the most used evaluation indicator and it is the proportion of the correctly classified samples to the total number of samples in addition precision p and recall r are also widely used measurements for evaluating classifiers the predicted results can be divided into true positive tp false positive fp true negative tn and false negative fn according to their real categories and the predicted categories table 1 p is defined as the proportion of the correctly classified positive samples in the total number of positive samples while r is the proportion of the correctly classified positive samples in the total number of correctly classified samples for an ideal classifier the values of both p and r are expected to be as high as possible however one value will increase while the other decreases in practical cases therefore the fβ score the weighted harmonic mean of the p and r values is applied to balance p and r fβ is presented as eq 1 where β measures the relative importance of r to p 1 f β 1 β 2 p r β 2 p r where r matters more than p when β 1 and conversely p matters more than r when β 1 when β 1 fβ is converted to the f1 score that represents the balance between r and p 3 water quality prediction and management in natural water systems natural waters including rivers lakes groundwaters and seas are the most important water sources for human life and productive activities to better manage and utilize natural water resources different countries and regions have adopted various evaluation schemes based on a series of water quality indicators wqis physical indicators include temperature color turbidity electric conductivity ec suspended solids ss and total solids ts chemical indicators include ph dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc alkalinity ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn biological indicators covering chlorophyll a chl a and fecal indicator bacteria fib e g total coliform e coli and enterococcus uddin et al 2021 in recent years many studies have applied ml approaches in water quality prediction and water resource management in natural water environments below the relevant representative applications of ml are summarized including predicting water quality wqis e g do fib and chl a or other multiple indicators mapping pollutant distribution in groundwater classifying water resources according to different standards tracing contamination sources and evaluating pollutant toxicity 3 1 predicting water quality the dissolved oxygen do concentration is a critical parameter for evaluating the ecological health of an aquatic environment this concentration results from an equilibrium between oxygen producing e g photosynthesis and air diffusing and oxygen consuming e g aerobic respiration nitrification and chemical oxidation processes in an aquatic environment olyaie et al 2017 under the influence of these complex processes it is difficult for conventional process based models or statistical approaches to simulate the do level on the contrary data driven ml does not consider the accumulation mechanism of do but only analyzes the statistical and mathematical relationship between different parameters for example wqis such as temperature ph ec and discharge were selected as inputs to train two types of ann models for predicting do concentrations downstream and upstream of fountain creek the rbf nn performed better with a higher r2 value for both sampling stations than the mlp model ay and kisi 2012 however the rbf nn was not as accurate as the mlp in predicting the do concentration in the mediterranean sea along with gaza which might have been attributed to the small database as rbf nn was more sensitive to the data volume zaqoot et al 2009 to improve the performance of the rbf nn the general regression neural network grnn modified the structure of the rbf by replacing its weight connection between the hidden layer and the output layer with a summation layer to reduce the need for data volumes in predicting the do concentration in the danube river the performances of the mlp grnn and recurrent neural network rnn were examined using only small amount of data results showed that the grnn obtained better performance than the mlp did however the grnn was inferior to the rnn model that was equipped with an extra layer to store and transform the previous input information as a decision reference when needed fig 2j j and w 2011 the tested rnn provided considerably better predictions of the do with all results within an error of less than 10 antanasijevic et al 2013b however because the previous information was sequentially stored in rnn too much information would make it difficult to learn from the far information thus causing long term dependency problems to solve this problem the long short term memory lstm algorithm was developed by storing previous information in the memory cells that will be opened by a gate to transfer information when needed fig 2k greff et al 2017 the lstm was applied to predict the river do concentrations at the continental scale using the camels chem database that collected do information from 236 minimally disturbed watersheds across the u s ultimately the proposed lstm model achieved a satisfactory prediction with a mean and median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 60 and 0 78 respectively fig 3 a zhi et al 2021 due to the difference in the spatial location and scale of the study as well as the choice of variables and the amount of data a comparison between different studies is undoubtedly difficult however by utilizing a direct comparison in the same study and a cross comparison of the different studies listed in table s1 it was found that mlp performed well with a small dataset data bulk 1000 while svm performed better with a larger dataset data bulk 1000 moreover considering that the variables used in a study for predicting do are typically based on a time series the lstm is also recommended as it is designed for time series tasks and can carry useful information from the past to the future in addition it relies on fewer environment variables and this saves the cost of data collection drinking water or recreational water polluted with feces has the potential to cause gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases haile et al 1999 total coliform fecal coliform or e coli and enterococcus are typically applied as fecal indicator bacteria fib to characterize fecal contamination in water however common approaches for quantifying fib such as multiple tube fermentation membrane filtration and specific enzymatic detection usually require 18 72 h while emerging techniques such as flow cytometry atp assays online optical sensors and quantitative pcr are costly garcía alba et al 2019 however data driven ml can provide real time predictions that rely on easily available information about environmental conditions e g precipitation discharge and tide and the representative studies are reviewed below for instance an mlp model was used to fill the missing microbial data in a dataset based on related physical chemical and bacteriological data from the kentucky river the mlp had a more accurate performance than conventional imputation or regression models with smaller error values additionally the proposed mlp model also accurately classified observational data into two defined ranges for fecal coliform concentrations in a river system especially when the concentration of fib was below 200 cfu 100 ml chandramouli et al 2007 moreover when the safe concentration of fib was set as the classification threshold ml could also be applied in water quality warnings for recreational surface waters for example when monitoring fecal pollution of coastal water in southern california an mlp accurately predicted the levels of three fibs with fp and fn rates less than 10 thus sufficing to make rapid and reliable decisions regarding beach closures or advisories he and he 2008 in addition to ann models some other algorithms such as cart rf and the bayesian network have also been applied to predict fib concentrations to provide information about water safety thoe et al 2014 though the models described above performed well with high overall accuracy the unbalance in the dataset might have reduced the sensitivity of the predictions data unbalance is caused because most of the data in the dataset was typically below the guideline thresholds while the minority is exceeded this increases the possibility of over fitting in the majority class and information loss in the minority class when training a model batista et al 2004 to solve this problem an adaptive synthetic adasyn sampling algorithm was adopted to create more samples at the boundary between the two classes using linear interpolation fig 3b afterward the proposed knn bdt and mlp models all provided favorable predictions with relatively high sensitivity of approximately 75 and an overall accuracy of greater than 90 xu et al 2020 in addition to adasyn recently the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote was also applied to solve the data imbalance problem in fib prediction smote is a technique based on the nearest neighbor idea to synthesize new samples for the minority class the combination with smote improved the performance of the six tested algorithms for example rf presented a 50 higher true positive rate with respect to the baseline bourel et al 2021 the proposed approach in these two studies provided new insight into data preparation for training ml models moreover no matter what algorithms were applied for fib prediction accuracy was always used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models however accuracy might not be enough to assess models when the potential health effects of a high false negative fn rate are assumed to outweigh the risk of an unnecessary recreational water closure given by a high false positive fp rate therefore stidson et al 2012 attached more importance to the false negative fn rate over other metrics stidson et al 2012 this was because a high fn rate meant the prediction of a dangerous situation as a safe one motamarri and boccelli 2012 therefore when evaluating the performance of an ml model diversified evaluation criteria based on actual requirements should be considered according to table s2 mlp was the most widely used algorithm in the previous studies that modeled fib but algorithms based on dt such as bdt cart and rf performed better in studies that solved the data imbalance problem in addition the model based on dt was more interpretable than the neural network model and it was more instructive to understand and prevent fib from exceeding the safety standard therefore dt based models combined with data imbalance processing technology are more suitable for fib predictions an appropriate amount of phytoplankton in an aquatic environment can improve water quality by producing oxygen and soaking up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis durham et al 2015 however eutrophication of water bodies will promote the rapid growth of phytoplankton thus leading to aquatic environmental problems such as algal blooms ma et al 2015 algal blooms will shade benthic primary producers from the sunlight reduce do levels and accumulate toxic metabolites to threaten the ecology and human beings conley et al 2009 therefore forecasting algal blooms or determining the key factors that control bloom production is important to prevent their deleterious effects recknagel et al 1997 various models have been proposed to achieve this purpose including empirical models deterministic models time series analysis models and fuzzy logic models yabunaka et al 1997 ml has also been applied to predict algal blooms by identifying the environmental factors that affect the growth and accumulation of algal biomass to simulate the nonlinear processes of algal blooms karul et al 2000 lee et al 2003 however environmental factors that control the biomass of algae vary according to different studies for example flow and temperature have been reported to be predominant in determining the initiate and duration of cyanobacterial growth while water color controls the magnitude of the population growth peak maier et al 1998 additionally the importance of controlling factors for different cyanobacteria genera varied with their species concretely anabaena and microcystis had the highest sensitivity to average flow while for planktolyngbya and oscillatoria it was temperature and for cylindrospermopsis it was water color therefore it has been difficult to predict the intensity and frequency of algal blooms using a single environment variable and to control algal biomass by adjusting few influential factors due to the diversity of phytoplankton that made up algal blooms nelson et al 2018 in the last few decades the development of remote sensing technology makes has made it possible to directly observe and investigate algal blooms at large spatial and temporal scales recently ml has also been applied to analyze remote sensing data lary et al 2016 for example moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data were applied to estimate the chl a concentration within the gulf of st lawrence of canada fig 3c in this study remote sensing with 10 types of reflectance rrs was combined with eight different ml algorithms to predict algal blooms the comparison results revealed the svr model obtained the best performance using rrs at 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm he et al 2020 in addition some other remote sensing data such as seawifs have also been applied for estimating chl a concentrations to forecast algal blooms campsvalls et al 2006 keiner 2010 in addition to predicting chl a in the form of remote sensing data remote sensing technology can also provide hyperspectral images to simulate the concentration of algae cells in a study that predicted cyanobacterial cell concentrations pyo et al 2021 developed a convolutional neural network cnn model with a convolutional block attention module cnnan that could emphasize valuable information and suppress insignificant ones to improve the performance of cnn for image recognition compared to a traditional hydrodynamic model and cnn cnnan performed better with a higher nse and a smaller rmse table s3 pyo et al 2021 as mentioned in this section the factors that affect the growth of different algae are different and a natural water body often contains several types of algae at the same time consequently screening from all available water related parameters to determine influential ones is often necessary prior to an algae or chl a prediction which is time and labor intensive remote sensing and image recognition technologies do not consider complex water quality parameters but directly use color information which is one of the major characteristics of water bodies rich in chl a or algae relative to other polluted water bodies therefore algorithms based on remote sensing information or hyperspectral images are undoubtedly the optimal choice to predict the concentration of algae or chl a aside from the single wqi like do fib and chl a introduced above indicators like bod cod toc tp tn and ts are more common in water quality evaluations and ml has also been used to predict these water quality indicators for instance 13 environmental variables were adopted to develop an mlp model to simulate the daily concentrations of toc tn and tp in three rivers the results showed that concentrations of the three wqis were all estimated with r2 values greater than 0 75 moreover the future carbon and nitrogen loads under climate change scenarios were predicted and increases in toc and tn under notable change scenarios were reported holmberg et al 2006 recently an rf model was used to predict the concentrations of nutrients n and p in both rural and urban catchments by analyzing the impacts of each variable in the model and removing the inessential ones the number of variables were minimized to reduce the cost of surrogate sensors in this manner both the low cost and high accuracy of the prediction were guaranteed castrillo and garcia 2020 in addition to rivers the water quality of other water bodies has also been simulated including a lake barzegar et al 2020 a reservoir zhao et al 2007 coastal water palani et al 2008 and even stormwater runoff najah ahmed et al 2019 in particular the water quality index rather than wqis has been utilized in studies to predict the water quality in wetlands using mlp rbf nn svm and cart models the water quality index is a single number calculated using a set of physicochemical water indicators to normalize the water quality mohammadpour et al 2015 2016 interestingly image analysis was also applied to determine the quantitative relationships between the image information and the water quality in a study that analyzed animal wastewater quality the linear regression lr stochastic gradient descent sgd and ridge regression algorithms were applied the rgb color index extracted from the water sample images was used to analyze the correlations between the spectral rate and the wqis including n p ts and total coliform fig 3d the optimal r2 values were as high as 0 98 for ts and 0 96 for total coliform which demonstrated that this was an instructive method for rapid and cheap analysis of water quality li et al 2020b due to random or systematic errors data obtained from site monitoring or experimental processes were possibly affected by noise that caused uncertainty in the accurate prediction to eliminate the effects of noise on data the anfis algorithm was improved by combining it with the wavelet de noising technique wdt the results indicated that wdt anfis was the fastest and the most precise method for processing large volumes of non linear and non parametric data compared with the mlp rbf nn and anfis models najah ahmed et al 2019 therefore to optimize the performance of ml more advanced analytical and data processing techniques are worthy of being considered according to table s4 the tested algorithms e g mlp rbf nn svm and dt performed well in predicting various wqis in the reviewed studies and this might have been due to the close chemical and physical relationship between the selected water quality variables and the predicted parameters although the performance of various algorithms seems acceptable noise in the data is always an unavoidable problem and this could be solved by wdt to improve the performance of ml algorithms moreover image recognition technology and the dl model once again has appeared in recent studies and this might indicate the developmental direction of predicting water quality using ml 3 2 mapping groundwater contaminants groundwater contamination is a public concern because of its potential health threats to billions of people globally who rely on groundwater for drinking however the worldwide scale of polluted regions is still unknown due to a lack of sufficient field data that reflects the spatial distribution and concentration of contaminants to solve this problem various research methods have been developed in the past geostatistical statistical interpolation methods such as kriging inverse distance weighting global polynomial interpolation sequential gaussian simulations and the thiessen polygon have been applied to simulate the spatial distribution of contaminants in groundwater bindal and singh 2019 however these methods depend too much on accurate field data which is sometimes unattainable or sparse moreover they do not take consider the spatial dependency of data thus making the performance of these methods unsatisfactory shaji et al 2020 in recent years ml has also been widely applied to predict the distribution of contaminants such as arsenic as fluoride manganese and e coli in groundwater based on analyzing the hidden relationships between contaminants and their direct or indirect influencing factors because of the serious health threat of as to humans and its wide distribution throughout earth s crust and the hydrosphere the prediction of the arsenic spatial distribution in groundwater by ml has been highlighted shaji et al 2020 geologic and geochemical settings are primary factors that affects the occurrence of as in the lithosphere geologic factors such as specific rocks i e mafic and granitic rocks ayotte et al 2006 basalt andesite and rhyolite bretzler et al 2017 and soils i e medium textured soils winkel et al 2011 yang et al 2014 organic rich deposits winkel et al 2008 2011 and holocene fluvial sediments podgorski et al 2017 rodríguez lado et al 2013 yang et al 2014 were reported to be the primary causes of arsenic accumulation moreover geochemical conditions such as the level of soil ph lee et al 2009 podgorski et al 2017 twarakavi and kaluarachchi 2006 yang et al 2012 do yang et al 2012 and other chemical substances including fluoride bromide chloride iron manganese ammonia nitrate nitrite phosphate and sulfate lee et al 2009 yang et al 2012 were also reported to be crucial factors that affect the occurrence of as in groundwater by introducing these relevant environmental factors as variables ml has gained satisfactory performance in predicting the spatial distribution of arsenic in groundwater around the world these nations include the united states anning et al 2012 ayotte et al 2017 2016 2006 frederick et al 2016 kim et al 2011 meliker et al 2008 twarakavi and kaluarachchi 2006 yang et al 2014 2012 china lee et al 2009 rodríguez lado et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 2013 canada dummer et al 2015 india bindal and singh 2019 purkait 2008 pakistan podgorski et al 2017 burkina faso bretzler et al 2017 bangladesh tan et al 2020 cambodia lado et al 2008 and regions such as southeast asia bangladesh myanmar thailand laos cambodia vietnam sumatra red river and mekong deltas cha et al 2016 cho et al 2011 chowdhury et al 2010 hossain and piantanakulchai 2013 lado et al 2008 tan et al 2020 winkel et al 2008 2011 and the global fig 4 a podgorski and berg 2020 in these studies logistic regression lr was the most frequently used algorithm with an accuracy rate of approximately 70 being achieved in corresponding studies however lr has shortcomings in dealing with outliers large feature space and the multicollinearity of variables thus causing problems of under fitting or low accuracy mood and carina 2010 in contrast the cart is immune to the multicollinearity as the decision at each node of the tree is made based on a single feature myles et al 2004 in addition the cart can also solve the problem of outliers and missing data by accommodating surrogates therefore the cart is capable of making more accurate predictions breiman et al 1984 for example the cart model achieved an accuracy of 78 25 in predicting the distribution of groundwater arsenic contamination in bangladesh hossain and piantanakulchai 2013 moreover the cart has also been used to investigate the factors governing elevated groundwater arsenic concentrations across the western and the eastern united states and the significance of aridity and ph was revealed frederick et al 2016 to improve the prediction ability of the cart a weak learner ensemble model called the boosted regression tree brt was recently developed by combining the cart with an adaptive boosting method elith et al 2008 the brt model captured the corresponding major geochemical processes with an accuracy of up to 91 in predicting the probabilities of groundwater arsenic in the central valley of california ayotte et al 2016 in addition the brt also obtained an outstanding performance with an accuracy value of approximately 90 5 in comparison with the lr model and the rf model to predict the groundwater arsenic distribution in bangladesh likewise the rf model delivered an excellent result with a prediction accuracy of 90 in this comparison tan et al 2020 moreover the rf model was also applied to predict the global groundwater arsenic concentrations in this study 52 types of parameters widely covering climate soil geology and topography that were known or hypothesized to be related to the accumulation and release of arsenic were initially selected to be the predictor variables by using a relative importance analysis soil parameters i e topsoil clay subsoil sand ph and fluvisols climate variables i e precipitation actual and potential evapotranspiration and combinations thereof with temperature and the topographic wetness index were ultimately determined as influential variables for the distribution of arsenic podgorski and berg 2020 in addition to arsenic the rf model was also applied to predict the distribution of fluoride in groundwater throughout india fig 4b podgorski et al 2018 the proposed rf model obtained a more accurate prediction with an overall prediction accuracy of 91 podgorski et al 2018 compared to a previous study mapping the distribution of worldwide groundwater fluoride using the anfis method amini et al 2008 in addition to arsenic and fluoride the distribution of manganese in the northern continental united states was also predicted using a brt model with a total accuracy of 83 fig 4c environmental variables such as estimated recharge probability of high fe 100 μg l baseflow index and the mean annual precipitation were demonstrated to have a high relative importance on influencing the probability of high manganese erickson et al 2021 recently a generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss regression model was applied to predict the e coli concentration in wells across ontario canada a dataset containing e coli concentration well characteristics well depth location and hydrogeological characteristics bottom of well stratigraphy and specific capacity from 253 136 independent wells was established to train the gamlss model the regression analysis revealed that bedrock wells drilled in sedimentary and igneous rock were more susceptible to contamination events which was helpful to improve the understanding of aquifer vulnerability to contamination and for assessing water quality white et al 2021 in studies that mapped the groundwater contaminant distribution it was not necessary for the ml model to accurately predict the contaminant concentration at a certain point but to judge whether the contaminant concentration at that point exceeded the threshold e g 10 mg l for as according to the environmental variables therefore the essence of this type of research is classification which explains why the commonly used algorithms are lr and those based on dt the lr algorithm is robust to small noises in the data and will not be specially affected by slight multicollinearity while serious multicollinearity can be solved by combining with l2 regularization therefore lr performed well in dealing with environmental variables influencing the distribution of as even though there are typically interactions among geologic and geochemical variables however lr covers all the features and will suffer performance decline when the feature space becomes larger in contrast the dt model is not limited by the size of the feature space because it can select the optimal feature according to the information gain however the dt model is designed to create branches for the training set thus making it prone to over fitting rf overcomes this shortcoming by randomness in taking samples determining features and building trees therefore dt based models especially rf theoretically perform better than other classification algorithms this is why dt based models have been more popular in recent studies table s5 3 3 classifying water resources to better manage and protect water resources different countries and regions have adopted various standards to classify water resources according to their water quality for example in the national environmental quality standards of surface water gb3838 2002 china water resources are divided into five categories by 24 fundamental wqis each category of water resource has corresponding applications according to its water quality however measuring all wqis listed in the standard is costly therefore it is meaningful to classify water quality with fewer parameters that are more indicative ml is good at evaluating the variable importance to the prediction target and has been applied to identify the key wqis to classify water resources initially anfis was applied to classify the water samples of all major river basins across china using the gb3838 2002 for the classification standards do cod and nh3 n were determined to be the influential variables and 89 59 of the data was correctly classified yan et al 2010 in addition to the gb3838 2002 other standards such as the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme wqi canada and the national sanitation foundation nsf wqi u s were also applied to classify water resources for example the svm the probabilistic neural network pnn and the knn model were applied using the ccme wqi for the classification standards to classify the water samples of the primary aquifer in the tehran plain the results revealed that the knn algorithm was the weakest classifier with the highest total number and the total value of errors in contrast pnn and svm were more appropriate for a small sets of samples and svm presented the best performance with no errors in the calibration and validation phases modaresi and araghinejad 2014 however in another study classifying the water of the tiaoxi river in the lake taihu watershed the classification accuracy of svm fell from 99 56 to 61 60 when the number of indicators was raised from one to five indicating that it was insufficient for svm to treat data with large features li et al 2013 in addition when classifying water samples from the karoon river in iran using nsf wqi as standards the training process of svm was reported to be more difficult and time consuming therefore the pnn model was ultimately recommended for water quality classification due to its synthetic ability to reduce the sampling costs and computation time dezfooli et al 2017 to further identify a better model and the key wqis a more comprehensive comparison was conducted among 10 ml algorithms using big data 33 612 observations from the major rivers and lakes in china using gb3838 2002 as the standard different algorithms were compared using different wqi groups as prediction indicators ultimately two wqi sets do codmn and nh3 n and codmn and nh3 n were identified as the key water parameters the performances of the dt rf and deep cascade forest dcf were shown to be better than other tested algorithms including lr lda svm cart nb and knn fig 5 a chen et al 2020a in addition to water quality spatial or temporal factors can also be regarded as standards in water classification for example water samples from the gomti river were classified in terms of sampling sites spatial and months temporal thereby identifying similar ones in the monitoring network to reduce sampling numbers and the annual sampling frequency in this way a data reduction of 92 5 without compromising the output quality was achieved singh et al 2011 the nonlinear boundary problem caused by a variety of water quality parameters is one of the most distinct features of water resource classification svm relies on a single sample of the boundary to establish the desired separation curve so it can deal with nonlinear decision boundaries therefore compared with the application in mapping groundwater contaminants svm was more commonly used in classifying water resources tables s5 and s6 however training support vector machine on large data is very time consuming and sometimes it is difficult to find a suitable kernel function moreover dt based models exhibited better performance than svm especially in dealing with tasks with large dataset chen et al 2020a as a result dt based models are more suitable in classifying water resources 3 4 tracing contaminant sources the accurate detection of contaminant sources in water environments is a critical step for contamination prevention and remediation many approaches such as the response matrix contaminant transport simulation and tikhonov regularization have been proposed to identify pollution sources singh et al 2004 and ml has also joined in this attempt for instance an mlp was applied to simulate the time series of e coli concentrations in a water system to locate discharge points by inversely interpreting the transport patterns of e coli the source locations where e coli was introduced into the given system were identified with an accuracy of 75 kim et al 2008 moreover in a recent study using the rf model to identify water sample sources from three different river ecosystems the responses of the aquatic microbial community to variations in water quality caused by pollution discharge were considered environmental physicochemical indices microbiological indices and their combination were applied as inputs to train the classifier microbiological indices based models obtained the best predictions by using the abundances of the top 30 bacteria as predictor variables with the increasing development of gene sequencing technology the method proposed in this study provided an economical and rapid approach to trace water sample sources based on the abundance of microbial communities wang et al 2021a recently ml classification programs specifically designed for contamination tracing such as sourcetracker have gained many applications sourcetracker can estimate the relative contribution of a specific potential source to an environmental sink based on the bayesian approach knights et al 2011 to track the sources of fecal bacteria in the lake superior estuary community based microbial source tracking using sourcetracker was conducted the high throughput dna sequencing of a fecal sample collection was used to establish a fecal library that was utilized to understand the fecal microbiome composition as well as the marker specificity and sensitivity in several animals it was found that fecal bacteria in the lake superior estuary were primarily attributed to wastewater effluent and to a lesser extent geese and gull wastes fig 5b brown et al 2017 sourcetracker was also combined with the shotgun metagenomic technique to analyze the sources of antibiotic resistance genes args in an urban stream during wet weather the relative contributions of both microbes and args in the sink environment were estimated using the abundances of microbial taxa and args provided by shotgun metagenomics the results revealed that storm drain outfall waters were the largest contributor of both microbes and args in the urban stream while wash off from streets was the largest contributor of microbes and args in the storm drain outfall water fig 5c baral et al 2018 moreover sourcetracker was applied to analyze the sources of sediment pollution in lake dongting a metagenomic analysis characterized the difference among community compositions of source sediment samples then the specific sources of sediment were identified by sourcetracker based on the inseparable relationships between sediment and adsorbed microorganisms fig 5d zhang et al 2019a additionally the significant relationships between sediment and microbial community were also used to investigate phosphorus sources in lake dongting by analyzing phosphorus source contributions in interconnected river lake systems using sourcetracker a novel framework for nutrient source tracking was established to develop effective management and control strategies for both sediment and eutrophication in river lake systems gu et al 2020 ichnaea is another ml based software utilized to improve tracking the fecal pollution sources in water different from sourcetracker that depends on comparing obtained gene information with a known gene library ichnaea relies on library independent markers and the abundance of fecal indicators or host specific markers for example in tracking the sources of fecal pollution in a given water different fecal indicators and source tracking markers were applied to provide host information ichnaea correctly distinguished the fecal pollution of human or non human from other several origins fig 5e balleste et al 2020 compared with the research directions introduced above there have been fewer studies that have investigated the use of ml in tracing the source of contaminants despite this most of the reviewed studies in this paper adopted ml based contaminant tracing tools e g sourcetracker and ichnaea table s7 and this not only reduced the burden of developing specialized ml models for researchers but also provides an opportunity for researchers who are not proficient in programming and ml to use efficient contaminant tracing tools this provides a reference for lowering the threshold of applying ml for environmental researchers 3 5 evaluating pollutant toxicity toxic pollutants discharged into the natural water environment will inevitably cause harm to aquatic ecosystems and ultimately poison humans through the food chain therefore it is crucial to assess the toxicity of pollutants on aquatic organisms and humans animal testing is one of the primary approaches to evaluate the toxicity of chemical substances however the consumption of animal testing in time money and labor limits its applications in addition the rise of animal protectionism recently exacerbates the difficulty of implementing of animal testing takata et al 2020 to reduce the costs and uncertainties of conventional toxicity evaluation methods high throughput computer technologies have become increasingly popular due to because of their high efficiency and convenience in data driven toxicity assessments the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar builds a quantitative relationship between the structural or physicochemical characteristics of chemicals and their properties or activities including toxicity wu and wang 2018 however it is increasingly difficult for the prior knowledge based qsar method to process tasks with increasing amounts of data thus making it feasible to introduce ml to assist and improve the qsar in predicting the toxicity of pollutants ml qsar approaches collected large amounts of data from the related literature to reveal some universal rules or mechanisms of correlative chemical reactions or processes thus guiding the modeling of similar reactions therefore ml qsar has been widely applied for evaluating pollutant toxicity pesticides are organics that possess high toxicity against various organisms in a recent study five ml models i e dt nb knn rf and svm were severally combined with the qsar to predict the concentration for 50 of the maximal effect ec50 of 639 diverse pesticides against daphnia magna a total of 365 molecular descriptors and seven molecular fingerprints mf were applied to describe the characteristics of the tested pesticides mf referred to a method to encode the molecules into a mathematical format that is readable for computational programming according to their molecular structure the best performance was obtained using the svm model with a prediction accuracy of 0 848 in the test set verification he et al 2019 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are another type of organic that can cause adverse effects on the normal function of homeostasis reproduction and metabolism by disordering the endocrine system of animals and humans lister and van der kraak 2001 a dl based qsar model was developed to classify and predict the toxicological effects of edcs on sex hormone binding globulin shbg and estrogen receptors er datasets assessing diverse qualitative responses of the shbg and er to the tested edcs were collected from the relevant literature the proposed dl qsar model exhibited more satisfactory performance than mlr and svm in simulating the toxicity of edcs with r2 values of 0 86 for shbg and 0 84 for er heo et al 2019 moreover chemicals can produce endocrine disrupting effects by binding to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ pparγ to identify the binding affinity of chemicals with pparγ recently qsar was also utilized to provide molecular descriptors for the construction of ml models wang et al 2021d in addition a dnn based dl model was developed for the toxicity classification of 1317 chemicals to screen for environmental estrogens by introducing a novel three dimensional molecular surface point cloud with electrostatic potential to describe chemical structures this model recognized the active and inactive chemicals at accuracies of 82 8 and 88 9 respectively wang et al 2021c in addition to organics nanoparticles nps are also of concern in environmental toxicology nps are emerging detrimental pollutants that can cause harmful effects such as oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation on aquatic organisms by generating reactive oxygen species due to their specific surface area or photocatalytic activity to predict the toxicity of nps a perturbation theory machine learning ptml based qsar was applied to estimate the genotoxicity of metal oxide nps the genotoxicity information of 78 metal oxide nps against 32 different biological targets was collected as a dataset in addition chemical periodic table based descriptors quantum chemical properties and constitutional descriptors were adopted to describe the tested nps the results revealed that 97 81 of the cases in the test set were correctly classified and the toxicity of nearly all the 78 nps was correctly predicted in the external validation moreover because the proposed ptml qsar model was built based on the relevant physicochemical descriptors it could also provide reliable insights in terms of the genotoxicity mechanisms of nps fig 5f halder et al 2020 in addition to combining with qsar ml is sufficient to predict the toxicity of pollutants independently for example the 50 lethal concentrations lc50 of 400 compounds were predicted using the rf svm and xgboost algorithms based on 12 types of mf the optimal prediction results were achieved using the svm model with an accuracy of 92 2 which was better than those generated by the qsar or ann methods ai et al 2019 additionally the performance of knn svm ann rf adaboost and gbm for predicting 50 hazardous concentrations hc50 of 578 chemical substances were compared the rf model was found to outperform the other models including the qsar and ecosar methods as it could explain 63 of the variability of hc50 hou et al 2020 in the reviewed studies above various environmental variables were required to form the feature space to train the ml model because the predicted objectives e g water quality and classification contaminant distribution and sources were closely related to the surrounding environmental factors however toxicity is an attribute of the pollutant itself to the organisms consequently when training a model to predict the toxicity of chemicals the characteristics of the tested chemical itself are required to form the feature space there were several methods adopted in the reviewed studies to describe the molecular characteristics including molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints and these are also basic research tools for the qsar methods therefore ml models combined with qsar were often used for predicting the toxicity of pollutants and they obtained good prediction results table s8 however with the deepening of studies on the prediction of pollutant toxicity more cutting edge descriptors or patterns such as higher dimensional descriptors and transformer architecture are encouraged to be utilized for pollutant toxicity prediction 4 technology optimization and operation monitoring in engineered water systems engineered water systems refer to a series of processes that consist of taking water from natural waters drinking water purification and distribution sewage or wastewater collection and treatment and water reuse or draining back to nature in modern cities and towns lu et al 2016 effective management of engineered water systems will be of great help in providing clean water to users and preventing ecological pollution to achieve this ml has been applied widely in each link of engineered water systems and related studies and applications of ml are reviewed in this section in addition ml has also been combined with adsorption and oxidation techniques and the characterization analysis of pollutants which are also necessary steps in engineered water systems therefore the applications of ml in modeling adsorption and oxidation and assisting characterization analysis are also reviewed below 4 1 modeling treatment technique lab scale development and optimization are fundamental for actual applications of treatment technologies for drinking water or wastewater in dwtps and wwtps especially for the removal of emerging pollutants requiring specific treatment techniques adsorption and oxidation are common processes in both laboratory experiments and treatment plants to remove pollutants with low biodegradability or biological toxicity accurate simulation of treatment processes is beneficial for optimizing the reactant dosage selecting an appropriate approach or scaling up reactors for practical use some representative applications of ml for modeling the adsorption and oxidation processes to improve the pollutant removal efficiency are summarized below adsorption is a popular process in wastewater treatment especially for removing pollutants that are immune or even noxious to conventional biological treatment processes such as heavy metals and some types of organic matter dabrowski 2001 for example in predicting the removal efficiency of pb ii adsorbed by red mud the adsorbent dosage contact time and ph were used as variables to train an mlp model the results were then compared with the response surface methodology rsm the rsm is a common method used to assess the effects of independent variables on the reaction process yetilmezsoy et al 2009 the results showed that the mlp exhibited a better performance for predicting the lead removal efficiency than rsm did with r2 values of 0 898 for the mlp and 0 672 for the rsm geyikçi et al 2012 moreover the performance of ml could be further improved by combining it with optimization algorithms the genetic algorithm ga is a global and parallel optimization algorithm that can automatically acquire and accumulate the knowledge of a search space during the process of searching thus controlling the searching process adaptively to obtain the best solution álvarez et al 2016 in the adsorption of cu ii by reduced graphene oxide supported nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi rgo magnetic nanocomposites mlp ga performed well with an mae value of 1 13 while the values were 3 64 and 7 44 for the mlp and rsm methods respectively moreover the combination of mlp and particle swarm optimization pso obtained a better prediction with a minimum mae value of 0 46 pso is another optimization algorithm through which global optimization is realized by group iteration based on the interaction among and update of particles each represents a possible solution to a problem kennedy and eberhart 1995 by using the mlp pso to identify and adjust the critical parameters controlling adsorption processes the cu ii removal efficiency was improved by 3 15 and 8 54 compared to that of the mlp ga model and the rsm model fan et al 2017 aside from heavy metals ml was also applied in modeling the adsorption of some types of organic matter for instance triclosan tcs is a broad spectrum chlorinated antibacterial ingredient that possesses high health risks and ecological toxicities the absorption process of tcs by a novel host guest complex mwcnt peg b cd was simulated using the grnn anfis and rsm models in which anfis showed a better prediction ability than the other two models moreover ga was introduced to optimize the experimental design and the maximum tcs removal efficiency was improved to 99 50 azqhandi et al 2019 synthetic dye is another type of organic compound that can cause environmental pollution salleh et al 2011 ghaedi et al summarized in early 2017 the applications of ann models for simulating synthetic dye adsorption their review concluded that four types of ml models including mlp anfis svm and the hybrid with ga or pso optimization were primarily used in previous studies ghaedi and vafaei 2017 the better performance of the hybrid networks with optimization algorithms was confirmed in this review as well as in a study published afterward jun et al 2020 in addition to batch experiments in a single study the datasets generated from the published literature have also been used to develop ml algorithms for instance to train a deep learning neural network dlnn a dataset containing 200 000 sample scenarios was generated from over ten years of studies that used a carbon based adsorbent i e carbon nanotube cnt activated carbon biochar graphene carbonaceous or graphite to absorb anionic cationic and zwitterionic ionizable organic compounds the proposed dlnn model exhibited a strong generalization and forecasting ability for the adsorption of ionizable organic compounds by a wide range of carbonaceous materials with r2 values exceeding 0 98 and 0 91 for predicting the freundlich coefficient kf and the exponent n respectively sigmund et al 2020 another study mined literature for the adsorption data of 165 organic chemicals on 50 biochars 34 cnts 35 granular activated carbons gac and 30 polymeric resins to train a neural network with the poly parameter linear free energy relationships pp lfer the results showed that the proposed nn lfer model accurately simulated the tested adsorption processes with r2 values ranging from 0 86 to 0 91 fig 6 a zhang et al 2020 more notably a graphical user interface was provided in these two studies for those who are not skilled in computer operation this provides great convenience for researchers and practitioners in the fields of water purification and pollution control to select the appropriate sorbent for a given contaminant based on their requirements apart from adsorption processes advanced oxidation processes aops are also effective technologies to treat pollutants with high chemical stabilities and low biodegradabilities the development of aops can be traced back to the late 19th century when h j h fenton discovered that hydrogen peroxide could generate hydroxyl radicals oh catalyzed by ferrous ions to oxidize organic contaminants that then became known as the fenton reaction nguyen et al 2020 since then an increasing number of aop processes have been developed based on various approaches including ozone based ultraviolet uv based photocatalytic electrochemical and physical methods bolton et al 1996 miklos et al 2018 currently ml is also applied to simulate the oxidation processes for removing organic pollutants khataee et al reviewed early applications of ann in modeling homogeneous and heterogeneous nanocatalytic aops that included photocatalytic photooxidative and electrochemical treatment processes the authors confirmed that ann was an effective and simple approach to describe aop processes without considering the complex effects such as the radiant energy balance mass transfer and the spatial distribution of the absorbed radiation khataee and kasiri 2010 here the studies published after or covering content outside the scope of khataee and kasiri s review were summarized to present the applications of more ml models in a wider range of aops for the degrading of antibiotics including amoxicillin ampicillin and cloxacillin with fenton reaction an mlp model was used to simulate the reaction processes in terms of cod removal an accurate prediction of cod removal efficiency was achieved with an r2 of 0 997 additionally the sensitivity analysis showed that the h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was the most influential parameter on antibiotic degradation this result pointed the direction for further improving the removal efficiency elmolla et al 2010 based on the fenton reaction photo fenton processes are developed due to the exposure of the reaction system to solar or uv light both of which can speed up the generation of hydroxyl radicals in fenton reactions kavitha and palanivelu 2004 during the degradation of oil contaminated wastewater by the homogeneous photo fenton uv h2o2 fe2 process the mlp model accurately predicted the oil removal efficiency in addition ph was discovered to be the most influential parameter that affects oil degradation compared with h2o2 fe2 oil concentration or the irradiation time and temperature mustafa et al 2014 in addition to facilitating the fenton process to generate hydroxyl radicals in the photo fenton processes in photocatalytic processes light can also provide photons to excite the lone electron on a semiconductor e g tio2 and zno to create an electron hole pair e h then a series of chain oxidative reductive reactions will occur to degrade the contaminants on the semiconductor surface with electron hole pairs chong et al 2010 during the photocatalytic degradation of m cresol by synthesized mn doped zno nanoparticles under visible light irradiation three types of mlp with different architectures were developed to simulate the reaction processes a comparison between the predicted output and the experimental results showed that ann trained with quick propagation and accurately simulated the degradation with an r2 of 0 9938 moreover the predicted optimal parameter values were used to optimize the reaction condition under which the actual removal efficiency of m cresol was improved to 99 abdollahi et al 2014 in addition to fenton and photocatalytic processes ozonation is another popular aop technology during the degradation of micropollutants mps by the ozonation process the rf model was applied to predict the oxidant exposures and mp abatement during ozonation parameters including ph alkalinity doc and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem data were adopted as input variables ultimately the proposed rf model obtained an accurate prediction with r2 values of 0 798 and 0 772 for o3 and oh exposure respectively and 0 904 for mp abatement fig 6b cha et al 2020 ozonation could also be combined with other processes to enhance the ability of treating pollutants for instance a synthesized dy2o3 tio2 graphite nanocomposite was used to assist the photocatalytic ozonation process for the degradation of textile dyeing in wastewater while o3 h2o2 zr pumice was applied in the decolorization of rhodamine b dye for both studies the mlp models were applied to predict the removal efficiency and achieved excellent accuracy with r2 values of 0 99 and 0 9948 sheydaei et al 2020 shokoohi et al 2020 data mining in aop related studies has also been conducted for instance 446 data points concerning the photo degradation rate constants log k of organic contaminants in a tio2 uv photocatalyst system were collected then an mlp model was trained using a variety of reaction parameters including ultraviolet intensity tio2 dosage initial concentration and the mf information of 78 tested organic contaminants the proposed mlp model showed its reliability and stability as the predicted photo degradation rate constants were in good agreement with experimental data with an average r2 value of 0 873 jiang et al 2020 in another study an mlp was compared with the quantitative structure property relationship qspr method to model hydroxyl radical rate constants k ho using a diverse dataset of 457 water contaminants from 27 various chemical classes with a total of 785 molecular descriptors as variables qspr achieved a simulation of k ho with r2 of 0 724 while the mlp performed better with r2 of 0 847 borhani et al 2016 moreover based on this dataset a dnn combined with mf was developed to predict the k ho of other 46 organic pollutants and obtained a prediction accuracy of 0 724 zhong et al 2020 the accurate prediction of reaction rate constants such as degradation rate constants and hydroxyl radical rate constants will undoubtedly help researchers select appropriate reaction types and reactants as well as to design more efficient aop based water treatment units the summary of tables s9 and s10 indicates that mlp is the most frequently used algorithm for the simulation of adsorption and oxidation reactions especially in earlier studies with small datasets mlp is one of the most basic algorithms of an ann and it can approximate any nonlinear function relation with high precision in addition mlp has strong robustness and fault tolerance to noise datasets additionally after 30 years of development there are many mlp based programs and software that can be used directly by researchers who are not familiar with programming therefore mlp has been widely used in dealing with tasks with smaller dataset and fewer features for example data generated by batch experiments of a single study are reviewed herein in these studies optimization algorithms e g ga and pso played important roles in improving the performance of mlp which could be an experience worth learning however when dealing with tasks with large dataset and many features for example data generated by collecting from similar studies an ann with more hidden layers that is a dnn has a stronger ability to model objects or abstract features and can also simulate more complex models therefore dnns are increasingly popular in studies simulating various reaction processes especially when the computing power of computers is becoming increasingly stronger 4 2 assisting characterization analysis in addition to modeling and optimizing of physical and chemical treatment processes ml has also been applied in assisting characterization analyses by processing data or images produced by various analytical instruments ml approaches can deepen and broaden the analysis information or reduce the workload and improve the efficiency of testers for example to improve the predictability of drinking water disinfection by products dbps parallel factors analysis pca and autoencoders ae were applied to process high dimensional fluorescence data of dbps then a neural network approach was used to identify fluorescence regions associated with dbp formation thus estimating the concentrations of dbps the ae nn was found to provide more accurate predictions for both trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by when compared to common organic measuring methods the approach proposed in this work provided a promising approach to rapidly quantify dbps or other organics by analyzing fluorescence eem data peleato et al 2018 in addition to the direct determination of dbps determining the relationships between the molecular properties of dissolved organic matter dom and their reactivity as potential precursors of dbps is also instructive for dbp control and management for instance fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was used to provide chemical information about dom molecules then the rf model was introduced to identify the molecular reactivity classes based on the chemical properties and peak intensities of the ft icr ms finally a classification approach based on molecular formulas rather than a prior definition of biogeochemical reactivity was applied to discriminate biogeochemical reaction types with this approach potential precursor dom of dbps could be distinguished and specifically removed in drinking water treatment processes fig 6c herzsprung et al 2020 apart from acting as dbp precursors some organic micropollutants mps including various anthropogenic pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals are also a negligible threat to the water quality high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has been commonly used to measure the concentration of mps however the high cost of the stable isotope labeled sil standard used in hrms restricts its economic efficiency in measuring mps to reduce the cost of hrms analysis dl and ml models were proposed to estimate the concentrations of five mps without sil standards including sulpiride metformin benzotriazole tebuconazole and niflumic acid first 35 alternative ms subsets were selected from hundreds of ms results to examine their correlation with the sil standard peak for determining the specific ms subset to replace sil standards then four convolutional neural network cnn models as well as the rf svm and ann models were applied to estimate concentrations of tested mps by analyzing their mass spectrum using the selected ms subset the results revealed that the cnn model resnet 101 achieved the best performance in estimating the concentrations of the five mps with an average r2 value of 0 84 baek et al 2021 the cnn algorithm has also been applied in image recognition to classify and count diatoms on fouled surfaces during short term field exposures the acquired images were saved as two channel red green blue rgb images with the phase contrast images encoded in the blue channel and the fluorescence images encoded in the green one the proposed dl model could analyze the tested images and distinguish diatoms from sand dirt and bacteria on fouled surfaces in only 30 min while it took 180 h of manual counting fig 6d krause et al 2020 microplastics are a type of emerging harmful pollutants derived from the fragmentating of plastics ml approaches have also been applied to identify quantify and classify microplastics for example near infrared hyperspectral imaging nir hsi was used to characterize the intestinal tract content of crucian carps carassius carassius that were exposed to water that contained various tested microplastics an svm classifier was developed to detect and classify the microplastics according to their nir hsi the validation with raman spectroscopy indicated that the svm model performed well in classifying five different microplastics with high precision 97 19 and recall 91 98 values fig 6e zhang et al 2019c moreover the performance of the svm knn and lda algorithms for identifying consumer plastics cp and marine plastic debris mpd was compared four spectroscopic techniques including attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir nir reflectance spectroscopy laser induced breakdown spectroscopy libs and x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf were applied to characterize the tested plastics the comparison results revealed that atr ftir combined with knn classifiers obtained the optimal classification accuracies of 95 and 99 for cp and mpd respectively fig 6f michel et al 2020 to assist the characterization analysis ml is primarily used to deal with data or images generated by various analysis equipment for image processing cnns are undoubtedly a popular and powerful option for data processing it is also divided into a regression prediction e g dbp and mp concentration estimation and a classification prediction e g dbp precursor and microplastic classification based on the above analysis of the regression and classification algorithms it is not difficult to select an appropriate regression or classification algorithm according to the volume of both dataset and features for assisting the characterization analysis with ml the real difficulty is to find the combination point of ml technology and traditional analytical methods 4 3 purifying and distributing drinking water in drinking water treatment plants dwtps conventional treatment processes including coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are designed to supply adequate and safe drinking water to users lapara et al 2015 however demand for high quality drinking water and the gradual deterioration of raw water has brought requirements for more efficient treatment and management in dwtps comprehensive and timely monitoring of water quality is essential for improving the management and automation development of dwtps to this end ml has been applied to simulate water quality in a series of treatment units to provide real time information on the operational conditions of dwtps antanasijevic et al 2013a some of the relevant studies are reviewed below pre oxidation is an optional process according to the quality of the raw water this be conducted prior to the coagulation procedure to oxidize iron manganese or taste and odor substances and control microorganisms or dbp precursors in raw water hu et al 2018 following pre oxidation coagulants are added to coagulate the insoluble contaminants by charging neutralization enmeshment or sweep to form particles and flocs that can be removed during subsequent sedimentation and filtration processes hogg 2000 therefore an appropriate dosage of oxidants and coagulants is critical for the entire drinking water treatment process however the dosage of oxidants or coagulants is determined by complicated factors such as nom turbidity conductivity and temperature heddam et al 2012 therefore there is not a simple empirical approach nor an accepted mathematical model to determine the optimal dosage for both oxidants and coagulants hu et al 2018 currently ml approaches have been applied for interpreting relationships between the raw water characteristics and the demands of oxidants or coagulants for pre oxidizing oxidants an mlp model was developed to predict the kmno4 demand in addition to an accurate simulation of the kmno4 dosing rate the proposed model also found that turbidity had the highest impact on kmno4 demand while the inflow rate had the least fig 7 a godo pla et al 2019 for coagulants the mlp and anfis models were compared for simulating the poly aluminum chloride pac dosage the anfis model well predicted the pac dosage with the pac dosage of yesterday being the only input however in an emergency such as high turbidity caused by a rainstorm the mlp output more stable predictions fig 7b wu and lo 2008 after coagulation the sedimentation process will remove the formed particles and flocs with high density while the filtration process removes the remaining suspended ones an mlp model successfully predicted the post filtration particle counts for three different size ranges in a dual media filter of a dwtp griffiths and andrews 2011 another mlp model was combined with ga optimization to predict the transmembrane pressure of a ceramic membrane microfiltration system the proposed model optimized the settings for filtration time flux and aluminum dosage thus leading to the minimized operational cost with a reduction of approximately 15 strugholtz et al 2008 membrane filtration has gained increasing popularity in water treatment processes due to its strong purification ability however a major problem facing the membrane filtration process is membrane fouling that would reduce the purification ability and shorten the working life of the membrane to monitor and predict membrane fouling an mlp model was used to simulate the membrane resistance during the nanofiltration process the developed model correctly predicted the 93 of the experimental data with an absolute relative error 5 which sufficed to reduce or even replace expensive site specific tests shetty and chellam 2003 in addition an image analysis was also used to investigate membrane fouling a dnn model was trained using thousands of high resolution fouling layer images that were generated using optical coherence tomography characterizing membrane fouling during nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro filtration the proposed dnn accurately reproduced two or three dimensional images of the organic fouling growth with the r2 values of 0 99 in the simulation for both fouling growth and flux decline fig 7c park et al 2019 moreover determining the relationships between the physicochemical properties of nom and their effects on membrane fouling is also helpful to prevent fouling events recently a pca model was used to analyze the relationships between organic matter and their fouling propensity then a clustering analysis was applied to classify the water resources into three groups according to their low intermediate or high fouling potential the results revealed a correlation between strong fouling events and a combined increase of carbon and protein like substances contents in water this conclusion was helpful for membrane users to make a better selection of feed water resources to prevent membrane fouling events teychene et al 2018 following the pre oxidation coagulation sedimentation and filtration processes disinfection is performed to further inactivate microorganisms chlorine is the most common disinfectant because of its high efficiency and low cost and its persistence that meets the residual disinfectant demand however chlorine will interact with nom to generate dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and total organic halide tox and these can act as human mutagens carcinogens and teratogens hamidin et al 2008 an mlp model was developed to simulate the concentrations of these three types of dbps in raw and treated water and accurate predictions were obtained with r2 values ranging from 0 71 to 0 97 fig 7d kulkarni and chellam 2010 in addition to the water quality or operational conditions in various treatment units inside a dwtp a recent study forecasted the overall performance of dwtps across china the authors collected the monthly data of water quality and operational parameters from 45 dwtps nationwide as the dataset by using these data they proposed an mlp model that well predicted the water production variation this work enabled decision makers and dwtp managers to revise production plans in response to different raw water quality water quality standards and market demands zhang et al 2019b after the treatment in dwtps drinking water of qualified quality and quantity will be delivered to consumers via drinking water distribution systems dwdss therefore water quality in dwdss is also important for the entire drinking water supply system discoloration is one of the most disturbing problems facing drinking water producers and users elevated concentrations of fe and mn have been recognized as the major causes of drinking water discoloration speight et al 2019 therefore predicting the accumulation potential of fe and mn is important for preventing discoloration an mlp model was developed to investigate the influence of chemical properties of water on the accumulation behaviors of fe and mn the results showed that free chlorine residual fcr played complex roles in affecting the accumulation of fe and mn concretely a high concentration of fcr would oxidize soluble fe2 and mn2 to insoluble fe3 and mn4 thus aggravating discoloration on the contrary as a disinfectant fcr could sterilize the oxidizing bacteria to prevent biological oxidation of fe and mn thus easing discoloration therefore to achieve the equilibrium of chemical and biological oxidation the fcr concentration was recommended to be 0 8 to 1 8 mg l in the tested dwtss danso amoakoa and prasad 2014 moreover an appropriate amount of fcr can also restrain the growth of other harmful microbial pathogens while high dosing will lead to undesired taste corrosion of the pipe network and an increase in treatment costs therefore it is beneficial to accurately predict fcr in dwdss to achieve a balance among bacteriostasis pleasant water quality and economic cost may et al 2008 in study that applied the grnn model to forecast fcr in a dwds the flow temperature and chlorine residual data were collected as variables then a ga method was used to optimize the division of the dataset into training testing and validation sets the results showed that the grnn model accurately predicted the fcr up to 72 h in advance with an r2 value of 0 9617 fig 7e bowden et al 2006 in addition to the fcr the concentration of dbps in dwdss is another hotspot of concern related to the disinfection process for instance an rbf nn predicted the concentration of nine different haas with an accuracy ranging from 75 to 91 fig 7f lin et al 2020 moreover a bayesian network found that monochloramine had a negative effect while doc and tds exerted positive effects on the formation of thms li et al 2020a in addition to investigating factors that influence the water quality in dwdss ml has also been used to forecast the pipeline failures in the distribution networks for instance contamination events in dwdss can be caused by the injection of any potential pollutants to detect anomalous fluctuations in water quality an mlp model was used to depict the temporal variations in water quality indicators then the bayesian updating rule was recursively applied to analyze the probability of a related contamination event perelman et al 2012 moreover the recursive bayesian rule was also combined with ga optimization to improve the performance of the mlp bayesian by applying adaptive updating dynamic thresholds to optimize the fixed thresholds in the outliers classification module better performance in the detection of contamination events in dwdss was obtained arad et al 2013 in addition pipeline leakage detection and location in dwdss are also of significance for instance the svm and mlp models were respectively used to simulate the leakage size and location by analyzing the time series behavior of flow and pressure in pipe networks makaya and hensel 2016 interestingly shortridge et al compared pipe break events with weekly internet search volume for symptoms of gastrointestinal illness using data mining techniques the results revealed a positive correlation between elevated risk on public health and pipe failures fig 7g shortridge and guikema 2014 this finding emphasized the importance of the application of ml in real time monitoring of the functional integrity of pipelines like water quality predictions in natural water systems the volume of features involved in a water quality simulation for drinking water treatment and distribution is relatively small and water quality parameters are interconnected and affect each other through chemical and physical interactions therefore nn based models e g mlp and anfis are competent for most water quality prediction tasks and have been applied widely table s12 additionally lstm based on time series and image recognition technology based on dl have also been applied for predicting membrane fouling in fact water quality parameters in drinking water treatment and distribution processes are all time series that provide the feasibility for lstm to solve more problems in engineered water systems moreover image recognition technology can also be used to investigate processes of visual changes such as coagulation sedimentation and discoloration 4 4 collecting and treating sewage water sewer networks are designed to collect domestic sewage and industrial and hospital wastewater and transport them to wwtps for contaminant removal therefore the good condition of a sewer network plays an important role in maintaining the sanitation of an urban environment currently ml approaches have been applied to improve the maintenance of sewer networks in sewers fluctuations in flow rate and pressure typically cause debris sedimentation that can gradually form accumulative deposits bottom deposits will reduce the transport capacity of pipelines and form anaerobic conditions to cause corrosion or odor problems bonakdari and larrarte 2006 to monitor the deposition situation and predict the bed loads inside pipelines an anfis model was applied to analyze the effects of sewer geometrical features and flow hydraulic characteristics azamathulla et al 2012 in addition an rf model was also used to predict the self cleansing sewer velocity and this allowed the flow to spontaneously scour and remove deposited sediments from the pipes the results showed the most important variable that determines the self cleansing velocity was the volumetric sediment concentration fig 8 a montes et al 2020 in addition the multigene genetic programming technique was adopted to estimate the particle froude number in large sewers both works were found to be conducive to self cleansing sewer design safari and danandeh mehr 2018 recently an ensemble procedure comprised of the network k function geographically weighted poisson regression and the rf algorithm was applied to analyze the factors that affect sewer pipe blockages explanatory factors such as material type number of service connections self cleaning velocity sagging pipes root intrusion risk closed circuit television cctv inspection grade and distance to restaurants showed significantly varying impacts on the blockage propensity in addition the rf model predicted the blockage recurrence with a 60 80 accuracy in one of the studied cities okwori et al 2021 moreover ml has also been applied in sewer defect detection closed circuit television cctv is also a popular tool for visual inspection of the internal conditions of pipelines however cctv inspection relies heavily on human labor to perform video analysis which is time consuming labor intensive and error prone in this case the svm model based on anomalous frame recognition and classification was proposed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cctv inspections ye et al 2019 moreover better performance in defect recognition and classification was achieved by applying a cnn model which obtained an accuracy of 96 33 fig 8b hassan et al 2019 when transported into the wwtps sewage and wastewater will be treated by a series of treatment processes however increasingly stringent sewage discharge standards have brought demands for more advanced treatment processes and more efficient management in wwtps like dwtps timely and readily obtaining water quality information helps improve the operation and management of a wwtp to achieve this goal ml has been used to simulate the water quality and operation status in various treatment processes in different wwtps in studies applying ml to predict the performance of wwtps water quality indicators such as cod bod phosphorus and ammonia have typically been adopted to evaluate the effluent quality khatri et al 2019 for example an mlp model accurately predicted the effluent tn tp and cod concentrations in small scaled wwtps in korea s rural areas thus realizing real time remote supervising of wwtps lee et al 2008 similarly the ann model was also applied for predicting the effluent quality of processes including a membrane bioreactor mbr giwa et al 2016 a sequential batch reactor sbr khatri et al 2019 and anoxic oxic ao system yang et al 2021 and aerobic granular sludge reactors ags mahmod and wahab 2017 additionally some other algorithms such as svr seshan et al 2014 anfis perendeci et al 2009 and extreme learning machine elm lotfi et al 2019 have also obtained encouraging results for predicting effluent water quality in a combined lysis cryptic and biological nitrogen removal system an mlp model realized an accurate simulation of the process with an r2 value of 0 9513 by real time adjusting the sludge lysate return ratio the optimized system removed greater than 97 99 of the ammonia nitrogen with zero excess sludge production fig 8c yang et al 2021 another study used molecular data to train the svr model to predict the effluent cod ammonia nitrate and the removal of 3 chloroaniline molecular data was generated from a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis targeting the 16s rrna and amoa genes from the sludge community the results showed that the proposed svr model simulated the effluent water quality with r2 values ranging from 0 89 to 0 97 for the tested four parameters seshan et al 2014 similarly metagenomic information was also applied to investigate the strength of associations between args and different bacterial taxa using the rf model that revealed that genera including bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus were primarily the hosts of the selected args sun et al 2021 moreover comparisons among different algorithms have been conducted svm was found to perform better for predicting effluent total ammonia nitrogen tan than ann alejo et al 2018 while it was better for simulating the concentration of kjeldahl nitrogen kn than anfis manu and thalla 2017 the superior ability of svr compared to these two algorithms was also reported when predicting the performance of ags reactors zaghloul et al 2020a in contrast to these comparisons a multi stage model that combined several ml algorithms was developed for predicting effluent cod nh4 n and po4 3 during the first stage of this model the selected variables were input into the ann svr and anfis models then the outputs were combined as inputs for the subsequent ensemble algorithms of which the best outputs were determined to be the final prediction this approach improved the performance of ml models with a small dataset by combining the advantages of different algorithms instead of discussing and selecting the best single one zaghloul et al 2020b in addition to the common indicators mentioned above some other parameters related to wwtps have also been predicted for example the accumulation of fat oil and grease in the sumps of wastewater pumping stations was monitored using cnn based image recognition technology moreno rodenas et al 2021 the sludge volume index svi was predicted to monitor the running conditions of the activated sludge process fig 8d djeddou and achour 2015 in addition the daily flow rates for a wwtp were simulated to better design its treatment units najafzadeh and zeinolabedini 2019 moreover some toxic substances present in effluent have also been predicted for instance in a two phase continuous stirred tank bioreactor cstb used for treating a trichloroethylene tce polluted stream an mlp model simulated the treatment process with excellent accuracy r2 0 9923 fig 8e baskaran et al 2020 the fecal coliform and total coliform removal efficiencies were also predicted with an mlp model in a wwtp using an intermittent cycle extended aeration sequential batch reactor iceas sbr khatri et al 2020 additionally ml approaches have also been used to predict the removal of heavy metals including zinc rahmanian et al 2011 chromium yaqub et al 2019 and mercury yaqub and lee 2020 all of these three studies provided helpful guidance for future research on the removal of other heavy metals fig 8f moreover a dnn and lstm model were compared for predicting the emission of nitrous oxide n2o from a wwtp in denmark a total of 750 000 measurements including the influent flow rate airflow rate temperature ammonium nitrate and do were collected to train the models the higher r2 values 0 94 versus 0 76 indicated that the lstm performed better than the dnn fig 8g a sensitivity analysis revealed that the temperature no3 n and nh4 n were the most important factors contributing to the n2o concentration and n2o emission rate wwtps are a great contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions because of the strong warming effects of n2o therefore this study was beneficial for understanding the production and emission mechanisms as well as developing control strategies for n2o to ensure the sustainable operation and development of wwtps hwangbo et al 2021 recently ml has also been applied to model anaerobic digestion ad processes ad is a popular technique that can convert organic waste and wastewater into biomethane to harvest energy in this study six ml algorithms were combined with microbial gene sequencing techniques to predict the methane yield genomic data and their corresponding operational parameters from eight research groups were used to train the models the rf model achieved an accuracy of 0 82 using the combination of operational parameters and genomic data moreover the importance of microbial community members for methane production was first quantified and the results showed that chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaeta were the top five most influential phyla this study provided valuable information regarding the ad process for monitoring and controlling methane production long et al 2021 according to table s15 mlp was undoubtedly a powerful tool for predicting water quality in sewage or wastewater treatment and has been widely used the past two decades indicating that it was not out of date due to the popularity of other emerging powerful algorithms however it cannot be ignored that emerging technologies bring more possibilities and efficiency to water quality prediction with ml for example dl makes it possible to deal with tasks with large feature spaces while image recognition develops a non data prediction framework moreover the combination of ml and bioinformatics analysis provides richer data and an in depth perspective for predicting biological treatment processes which is lacking in the current studies and will require special attention in future research 5 discussion conclusions and prospects 5 1 discussion and conclusions the above review lists representative applications of ml in fields of water science and exhibits the availability and efficiency of ml for solving problems concerning water utilization and pollution control to better use ml in water related research previous research and algorithm applications need to be analyzed to provide other researchers with common characteristics and rules that can be used for reference according to the classification and analysis of the studies reviewed above the combination of ml with water science was found to be realized primarily in the following manners table 2 i predicting the status of desired contaminants was based on analyzing their interactions with other water related parameters in these studies the ml approaches could be further divided into regression and classification analyses in studies that adopted regression analyses the specific concentration of pollutants was predicted for example they were utilized for predicting the wqis in natural and engineered systems and simulating pollutant concentrations in treatment reaction processes in studies that applied classification analyses the category of the target e g the pollutant concentration range or water quality classification rather than a specific value was determined for example classification analyses were utilized for the mapping of contaminant distributions in groundwater and classifying water resources into different categories according to their water quality ii mining big data from previous studies were used to summarize universal rules and mechanisms thus guiding similar reactions or processes these included evaluating the toxicity of emerging pollutants and applying adsorption or oxidation reactions to remove pollutants or test new reactive materials in this manner the valuable information hidden in an increasing number of scientific studies was systematically delved to provide more theoretical guidance for similar studies iii image recognition technology was applied to analyze the relationships between the image information and physicochemical properties of the research object thus characterizing water quality identifying specific contaminants and detecting equipment faults in engineered water systems this approach improved the efficiency of analysis methods with spectrum or image as output thereby reducing the difficulty in detecting sewer faults in particular this method provides new insights for analyzing water quality in this era when high definition cameras and remote sensing are increasingly popular though ml has been recognized as a powerful tool for solving water related problems different algorithms exhibited different performance in these fields therefore discussing and analyzing the applicability of various commonly used algorithms in different application scenarios is informative for other researchers to choose the appropriate algorithm or further optimize an algorithm to determine the commonly used algorithms the usage frequency of algorithms used in 215 reviewed studies was counted and the usage frequency of these algorithms in water related researches was also retrieved results of both statistical schemes showed that mlp anfis rbf svm lr cart and rf were commonly used ml algorithms while lstm dnn and cnn were popular dl algorithms text s1 therefore the advantages and disadvantages of these ml algorithms in different research directions were compared and analyzed and the results are briefly presented in table 2 in general mlp was the most widely used algorithm in dealing with both regression and classification tasks especially in earlier studies with small volume of data and features ml achieved satisfactory performance for predicting pollutant concentrations in natural waters chemical reaction processes and water or wastewater treatment however mlp suffers the problem of a long training time slow convergence and a local optimum caused by gradient decline although it has a strong ability in fitting nonlinear problems and robustness to data noise in contrast rbf nn makes up for these disadvantages of mlp and even has higher approximation accuracy and generalization ability however as the volume of training samples increase the number of hidden layer neurons of rbf nn will be higher than that of mlp which will increase the complexity and computation burden of the rbf network recently dl has also been applied in dealing with problems in water science due to the introduction of more hidden layers dnn has stronger abilities in nonlinear learning feature extraction and fault tolerance consequently dnn was found to be used to handle tasks with a large volume of data and features especially studies that applied data mining from the literature additionally rnn and lstm can deal with time series data moreover through the switch of the cell gate lstm realizes the function of long time memory thus solving the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion during the training process therefore lstm can solve more problems in water science as the data in many fields of water related research are time series data although the dl models seem to possess a powerful ability to solve nearly all the tasks concerning water science they still must face the black box nature which is an unavoidable problem for all nn based algorithms in contrast the dt based models are more interpretable as they can show the importance of different features to generate understandable rules in addition dt based models can quickly solve multi classification tasks with large volume of features this is the advantage over lr and svm the former of which cannot deal with tasks with nonlinear and large feature spaces and it is time consuming during training and sometimes difficult to find a suitable kernel function for the latter therefore cart especially the rf models have been widely used for handling both regression and classification tasks such as mapping groundwater contaminants and classifying water sources this is because rf overcomes the problems of over fitting and data imbalance and it is robust to the loss of features based on the above comparison and analysis of the several commonly used algorithms recommendations on the selection of algorithms were made according to their applicability to different scenarios table 2 for regression tasks with a small volume of data both mlp and rbf nn are competent without regard to the complexity of the model rbf nn may be better due to its higher ability of generalization fitting and convergence for classification tasks the cart model is more suitable for data with a balanced sample size for each category because the information gain is partial to the feature with more data thus leading to over fitting otherwise the rf model is more qualified especially for tasks with a large volume of features moreover for those tasks with a huge amount of data dnn and lstm are more competent 5 2 prospects the development of ml in water science is still at an initial stage however ml has shown its feasibility and efficiency in solving complex environmental problems in many studies to make ml technology more accessible to environmental researchers thus solving research problems in the water science field more efficiently joint efforts in terms of algorithm development data curation and interdisciplinary cooperation are required i as analyzed above there was not a perfect algorithm for all tasks necessary for the water science field algorithms with simple structures typically have defects in performance e g mlp and cart while those with excellent performance often possess complex structures thus increasing the difficulty of programming and the hardware cost of operation e g dnn therefore according to the characteristics of the data in water related research such as a moderate amount of time series data algorithms with simple structures high performance and strong interpretability are encouraged to be developed moreover the graphical user interface e g the graphical user interface designed for modeling adsorption processes or user friendly data analytics tools e g sourcetracker designed specifically for water related studies can also reduce the cost and difficulties of researchers encounter when using ml techniques ii data mining is helpful to collect data from similar studies to form big data thus revealing underlying rules or providing a data basis for other big data researchers however in traditional research areas including water science data from other studies are often difficult to obtain open data and the sharing of data are common ways to provide rich data sources for datasets in the application of ml however open source data in water science field seems to be insufficient compared to other fields where ml techniques have been applied earlier and utilized more in depth e g drug research vamathevan et al 2019 biological research camacho et al 2018 and solid earth geosciences bergen et al 2019 for which many open source data platforms have been developed therefore the concept of open source data and the sharing of data is expected to be accepted and practiced more widely in the water research community and researchers are encouraged to share their research data without any conflict of interest or legal and regulatory restrictions iii the programming and implementation of ml models depend on the researchers computer skills and mastery of algorithms which are difficult for most water researchers to grasp in a short amount of time to lower the threshold for researchers to use the ml technologies interdisciplinary communication and cooperation with data researchers are beneficial under this framework of cross disciplines data researchers can provide professional suggestions on data processing and modeling while water researchers can interpret the output of the model with expert knowledge moreover with the help of data researchers some cutting edge algorithms can also be used to solve problems in water science field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of

the intelligent development of water science graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords machine learning natural water systems engineered water systems 1 introduction water is one of the most indispensable material resources on which the survival and development of humanity depends however the increasing amounts of pollutant discharge caused by human activities has been leading to increasing amount of water pollution which poses a threat to the sustainable development of ecosystems and human society to protect the ecological safety and human health from water pollution a range of measures have been adopted in natural water systems the qualities of various waters e g rivers lakes groundwaters and seawaters are under close monitoring for better management and utilization of water resources in addition water pollution is controlled using identification source tracking and toxicity evaluations of pollutants in engineered water systems raw water taken from natural waters is purified in drinking water treatment plants dwtps using various treatment processes e g coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection to remove the contaminants and then this supplied to users via distribution systems additionally sewage and wastewater are collected and treated in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps through a series of physical chemical and biological processes to abate pollution toward the urban and natural environment during the processes of natural water management water resource utilization and polluted water treatment a large number of corresponding studies have been conducted gradually developing into fields related to natural and engineered water systems currently the fourth industrial revolution combined with big data and artificial intelligence is expected to bring immense changes to human society machine learning ml is one of the technical approaches of artificial intelligence and it is developed using various algorithms based on mathematical and statistical knowledge ml can predict the status of new data by summarizing the underlying relationships and rules within known data and its prediction performance will improve with an increase in the data amount and the iteration of the algorithms vamathevan et al 2019 ml can solve complex problems involving massive nonlinear processes or combinatorial spaces that cannot be solved using conventional methods or only with great time and cost therefore ml has been widely used in fields such as computer vision speech recognition natural language processing robotic control and other hot topics jordan and mitchell 2015a in recent years ml has also been applied to solve a wide variety of problems in the water science field to understand the application situation of ml in these fields and the applicability and feasibility of various algorithms in solving water related problems it is necessary to review and summarize the existing studies and some papers have reviewed relevant studies for example many publications have reviewed the application of artificial neural networks anns and other algorithms such as the fuzzy inference system fis evolutionary algorithms the support vector machine svm random forest rf decision tree dt and ml coupled with wavelet transformation or optimization algorithms for modeling water quality in rivers lakes and groundwater chau 2006 che osmi et al 2016 chen et al 2020b ighalo et al 2020 maier and dandy 2000 maier et al 2010 2014 nicklow et al 2010 ostfeld and solomatine 2008 raghavendra and deka 2014 rajaee et al 2020 tiyasha tung and yaseen 2020 in addition the applications of ml in other aspects or water related research have also been reviewed such as remote sensing for monitoring water quality sagan et al 2020 wagle et al 2020 drinking water treatment dogo et al 2019 li et al 2021 seawater desalination al aani et al 2019 and wastewater treatment and pollutant removal fan et al 2018 khataee and kasiri 2011 wang et al 2021b yaseen 2021 all of these reviews are beneficial for researchers to understand and expand the application of artificial intelligence in the water science field however many other published applications of ml such as groundwater contaminant mapping podgorski and berg 2020 contaminant sources tracing balleste et al 2020 pollutant toxicity evaluating wang et al 2021d contaminant identification baek et al 2021 and others have not been summarized and discussed moreover many review papers have focused on the application of one algorithm thus lacking a comparison of its advantages and disadvantages with other algorithms as is well known plenty of ml algorithms have been developed and their performance for solving practical tasks varies therefore an analysis of the applicability scope of various algorithms for dealing with different water related problems is required this article provides a comprehensive review of ml applications in related fields of water science and summarizes the representative studies in recent years first the establishment processes of ml models including data preparation algorithm selection and model evaluation are briefly introduced in addition the representative applications of ml in water quality prediction and management in natural water systems as well as technology development and operation monitoring in engineered water systems are summarized to be specific in natural water systems ml has been used to predict water quality indicators map pollutant distribution in groundwater classify water resources trace contaminant sources and evaluate pollutant toxicities in engineered water systems ml has been applied to optimize adsorption and oxidation processes assist laboratory characterization analyses and improve the operation and management of drinking water purification and distribution as well as wastewater collection and treatment more importantly the advantages and disadvantages of representative algorithms are discussed and their applicability for different data and researches is analyzed by comparing their structures and mechanisms finally current research hotspots challenges and prospects of ml combined water utilization and pollution control are discussed 2 an overview of machine learning ml refers to a technology that uses a series of programmed algorithms to predict the future patterns of any raw data with the experience learned from the hidden associations within the given data through an automatic mathematical analysis jordan and mitchell 2015b in general to recognize the rules underlying the known data as accurately as possible the data should first be well treated to generate the dataset then an appropriate ml algorithm is determined according to the characteristics of input data and the requirements of output data the selected algorithm will then be trained with the well prepared data and evaluated to adjust the hyper parameters within thus generating the desired model afterward the proposed ml model is qualified to make predictions on new data the establishment of the ml model is briefly introduced in the subsequent sections and those who want to learn more details about ml algorithms can refer to specialized books and papers on statistics or machine learning hastie et al 2008 mohri et al 2012 2 1 date preparation an ideal ml requires appropriate and well trained models but the quality and quantity of data are also vitally important currently we can crawl data from the internet collect data from the literature search data from open source databases or record data from the experiments etc however we typically obtain raw data with missing values errors duplicates or noises that should be treated with data cleansing then feature engineering is conducted based on professional background knowledge to select or extract data features according to task demands finally the prepared data is typically divided into a training set a validation set for some algorithms and a test set the training set is used to train the model based on the selected ml algorithm while the validation set is applied to tune hyper parameters to optimize the trained model after the training process the predictive and generalization ability of the trained model is evaluated using the test set by comparing the prediction outputs with their corresponding known results 2 2 algorithm selection the rise of ml can be traced back to the 1950s when donald hebb proposed the hebbian learning theory hebb 1949 after which a wide range of ml algorithms were developed in general ml algorithms can be classified into three categories supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning a certain classification also includes semi supervised learning according to the types of data and requirements of the work moreover the applications of deep learning dl for water utilization and pollution control are also discussed due to the inseparable relationships between dl and ml fig 1 outlines the reviewed ml algorithms and their applications in the fields of natural and engineered water systems supervised learning algorithms are typically applied to treat labeled data to predict the values of a continuous set using regression or the category of a discrete set using classification for the regression analysis the least square method lsm has long been used in many algorithms as it can find the best function parameters to minimize the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values based on the lsm the simplest ml algorithm linear regression is typically applied when the dataset possesses a relatively small size and a linear relationship within data fig 2 a when dealing with nonlinear relationships polynomial regression which is also based on lsm is a better choice as it can flexibly fit nonlinear data by adjusting the power of the variables fig 2b by using linear and polynomial regressions rapid modeling intuitive interpretation and accurate sensitivity to outliers can be achieved in addition to linear and polynomial regressions the ridge regression lasso regression and elasticnet regression are also common regression algorithms used in other fields as for the classification tasks the naïve bayesian nb classifier and logistic regression lr have long been used the nb classifier can calculate the required posterior probability based on the existing prior probability of the event then the newly gained probability is updated to perform the subsequent tasks the lr applies the sigmoid function to normalize the predicted values thus calculating the probability of an event and comparing it with the selected threshold value usually 0 5 to generate the predicted binary outcomes yes or no in addition to the algorithms described above specifically developed for regression or classification many other algorithms can be used for both regression and classification the k nearest neighbors knn can predict the value or category of a sample according to its adjacent neighbors in the feature space for regression the average value of the k nearest neighbors is recognized as the prediction result while for classification the category of the most occurring in the k nearest neighbors is outputted fig 2c altman 1992 additionally the support vector machine svm aims at finding a hyperplane to segment the samples based on the principle of maximizing the interval between two categories of samples fig 2d to solve classification or regression problems svm can be divided into support vector classification svc and support vector regression svr kadyrova and pavlova 2014 the decision tree dt is also a popular algorithm that has a tree structure it is composed of a root node several internal nodes and leaf nodes that respectively represent the set of all samples attribute tests and the decision results fig 2e the dt algorithm begins its decision making process from the root node and then compares the tested data with the characteristic nodes the algorithm then selects the next comparison branch according to the result of the attribute test it finally outputs the result of the leaf node as the final decision result myles et al 2004 because the dt algorithm can solve both classification and regression problems it is also known as the classification and regression tree cart moreover to improve the performance of the dt algorithm many derived dt algorithms such as boosted decision trees bdts gradient boosted decision trees gbdts and the random forests rf have been developed in particular rf is an ensemble algorithm comprised of many dts in which each tree randomly samples from the input data to independently generate a prediction result after all the trees output their decisions they vote for the most appropriate result as the final prediction of this rf model fig 2f breiman 2001 aside from the above algorithms the artificial neural network ann was the most frequently used algorithm in the reviewed studies perceptron is the structural unit of ann and it is composed of input cells and an output cell and the weight the connections between them different input information can exert different effects on the output by adjusting the values of the weight connections fig 2g rosenblatt 1957 the perceptron algorithm is a linear classification model that is suitable for dealing with linearly separable data by combining multiple perceptrons and introducing hidden layers and activation functions the multilayer perceptron mlp algorithm was proposed and is capable of treating multi dimensional data fig 2h clark 1991 however mlp is a global approximation algorithm in which all the weights in the network should be readjusted every time the sample is learned therefore mlp has the disadvantage of a slow convergence velocity thus tending to fall into the local optimum the radial basis function neural network rbf nn is another common ann algorithm fig 2i it employs the radial basis function as the activation function and only adjusts the weights connections in the specified domain therefore rbf nn has the advantage of fast convergence and is immune to the local optimum problem lee and chang 2003 moreover the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is also a commonly used ann derived algorithm anfis can be defined as a multi layer feed forward network that employs fuzzy inference to map the input space to the output space anfis allowed the realization of a highly non linear mapping that is considered to be superior in yielding non linear time series compared with common linear methods jang 1993 unsupervised learning algorithms are often applied to reveal the intrinsic characteristics and rules of the unlabeled sample data they are typically applied in dimensionality reduction clustering and anomaly detection also known as outlier detection the principal component analysis pca is a representative method for unsupervised dimensionality reduction as its name implies pca aims to find the most essential characteristics or generate a new characteristic to describe the original dataset thus reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and increasing interpretability with minimized information loss jolliffe and cadima 2016 k means is a common method for clustering analysis it can find a partition to organize data into differentiable groupings by minimizing the squared error between the empirical mean and the points in cluster jain 2010 isolation forest gaussian distribution and local outlier factor lof are also common algorithms for anomaly detection they are typically used to detect samples that are sparsely distributed and far from the majority of data ariyaluran habeeb et al 2019 different from supervised learning algorithms that predict the data directly unsupervised learning algorithms are typically applied for data pretreatment in the studies reviewed herein 2 3 model evaluation many approaches have been proposed to evaluate the performance of ml models the evaluation parameters for regression algorithms primarily include bias variance the mean absolute error mae the mean squared error mse and r squared r2 among others bias is the difference between the predicted result and its actual value while variance represents the degree of deviation from the mean of the total sample mae is the average sum of the absolute value of the bias for each sample it can reflect the actual error of prediction by avoiding the problem where the positive and negative errors cancel each other mse is the average of the sum of the square of the bias for each sample typically to keep the evaluation indicator and the sample values are on the same order of magnitude mse uses the root to obtain the root mean squared error rmse which is also a commonly used measure of performance moreover r2 also known as the coefficient of determination describes the fitting degree of the regression function to the observed values the value of r2 is between 0 and 1 and the closer the r2 value is to 1 the better the model fits the data for classification algorithms the accuracy rate is the most used evaluation indicator and it is the proportion of the correctly classified samples to the total number of samples in addition precision p and recall r are also widely used measurements for evaluating classifiers the predicted results can be divided into true positive tp false positive fp true negative tn and false negative fn according to their real categories and the predicted categories table 1 p is defined as the proportion of the correctly classified positive samples in the total number of positive samples while r is the proportion of the correctly classified positive samples in the total number of correctly classified samples for an ideal classifier the values of both p and r are expected to be as high as possible however one value will increase while the other decreases in practical cases therefore the fβ score the weighted harmonic mean of the p and r values is applied to balance p and r fβ is presented as eq 1 where β measures the relative importance of r to p 1 f β 1 β 2 p r β 2 p r where r matters more than p when β 1 and conversely p matters more than r when β 1 when β 1 fβ is converted to the f1 score that represents the balance between r and p 3 water quality prediction and management in natural water systems natural waters including rivers lakes groundwaters and seas are the most important water sources for human life and productive activities to better manage and utilize natural water resources different countries and regions have adopted various evaluation schemes based on a series of water quality indicators wqis physical indicators include temperature color turbidity electric conductivity ec suspended solids ss and total solids ts chemical indicators include ph dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc alkalinity ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn biological indicators covering chlorophyll a chl a and fecal indicator bacteria fib e g total coliform e coli and enterococcus uddin et al 2021 in recent years many studies have applied ml approaches in water quality prediction and water resource management in natural water environments below the relevant representative applications of ml are summarized including predicting water quality wqis e g do fib and chl a or other multiple indicators mapping pollutant distribution in groundwater classifying water resources according to different standards tracing contamination sources and evaluating pollutant toxicity 3 1 predicting water quality the dissolved oxygen do concentration is a critical parameter for evaluating the ecological health of an aquatic environment this concentration results from an equilibrium between oxygen producing e g photosynthesis and air diffusing and oxygen consuming e g aerobic respiration nitrification and chemical oxidation processes in an aquatic environment olyaie et al 2017 under the influence of these complex processes it is difficult for conventional process based models or statistical approaches to simulate the do level on the contrary data driven ml does not consider the accumulation mechanism of do but only analyzes the statistical and mathematical relationship between different parameters for example wqis such as temperature ph ec and discharge were selected as inputs to train two types of ann models for predicting do concentrations downstream and upstream of fountain creek the rbf nn performed better with a higher r2 value for both sampling stations than the mlp model ay and kisi 2012 however the rbf nn was not as accurate as the mlp in predicting the do concentration in the mediterranean sea along with gaza which might have been attributed to the small database as rbf nn was more sensitive to the data volume zaqoot et al 2009 to improve the performance of the rbf nn the general regression neural network grnn modified the structure of the rbf by replacing its weight connection between the hidden layer and the output layer with a summation layer to reduce the need for data volumes in predicting the do concentration in the danube river the performances of the mlp grnn and recurrent neural network rnn were examined using only small amount of data results showed that the grnn obtained better performance than the mlp did however the grnn was inferior to the rnn model that was equipped with an extra layer to store and transform the previous input information as a decision reference when needed fig 2j j and w 2011 the tested rnn provided considerably better predictions of the do with all results within an error of less than 10 antanasijevic et al 2013b however because the previous information was sequentially stored in rnn too much information would make it difficult to learn from the far information thus causing long term dependency problems to solve this problem the long short term memory lstm algorithm was developed by storing previous information in the memory cells that will be opened by a gate to transfer information when needed fig 2k greff et al 2017 the lstm was applied to predict the river do concentrations at the continental scale using the camels chem database that collected do information from 236 minimally disturbed watersheds across the u s ultimately the proposed lstm model achieved a satisfactory prediction with a mean and median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 60 and 0 78 respectively fig 3 a zhi et al 2021 due to the difference in the spatial location and scale of the study as well as the choice of variables and the amount of data a comparison between different studies is undoubtedly difficult however by utilizing a direct comparison in the same study and a cross comparison of the different studies listed in table s1 it was found that mlp performed well with a small dataset data bulk 1000 while svm performed better with a larger dataset data bulk 1000 moreover considering that the variables used in a study for predicting do are typically based on a time series the lstm is also recommended as it is designed for time series tasks and can carry useful information from the past to the future in addition it relies on fewer environment variables and this saves the cost of data collection drinking water or recreational water polluted with feces has the potential to cause gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases haile et al 1999 total coliform fecal coliform or e coli and enterococcus are typically applied as fecal indicator bacteria fib to characterize fecal contamination in water however common approaches for quantifying fib such as multiple tube fermentation membrane filtration and specific enzymatic detection usually require 18 72 h while emerging techniques such as flow cytometry atp assays online optical sensors and quantitative pcr are costly garcía alba et al 2019 however data driven ml can provide real time predictions that rely on easily available information about environmental conditions e g precipitation discharge and tide and the representative studies are reviewed below for instance an mlp model was used to fill the missing microbial data in a dataset based on related physical chemical and bacteriological data from the kentucky river the mlp had a more accurate performance than conventional imputation or regression models with smaller error values additionally the proposed mlp model also accurately classified observational data into two defined ranges for fecal coliform concentrations in a river system especially when the concentration of fib was below 200 cfu 100 ml chandramouli et al 2007 moreover when the safe concentration of fib was set as the classification threshold ml could also be applied in water quality warnings for recreational surface waters for example when monitoring fecal pollution of coastal water in southern california an mlp accurately predicted the levels of three fibs with fp and fn rates less than 10 thus sufficing to make rapid and reliable decisions regarding beach closures or advisories he and he 2008 in addition to ann models some other algorithms such as cart rf and the bayesian network have also been applied to predict fib concentrations to provide information about water safety thoe et al 2014 though the models described above performed well with high overall accuracy the unbalance in the dataset might have reduced the sensitivity of the predictions data unbalance is caused because most of the data in the dataset was typically below the guideline thresholds while the minority is exceeded this increases the possibility of over fitting in the majority class and information loss in the minority class when training a model batista et al 2004 to solve this problem an adaptive synthetic adasyn sampling algorithm was adopted to create more samples at the boundary between the two classes using linear interpolation fig 3b afterward the proposed knn bdt and mlp models all provided favorable predictions with relatively high sensitivity of approximately 75 and an overall accuracy of greater than 90 xu et al 2020 in addition to adasyn recently the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote was also applied to solve the data imbalance problem in fib prediction smote is a technique based on the nearest neighbor idea to synthesize new samples for the minority class the combination with smote improved the performance of the six tested algorithms for example rf presented a 50 higher true positive rate with respect to the baseline bourel et al 2021 the proposed approach in these two studies provided new insight into data preparation for training ml models moreover no matter what algorithms were applied for fib prediction accuracy was always used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models however accuracy might not be enough to assess models when the potential health effects of a high false negative fn rate are assumed to outweigh the risk of an unnecessary recreational water closure given by a high false positive fp rate therefore stidson et al 2012 attached more importance to the false negative fn rate over other metrics stidson et al 2012 this was because a high fn rate meant the prediction of a dangerous situation as a safe one motamarri and boccelli 2012 therefore when evaluating the performance of an ml model diversified evaluation criteria based on actual requirements should be considered according to table s2 mlp was the most widely used algorithm in the previous studies that modeled fib but algorithms based on dt such as bdt cart and rf performed better in studies that solved the data imbalance problem in addition the model based on dt was more interpretable than the neural network model and it was more instructive to understand and prevent fib from exceeding the safety standard therefore dt based models combined with data imbalance processing technology are more suitable for fib predictions an appropriate amount of phytoplankton in an aquatic environment can improve water quality by producing oxygen and soaking up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis durham et al 2015 however eutrophication of water bodies will promote the rapid growth of phytoplankton thus leading to aquatic environmental problems such as algal blooms ma et al 2015 algal blooms will shade benthic primary producers from the sunlight reduce do levels and accumulate toxic metabolites to threaten the ecology and human beings conley et al 2009 therefore forecasting algal blooms or determining the key factors that control bloom production is important to prevent their deleterious effects recknagel et al 1997 various models have been proposed to achieve this purpose including empirical models deterministic models time series analysis models and fuzzy logic models yabunaka et al 1997 ml has also been applied to predict algal blooms by identifying the environmental factors that affect the growth and accumulation of algal biomass to simulate the nonlinear processes of algal blooms karul et al 2000 lee et al 2003 however environmental factors that control the biomass of algae vary according to different studies for example flow and temperature have been reported to be predominant in determining the initiate and duration of cyanobacterial growth while water color controls the magnitude of the population growth peak maier et al 1998 additionally the importance of controlling factors for different cyanobacteria genera varied with their species concretely anabaena and microcystis had the highest sensitivity to average flow while for planktolyngbya and oscillatoria it was temperature and for cylindrospermopsis it was water color therefore it has been difficult to predict the intensity and frequency of algal blooms using a single environment variable and to control algal biomass by adjusting few influential factors due to the diversity of phytoplankton that made up algal blooms nelson et al 2018 in the last few decades the development of remote sensing technology makes has made it possible to directly observe and investigate algal blooms at large spatial and temporal scales recently ml has also been applied to analyze remote sensing data lary et al 2016 for example moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data were applied to estimate the chl a concentration within the gulf of st lawrence of canada fig 3c in this study remote sensing with 10 types of reflectance rrs was combined with eight different ml algorithms to predict algal blooms the comparison results revealed the svr model obtained the best performance using rrs at 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm he et al 2020 in addition some other remote sensing data such as seawifs have also been applied for estimating chl a concentrations to forecast algal blooms campsvalls et al 2006 keiner 2010 in addition to predicting chl a in the form of remote sensing data remote sensing technology can also provide hyperspectral images to simulate the concentration of algae cells in a study that predicted cyanobacterial cell concentrations pyo et al 2021 developed a convolutional neural network cnn model with a convolutional block attention module cnnan that could emphasize valuable information and suppress insignificant ones to improve the performance of cnn for image recognition compared to a traditional hydrodynamic model and cnn cnnan performed better with a higher nse and a smaller rmse table s3 pyo et al 2021 as mentioned in this section the factors that affect the growth of different algae are different and a natural water body often contains several types of algae at the same time consequently screening from all available water related parameters to determine influential ones is often necessary prior to an algae or chl a prediction which is time and labor intensive remote sensing and image recognition technologies do not consider complex water quality parameters but directly use color information which is one of the major characteristics of water bodies rich in chl a or algae relative to other polluted water bodies therefore algorithms based on remote sensing information or hyperspectral images are undoubtedly the optimal choice to predict the concentration of algae or chl a aside from the single wqi like do fib and chl a introduced above indicators like bod cod toc tp tn and ts are more common in water quality evaluations and ml has also been used to predict these water quality indicators for instance 13 environmental variables were adopted to develop an mlp model to simulate the daily concentrations of toc tn and tp in three rivers the results showed that concentrations of the three wqis were all estimated with r2 values greater than 0 75 moreover the future carbon and nitrogen loads under climate change scenarios were predicted and increases in toc and tn under notable change scenarios were reported holmberg et al 2006 recently an rf model was used to predict the concentrations of nutrients n and p in both rural and urban catchments by analyzing the impacts of each variable in the model and removing the inessential ones the number of variables were minimized to reduce the cost of surrogate sensors in this manner both the low cost and high accuracy of the prediction were guaranteed castrillo and garcia 2020 in addition to rivers the water quality of other water bodies has also been simulated including a lake barzegar et al 2020 a reservoir zhao et al 2007 coastal water palani et al 2008 and even stormwater runoff najah ahmed et al 2019 in particular the water quality index rather than wqis has been utilized in studies to predict the water quality in wetlands using mlp rbf nn svm and cart models the water quality index is a single number calculated using a set of physicochemical water indicators to normalize the water quality mohammadpour et al 2015 2016 interestingly image analysis was also applied to determine the quantitative relationships between the image information and the water quality in a study that analyzed animal wastewater quality the linear regression lr stochastic gradient descent sgd and ridge regression algorithms were applied the rgb color index extracted from the water sample images was used to analyze the correlations between the spectral rate and the wqis including n p ts and total coliform fig 3d the optimal r2 values were as high as 0 98 for ts and 0 96 for total coliform which demonstrated that this was an instructive method for rapid and cheap analysis of water quality li et al 2020b due to random or systematic errors data obtained from site monitoring or experimental processes were possibly affected by noise that caused uncertainty in the accurate prediction to eliminate the effects of noise on data the anfis algorithm was improved by combining it with the wavelet de noising technique wdt the results indicated that wdt anfis was the fastest and the most precise method for processing large volumes of non linear and non parametric data compared with the mlp rbf nn and anfis models najah ahmed et al 2019 therefore to optimize the performance of ml more advanced analytical and data processing techniques are worthy of being considered according to table s4 the tested algorithms e g mlp rbf nn svm and dt performed well in predicting various wqis in the reviewed studies and this might have been due to the close chemical and physical relationship between the selected water quality variables and the predicted parameters although the performance of various algorithms seems acceptable noise in the data is always an unavoidable problem and this could be solved by wdt to improve the performance of ml algorithms moreover image recognition technology and the dl model once again has appeared in recent studies and this might indicate the developmental direction of predicting water quality using ml 3 2 mapping groundwater contaminants groundwater contamination is a public concern because of its potential health threats to billions of people globally who rely on groundwater for drinking however the worldwide scale of polluted regions is still unknown due to a lack of sufficient field data that reflects the spatial distribution and concentration of contaminants to solve this problem various research methods have been developed in the past geostatistical statistical interpolation methods such as kriging inverse distance weighting global polynomial interpolation sequential gaussian simulations and the thiessen polygon have been applied to simulate the spatial distribution of contaminants in groundwater bindal and singh 2019 however these methods depend too much on accurate field data which is sometimes unattainable or sparse moreover they do not take consider the spatial dependency of data thus making the performance of these methods unsatisfactory shaji et al 2020 in recent years ml has also been widely applied to predict the distribution of contaminants such as arsenic as fluoride manganese and e coli in groundwater based on analyzing the hidden relationships between contaminants and their direct or indirect influencing factors because of the serious health threat of as to humans and its wide distribution throughout earth s crust and the hydrosphere the prediction of the arsenic spatial distribution in groundwater by ml has been highlighted shaji et al 2020 geologic and geochemical settings are primary factors that affects the occurrence of as in the lithosphere geologic factors such as specific rocks i e mafic and granitic rocks ayotte et al 2006 basalt andesite and rhyolite bretzler et al 2017 and soils i e medium textured soils winkel et al 2011 yang et al 2014 organic rich deposits winkel et al 2008 2011 and holocene fluvial sediments podgorski et al 2017 rodríguez lado et al 2013 yang et al 2014 were reported to be the primary causes of arsenic accumulation moreover geochemical conditions such as the level of soil ph lee et al 2009 podgorski et al 2017 twarakavi and kaluarachchi 2006 yang et al 2012 do yang et al 2012 and other chemical substances including fluoride bromide chloride iron manganese ammonia nitrate nitrite phosphate and sulfate lee et al 2009 yang et al 2012 were also reported to be crucial factors that affect the occurrence of as in groundwater by introducing these relevant environmental factors as variables ml has gained satisfactory performance in predicting the spatial distribution of arsenic in groundwater around the world these nations include the united states anning et al 2012 ayotte et al 2017 2016 2006 frederick et al 2016 kim et al 2011 meliker et al 2008 twarakavi and kaluarachchi 2006 yang et al 2014 2012 china lee et al 2009 rodríguez lado et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 2013 canada dummer et al 2015 india bindal and singh 2019 purkait 2008 pakistan podgorski et al 2017 burkina faso bretzler et al 2017 bangladesh tan et al 2020 cambodia lado et al 2008 and regions such as southeast asia bangladesh myanmar thailand laos cambodia vietnam sumatra red river and mekong deltas cha et al 2016 cho et al 2011 chowdhury et al 2010 hossain and piantanakulchai 2013 lado et al 2008 tan et al 2020 winkel et al 2008 2011 and the global fig 4 a podgorski and berg 2020 in these studies logistic regression lr was the most frequently used algorithm with an accuracy rate of approximately 70 being achieved in corresponding studies however lr has shortcomings in dealing with outliers large feature space and the multicollinearity of variables thus causing problems of under fitting or low accuracy mood and carina 2010 in contrast the cart is immune to the multicollinearity as the decision at each node of the tree is made based on a single feature myles et al 2004 in addition the cart can also solve the problem of outliers and missing data by accommodating surrogates therefore the cart is capable of making more accurate predictions breiman et al 1984 for example the cart model achieved an accuracy of 78 25 in predicting the distribution of groundwater arsenic contamination in bangladesh hossain and piantanakulchai 2013 moreover the cart has also been used to investigate the factors governing elevated groundwater arsenic concentrations across the western and the eastern united states and the significance of aridity and ph was revealed frederick et al 2016 to improve the prediction ability of the cart a weak learner ensemble model called the boosted regression tree brt was recently developed by combining the cart with an adaptive boosting method elith et al 2008 the brt model captured the corresponding major geochemical processes with an accuracy of up to 91 in predicting the probabilities of groundwater arsenic in the central valley of california ayotte et al 2016 in addition the brt also obtained an outstanding performance with an accuracy value of approximately 90 5 in comparison with the lr model and the rf model to predict the groundwater arsenic distribution in bangladesh likewise the rf model delivered an excellent result with a prediction accuracy of 90 in this comparison tan et al 2020 moreover the rf model was also applied to predict the global groundwater arsenic concentrations in this study 52 types of parameters widely covering climate soil geology and topography that were known or hypothesized to be related to the accumulation and release of arsenic were initially selected to be the predictor variables by using a relative importance analysis soil parameters i e topsoil clay subsoil sand ph and fluvisols climate variables i e precipitation actual and potential evapotranspiration and combinations thereof with temperature and the topographic wetness index were ultimately determined as influential variables for the distribution of arsenic podgorski and berg 2020 in addition to arsenic the rf model was also applied to predict the distribution of fluoride in groundwater throughout india fig 4b podgorski et al 2018 the proposed rf model obtained a more accurate prediction with an overall prediction accuracy of 91 podgorski et al 2018 compared to a previous study mapping the distribution of worldwide groundwater fluoride using the anfis method amini et al 2008 in addition to arsenic and fluoride the distribution of manganese in the northern continental united states was also predicted using a brt model with a total accuracy of 83 fig 4c environmental variables such as estimated recharge probability of high fe 100 μg l baseflow index and the mean annual precipitation were demonstrated to have a high relative importance on influencing the probability of high manganese erickson et al 2021 recently a generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss regression model was applied to predict the e coli concentration in wells across ontario canada a dataset containing e coli concentration well characteristics well depth location and hydrogeological characteristics bottom of well stratigraphy and specific capacity from 253 136 independent wells was established to train the gamlss model the regression analysis revealed that bedrock wells drilled in sedimentary and igneous rock were more susceptible to contamination events which was helpful to improve the understanding of aquifer vulnerability to contamination and for assessing water quality white et al 2021 in studies that mapped the groundwater contaminant distribution it was not necessary for the ml model to accurately predict the contaminant concentration at a certain point but to judge whether the contaminant concentration at that point exceeded the threshold e g 10 mg l for as according to the environmental variables therefore the essence of this type of research is classification which explains why the commonly used algorithms are lr and those based on dt the lr algorithm is robust to small noises in the data and will not be specially affected by slight multicollinearity while serious multicollinearity can be solved by combining with l2 regularization therefore lr performed well in dealing with environmental variables influencing the distribution of as even though there are typically interactions among geologic and geochemical variables however lr covers all the features and will suffer performance decline when the feature space becomes larger in contrast the dt model is not limited by the size of the feature space because it can select the optimal feature according to the information gain however the dt model is designed to create branches for the training set thus making it prone to over fitting rf overcomes this shortcoming by randomness in taking samples determining features and building trees therefore dt based models especially rf theoretically perform better than other classification algorithms this is why dt based models have been more popular in recent studies table s5 3 3 classifying water resources to better manage and protect water resources different countries and regions have adopted various standards to classify water resources according to their water quality for example in the national environmental quality standards of surface water gb3838 2002 china water resources are divided into five categories by 24 fundamental wqis each category of water resource has corresponding applications according to its water quality however measuring all wqis listed in the standard is costly therefore it is meaningful to classify water quality with fewer parameters that are more indicative ml is good at evaluating the variable importance to the prediction target and has been applied to identify the key wqis to classify water resources initially anfis was applied to classify the water samples of all major river basins across china using the gb3838 2002 for the classification standards do cod and nh3 n were determined to be the influential variables and 89 59 of the data was correctly classified yan et al 2010 in addition to the gb3838 2002 other standards such as the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme wqi canada and the national sanitation foundation nsf wqi u s were also applied to classify water resources for example the svm the probabilistic neural network pnn and the knn model were applied using the ccme wqi for the classification standards to classify the water samples of the primary aquifer in the tehran plain the results revealed that the knn algorithm was the weakest classifier with the highest total number and the total value of errors in contrast pnn and svm were more appropriate for a small sets of samples and svm presented the best performance with no errors in the calibration and validation phases modaresi and araghinejad 2014 however in another study classifying the water of the tiaoxi river in the lake taihu watershed the classification accuracy of svm fell from 99 56 to 61 60 when the number of indicators was raised from one to five indicating that it was insufficient for svm to treat data with large features li et al 2013 in addition when classifying water samples from the karoon river in iran using nsf wqi as standards the training process of svm was reported to be more difficult and time consuming therefore the pnn model was ultimately recommended for water quality classification due to its synthetic ability to reduce the sampling costs and computation time dezfooli et al 2017 to further identify a better model and the key wqis a more comprehensive comparison was conducted among 10 ml algorithms using big data 33 612 observations from the major rivers and lakes in china using gb3838 2002 as the standard different algorithms were compared using different wqi groups as prediction indicators ultimately two wqi sets do codmn and nh3 n and codmn and nh3 n were identified as the key water parameters the performances of the dt rf and deep cascade forest dcf were shown to be better than other tested algorithms including lr lda svm cart nb and knn fig 5 a chen et al 2020a in addition to water quality spatial or temporal factors can also be regarded as standards in water classification for example water samples from the gomti river were classified in terms of sampling sites spatial and months temporal thereby identifying similar ones in the monitoring network to reduce sampling numbers and the annual sampling frequency in this way a data reduction of 92 5 without compromising the output quality was achieved singh et al 2011 the nonlinear boundary problem caused by a variety of water quality parameters is one of the most distinct features of water resource classification svm relies on a single sample of the boundary to establish the desired separation curve so it can deal with nonlinear decision boundaries therefore compared with the application in mapping groundwater contaminants svm was more commonly used in classifying water resources tables s5 and s6 however training support vector machine on large data is very time consuming and sometimes it is difficult to find a suitable kernel function moreover dt based models exhibited better performance than svm especially in dealing with tasks with large dataset chen et al 2020a as a result dt based models are more suitable in classifying water resources 3 4 tracing contaminant sources the accurate detection of contaminant sources in water environments is a critical step for contamination prevention and remediation many approaches such as the response matrix contaminant transport simulation and tikhonov regularization have been proposed to identify pollution sources singh et al 2004 and ml has also joined in this attempt for instance an mlp was applied to simulate the time series of e coli concentrations in a water system to locate discharge points by inversely interpreting the transport patterns of e coli the source locations where e coli was introduced into the given system were identified with an accuracy of 75 kim et al 2008 moreover in a recent study using the rf model to identify water sample sources from three different river ecosystems the responses of the aquatic microbial community to variations in water quality caused by pollution discharge were considered environmental physicochemical indices microbiological indices and their combination were applied as inputs to train the classifier microbiological indices based models obtained the best predictions by using the abundances of the top 30 bacteria as predictor variables with the increasing development of gene sequencing technology the method proposed in this study provided an economical and rapid approach to trace water sample sources based on the abundance of microbial communities wang et al 2021a recently ml classification programs specifically designed for contamination tracing such as sourcetracker have gained many applications sourcetracker can estimate the relative contribution of a specific potential source to an environmental sink based on the bayesian approach knights et al 2011 to track the sources of fecal bacteria in the lake superior estuary community based microbial source tracking using sourcetracker was conducted the high throughput dna sequencing of a fecal sample collection was used to establish a fecal library that was utilized to understand the fecal microbiome composition as well as the marker specificity and sensitivity in several animals it was found that fecal bacteria in the lake superior estuary were primarily attributed to wastewater effluent and to a lesser extent geese and gull wastes fig 5b brown et al 2017 sourcetracker was also combined with the shotgun metagenomic technique to analyze the sources of antibiotic resistance genes args in an urban stream during wet weather the relative contributions of both microbes and args in the sink environment were estimated using the abundances of microbial taxa and args provided by shotgun metagenomics the results revealed that storm drain outfall waters were the largest contributor of both microbes and args in the urban stream while wash off from streets was the largest contributor of microbes and args in the storm drain outfall water fig 5c baral et al 2018 moreover sourcetracker was applied to analyze the sources of sediment pollution in lake dongting a metagenomic analysis characterized the difference among community compositions of source sediment samples then the specific sources of sediment were identified by sourcetracker based on the inseparable relationships between sediment and adsorbed microorganisms fig 5d zhang et al 2019a additionally the significant relationships between sediment and microbial community were also used to investigate phosphorus sources in lake dongting by analyzing phosphorus source contributions in interconnected river lake systems using sourcetracker a novel framework for nutrient source tracking was established to develop effective management and control strategies for both sediment and eutrophication in river lake systems gu et al 2020 ichnaea is another ml based software utilized to improve tracking the fecal pollution sources in water different from sourcetracker that depends on comparing obtained gene information with a known gene library ichnaea relies on library independent markers and the abundance of fecal indicators or host specific markers for example in tracking the sources of fecal pollution in a given water different fecal indicators and source tracking markers were applied to provide host information ichnaea correctly distinguished the fecal pollution of human or non human from other several origins fig 5e balleste et al 2020 compared with the research directions introduced above there have been fewer studies that have investigated the use of ml in tracing the source of contaminants despite this most of the reviewed studies in this paper adopted ml based contaminant tracing tools e g sourcetracker and ichnaea table s7 and this not only reduced the burden of developing specialized ml models for researchers but also provides an opportunity for researchers who are not proficient in programming and ml to use efficient contaminant tracing tools this provides a reference for lowering the threshold of applying ml for environmental researchers 3 5 evaluating pollutant toxicity toxic pollutants discharged into the natural water environment will inevitably cause harm to aquatic ecosystems and ultimately poison humans through the food chain therefore it is crucial to assess the toxicity of pollutants on aquatic organisms and humans animal testing is one of the primary approaches to evaluate the toxicity of chemical substances however the consumption of animal testing in time money and labor limits its applications in addition the rise of animal protectionism recently exacerbates the difficulty of implementing of animal testing takata et al 2020 to reduce the costs and uncertainties of conventional toxicity evaluation methods high throughput computer technologies have become increasingly popular due to because of their high efficiency and convenience in data driven toxicity assessments the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar builds a quantitative relationship between the structural or physicochemical characteristics of chemicals and their properties or activities including toxicity wu and wang 2018 however it is increasingly difficult for the prior knowledge based qsar method to process tasks with increasing amounts of data thus making it feasible to introduce ml to assist and improve the qsar in predicting the toxicity of pollutants ml qsar approaches collected large amounts of data from the related literature to reveal some universal rules or mechanisms of correlative chemical reactions or processes thus guiding the modeling of similar reactions therefore ml qsar has been widely applied for evaluating pollutant toxicity pesticides are organics that possess high toxicity against various organisms in a recent study five ml models i e dt nb knn rf and svm were severally combined with the qsar to predict the concentration for 50 of the maximal effect ec50 of 639 diverse pesticides against daphnia magna a total of 365 molecular descriptors and seven molecular fingerprints mf were applied to describe the characteristics of the tested pesticides mf referred to a method to encode the molecules into a mathematical format that is readable for computational programming according to their molecular structure the best performance was obtained using the svm model with a prediction accuracy of 0 848 in the test set verification he et al 2019 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are another type of organic that can cause adverse effects on the normal function of homeostasis reproduction and metabolism by disordering the endocrine system of animals and humans lister and van der kraak 2001 a dl based qsar model was developed to classify and predict the toxicological effects of edcs on sex hormone binding globulin shbg and estrogen receptors er datasets assessing diverse qualitative responses of the shbg and er to the tested edcs were collected from the relevant literature the proposed dl qsar model exhibited more satisfactory performance than mlr and svm in simulating the toxicity of edcs with r2 values of 0 86 for shbg and 0 84 for er heo et al 2019 moreover chemicals can produce endocrine disrupting effects by binding to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ pparγ to identify the binding affinity of chemicals with pparγ recently qsar was also utilized to provide molecular descriptors for the construction of ml models wang et al 2021d in addition a dnn based dl model was developed for the toxicity classification of 1317 chemicals to screen for environmental estrogens by introducing a novel three dimensional molecular surface point cloud with electrostatic potential to describe chemical structures this model recognized the active and inactive chemicals at accuracies of 82 8 and 88 9 respectively wang et al 2021c in addition to organics nanoparticles nps are also of concern in environmental toxicology nps are emerging detrimental pollutants that can cause harmful effects such as oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation on aquatic organisms by generating reactive oxygen species due to their specific surface area or photocatalytic activity to predict the toxicity of nps a perturbation theory machine learning ptml based qsar was applied to estimate the genotoxicity of metal oxide nps the genotoxicity information of 78 metal oxide nps against 32 different biological targets was collected as a dataset in addition chemical periodic table based descriptors quantum chemical properties and constitutional descriptors were adopted to describe the tested nps the results revealed that 97 81 of the cases in the test set were correctly classified and the toxicity of nearly all the 78 nps was correctly predicted in the external validation moreover because the proposed ptml qsar model was built based on the relevant physicochemical descriptors it could also provide reliable insights in terms of the genotoxicity mechanisms of nps fig 5f halder et al 2020 in addition to combining with qsar ml is sufficient to predict the toxicity of pollutants independently for example the 50 lethal concentrations lc50 of 400 compounds were predicted using the rf svm and xgboost algorithms based on 12 types of mf the optimal prediction results were achieved using the svm model with an accuracy of 92 2 which was better than those generated by the qsar or ann methods ai et al 2019 additionally the performance of knn svm ann rf adaboost and gbm for predicting 50 hazardous concentrations hc50 of 578 chemical substances were compared the rf model was found to outperform the other models including the qsar and ecosar methods as it could explain 63 of the variability of hc50 hou et al 2020 in the reviewed studies above various environmental variables were required to form the feature space to train the ml model because the predicted objectives e g water quality and classification contaminant distribution and sources were closely related to the surrounding environmental factors however toxicity is an attribute of the pollutant itself to the organisms consequently when training a model to predict the toxicity of chemicals the characteristics of the tested chemical itself are required to form the feature space there were several methods adopted in the reviewed studies to describe the molecular characteristics including molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints and these are also basic research tools for the qsar methods therefore ml models combined with qsar were often used for predicting the toxicity of pollutants and they obtained good prediction results table s8 however with the deepening of studies on the prediction of pollutant toxicity more cutting edge descriptors or patterns such as higher dimensional descriptors and transformer architecture are encouraged to be utilized for pollutant toxicity prediction 4 technology optimization and operation monitoring in engineered water systems engineered water systems refer to a series of processes that consist of taking water from natural waters drinking water purification and distribution sewage or wastewater collection and treatment and water reuse or draining back to nature in modern cities and towns lu et al 2016 effective management of engineered water systems will be of great help in providing clean water to users and preventing ecological pollution to achieve this ml has been applied widely in each link of engineered water systems and related studies and applications of ml are reviewed in this section in addition ml has also been combined with adsorption and oxidation techniques and the characterization analysis of pollutants which are also necessary steps in engineered water systems therefore the applications of ml in modeling adsorption and oxidation and assisting characterization analysis are also reviewed below 4 1 modeling treatment technique lab scale development and optimization are fundamental for actual applications of treatment technologies for drinking water or wastewater in dwtps and wwtps especially for the removal of emerging pollutants requiring specific treatment techniques adsorption and oxidation are common processes in both laboratory experiments and treatment plants to remove pollutants with low biodegradability or biological toxicity accurate simulation of treatment processes is beneficial for optimizing the reactant dosage selecting an appropriate approach or scaling up reactors for practical use some representative applications of ml for modeling the adsorption and oxidation processes to improve the pollutant removal efficiency are summarized below adsorption is a popular process in wastewater treatment especially for removing pollutants that are immune or even noxious to conventional biological treatment processes such as heavy metals and some types of organic matter dabrowski 2001 for example in predicting the removal efficiency of pb ii adsorbed by red mud the adsorbent dosage contact time and ph were used as variables to train an mlp model the results were then compared with the response surface methodology rsm the rsm is a common method used to assess the effects of independent variables on the reaction process yetilmezsoy et al 2009 the results showed that the mlp exhibited a better performance for predicting the lead removal efficiency than rsm did with r2 values of 0 898 for the mlp and 0 672 for the rsm geyikçi et al 2012 moreover the performance of ml could be further improved by combining it with optimization algorithms the genetic algorithm ga is a global and parallel optimization algorithm that can automatically acquire and accumulate the knowledge of a search space during the process of searching thus controlling the searching process adaptively to obtain the best solution álvarez et al 2016 in the adsorption of cu ii by reduced graphene oxide supported nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi rgo magnetic nanocomposites mlp ga performed well with an mae value of 1 13 while the values were 3 64 and 7 44 for the mlp and rsm methods respectively moreover the combination of mlp and particle swarm optimization pso obtained a better prediction with a minimum mae value of 0 46 pso is another optimization algorithm through which global optimization is realized by group iteration based on the interaction among and update of particles each represents a possible solution to a problem kennedy and eberhart 1995 by using the mlp pso to identify and adjust the critical parameters controlling adsorption processes the cu ii removal efficiency was improved by 3 15 and 8 54 compared to that of the mlp ga model and the rsm model fan et al 2017 aside from heavy metals ml was also applied in modeling the adsorption of some types of organic matter for instance triclosan tcs is a broad spectrum chlorinated antibacterial ingredient that possesses high health risks and ecological toxicities the absorption process of tcs by a novel host guest complex mwcnt peg b cd was simulated using the grnn anfis and rsm models in which anfis showed a better prediction ability than the other two models moreover ga was introduced to optimize the experimental design and the maximum tcs removal efficiency was improved to 99 50 azqhandi et al 2019 synthetic dye is another type of organic compound that can cause environmental pollution salleh et al 2011 ghaedi et al summarized in early 2017 the applications of ann models for simulating synthetic dye adsorption their review concluded that four types of ml models including mlp anfis svm and the hybrid with ga or pso optimization were primarily used in previous studies ghaedi and vafaei 2017 the better performance of the hybrid networks with optimization algorithms was confirmed in this review as well as in a study published afterward jun et al 2020 in addition to batch experiments in a single study the datasets generated from the published literature have also been used to develop ml algorithms for instance to train a deep learning neural network dlnn a dataset containing 200 000 sample scenarios was generated from over ten years of studies that used a carbon based adsorbent i e carbon nanotube cnt activated carbon biochar graphene carbonaceous or graphite to absorb anionic cationic and zwitterionic ionizable organic compounds the proposed dlnn model exhibited a strong generalization and forecasting ability for the adsorption of ionizable organic compounds by a wide range of carbonaceous materials with r2 values exceeding 0 98 and 0 91 for predicting the freundlich coefficient kf and the exponent n respectively sigmund et al 2020 another study mined literature for the adsorption data of 165 organic chemicals on 50 biochars 34 cnts 35 granular activated carbons gac and 30 polymeric resins to train a neural network with the poly parameter linear free energy relationships pp lfer the results showed that the proposed nn lfer model accurately simulated the tested adsorption processes with r2 values ranging from 0 86 to 0 91 fig 6 a zhang et al 2020 more notably a graphical user interface was provided in these two studies for those who are not skilled in computer operation this provides great convenience for researchers and practitioners in the fields of water purification and pollution control to select the appropriate sorbent for a given contaminant based on their requirements apart from adsorption processes advanced oxidation processes aops are also effective technologies to treat pollutants with high chemical stabilities and low biodegradabilities the development of aops can be traced back to the late 19th century when h j h fenton discovered that hydrogen peroxide could generate hydroxyl radicals oh catalyzed by ferrous ions to oxidize organic contaminants that then became known as the fenton reaction nguyen et al 2020 since then an increasing number of aop processes have been developed based on various approaches including ozone based ultraviolet uv based photocatalytic electrochemical and physical methods bolton et al 1996 miklos et al 2018 currently ml is also applied to simulate the oxidation processes for removing organic pollutants khataee et al reviewed early applications of ann in modeling homogeneous and heterogeneous nanocatalytic aops that included photocatalytic photooxidative and electrochemical treatment processes the authors confirmed that ann was an effective and simple approach to describe aop processes without considering the complex effects such as the radiant energy balance mass transfer and the spatial distribution of the absorbed radiation khataee and kasiri 2010 here the studies published after or covering content outside the scope of khataee and kasiri s review were summarized to present the applications of more ml models in a wider range of aops for the degrading of antibiotics including amoxicillin ampicillin and cloxacillin with fenton reaction an mlp model was used to simulate the reaction processes in terms of cod removal an accurate prediction of cod removal efficiency was achieved with an r2 of 0 997 additionally the sensitivity analysis showed that the h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was the most influential parameter on antibiotic degradation this result pointed the direction for further improving the removal efficiency elmolla et al 2010 based on the fenton reaction photo fenton processes are developed due to the exposure of the reaction system to solar or uv light both of which can speed up the generation of hydroxyl radicals in fenton reactions kavitha and palanivelu 2004 during the degradation of oil contaminated wastewater by the homogeneous photo fenton uv h2o2 fe2 process the mlp model accurately predicted the oil removal efficiency in addition ph was discovered to be the most influential parameter that affects oil degradation compared with h2o2 fe2 oil concentration or the irradiation time and temperature mustafa et al 2014 in addition to facilitating the fenton process to generate hydroxyl radicals in the photo fenton processes in photocatalytic processes light can also provide photons to excite the lone electron on a semiconductor e g tio2 and zno to create an electron hole pair e h then a series of chain oxidative reductive reactions will occur to degrade the contaminants on the semiconductor surface with electron hole pairs chong et al 2010 during the photocatalytic degradation of m cresol by synthesized mn doped zno nanoparticles under visible light irradiation three types of mlp with different architectures were developed to simulate the reaction processes a comparison between the predicted output and the experimental results showed that ann trained with quick propagation and accurately simulated the degradation with an r2 of 0 9938 moreover the predicted optimal parameter values were used to optimize the reaction condition under which the actual removal efficiency of m cresol was improved to 99 abdollahi et al 2014 in addition to fenton and photocatalytic processes ozonation is another popular aop technology during the degradation of micropollutants mps by the ozonation process the rf model was applied to predict the oxidant exposures and mp abatement during ozonation parameters including ph alkalinity doc and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem data were adopted as input variables ultimately the proposed rf model obtained an accurate prediction with r2 values of 0 798 and 0 772 for o3 and oh exposure respectively and 0 904 for mp abatement fig 6b cha et al 2020 ozonation could also be combined with other processes to enhance the ability of treating pollutants for instance a synthesized dy2o3 tio2 graphite nanocomposite was used to assist the photocatalytic ozonation process for the degradation of textile dyeing in wastewater while o3 h2o2 zr pumice was applied in the decolorization of rhodamine b dye for both studies the mlp models were applied to predict the removal efficiency and achieved excellent accuracy with r2 values of 0 99 and 0 9948 sheydaei et al 2020 shokoohi et al 2020 data mining in aop related studies has also been conducted for instance 446 data points concerning the photo degradation rate constants log k of organic contaminants in a tio2 uv photocatalyst system were collected then an mlp model was trained using a variety of reaction parameters including ultraviolet intensity tio2 dosage initial concentration and the mf information of 78 tested organic contaminants the proposed mlp model showed its reliability and stability as the predicted photo degradation rate constants were in good agreement with experimental data with an average r2 value of 0 873 jiang et al 2020 in another study an mlp was compared with the quantitative structure property relationship qspr method to model hydroxyl radical rate constants k ho using a diverse dataset of 457 water contaminants from 27 various chemical classes with a total of 785 molecular descriptors as variables qspr achieved a simulation of k ho with r2 of 0 724 while the mlp performed better with r2 of 0 847 borhani et al 2016 moreover based on this dataset a dnn combined with mf was developed to predict the k ho of other 46 organic pollutants and obtained a prediction accuracy of 0 724 zhong et al 2020 the accurate prediction of reaction rate constants such as degradation rate constants and hydroxyl radical rate constants will undoubtedly help researchers select appropriate reaction types and reactants as well as to design more efficient aop based water treatment units the summary of tables s9 and s10 indicates that mlp is the most frequently used algorithm for the simulation of adsorption and oxidation reactions especially in earlier studies with small datasets mlp is one of the most basic algorithms of an ann and it can approximate any nonlinear function relation with high precision in addition mlp has strong robustness and fault tolerance to noise datasets additionally after 30 years of development there are many mlp based programs and software that can be used directly by researchers who are not familiar with programming therefore mlp has been widely used in dealing with tasks with smaller dataset and fewer features for example data generated by batch experiments of a single study are reviewed herein in these studies optimization algorithms e g ga and pso played important roles in improving the performance of mlp which could be an experience worth learning however when dealing with tasks with large dataset and many features for example data generated by collecting from similar studies an ann with more hidden layers that is a dnn has a stronger ability to model objects or abstract features and can also simulate more complex models therefore dnns are increasingly popular in studies simulating various reaction processes especially when the computing power of computers is becoming increasingly stronger 4 2 assisting characterization analysis in addition to modeling and optimizing of physical and chemical treatment processes ml has also been applied in assisting characterization analyses by processing data or images produced by various analytical instruments ml approaches can deepen and broaden the analysis information or reduce the workload and improve the efficiency of testers for example to improve the predictability of drinking water disinfection by products dbps parallel factors analysis pca and autoencoders ae were applied to process high dimensional fluorescence data of dbps then a neural network approach was used to identify fluorescence regions associated with dbp formation thus estimating the concentrations of dbps the ae nn was found to provide more accurate predictions for both trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by when compared to common organic measuring methods the approach proposed in this work provided a promising approach to rapidly quantify dbps or other organics by analyzing fluorescence eem data peleato et al 2018 in addition to the direct determination of dbps determining the relationships between the molecular properties of dissolved organic matter dom and their reactivity as potential precursors of dbps is also instructive for dbp control and management for instance fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was used to provide chemical information about dom molecules then the rf model was introduced to identify the molecular reactivity classes based on the chemical properties and peak intensities of the ft icr ms finally a classification approach based on molecular formulas rather than a prior definition of biogeochemical reactivity was applied to discriminate biogeochemical reaction types with this approach potential precursor dom of dbps could be distinguished and specifically removed in drinking water treatment processes fig 6c herzsprung et al 2020 apart from acting as dbp precursors some organic micropollutants mps including various anthropogenic pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals are also a negligible threat to the water quality high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has been commonly used to measure the concentration of mps however the high cost of the stable isotope labeled sil standard used in hrms restricts its economic efficiency in measuring mps to reduce the cost of hrms analysis dl and ml models were proposed to estimate the concentrations of five mps without sil standards including sulpiride metformin benzotriazole tebuconazole and niflumic acid first 35 alternative ms subsets were selected from hundreds of ms results to examine their correlation with the sil standard peak for determining the specific ms subset to replace sil standards then four convolutional neural network cnn models as well as the rf svm and ann models were applied to estimate concentrations of tested mps by analyzing their mass spectrum using the selected ms subset the results revealed that the cnn model resnet 101 achieved the best performance in estimating the concentrations of the five mps with an average r2 value of 0 84 baek et al 2021 the cnn algorithm has also been applied in image recognition to classify and count diatoms on fouled surfaces during short term field exposures the acquired images were saved as two channel red green blue rgb images with the phase contrast images encoded in the blue channel and the fluorescence images encoded in the green one the proposed dl model could analyze the tested images and distinguish diatoms from sand dirt and bacteria on fouled surfaces in only 30 min while it took 180 h of manual counting fig 6d krause et al 2020 microplastics are a type of emerging harmful pollutants derived from the fragmentating of plastics ml approaches have also been applied to identify quantify and classify microplastics for example near infrared hyperspectral imaging nir hsi was used to characterize the intestinal tract content of crucian carps carassius carassius that were exposed to water that contained various tested microplastics an svm classifier was developed to detect and classify the microplastics according to their nir hsi the validation with raman spectroscopy indicated that the svm model performed well in classifying five different microplastics with high precision 97 19 and recall 91 98 values fig 6e zhang et al 2019c moreover the performance of the svm knn and lda algorithms for identifying consumer plastics cp and marine plastic debris mpd was compared four spectroscopic techniques including attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir nir reflectance spectroscopy laser induced breakdown spectroscopy libs and x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf were applied to characterize the tested plastics the comparison results revealed that atr ftir combined with knn classifiers obtained the optimal classification accuracies of 95 and 99 for cp and mpd respectively fig 6f michel et al 2020 to assist the characterization analysis ml is primarily used to deal with data or images generated by various analysis equipment for image processing cnns are undoubtedly a popular and powerful option for data processing it is also divided into a regression prediction e g dbp and mp concentration estimation and a classification prediction e g dbp precursor and microplastic classification based on the above analysis of the regression and classification algorithms it is not difficult to select an appropriate regression or classification algorithm according to the volume of both dataset and features for assisting the characterization analysis with ml the real difficulty is to find the combination point of ml technology and traditional analytical methods 4 3 purifying and distributing drinking water in drinking water treatment plants dwtps conventional treatment processes including coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are designed to supply adequate and safe drinking water to users lapara et al 2015 however demand for high quality drinking water and the gradual deterioration of raw water has brought requirements for more efficient treatment and management in dwtps comprehensive and timely monitoring of water quality is essential for improving the management and automation development of dwtps to this end ml has been applied to simulate water quality in a series of treatment units to provide real time information on the operational conditions of dwtps antanasijevic et al 2013a some of the relevant studies are reviewed below pre oxidation is an optional process according to the quality of the raw water this be conducted prior to the coagulation procedure to oxidize iron manganese or taste and odor substances and control microorganisms or dbp precursors in raw water hu et al 2018 following pre oxidation coagulants are added to coagulate the insoluble contaminants by charging neutralization enmeshment or sweep to form particles and flocs that can be removed during subsequent sedimentation and filtration processes hogg 2000 therefore an appropriate dosage of oxidants and coagulants is critical for the entire drinking water treatment process however the dosage of oxidants or coagulants is determined by complicated factors such as nom turbidity conductivity and temperature heddam et al 2012 therefore there is not a simple empirical approach nor an accepted mathematical model to determine the optimal dosage for both oxidants and coagulants hu et al 2018 currently ml approaches have been applied for interpreting relationships between the raw water characteristics and the demands of oxidants or coagulants for pre oxidizing oxidants an mlp model was developed to predict the kmno4 demand in addition to an accurate simulation of the kmno4 dosing rate the proposed model also found that turbidity had the highest impact on kmno4 demand while the inflow rate had the least fig 7 a godo pla et al 2019 for coagulants the mlp and anfis models were compared for simulating the poly aluminum chloride pac dosage the anfis model well predicted the pac dosage with the pac dosage of yesterday being the only input however in an emergency such as high turbidity caused by a rainstorm the mlp output more stable predictions fig 7b wu and lo 2008 after coagulation the sedimentation process will remove the formed particles and flocs with high density while the filtration process removes the remaining suspended ones an mlp model successfully predicted the post filtration particle counts for three different size ranges in a dual media filter of a dwtp griffiths and andrews 2011 another mlp model was combined with ga optimization to predict the transmembrane pressure of a ceramic membrane microfiltration system the proposed model optimized the settings for filtration time flux and aluminum dosage thus leading to the minimized operational cost with a reduction of approximately 15 strugholtz et al 2008 membrane filtration has gained increasing popularity in water treatment processes due to its strong purification ability however a major problem facing the membrane filtration process is membrane fouling that would reduce the purification ability and shorten the working life of the membrane to monitor and predict membrane fouling an mlp model was used to simulate the membrane resistance during the nanofiltration process the developed model correctly predicted the 93 of the experimental data with an absolute relative error 5 which sufficed to reduce or even replace expensive site specific tests shetty and chellam 2003 in addition an image analysis was also used to investigate membrane fouling a dnn model was trained using thousands of high resolution fouling layer images that were generated using optical coherence tomography characterizing membrane fouling during nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro filtration the proposed dnn accurately reproduced two or three dimensional images of the organic fouling growth with the r2 values of 0 99 in the simulation for both fouling growth and flux decline fig 7c park et al 2019 moreover determining the relationships between the physicochemical properties of nom and their effects on membrane fouling is also helpful to prevent fouling events recently a pca model was used to analyze the relationships between organic matter and their fouling propensity then a clustering analysis was applied to classify the water resources into three groups according to their low intermediate or high fouling potential the results revealed a correlation between strong fouling events and a combined increase of carbon and protein like substances contents in water this conclusion was helpful for membrane users to make a better selection of feed water resources to prevent membrane fouling events teychene et al 2018 following the pre oxidation coagulation sedimentation and filtration processes disinfection is performed to further inactivate microorganisms chlorine is the most common disinfectant because of its high efficiency and low cost and its persistence that meets the residual disinfectant demand however chlorine will interact with nom to generate dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and total organic halide tox and these can act as human mutagens carcinogens and teratogens hamidin et al 2008 an mlp model was developed to simulate the concentrations of these three types of dbps in raw and treated water and accurate predictions were obtained with r2 values ranging from 0 71 to 0 97 fig 7d kulkarni and chellam 2010 in addition to the water quality or operational conditions in various treatment units inside a dwtp a recent study forecasted the overall performance of dwtps across china the authors collected the monthly data of water quality and operational parameters from 45 dwtps nationwide as the dataset by using these data they proposed an mlp model that well predicted the water production variation this work enabled decision makers and dwtp managers to revise production plans in response to different raw water quality water quality standards and market demands zhang et al 2019b after the treatment in dwtps drinking water of qualified quality and quantity will be delivered to consumers via drinking water distribution systems dwdss therefore water quality in dwdss is also important for the entire drinking water supply system discoloration is one of the most disturbing problems facing drinking water producers and users elevated concentrations of fe and mn have been recognized as the major causes of drinking water discoloration speight et al 2019 therefore predicting the accumulation potential of fe and mn is important for preventing discoloration an mlp model was developed to investigate the influence of chemical properties of water on the accumulation behaviors of fe and mn the results showed that free chlorine residual fcr played complex roles in affecting the accumulation of fe and mn concretely a high concentration of fcr would oxidize soluble fe2 and mn2 to insoluble fe3 and mn4 thus aggravating discoloration on the contrary as a disinfectant fcr could sterilize the oxidizing bacteria to prevent biological oxidation of fe and mn thus easing discoloration therefore to achieve the equilibrium of chemical and biological oxidation the fcr concentration was recommended to be 0 8 to 1 8 mg l in the tested dwtss danso amoakoa and prasad 2014 moreover an appropriate amount of fcr can also restrain the growth of other harmful microbial pathogens while high dosing will lead to undesired taste corrosion of the pipe network and an increase in treatment costs therefore it is beneficial to accurately predict fcr in dwdss to achieve a balance among bacteriostasis pleasant water quality and economic cost may et al 2008 in study that applied the grnn model to forecast fcr in a dwds the flow temperature and chlorine residual data were collected as variables then a ga method was used to optimize the division of the dataset into training testing and validation sets the results showed that the grnn model accurately predicted the fcr up to 72 h in advance with an r2 value of 0 9617 fig 7e bowden et al 2006 in addition to the fcr the concentration of dbps in dwdss is another hotspot of concern related to the disinfection process for instance an rbf nn predicted the concentration of nine different haas with an accuracy ranging from 75 to 91 fig 7f lin et al 2020 moreover a bayesian network found that monochloramine had a negative effect while doc and tds exerted positive effects on the formation of thms li et al 2020a in addition to investigating factors that influence the water quality in dwdss ml has also been used to forecast the pipeline failures in the distribution networks for instance contamination events in dwdss can be caused by the injection of any potential pollutants to detect anomalous fluctuations in water quality an mlp model was used to depict the temporal variations in water quality indicators then the bayesian updating rule was recursively applied to analyze the probability of a related contamination event perelman et al 2012 moreover the recursive bayesian rule was also combined with ga optimization to improve the performance of the mlp bayesian by applying adaptive updating dynamic thresholds to optimize the fixed thresholds in the outliers classification module better performance in the detection of contamination events in dwdss was obtained arad et al 2013 in addition pipeline leakage detection and location in dwdss are also of significance for instance the svm and mlp models were respectively used to simulate the leakage size and location by analyzing the time series behavior of flow and pressure in pipe networks makaya and hensel 2016 interestingly shortridge et al compared pipe break events with weekly internet search volume for symptoms of gastrointestinal illness using data mining techniques the results revealed a positive correlation between elevated risk on public health and pipe failures fig 7g shortridge and guikema 2014 this finding emphasized the importance of the application of ml in real time monitoring of the functional integrity of pipelines like water quality predictions in natural water systems the volume of features involved in a water quality simulation for drinking water treatment and distribution is relatively small and water quality parameters are interconnected and affect each other through chemical and physical interactions therefore nn based models e g mlp and anfis are competent for most water quality prediction tasks and have been applied widely table s12 additionally lstm based on time series and image recognition technology based on dl have also been applied for predicting membrane fouling in fact water quality parameters in drinking water treatment and distribution processes are all time series that provide the feasibility for lstm to solve more problems in engineered water systems moreover image recognition technology can also be used to investigate processes of visual changes such as coagulation sedimentation and discoloration 4 4 collecting and treating sewage water sewer networks are designed to collect domestic sewage and industrial and hospital wastewater and transport them to wwtps for contaminant removal therefore the good condition of a sewer network plays an important role in maintaining the sanitation of an urban environment currently ml approaches have been applied to improve the maintenance of sewer networks in sewers fluctuations in flow rate and pressure typically cause debris sedimentation that can gradually form accumulative deposits bottom deposits will reduce the transport capacity of pipelines and form anaerobic conditions to cause corrosion or odor problems bonakdari and larrarte 2006 to monitor the deposition situation and predict the bed loads inside pipelines an anfis model was applied to analyze the effects of sewer geometrical features and flow hydraulic characteristics azamathulla et al 2012 in addition an rf model was also used to predict the self cleansing sewer velocity and this allowed the flow to spontaneously scour and remove deposited sediments from the pipes the results showed the most important variable that determines the self cleansing velocity was the volumetric sediment concentration fig 8 a montes et al 2020 in addition the multigene genetic programming technique was adopted to estimate the particle froude number in large sewers both works were found to be conducive to self cleansing sewer design safari and danandeh mehr 2018 recently an ensemble procedure comprised of the network k function geographically weighted poisson regression and the rf algorithm was applied to analyze the factors that affect sewer pipe blockages explanatory factors such as material type number of service connections self cleaning velocity sagging pipes root intrusion risk closed circuit television cctv inspection grade and distance to restaurants showed significantly varying impacts on the blockage propensity in addition the rf model predicted the blockage recurrence with a 60 80 accuracy in one of the studied cities okwori et al 2021 moreover ml has also been applied in sewer defect detection closed circuit television cctv is also a popular tool for visual inspection of the internal conditions of pipelines however cctv inspection relies heavily on human labor to perform video analysis which is time consuming labor intensive and error prone in this case the svm model based on anomalous frame recognition and classification was proposed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cctv inspections ye et al 2019 moreover better performance in defect recognition and classification was achieved by applying a cnn model which obtained an accuracy of 96 33 fig 8b hassan et al 2019 when transported into the wwtps sewage and wastewater will be treated by a series of treatment processes however increasingly stringent sewage discharge standards have brought demands for more advanced treatment processes and more efficient management in wwtps like dwtps timely and readily obtaining water quality information helps improve the operation and management of a wwtp to achieve this goal ml has been used to simulate the water quality and operation status in various treatment processes in different wwtps in studies applying ml to predict the performance of wwtps water quality indicators such as cod bod phosphorus and ammonia have typically been adopted to evaluate the effluent quality khatri et al 2019 for example an mlp model accurately predicted the effluent tn tp and cod concentrations in small scaled wwtps in korea s rural areas thus realizing real time remote supervising of wwtps lee et al 2008 similarly the ann model was also applied for predicting the effluent quality of processes including a membrane bioreactor mbr giwa et al 2016 a sequential batch reactor sbr khatri et al 2019 and anoxic oxic ao system yang et al 2021 and aerobic granular sludge reactors ags mahmod and wahab 2017 additionally some other algorithms such as svr seshan et al 2014 anfis perendeci et al 2009 and extreme learning machine elm lotfi et al 2019 have also obtained encouraging results for predicting effluent water quality in a combined lysis cryptic and biological nitrogen removal system an mlp model realized an accurate simulation of the process with an r2 value of 0 9513 by real time adjusting the sludge lysate return ratio the optimized system removed greater than 97 99 of the ammonia nitrogen with zero excess sludge production fig 8c yang et al 2021 another study used molecular data to train the svr model to predict the effluent cod ammonia nitrate and the removal of 3 chloroaniline molecular data was generated from a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis targeting the 16s rrna and amoa genes from the sludge community the results showed that the proposed svr model simulated the effluent water quality with r2 values ranging from 0 89 to 0 97 for the tested four parameters seshan et al 2014 similarly metagenomic information was also applied to investigate the strength of associations between args and different bacterial taxa using the rf model that revealed that genera including bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus were primarily the hosts of the selected args sun et al 2021 moreover comparisons among different algorithms have been conducted svm was found to perform better for predicting effluent total ammonia nitrogen tan than ann alejo et al 2018 while it was better for simulating the concentration of kjeldahl nitrogen kn than anfis manu and thalla 2017 the superior ability of svr compared to these two algorithms was also reported when predicting the performance of ags reactors zaghloul et al 2020a in contrast to these comparisons a multi stage model that combined several ml algorithms was developed for predicting effluent cod nh4 n and po4 3 during the first stage of this model the selected variables were input into the ann svr and anfis models then the outputs were combined as inputs for the subsequent ensemble algorithms of which the best outputs were determined to be the final prediction this approach improved the performance of ml models with a small dataset by combining the advantages of different algorithms instead of discussing and selecting the best single one zaghloul et al 2020b in addition to the common indicators mentioned above some other parameters related to wwtps have also been predicted for example the accumulation of fat oil and grease in the sumps of wastewater pumping stations was monitored using cnn based image recognition technology moreno rodenas et al 2021 the sludge volume index svi was predicted to monitor the running conditions of the activated sludge process fig 8d djeddou and achour 2015 in addition the daily flow rates for a wwtp were simulated to better design its treatment units najafzadeh and zeinolabedini 2019 moreover some toxic substances present in effluent have also been predicted for instance in a two phase continuous stirred tank bioreactor cstb used for treating a trichloroethylene tce polluted stream an mlp model simulated the treatment process with excellent accuracy r2 0 9923 fig 8e baskaran et al 2020 the fecal coliform and total coliform removal efficiencies were also predicted with an mlp model in a wwtp using an intermittent cycle extended aeration sequential batch reactor iceas sbr khatri et al 2020 additionally ml approaches have also been used to predict the removal of heavy metals including zinc rahmanian et al 2011 chromium yaqub et al 2019 and mercury yaqub and lee 2020 all of these three studies provided helpful guidance for future research on the removal of other heavy metals fig 8f moreover a dnn and lstm model were compared for predicting the emission of nitrous oxide n2o from a wwtp in denmark a total of 750 000 measurements including the influent flow rate airflow rate temperature ammonium nitrate and do were collected to train the models the higher r2 values 0 94 versus 0 76 indicated that the lstm performed better than the dnn fig 8g a sensitivity analysis revealed that the temperature no3 n and nh4 n were the most important factors contributing to the n2o concentration and n2o emission rate wwtps are a great contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions because of the strong warming effects of n2o therefore this study was beneficial for understanding the production and emission mechanisms as well as developing control strategies for n2o to ensure the sustainable operation and development of wwtps hwangbo et al 2021 recently ml has also been applied to model anaerobic digestion ad processes ad is a popular technique that can convert organic waste and wastewater into biomethane to harvest energy in this study six ml algorithms were combined with microbial gene sequencing techniques to predict the methane yield genomic data and their corresponding operational parameters from eight research groups were used to train the models the rf model achieved an accuracy of 0 82 using the combination of operational parameters and genomic data moreover the importance of microbial community members for methane production was first quantified and the results showed that chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaeta were the top five most influential phyla this study provided valuable information regarding the ad process for monitoring and controlling methane production long et al 2021 according to table s15 mlp was undoubtedly a powerful tool for predicting water quality in sewage or wastewater treatment and has been widely used the past two decades indicating that it was not out of date due to the popularity of other emerging powerful algorithms however it cannot be ignored that emerging technologies bring more possibilities and efficiency to water quality prediction with ml for example dl makes it possible to deal with tasks with large feature spaces while image recognition develops a non data prediction framework moreover the combination of ml and bioinformatics analysis provides richer data and an in depth perspective for predicting biological treatment processes which is lacking in the current studies and will require special attention in future research 5 discussion conclusions and prospects 5 1 discussion and conclusions the above review lists representative applications of ml in fields of water science and exhibits the availability and efficiency of ml for solving problems concerning water utilization and pollution control to better use ml in water related research previous research and algorithm applications need to be analyzed to provide other researchers with common characteristics and rules that can be used for reference according to the classification and analysis of the studies reviewed above the combination of ml with water science was found to be realized primarily in the following manners table 2 i predicting the status of desired contaminants was based on analyzing their interactions with other water related parameters in these studies the ml approaches could be further divided into regression and classification analyses in studies that adopted regression analyses the specific concentration of pollutants was predicted for example they were utilized for predicting the wqis in natural and engineered systems and simulating pollutant concentrations in treatment reaction processes in studies that applied classification analyses the category of the target e g the pollutant concentration range or water quality classification rather than a specific value was determined for example classification analyses were utilized for the mapping of contaminant distributions in groundwater and classifying water resources into different categories according to their water quality ii mining big data from previous studies were used to summarize universal rules and mechanisms thus guiding similar reactions or processes these included evaluating the toxicity of emerging pollutants and applying adsorption or oxidation reactions to remove pollutants or test new reactive materials in this manner the valuable information hidden in an increasing number of scientific studies was systematically delved to provide more theoretical guidance for similar studies iii image recognition technology was applied to analyze the relationships between the image information and physicochemical properties of the research object thus characterizing water quality identifying specific contaminants and detecting equipment faults in engineered water systems this approach improved the efficiency of analysis methods with spectrum or image as output thereby reducing the difficulty in detecting sewer faults in particular this method provides new insights for analyzing water quality in this era when high definition cameras and remote sensing are increasingly popular though ml has been recognized as a powerful tool for solving water related problems different algorithms exhibited different performance in these fields therefore discussing and analyzing the applicability of various commonly used algorithms in different application scenarios is informative for other researchers to choose the appropriate algorithm or further optimize an algorithm to determine the commonly used algorithms the usage frequency of algorithms used in 215 reviewed studies was counted and the usage frequency of these algorithms in water related researches was also retrieved results of both statistical schemes showed that mlp anfis rbf svm lr cart and rf were commonly used ml algorithms while lstm dnn and cnn were popular dl algorithms text s1 therefore the advantages and disadvantages of these ml algorithms in different research directions were compared and analyzed and the results are briefly presented in table 2 in general mlp was the most widely used algorithm in dealing with both regression and classification tasks especially in earlier studies with small volume of data and features ml achieved satisfactory performance for predicting pollutant concentrations in natural waters chemical reaction processes and water or wastewater treatment however mlp suffers the problem of a long training time slow convergence and a local optimum caused by gradient decline although it has a strong ability in fitting nonlinear problems and robustness to data noise in contrast rbf nn makes up for these disadvantages of mlp and even has higher approximation accuracy and generalization ability however as the volume of training samples increase the number of hidden layer neurons of rbf nn will be higher than that of mlp which will increase the complexity and computation burden of the rbf network recently dl has also been applied in dealing with problems in water science due to the introduction of more hidden layers dnn has stronger abilities in nonlinear learning feature extraction and fault tolerance consequently dnn was found to be used to handle tasks with a large volume of data and features especially studies that applied data mining from the literature additionally rnn and lstm can deal with time series data moreover through the switch of the cell gate lstm realizes the function of long time memory thus solving the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion during the training process therefore lstm can solve more problems in water science as the data in many fields of water related research are time series data although the dl models seem to possess a powerful ability to solve nearly all the tasks concerning water science they still must face the black box nature which is an unavoidable problem for all nn based algorithms in contrast the dt based models are more interpretable as they can show the importance of different features to generate understandable rules in addition dt based models can quickly solve multi classification tasks with large volume of features this is the advantage over lr and svm the former of which cannot deal with tasks with nonlinear and large feature spaces and it is time consuming during training and sometimes difficult to find a suitable kernel function for the latter therefore cart especially the rf models have been widely used for handling both regression and classification tasks such as mapping groundwater contaminants and classifying water sources this is because rf overcomes the problems of over fitting and data imbalance and it is robust to the loss of features based on the above comparison and analysis of the several commonly used algorithms recommendations on the selection of algorithms were made according to their applicability to different scenarios table 2 for regression tasks with a small volume of data both mlp and rbf nn are competent without regard to the complexity of the model rbf nn may be better due to its higher ability of generalization fitting and convergence for classification tasks the cart model is more suitable for data with a balanced sample size for each category because the information gain is partial to the feature with more data thus leading to over fitting otherwise the rf model is more qualified especially for tasks with a large volume of features moreover for those tasks with a huge amount of data dnn and lstm are more competent 5 2 prospects the development of ml in water science is still at an initial stage however ml has shown its feasibility and efficiency in solving complex environmental problems in many studies to make ml technology more accessible to environmental researchers thus solving research problems in the water science field more efficiently joint efforts in terms of algorithm development data curation and interdisciplinary cooperation are required i as analyzed above there was not a perfect algorithm for all tasks necessary for the water science field algorithms with simple structures typically have defects in performance e g mlp and cart while those with excellent performance often possess complex structures thus increasing the difficulty of programming and the hardware cost of operation e g dnn therefore according to the characteristics of the data in water related research such as a moderate amount of time series data algorithms with simple structures high performance and strong interpretability are encouraged to be developed moreover the graphical user interface e g the graphical user interface designed for modeling adsorption processes or user friendly data analytics tools e g sourcetracker designed specifically for water related studies can also reduce the cost and difficulties of researchers encounter when using ml techniques ii data mining is helpful to collect data from similar studies to form big data thus revealing underlying rules or providing a data basis for other big data researchers however in traditional research areas including water science data from other studies are often difficult to obtain open data and the sharing of data are common ways to provide rich data sources for datasets in the application of ml however open source data in water science field seems to be insufficient compared to other fields where ml techniques have been applied earlier and utilized more in depth e g drug research vamathevan et al 2019 biological research camacho et al 2018 and solid earth geosciences bergen et al 2019 for which many open source data platforms have been developed therefore the concept of open source data and the sharing of data is expected to be accepted and practiced more widely in the water research community and researchers are encouraged to share their research data without any conflict of interest or legal and regulatory restrictions iii the programming and implementation of ml models depend on the researchers computer skills and mastery of algorithms which are difficult for most water researchers to grasp in a short amount of time to lower the threshold for researchers to use the ml technologies interdisciplinary communication and cooperation with data researchers are beneficial under this framework of cross disciplines data researchers can provide professional suggestions on data processing and modeling while water researchers can interpret the output of the model with expert knowledge moreover with the help of data researchers some cutting edge algorithms can also be used to solve problems in water science field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of
