2450,roughness is the key parameter for surface runoff simulations this study aims to determine robust manning resistance coefficients n on the basis of consecutive artificial rainfall experiments on natural hillslopes available in literature obtained at 22 different sites with different degrees of vegetation cover and type the manning resistance coefficient is particularly important in the context of two dimensional 2d hydraulic heavy rainfall simulations since there is a wide range of possible resistance values available leading to significantly different results regarding the accumulation of surface runoff especially for shallow water depths the planning of flood protection structures is directly affected by these uncertainties this work also improves the knowledge between roughness and the shape of the hydrograph allowing a better calibration of infiltration models as flow velocity water depth and infiltration rate were not observed during the rainfall experiments only the outflow of the test field and rain intensity are known for this purpose a framework was developed to parameterize shallow water depth 1 cm dependent roughness coefficients to test the robustness of the framework three different formulations of depth dependent roughness and a constant manning coefficient are used by comparing the measured discharge under different rainfall intensities with simulations in a 2d hydraulic model we identified a strong dependency of manning s n on the degree of vegetation cover and type as well as an influence of consecutive rainfall events this finally leads to a more robust parameterization of near surface roughness for hydrodynamic modelling which is particularly important for the simulation of heavy rainfall events graphical abstract keywords depth dependent roughness coefficients flow resistance artificial rainfall experiments hydraulic rainfall runoff modelling surface runoff flash floods data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction flash floods resulting from torrential rainfall events can cause great damage and loss of human lives as numerous events in central europe in recent years have demonstrated kaiser et al 2020 while climate change is potentially increasing the intensity and frequency of such events maps depicting the expected flooding risk caused by heavy rainfall are becoming increasingly important for communities sañudo et al 2020 bulti and abebe 2020 the use of detailed two dimensional 2d hydraulic models is the most common and accurate method for risk mapping rai et al 2010 the original purpose of hydraulic 2d models is to simulate fluvial flood events where the river overflows its bank meanwhile the direct generation of surface runoff within a hydraulic model considering hydrological processes like infiltration excess has become also a standard use case zhang and cundy 1989 fernández pato et al 2016 savant et al 2019 david and schmalz 2020 using hydraulic 2d models for heavy rainfall simulations the precipitation is distributed over the model domain this means that an individual amount of rain is added to each mesh node or cell depending on the infiltration approach subsequently the discharge concentration in flow paths caused by the surface topology is determined by solving the shallow water equations this enables the creation of accurate flood maps showing endangered critical infrastructure or buildings in contrast to fluvial flood simulations these simulations can show hazards far away from water bodies caused by short and intense rainfall events beside the hydrologic parameters the flow resistance expressed by the surface roughness is the key parameter for 2d hydraulic surface runoff simulations rai et al 2010 barros and colello 2001 the definition of the term roughness varies depending on the discipline and question it can represent surface or flow properties or simply serve as a model parameter the lack of a uniform parameterization and scale dependency complicates the subject since no single surface property can be defined as the roughness roughness primarily reflects the accuracy of the measurement technique and the motivation for parameterization smith 2014 the obstructive effects of roughness determine the velocity of the runoff on the surface and therefore the formation speed of a flood wave in general a smooth surface leads to a more rapidly rising flood wave while peak discharge can be significantly lower on rough surfaces sanz ramos et al 2021 vegetation coverage has the most significant effect on near surface runoff processes and surface resistance studies differentiate by vegetation type flexibility degree of submergence cantisani et al 2014 or vegetation stem diameter zhang et al 2021 a distinction is also often made between submerged and partially submerged vegetation kim et al 2012 wu et al 1999 roughness implies the effects on flow by crop ridges rocks tillage and the frictional drag over the surface engman 1986 romkens and wang 1986 distinguish surface roughness into four categories the first category includes microrelief variations in the range of 1 2mm as the friction drag of the surface the second type results from non directional clumping of the soil as it arises for example from tillage in the range of 100 to 200 mm the third class represents systematic or directional differences such as plough tracks the fourth type contains non directional variations of the terrain with elevation differences the increasing availability of high resolution terrain data often with a horizontal resolution of less than 1 m and a vertical accuracy of a few centimetres allows to depict most of the topographic complexity directly from the terrain model the roughness parameterization has to represent all processes which lie beyond the terrain resolution as different flow processes occur at different topographic scales so roughness parameterization has a scale dependency and parameters have to be chosen in dependency of the computational mesh resolution lane 2005 horritt et al 2006 the roughness of arable land is particularly difficult to standardize huang and bradford 1992 sepaskhah and bondar 2002 huang and bradford 1992 demonstrated this with laboratory tests experimenting with different rain intensities and successive rain events after an initial rainfall event of 63 mm soil was crusted and roughness reduced after a simulated rain event of 92 mm thereafter microrills developed and the visible roughness of the surface increased due to its stronger structuring whereby the roughness relevant to the runoff had decreased due to a channelling of the runoff the most common representation of roughness is done by the use of the manning parameter n manning 1891 as a value between 1 and 0 there are widely accepted and generally valid roughness coefficients for larger flow depths such as those that occur during fluvial floods chow 1959 apart from this the roughness at shallow water depths is subject to greater uncertainties especially surface runoff simulations require a reliable choice of roughness parameters due to the high sensitivity of the results gaur and mathur 2003 sauer and ortlepp 2021 and thus possibly to errors in risk assessment of flash floods many studies tried to find a relation with dimensionless parameters between reynolds number or froude number and vegetation or slope chow 1959 emmett 1970 wu et al 1999 díaz 2005 meanwhile the use of water depth dependent roughness relations rather than a single value representing the range of possible roughness effects for the simulation of surface runoff has become a standard in engineering gaur and mathur 2003 rai et al 2010 mügler et al 2011 fraga et al 2013 in practice the application of roughness coefficients is a definition of a water depth dependent relationship as it is for example the case for the 2d model hydro as 2d hydrotec 2022 these models originally developed for river hydraulics make use of the manning formula which is also the most common and widely used approach to quantify flow velocity díaz 2005 díaz 2005 divides the research concerning the manning formula in two fields the first type tries to develop new or extend existing formulas for the calculation of flow resistance as the formulation of the manning formula is based only on empirical assumptions jarrett 1990 the second type tries to determine better or more exact coefficients valid for specific use cases and conditions wu et al 1999 lawrence 2000 wilson and horritt 2002 ding et al 2004 in this study we contribute to the second type of research studies based on existing artificial rainfall experiments ries et al 2020 we derive empirical parameters describing depth dependent roughness relations valid for the micro topography and different land use types we use four different formulations describing roughness in order to compare their suitability for the proposed task combined with further data from literature this leads to a better more universal representation of overland flow in 2d hydraulic models finally this allows a more accurate assessment of flash flood risks and therefore a better planning of counter measures to achieve this goal an idealized hydraulic 2d model is applied representing the test sites of the artificial rainfall experiments by examining all possible parameter combinations to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between observed and simulated discharge and a comparison with results from other experiments a range of valid values is determined in addition the framework offers a way to determine roughness coefficients knowing only discharge rainfall rate and slope of the test sites thus avoiding complex measurements of water level or velocity 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial rainfall experiments artificial rainfall experiments are one option to examine roughness coefficients on real surfaces outside a laboratory ries et al 2019 and seibert et al 2011 for example provide collections of these experiments in most cases sprinkling experiments use a constant rain intensity e g 70 mm h which corresponds to a statistical return interval for a local heavy rainfall event e g a 100 year event the water is sprayed via a sprinkling system over a defined period of time e g 1 h onto the test field simultaneously the outflow is measured at the lower boundary of the test field as the volume of water running downstream as surface runoff in a high temporal resolution the data set provided by ries et al 2019 for instance includes the entire hydrograph with ascending and descending parts whereas the collection of seibert et al 2011 does not include the descent of the hydrograph sprinkling experiments with tracers tatard et al 2008 mügler et al 2011 try to circumvent the problem of lacking flow velocity data by measuring the propagation rate of a tracer substance a similar approach with a sprinkling setup to simulate rainfall has been conducted by katz et al 1995 using fluorescent dye and a slow motion camera system in an artificial channel to estimate flow velocities however these approaches focused mainly on one test site and did not cover a greater variety of surface properties this lack of a sufficient quantity of data does not allow a comparison of multiple land cover types and therefore artificial rainfall experiments with flow velocity measurements are not considered in this study one of the most comprehensive data sets available for germany is provided by ries et al 2019 the artificial rainfall experiments took place at 23 locations in baden wuerttemberg germany with different vegetation and soil conditions on a defined field of 10 m length six experiments were conducted on each field each with different rainfall duration intensity and initial soil moisture the following information was logged in a one minute time interval which is relevant for our study discharge at the lower end of the test field rain intensity on the test field soil moisture at three different depths in the test field vegetation density 0 100 height m 0 0 3 m land use pasture arable land and slope 9 32 of each site have been documented a detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in ries et al 2020 2 2 the partitioning of roughness and infiltration the basic idea is to use the shape of the hydrograph to infer the roughness of the surface the shape of the hydrograph is generally dependent on precipitation rate infiltration rate and roughness as precipitation rate p mm h is constant the partitioning of runoff q mm h infiltration f mm h and roughness is the key for determining manning s n sm 1 3 the relevant fluxes can be seen in the schematic drawing of a fictive sprinkling experiment in fig 1 the partitioning of runoff and infiltration changes during the rainfall experiment this behaviour is not only caused by changes in soil moisture but also from rainfall induced surface sealing assouline 2004 the impact of raindrops causes surface sealing by the destruction of soil aggregates which reduces the soil porosity by siltation mcintyre 1958 farres 1978 also chemical dispersion depending on the chemistry of the soil affects sealing agassi et al 1996 soil sealing is a crucial process for surfaces with low vegetation cover as the soil becomes less and less permeable caused by rapidly transforming soil surface features with persistent or consecutive rain events bresson and boiffin 1990 ribolzi et al 2011 in addition ribolzi et al 2011 stated that high intensity rain on surfaces with a slope gradient less than 30 which is the case for the data leads to less permeable erosion crusts while higher slopes cause more permeable structures consequently the change of infiltration rate over time is a non linear curve and must be considered for each rainfall experiment individually most equations describing the infiltration process are monotonically decreasing functions based on power laws or exponential decays assouline 2013 to describe the infiltration process of the artificial rainfall experiments a hortonian depletion curve horton 1933 beven 2004 is used to calculate the maximum possible infiltration rate f m a x of the rainfall experiment by fitting the equation to the difference of rainfall and observed discharge the minimum possible infiltration rate f m i n can be estimated when the hydrograph is nearly constant the actual infiltration rate f lies between the maximum and minimum infiltration rate which implies that f can only be determined when f m a x f m i n the empirical horton equation decreases f m a x exponentially from its initial value f 0 to its final one f c using the decay coefficient α eq 1 1 f t f c f 0 f c e α t the variables of the horton function are calculated with the non linear least square method as proposed by esen 1987 to fit the function eq 1 to the observed data the applied method using the levenberg marquardt algorithm is implemented in the minpack 1 package moré et al 1980 a horton curve is displayed exemplarily in fig 1 as maximum possible infiltration rate f m a x the schematic artificial rainfall experiment can be separated in three time segments ascent of the hydrograph nearly constant discharge and descent of the hydrograph during the ascent of the hydrograph the infiltration cannot be determined unambiguously orange area in fig 1 as the physical process of soil saturation is not represented by the empirical horton approach consequently the impact of manning s n on the shape of the hydrograph cannot be separated from infiltration since q is a function of f manning s n and precipitation p eq 2 2 d q d t 0 a n d q t 0 t t 1 f f n p a constant wetting rate leads to a gradually increasing q and converges in many observed cases to a steady rate the observed soil moisture data not shown shows also a plateau leading to the conclusion that the maximum saturation has been reached the depression storage is filled and infiltration into the soil is constant infiltration before the termination of artificial rainfall f m i n is in many cases equivalent to the equilibrium infiltration rate f c resulting in a constant surface runoff so infiltration is clearly predictable for these cases as a difference between precipitation p and discharge q but no inference on n can be made in this time segment as roughness has no visible effect on the hydrograph because runoff is nearly constant eq 3 3 d q d t 0 a n d q t 1 t t 2 f f c p finally the third time segment begins with the cessation of rainfall resulting in the descent of the hydrograph the decreasing q is a function of f and n eq 4 4 d q d t 0 a n d q t 2 t t e f f n a nearly constant infiltration rate can be extrapolated by using the fitted horton function for the falling limb segment of the hydrograph consequently the impact of n on the shape of this segment of the hydrograph can finally be separated from infiltration allowing a clear determination of roughness in addition high roughness coefficients cause a slower ascending hydrograph this effect can be used to verify the estimated n excluding roughness coefficients leading to a simulated slower rise of the hydrograph simultaneously applying the minimum infiltration rate f min in the model eq 5 5 q s i m t 0 t t 1 f p n f min the collection of rainfall experiments provides a large variety of different hydrographs with maximum discharge ranging from 5 to 150 mm h no meaningful roughness can be derived from experiments with very low discharges to recalculate the observed hydrograph a comparatively much higher roughness would be needed partly even with a manning value greater than 1 this is presumably caused by continuous drainage of soil and vegetation distorting the hydrograph for this reason experiments whose discharge does not exceed 15 mm h are generally excluded and discharge values below 5 mm h are not considered in the comparison of simulated and observed discharge 2 3 numerical hydraulic model for one dimensional and stationary conditions discharge q m 3 s m can be calculated under consideration of roughness as followed according to the converted manning equation eq 6 manning 1891 6 q 1 n h 5 3 s f during the artificial rainfall experiments only q has been measured as integral value and the energy slope s f is known as a property of the respective site so manning s equation does not allow an unambiguous calculation of q as it can be determined with different roughness coefficients n and their respective flow depth h in addition the instationary distribution of flow depth fig 2 cannot be represented by the manning equation as well as the ascent and descent of the hydrograph due to water accumulation to the end of the experimental site so the flow processes must be calculated by a two dimensional approach calculation of instationary flow on a surface is based on the two dimensional depth averaged flow equations shallow water equations they integrate the three dimensional continuity equation and the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for incompressible fluids over the water depth by assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution pironneau 1988 the shallow water equations in compact vector format are defined as followed 7 δ w δ t δ f δ x δ g δ y s 0 with 8 w h u h v h 9 f u h u 2 h 0 5 g h 2 v h δ u δ x u v h v h δ v δ x 10 s 0 g h s f x s b x g h s f y s b y 11 g v h u v h v h δ u δ y v 2 h 0 5 h 2 v h δ v δ y h h z which represents the water level as the sum of water depth h and elevation of the surface z u and v are the velocity components in x and y direction the source term s involves the friction slope s f with the components s f x and s f y and the bed slope s b x s b y the slope of the surface bed slope is defined by the gradient of bed level z in x and y direction 12 s b x δ z δ x s b y δ z δ y the friction slope s f is calculated with the darcy weisbach equation 13 s f λ v v 2 g d with the manning equation the friction factor λ is determined 14 λ 6 34 2 g n 2 d 1 3 g is defined as earth gravity and d 4 r h y is representing the hydraulic diameter applying the 2d shallow water equations the hydraulic radius r h y is equivalent to the water depth h using the finite volume method the shown equations provide depth and flow velocity at each node of the computational mesh in a temporal resolution for our study we used the hydrodynamic model hydro as 2d hydrotec 2022 the model hydro as 2d is widely used in germany and is applied both for the simulation of fluvial flood events and for surface runoff caused by heavy rainfall the discharge calculation is carried out via the finite volume method based on a mesh consisting of triangles and quadrilaterals the use of a combined mesh of triangles and quadrilaterals allows an easier adaptation to the topographical and hydrodynamic conditions of the respective task in a standard use case the structure of the hydraulic model is based on laserscan data the model representing the test sites consists of an inclined plane whose slope is specified in the database fig 2 as the test sites are homogeneous areas microtopography is not considered as height variation in the computational mesh the surface roughness is modelled with water depth dependent or constant manning coefficients on each node so all flow affecting parameters like microtopography vegetation resistance splash effects of raindrops or rill formation due to erosion must be represented by the roughness coefficient corresponding to the real experiments the surface of the model has a length of 10 m the width of the site is not relevant because flow is measured in discharge per metre the selection of a sufficient number of nodes has been done by a sensitivity analysis leading to an optimal node spacing of 25 cm this is the key to exclude an influence of model discretization on the results the rain is modelled via so called source nodes as a spatial homogeneous addition of water the infiltration is modelled similarly to the rain as negative source nodes if necessary in a time dependent manner the advantage of this procedure in comparison to a simple reduction of the amount of rainfall is that the infiltration can be active while or after the rainfall at the lower end of the surface the discharge and the water level is logged for further analysis 2 4 reducing the solution space each experiment leads to a solution space representing several acceptable roughness functions with minimal difference in quality of the results comparing the solution spaces of experiments with similar properties overlapping areas can be obtained leading to the assumption that there must be a smaller general valid solution space three steps are now taken to reduce the solution space the first step is to exclude smooth low n roughness relations based on the ascending hydrograph as described in section 2 2 in the second step the individual experiments of one site are compared with each other to find similarities that are valid for all finally the remaining solution space can be compared to sites with similar properties to further reduce or verify the results fig 3 shows the described process schematically the method followed in this study for determining the roughness coefficient is the iterative testing of different roughness values and the subsequent comparison of the hydrographs using a statistical performance measure like the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the identified roughness coefficients with a high nse score can be compared to the other experiments with different rain and infiltration rates of the same test site if all experiments lead to a similar roughness value the result can be considered as robust solution 2 5 roughness functions three depth dependent formulations of near surface roughness and one depth independent approach with different advantages are used to parameterize the roughness function to prove the robustness of the presented framework 2 5 1 constant roughness coefficients the use of constant depth independent roughness coefficients is the most straightforward method for this use case no parameterization is needed but the manning values can be iterated directly within the framework 2 5 2 exponential function thus better fitting shapes of the hydrographs and a universally valid roughness can only be modelled with depth dependent roughness relationships this assumption is confirmed by many authors wu 2008 fraga et al 2013 rai et al 2010 mügler et al 2011 fu et al 2019 to describe depth dependent roughness we parameterize n as a reciprocal exponential function of h defined by the variables c and d eq 15 15 n 1 c e d h the possible representation of either a constant roughness d 0 or a depth dependent d 0 decreasing roughness with increasing water depth is the advantage of this function this allows to test all possible combinations of the variables c and d in a reasonable range of values and to compare the observed with the simulated falling limb of the hydrograph the reciprocal is used to achieve a better distribution of roughness functions as functions with a low n would otherwise be underrepresented if c and d are iterated linearly preliminary test simulation showed that the differences in the simulated hydrograph of a linear varied n with high roughness values 0 6 to 1 0 are less pronounced than with a smaller n 0 2 to 0 4 the exponential function has no direct link to manning s equation but covers all possible variations of decreasing roughness with increasing water depth 2 5 3 kadlec s power law experimental investigations studying the shallow overland flow found a relationship between vegetative drag and roughness coefficient kadlec 1990 wu et al 1999 tsihrintzis et al 2001 gaur and mathur 2003 on the basis of these findings jain et al 2004 simplified kadlec s power law for the application in a distributed rainfall model eq 16 16 n n 0 h h 0 ϵ with the limits h h 0 and n n 0 for h h 0 h 0 defines minimum flow depth beyond which the roughness coefficient n 0 is assumed constant the exponent ϵ represents the influence of vegetation drag this formulation of a depth dependent roughness function is well established and has been used in several studies mügler et al 2011 simons et al 2014 özgen et al 2015 the formulation is opposite to the exponential function since it emphasizes low roughness more strongly for a linear iteration of n 0 the simplified power law can result in a decreasing or increasing function and has therefore a wider range of possible solutions 2 5 4 fu s equation a newer formulation describing depth dependent roughness based on the manning equation has been provided by fu et al 2019 later the equation has been adapted to be valid for litter cover ding et al 2021 fu conducted several laboratory experiments for a vegetation cover from 0 to 30 with artificial plants with a height of 12 cm fu s equation leads to a nearly constant roughness for low vegetation cover and an increasing roughness with higher water depths for a higher vegetation cover the equation calculates manning s roughness on stem covered slopes and shows that the influence of plant stem resistance flow resistance from vegetation and boundary resistance depends on water depth and plant basal cover c v c v is defined as the ratio between the area covered by stems a s and flume bed a f eq 17 17 c v 100 a s a f c v is regarded as equivalent to the plant coverage documented by ries et al 2020 as no further information about the methodology is provided the coefficients a and b vary with vegetation type eq 18 as provided by fu et al 2019 18 n a b 1 e 0 061 c v 1 668 h 0 604 0 710 e 0 219 c v the solution space of fu s equation is limited because the shape of the function is mainly defined by the vegetation coverage the advantage is that this reduces the necessary number of possible iterations to find a solution but this could also result in a lack of accuracy fu s equation has been determined with relatively low stem covers 30 and flow depths larger than 0 5 cm so the validity for higher vegetation covers the transferability of fu s stem cover to vegetation cover as used in the data of ries et al 2019 and lower flow depth needs to be verified 3 results the calibration of the three equations leads to multiple water depth dependent roughness functions and therefore to differing hydrographs similarity of the resulting falling limb of the simulated hydrograph with the measured one is represented by the nse as a value between 0 and 1 3 1 the most robust result the result is a heat map where each raster cell stands for one depth dependent roughness relation and the quality of its comparison to the descending part of the hydrograph 22 sites out of 23 are useable for simulation table 1 since no runoff could be generated at site 10 with any artificial rainfall experiment due to high soil porosity for each site up to six matrices depending on the number of useable experiments are generated the number of useable experiments depends on the successful generation of surface runoff in many cases the first experiment or experiments with a short rainfall duration did not produce any runoff because soil moisture could not sufficiently build up fig 4 exemplarily shows the matrices of three out of six experiments simulated for site 9 100 veg cover the crosses in the heat maps demonstrate the deviation from the highest nse value and are an indicator for the ambiguousness of the results of one experiment thus coherent and similar areas with crosses indicate robust solution spaces the more crosses appear the more possible parameter combinations lead to a good result to reduce the number of solutions an overlay of the results of all experiments of one site is performed by calculating the minimum nse values of each parameter combination fig 5 the lowest common denominator representing a solution which is most acceptable for all experiments can be found in order to verify the selection of the minimum as best possible solution the optimum solution space is compared with the optimum of other statistical moments such as mean median standard deviation or coefficient of variation not shown all the statistical moments of nse lead to similar results as well as the simulated hydrographs resemble to the observed ones but the minimum is considered as the most robust solution between the different experiments taking the mean values for instance would not assure that all the experiments are contained in the optimum solution space on site 9 basically all four approaches lead to a range of n values between 0 5 and 0 7 fig 5 the exponential function and kadlec s power law result in similar optimum roughness functions black lines with n values decreasing with h but the solution space grey functions of kadlec s power law covers also the optimum solution derived with fu s equation the formulation of fu s equation determines an increasing n with flow depth for higher vegetation coverage due to its predefined properties and does not allow much variation for full vegetation coverage accordingly all a b combinations generate similar results as the functions in fig 5 overlap each other the optimum depth dependent functions differ to a minor degree from the constant roughness as the flow process takes in this case completely place in partially submerged vegetation therefore also the constant approach results in a high nse value while the overall best fitting function leads to a slightly decreasing n with h the resulting parameters together with the most important properties of their sites are listed in table 1 to enable a straightforward comparison of the results the n value of each function at a depth of 4 mm is listed to indicate the limitation of the respective function the highest flow depth h achieved during the numeric simulation is also presented since the maximum flow depth of some functions e g sites 13 20 and 23 lies significantly below 4 mm they can nonetheless be seen as valid as they show a nearly constant n which can be extrapolated to 4 mm 3 2 numerical and experimental hydrographs the comparison between the observed and the simulated falling limb of the hydrographs obtained from applying the four roughness approaches in the hydraulic model in fig 6 lead to nearly identical results nse values from 0 94 to 0 99 the respective minimum nse is equivalent to the optimum value derived from the overlay in fig 5 the nse values of the single experiments correspond to the values presented in fig 4 and the position determined by the optimum value the simulation has been conducted with the in section 2 2 described minimum infiltration rate f m i n the criteria for an acceptable shape of a simulated hydrograph is defined as followed first the rise of the simulated hydrograph must be higher or equal to the observed q since infiltration is modelled as the minimum obtained from fitting the difference of precipitation and discharge to the horton function second the simulated descent of the hydrograph must fit to the observed data some deviation at the lower end is tolerable as this is assumed to be caused by soil or vegetation draining effects which cannot be mapped by the roughness formulation the example of site 9 shows that these criteria can be met as well as high nse coefficients can be achieved independently of the applied roughness formulation 3 3 quality and variability of the results the quality of the results is shown in fig 7 comparing the achieved nse values of the four approaches high nse values are achieved if the conducted rainfall experiments resulted in similar hydrographs while low nse values are caused by diverging discharge measurements site 19 is a negative exception because of extremely dense vegetation so that even with a manning value of 1 the hydrograph cannot be modelled correctly considering all sites it can be stated that kadlec s power law gives the best results on average since this formula reflects best the variability of the vegetation with increasing or decreasing roughness the exponential function also achieves a high level of consistency unless on sites where the roughness is strongly increasing with flow depth e g site 8 and 16 fu s equation tends to result in lower nse values since the adaptability of the formula is limited significantly lower results compared to kadlec s power law are achieved on sites where roughness clearly decreases with water depth e g sites 22 and 23 at the same time less iterations are necessary to obtain reasonable results since vegetation coverage is directly considered in the formulation executing a higher number of iterations with a finer parameter sampling interval could not improve the results significantly the quality of the results of constant n varies strongly with the properties of the respective site sites with a dense vegetation tend to have a less pronounced depth dependent roughness and therefore a low difference to the other approaches is achieved e g sites 12 14 and 22 in contrast to sites with low or no vegetation cover the nse values achieved with the constant n decrease significantly compared to the depth dependent approaches e g sites 5 8 and 23 the variation of roughness is shown in fig 8 by comparing roughness at a depth of 4 mm with the results derived with kadlec s power law larger deviations occur mainly at the upper end of the scale in particular the comparison with fu s equation shows a larger variance due to the lower adaptability of the formula the variation compared to the exponential function is lower as both approaches lead in many cases to similar solutions it is noticeable that the constant roughness has the smallest deviations this can be explained by the considered the water depth of 4 mm since the depth independent approach tends to result in a mean roughness value 3 4 correlation of parameters and site characteristics in comparison to the other approaches the strongest correlation between the parameters and vegetation cover could be ascertained with kadlec s power law fig 9 shows the identified n 0 ϵ values calculated with kadlec s power law with a maximum deviation of 1 of their optimum in dependency of the degree of vegetation coverage low vegetation cover corresponds clearly with a low n 0 and an ϵ value approaching zero resulting in a nearly constant roughness function a more differentiated result is obtained focusing on medium vegetation cover 30 60 overall the roughness function tends to become smoother with increasing flow depth corresponding to a negative ϵ exceptions can be caused by different plant types such as at site 18 with alfalfa and clover high vegetation cover 60 results in many cases in a high n 0 lower n 0 values are associated with a significantly positive ϵ corresponding to a rapidly increasing roughness with flow depth going further into detail different clusters with common vegetation characteristics can be obtained from the data table 2 to verify the coincidence of the cluster the minimum nse coefficient of the sites is calculated to find the best possible concordance that is acceptable for all sites for all clusters an adequate parameter combination can be obtained as the nse values indicate the high variability low nse in high density pasture cluster 6 can be substantiated with larger deviations in vegetation texture since there are still major differences even if vegetation coverage is assumed to be 100 as fu s equation implies vegetation cover directly the parameters a and b should represent the plant type according to fu et al 2019 so an overlay summarizing plant types in order to calculate the minimum nse value is conducted fig 10 for the shown vegetation types a best corresponding parameter combination could be determined but it must be admitted that for most of the plant types experiments have been conducted only on one site but as alfalfa mustard and winter barley depict a cluster as well as the recently seeded or harvested types the results can be seen as plausible the most important information for hydraulic modelling is that pasture as a frequently applied land use can be classified by the use of the data of twelve sites resulting in a solution space around the indicated position of a 0 4 and b 0 5 3 5 roughness and consecutive rainfall events ribolzi et al 2011 state that consecutive rainfall may cause severe changes in the surface structure especially for higher rain intensities on bare soil this possibly affects the roughness coefficient to visualize the effect of the consecutive rainfall experiments the deviation from mean n of the experiments conducted at a site at a flow depth of 4 mm is calculated the consideration of a single site does not yet show a clear shift of roughness but the comparison of all sites implies an influence of rain intensity and duration on roughness fig 11 the first and second experiment feature equal rainfall intensity and duration the difference in the distribution of n is probably caused by the size of the sample for the experiments 3 and especially 4 the rainfall duration was shorter while intensity has been increased here a shift towards a higher n can be recognized in contrast to experiment 5 with a long duration and significant smaller rain intensity the roughness decreases the last experiment alters again towards a higher roughness in conclusion a general trend in shifting roughness towards one direction caused by consecutive rain experiments as stated by huang and bradford 1992 cannot be recognized probably the high variability in intensity and duration overlays this effect but it can be concluded that a high intensity and especially a short duration leads to significantly higher roughness values exp 4 and 6 while a long duration has the opposite effect exp 5 during longer rain events more pronounced flow paths and grooves may develop while the raindrop impact may increase roughness during shorter events fraga et al 2013 the effect is slightly stronger on bare soil but the sample size is not sufficient to make robust conclusions 4 discussion our study shows that the presented framework robustly determines roughness values from artificial rainfall experiments without data of flow velocity or water depth independently of the used method all four applied approaches result in similar roughness functions while they offer different advantages a constant roughness is the most straightforward formulation but results only in valid values as long as the depth dependence is negligible which is mainly the case for surface runoff in partially submerged vegetation the exponential function covers all possible decreasing or constant water depth functions and leads in these cases to accurate roughness relations the disadvantage is that there is no clear correlation between the calculated parameters and vegetation cover kadlec s power law covers both decreasing and increasing functions and therefore delivers a wider range of functions the results indicate that increasing or decreasing functions are necessary to describe the near surface roughness as different vegetation types may cause different shapes of the function in addition a clear link between vegetation properties and the parameters could be recognized fig 9 and table 2 fu s equation based on the manning equation and empirical observations needs much less iterations to find a suitable roughness function as vegetation cover is directly implemented in the formulation fu et al 2019 states that the parameters are dependent on plant type which is confirmed by our results and valid parameters for the near surface can be provided fig 10 the result of the study are water depth dependent or constant roughness relationships for water depths under 1 cm further research should generate higher water depths in field experiments which can be achieved using longer test fields in the range of 10 m or higher or higher rain intensities however the relevance of this water depth range for hydraulic heavy rainfall simulations should not be underestimated as very shallow water depths are becoming increasingly important in 2d hydraulic modelling with high resolution terrain models rai et al 2010 the choice of roughness leads to diverging water depth flow velocities and thus different concentration times resulting in a temporal and quantitative diverging peak discharge sauer and ortlepp 2021 sanz ramos et al 2021 our results show clear dependencies of the roughness coefficient with vegetation cover plant type and rain intensity which should be taken into account in hydraulic simulations to improve the quality of the results this study therefore contributes to more robust calibrations in infiltration models since the influence of roughness on the shape of the hydrograph can now be estimated with higher accuracy overall our study is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating the increasing or decreasing roughness with increasing water depth in laboratory and field experiments díaz 2005 fraga et al 2013 wu et al 1999 lubw 2016 graf and chhun 1976 fu et al 2019 a summary of these values is shown in fig 12 for example wu et al 1999 investigated the impact of roughness in dependence to water level using an artificial channel and horsehair mattresses representing the influence of a ground near dense vegetation on surface runoff water depth dependent manning curves were determined for different vegetation heights with fully submerged vegetation the roughness coefficient tends to increase at low depths but then decreases to an asymptotic constant as the water level continues to rise since the mattresses are equivalent to a dense vegetation coverage they correspond well to the results of the present study díaz 2005 combined laboratory and field experiments investigating the influence of different vegetation types on roughness for grassland similar values were determined as in wu et al 1999 fraga et al 2013 conducted rainfall runoff experiments on concrete and grass surfaces and tried to predict the rising and falling limb of the observed hydrograph with a numerical model solving the unsteady shallow water equations compared to the other studies shown a very low vegetation height 5 mm was used which leads to a more rapidly decreasing roughness the results showed also a significant rise of roughness at very low water depths and an increasing surface resistance with higher rain intensities due to the raindrop impact this correlates with our findings as we detected also a coherence of rain intensity and roughness fig 11 several authors compared the roughness functions in dependency of the degree of submergence with a strong agreement between different experimental setups graf and chhun 1976 wilson and horritt 2002 fraga et al 2013 but this comparison is not appropriate for our data because flow depth in the used experimental setup did not submerge vegetation fu et al 2019 conducted laboratory experiments on an inclined flume and varied artificial vegetation cover from almost 0 to 30 their research stated an increasing roughness with flow depth which is contrary to the other studies but can be explained by the used vegetation as the density increases with flow depth the great achievement of their work is the derived empirical formula eq 18 directly considering the influence of vegetation coverage the lubw 2016 an environmental authority of the state of baden wuerttemberg in germany published a range of minimum and maximum plausible depth dependent roughness values for the application in 2d hydraulic surface runoff modelling for a water depth higher than 5 cm they fit quite well to the other values presented although the vegetation height was not considered comparing the given range of short grass and grassland to the present study they highly underestimate the roughness for the near surface runoff we now provide robust values describing roughness for near surface runoff 1 cm for different types of vegetation and degree of vegetation coverage the results give the hydraulic modeller an orientation what range of roughness to choose for near surface runoff fig 12 furthermore the knowledge gained about successive rain events can now help to better assess the influence of rainfall duration and intensity for example the roughness of very short and intense rain events would be underestimated with averaged values fig 11 5 conclusions manning s n or a depth dependent function of n is suitable to calculate the behaviour of surface runoff a general valid roughness function should include the degree of vegetation coverage and the vegetation type based on the main findings of our study roughness values can be determined by measuring the outflow based on a comparably simple framework as this renders the conduction of complex measurements of flow velocity and water level unnecessary the derived roughness values extend the current knowledge for shallow water depths it is shown that roughness has tended to be underestimated in some cases for all examined sites robust values could be derived while surfaces with no vegetation or an extremely high vegetation density showed largest variability for bare soil this can be explained by rapid changes in the surface structure potentially caused by crust formation and erosion the variability of high density vegetation is assumed to be caused by plant type as high vegetation coverage alone is not able to describe the differences between the sites this study contributes also to a more accurate calibration of infiltration models roughness has been estimated using the falling limb of the hydrograph when infiltration is nearly constant based on the identified roughness the impact of infiltration rate and roughness on the increasing segment of the hydrograph can be clearly separated consequently it is possible to precisely calculate the change in infiltration rate for the entire artificial rainfall experiment finally the study shows clearly the possibilities and limitations of estimating roughness coefficients with data from artificial sprinkling experiments the results of the study can be directly applied in hydraulic 2d modelling as they give modellers an orientation for the selection of parameters particularly when low water depths are crucial for the generation of surface runoff which is important for the simulation of heavy rainfall events credit authorship

2450,roughness is the key parameter for surface runoff simulations this study aims to determine robust manning resistance coefficients n on the basis of consecutive artificial rainfall experiments on natural hillslopes available in literature obtained at 22 different sites with different degrees of vegetation cover and type the manning resistance coefficient is particularly important in the context of two dimensional 2d hydraulic heavy rainfall simulations since there is a wide range of possible resistance values available leading to significantly different results regarding the accumulation of surface runoff especially for shallow water depths the planning of flood protection structures is directly affected by these uncertainties this work also improves the knowledge between roughness and the shape of the hydrograph allowing a better calibration of infiltration models as flow velocity water depth and infiltration rate were not observed during the rainfall experiments only the outflow of the test field and rain intensity are known for this purpose a framework was developed to parameterize shallow water depth 1 cm dependent roughness coefficients to test the robustness of the framework three different formulations of depth dependent roughness and a constant manning coefficient are used by comparing the measured discharge under different rainfall intensities with simulations in a 2d hydraulic model we identified a strong dependency of manning s n on the degree of vegetation cover and type as well as an influence of consecutive rainfall events this finally leads to a more robust parameterization of near surface roughness for hydrodynamic modelling which is particularly important for the simulation of heavy rainfall events graphical abstract keywords depth dependent roughness coefficients flow resistance artificial rainfall experiments hydraulic rainfall runoff modelling surface runoff flash floods data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction flash floods resulting from torrential rainfall events can cause great damage and loss of human lives as numerous events in central europe in recent years have demonstrated kaiser et al 2020 while climate change is potentially increasing the intensity and frequency of such events maps depicting the expected flooding risk caused by heavy rainfall are becoming increasingly important for communities sañudo et al 2020 bulti and abebe 2020 the use of detailed two dimensional 2d hydraulic models is the most common and accurate method for risk mapping rai et al 2010 the original purpose of hydraulic 2d models is to simulate fluvial flood events where the river overflows its bank meanwhile the direct generation of surface runoff within a hydraulic model considering hydrological processes like infiltration excess has become also a standard use case zhang and cundy 1989 fernández pato et al 2016 savant et al 2019 david and schmalz 2020 using hydraulic 2d models for heavy rainfall simulations the precipitation is distributed over the model domain this means that an individual amount of rain is added to each mesh node or cell depending on the infiltration approach subsequently the discharge concentration in flow paths caused by the surface topology is determined by solving the shallow water equations this enables the creation of accurate flood maps showing endangered critical infrastructure or buildings in contrast to fluvial flood simulations these simulations can show hazards far away from water bodies caused by short and intense rainfall events beside the hydrologic parameters the flow resistance expressed by the surface roughness is the key parameter for 2d hydraulic surface runoff simulations rai et al 2010 barros and colello 2001 the definition of the term roughness varies depending on the discipline and question it can represent surface or flow properties or simply serve as a model parameter the lack of a uniform parameterization and scale dependency complicates the subject since no single surface property can be defined as the roughness roughness primarily reflects the accuracy of the measurement technique and the motivation for parameterization smith 2014 the obstructive effects of roughness determine the velocity of the runoff on the surface and therefore the formation speed of a flood wave in general a smooth surface leads to a more rapidly rising flood wave while peak discharge can be significantly lower on rough surfaces sanz ramos et al 2021 vegetation coverage has the most significant effect on near surface runoff processes and surface resistance studies differentiate by vegetation type flexibility degree of submergence cantisani et al 2014 or vegetation stem diameter zhang et al 2021 a distinction is also often made between submerged and partially submerged vegetation kim et al 2012 wu et al 1999 roughness implies the effects on flow by crop ridges rocks tillage and the frictional drag over the surface engman 1986 romkens and wang 1986 distinguish surface roughness into four categories the first category includes microrelief variations in the range of 1 2mm as the friction drag of the surface the second type results from non directional clumping of the soil as it arises for example from tillage in the range of 100 to 200 mm the third class represents systematic or directional differences such as plough tracks the fourth type contains non directional variations of the terrain with elevation differences the increasing availability of high resolution terrain data often with a horizontal resolution of less than 1 m and a vertical accuracy of a few centimetres allows to depict most of the topographic complexity directly from the terrain model the roughness parameterization has to represent all processes which lie beyond the terrain resolution as different flow processes occur at different topographic scales so roughness parameterization has a scale dependency and parameters have to be chosen in dependency of the computational mesh resolution lane 2005 horritt et al 2006 the roughness of arable land is particularly difficult to standardize huang and bradford 1992 sepaskhah and bondar 2002 huang and bradford 1992 demonstrated this with laboratory tests experimenting with different rain intensities and successive rain events after an initial rainfall event of 63 mm soil was crusted and roughness reduced after a simulated rain event of 92 mm thereafter microrills developed and the visible roughness of the surface increased due to its stronger structuring whereby the roughness relevant to the runoff had decreased due to a channelling of the runoff the most common representation of roughness is done by the use of the manning parameter n manning 1891 as a value between 1 and 0 there are widely accepted and generally valid roughness coefficients for larger flow depths such as those that occur during fluvial floods chow 1959 apart from this the roughness at shallow water depths is subject to greater uncertainties especially surface runoff simulations require a reliable choice of roughness parameters due to the high sensitivity of the results gaur and mathur 2003 sauer and ortlepp 2021 and thus possibly to errors in risk assessment of flash floods many studies tried to find a relation with dimensionless parameters between reynolds number or froude number and vegetation or slope chow 1959 emmett 1970 wu et al 1999 díaz 2005 meanwhile the use of water depth dependent roughness relations rather than a single value representing the range of possible roughness effects for the simulation of surface runoff has become a standard in engineering gaur and mathur 2003 rai et al 2010 mügler et al 2011 fraga et al 2013 in practice the application of roughness coefficients is a definition of a water depth dependent relationship as it is for example the case for the 2d model hydro as 2d hydrotec 2022 these models originally developed for river hydraulics make use of the manning formula which is also the most common and widely used approach to quantify flow velocity díaz 2005 díaz 2005 divides the research concerning the manning formula in two fields the first type tries to develop new or extend existing formulas for the calculation of flow resistance as the formulation of the manning formula is based only on empirical assumptions jarrett 1990 the second type tries to determine better or more exact coefficients valid for specific use cases and conditions wu et al 1999 lawrence 2000 wilson and horritt 2002 ding et al 2004 in this study we contribute to the second type of research studies based on existing artificial rainfall experiments ries et al 2020 we derive empirical parameters describing depth dependent roughness relations valid for the micro topography and different land use types we use four different formulations describing roughness in order to compare their suitability for the proposed task combined with further data from literature this leads to a better more universal representation of overland flow in 2d hydraulic models finally this allows a more accurate assessment of flash flood risks and therefore a better planning of counter measures to achieve this goal an idealized hydraulic 2d model is applied representing the test sites of the artificial rainfall experiments by examining all possible parameter combinations to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between observed and simulated discharge and a comparison with results from other experiments a range of valid values is determined in addition the framework offers a way to determine roughness coefficients knowing only discharge rainfall rate and slope of the test sites thus avoiding complex measurements of water level or velocity 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial rainfall experiments artificial rainfall experiments are one option to examine roughness coefficients on real surfaces outside a laboratory ries et al 2019 and seibert et al 2011 for example provide collections of these experiments in most cases sprinkling experiments use a constant rain intensity e g 70 mm h which corresponds to a statistical return interval for a local heavy rainfall event e g a 100 year event the water is sprayed via a sprinkling system over a defined period of time e g 1 h onto the test field simultaneously the outflow is measured at the lower boundary of the test field as the volume of water running downstream as surface runoff in a high temporal resolution the data set provided by ries et al 2019 for instance includes the entire hydrograph with ascending and descending parts whereas the collection of seibert et al 2011 does not include the descent of the hydrograph sprinkling experiments with tracers tatard et al 2008 mügler et al 2011 try to circumvent the problem of lacking flow velocity data by measuring the propagation rate of a tracer substance a similar approach with a sprinkling setup to simulate rainfall has been conducted by katz et al 1995 using fluorescent dye and a slow motion camera system in an artificial channel to estimate flow velocities however these approaches focused mainly on one test site and did not cover a greater variety of surface properties this lack of a sufficient quantity of data does not allow a comparison of multiple land cover types and therefore artificial rainfall experiments with flow velocity measurements are not considered in this study one of the most comprehensive data sets available for germany is provided by ries et al 2019 the artificial rainfall experiments took place at 23 locations in baden wuerttemberg germany with different vegetation and soil conditions on a defined field of 10 m length six experiments were conducted on each field each with different rainfall duration intensity and initial soil moisture the following information was logged in a one minute time interval which is relevant for our study discharge at the lower end of the test field rain intensity on the test field soil moisture at three different depths in the test field vegetation density 0 100 height m 0 0 3 m land use pasture arable land and slope 9 32 of each site have been documented a detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in ries et al 2020 2 2 the partitioning of roughness and infiltration the basic idea is to use the shape of the hydrograph to infer the roughness of the surface the shape of the hydrograph is generally dependent on precipitation rate infiltration rate and roughness as precipitation rate p mm h is constant the partitioning of runoff q mm h infiltration f mm h and roughness is the key for determining manning s n sm 1 3 the relevant fluxes can be seen in the schematic drawing of a fictive sprinkling experiment in fig 1 the partitioning of runoff and infiltration changes during the rainfall experiment this behaviour is not only caused by changes in soil moisture but also from rainfall induced surface sealing assouline 2004 the impact of raindrops causes surface sealing by the destruction of soil aggregates which reduces the soil porosity by siltation mcintyre 1958 farres 1978 also chemical dispersion depending on the chemistry of the soil affects sealing agassi et al 1996 soil sealing is a crucial process for surfaces with low vegetation cover as the soil becomes less and less permeable caused by rapidly transforming soil surface features with persistent or consecutive rain events bresson and boiffin 1990 ribolzi et al 2011 in addition ribolzi et al 2011 stated that high intensity rain on surfaces with a slope gradient less than 30 which is the case for the data leads to less permeable erosion crusts while higher slopes cause more permeable structures consequently the change of infiltration rate over time is a non linear curve and must be considered for each rainfall experiment individually most equations describing the infiltration process are monotonically decreasing functions based on power laws or exponential decays assouline 2013 to describe the infiltration process of the artificial rainfall experiments a hortonian depletion curve horton 1933 beven 2004 is used to calculate the maximum possible infiltration rate f m a x of the rainfall experiment by fitting the equation to the difference of rainfall and observed discharge the minimum possible infiltration rate f m i n can be estimated when the hydrograph is nearly constant the actual infiltration rate f lies between the maximum and minimum infiltration rate which implies that f can only be determined when f m a x f m i n the empirical horton equation decreases f m a x exponentially from its initial value f 0 to its final one f c using the decay coefficient α eq 1 1 f t f c f 0 f c e α t the variables of the horton function are calculated with the non linear least square method as proposed by esen 1987 to fit the function eq 1 to the observed data the applied method using the levenberg marquardt algorithm is implemented in the minpack 1 package moré et al 1980 a horton curve is displayed exemplarily in fig 1 as maximum possible infiltration rate f m a x the schematic artificial rainfall experiment can be separated in three time segments ascent of the hydrograph nearly constant discharge and descent of the hydrograph during the ascent of the hydrograph the infiltration cannot be determined unambiguously orange area in fig 1 as the physical process of soil saturation is not represented by the empirical horton approach consequently the impact of manning s n on the shape of the hydrograph cannot be separated from infiltration since q is a function of f manning s n and precipitation p eq 2 2 d q d t 0 a n d q t 0 t t 1 f f n p a constant wetting rate leads to a gradually increasing q and converges in many observed cases to a steady rate the observed soil moisture data not shown shows also a plateau leading to the conclusion that the maximum saturation has been reached the depression storage is filled and infiltration into the soil is constant infiltration before the termination of artificial rainfall f m i n is in many cases equivalent to the equilibrium infiltration rate f c resulting in a constant surface runoff so infiltration is clearly predictable for these cases as a difference between precipitation p and discharge q but no inference on n can be made in this time segment as roughness has no visible effect on the hydrograph because runoff is nearly constant eq 3 3 d q d t 0 a n d q t 1 t t 2 f f c p finally the third time segment begins with the cessation of rainfall resulting in the descent of the hydrograph the decreasing q is a function of f and n eq 4 4 d q d t 0 a n d q t 2 t t e f f n a nearly constant infiltration rate can be extrapolated by using the fitted horton function for the falling limb segment of the hydrograph consequently the impact of n on the shape of this segment of the hydrograph can finally be separated from infiltration allowing a clear determination of roughness in addition high roughness coefficients cause a slower ascending hydrograph this effect can be used to verify the estimated n excluding roughness coefficients leading to a simulated slower rise of the hydrograph simultaneously applying the minimum infiltration rate f min in the model eq 5 5 q s i m t 0 t t 1 f p n f min the collection of rainfall experiments provides a large variety of different hydrographs with maximum discharge ranging from 5 to 150 mm h no meaningful roughness can be derived from experiments with very low discharges to recalculate the observed hydrograph a comparatively much higher roughness would be needed partly even with a manning value greater than 1 this is presumably caused by continuous drainage of soil and vegetation distorting the hydrograph for this reason experiments whose discharge does not exceed 15 mm h are generally excluded and discharge values below 5 mm h are not considered in the comparison of simulated and observed discharge 2 3 numerical hydraulic model for one dimensional and stationary conditions discharge q m 3 s m can be calculated under consideration of roughness as followed according to the converted manning equation eq 6 manning 1891 6 q 1 n h 5 3 s f during the artificial rainfall experiments only q has been measured as integral value and the energy slope s f is known as a property of the respective site so manning s equation does not allow an unambiguous calculation of q as it can be determined with different roughness coefficients n and their respective flow depth h in addition the instationary distribution of flow depth fig 2 cannot be represented by the manning equation as well as the ascent and descent of the hydrograph due to water accumulation to the end of the experimental site so the flow processes must be calculated by a two dimensional approach calculation of instationary flow on a surface is based on the two dimensional depth averaged flow equations shallow water equations they integrate the three dimensional continuity equation and the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for incompressible fluids over the water depth by assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution pironneau 1988 the shallow water equations in compact vector format are defined as followed 7 δ w δ t δ f δ x δ g δ y s 0 with 8 w h u h v h 9 f u h u 2 h 0 5 g h 2 v h δ u δ x u v h v h δ v δ x 10 s 0 g h s f x s b x g h s f y s b y 11 g v h u v h v h δ u δ y v 2 h 0 5 h 2 v h δ v δ y h h z which represents the water level as the sum of water depth h and elevation of the surface z u and v are the velocity components in x and y direction the source term s involves the friction slope s f with the components s f x and s f y and the bed slope s b x s b y the slope of the surface bed slope is defined by the gradient of bed level z in x and y direction 12 s b x δ z δ x s b y δ z δ y the friction slope s f is calculated with the darcy weisbach equation 13 s f λ v v 2 g d with the manning equation the friction factor λ is determined 14 λ 6 34 2 g n 2 d 1 3 g is defined as earth gravity and d 4 r h y is representing the hydraulic diameter applying the 2d shallow water equations the hydraulic radius r h y is equivalent to the water depth h using the finite volume method the shown equations provide depth and flow velocity at each node of the computational mesh in a temporal resolution for our study we used the hydrodynamic model hydro as 2d hydrotec 2022 the model hydro as 2d is widely used in germany and is applied both for the simulation of fluvial flood events and for surface runoff caused by heavy rainfall the discharge calculation is carried out via the finite volume method based on a mesh consisting of triangles and quadrilaterals the use of a combined mesh of triangles and quadrilaterals allows an easier adaptation to the topographical and hydrodynamic conditions of the respective task in a standard use case the structure of the hydraulic model is based on laserscan data the model representing the test sites consists of an inclined plane whose slope is specified in the database fig 2 as the test sites are homogeneous areas microtopography is not considered as height variation in the computational mesh the surface roughness is modelled with water depth dependent or constant manning coefficients on each node so all flow affecting parameters like microtopography vegetation resistance splash effects of raindrops or rill formation due to erosion must be represented by the roughness coefficient corresponding to the real experiments the surface of the model has a length of 10 m the width of the site is not relevant because flow is measured in discharge per metre the selection of a sufficient number of nodes has been done by a sensitivity analysis leading to an optimal node spacing of 25 cm this is the key to exclude an influence of model discretization on the results the rain is modelled via so called source nodes as a spatial homogeneous addition of water the infiltration is modelled similarly to the rain as negative source nodes if necessary in a time dependent manner the advantage of this procedure in comparison to a simple reduction of the amount of rainfall is that the infiltration can be active while or after the rainfall at the lower end of the surface the discharge and the water level is logged for further analysis 2 4 reducing the solution space each experiment leads to a solution space representing several acceptable roughness functions with minimal difference in quality of the results comparing the solution spaces of experiments with similar properties overlapping areas can be obtained leading to the assumption that there must be a smaller general valid solution space three steps are now taken to reduce the solution space the first step is to exclude smooth low n roughness relations based on the ascending hydrograph as described in section 2 2 in the second step the individual experiments of one site are compared with each other to find similarities that are valid for all finally the remaining solution space can be compared to sites with similar properties to further reduce or verify the results fig 3 shows the described process schematically the method followed in this study for determining the roughness coefficient is the iterative testing of different roughness values and the subsequent comparison of the hydrographs using a statistical performance measure like the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the identified roughness coefficients with a high nse score can be compared to the other experiments with different rain and infiltration rates of the same test site if all experiments lead to a similar roughness value the result can be considered as robust solution 2 5 roughness functions three depth dependent formulations of near surface roughness and one depth independent approach with different advantages are used to parameterize the roughness function to prove the robustness of the presented framework 2 5 1 constant roughness coefficients the use of constant depth independent roughness coefficients is the most straightforward method for this use case no parameterization is needed but the manning values can be iterated directly within the framework 2 5 2 exponential function thus better fitting shapes of the hydrographs and a universally valid roughness can only be modelled with depth dependent roughness relationships this assumption is confirmed by many authors wu 2008 fraga et al 2013 rai et al 2010 mügler et al 2011 fu et al 2019 to describe depth dependent roughness we parameterize n as a reciprocal exponential function of h defined by the variables c and d eq 15 15 n 1 c e d h the possible representation of either a constant roughness d 0 or a depth dependent d 0 decreasing roughness with increasing water depth is the advantage of this function this allows to test all possible combinations of the variables c and d in a reasonable range of values and to compare the observed with the simulated falling limb of the hydrograph the reciprocal is used to achieve a better distribution of roughness functions as functions with a low n would otherwise be underrepresented if c and d are iterated linearly preliminary test simulation showed that the differences in the simulated hydrograph of a linear varied n with high roughness values 0 6 to 1 0 are less pronounced than with a smaller n 0 2 to 0 4 the exponential function has no direct link to manning s equation but covers all possible variations of decreasing roughness with increasing water depth 2 5 3 kadlec s power law experimental investigations studying the shallow overland flow found a relationship between vegetative drag and roughness coefficient kadlec 1990 wu et al 1999 tsihrintzis et al 2001 gaur and mathur 2003 on the basis of these findings jain et al 2004 simplified kadlec s power law for the application in a distributed rainfall model eq 16 16 n n 0 h h 0 ϵ with the limits h h 0 and n n 0 for h h 0 h 0 defines minimum flow depth beyond which the roughness coefficient n 0 is assumed constant the exponent ϵ represents the influence of vegetation drag this formulation of a depth dependent roughness function is well established and has been used in several studies mügler et al 2011 simons et al 2014 özgen et al 2015 the formulation is opposite to the exponential function since it emphasizes low roughness more strongly for a linear iteration of n 0 the simplified power law can result in a decreasing or increasing function and has therefore a wider range of possible solutions 2 5 4 fu s equation a newer formulation describing depth dependent roughness based on the manning equation has been provided by fu et al 2019 later the equation has been adapted to be valid for litter cover ding et al 2021 fu conducted several laboratory experiments for a vegetation cover from 0 to 30 with artificial plants with a height of 12 cm fu s equation leads to a nearly constant roughness for low vegetation cover and an increasing roughness with higher water depths for a higher vegetation cover the equation calculates manning s roughness on stem covered slopes and shows that the influence of plant stem resistance flow resistance from vegetation and boundary resistance depends on water depth and plant basal cover c v c v is defined as the ratio between the area covered by stems a s and flume bed a f eq 17 17 c v 100 a s a f c v is regarded as equivalent to the plant coverage documented by ries et al 2020 as no further information about the methodology is provided the coefficients a and b vary with vegetation type eq 18 as provided by fu et al 2019 18 n a b 1 e 0 061 c v 1 668 h 0 604 0 710 e 0 219 c v the solution space of fu s equation is limited because the shape of the function is mainly defined by the vegetation coverage the advantage is that this reduces the necessary number of possible iterations to find a solution but this could also result in a lack of accuracy fu s equation has been determined with relatively low stem covers 30 and flow depths larger than 0 5 cm so the validity for higher vegetation covers the transferability of fu s stem cover to vegetation cover as used in the data of ries et al 2019 and lower flow depth needs to be verified 3 results the calibration of the three equations leads to multiple water depth dependent roughness functions and therefore to differing hydrographs similarity of the resulting falling limb of the simulated hydrograph with the measured one is represented by the nse as a value between 0 and 1 3 1 the most robust result the result is a heat map where each raster cell stands for one depth dependent roughness relation and the quality of its comparison to the descending part of the hydrograph 22 sites out of 23 are useable for simulation table 1 since no runoff could be generated at site 10 with any artificial rainfall experiment due to high soil porosity for each site up to six matrices depending on the number of useable experiments are generated the number of useable experiments depends on the successful generation of surface runoff in many cases the first experiment or experiments with a short rainfall duration did not produce any runoff because soil moisture could not sufficiently build up fig 4 exemplarily shows the matrices of three out of six experiments simulated for site 9 100 veg cover the crosses in the heat maps demonstrate the deviation from the highest nse value and are an indicator for the ambiguousness of the results of one experiment thus coherent and similar areas with crosses indicate robust solution spaces the more crosses appear the more possible parameter combinations lead to a good result to reduce the number of solutions an overlay of the results of all experiments of one site is performed by calculating the minimum nse values of each parameter combination fig 5 the lowest common denominator representing a solution which is most acceptable for all experiments can be found in order to verify the selection of the minimum as best possible solution the optimum solution space is compared with the optimum of other statistical moments such as mean median standard deviation or coefficient of variation not shown all the statistical moments of nse lead to similar results as well as the simulated hydrographs resemble to the observed ones but the minimum is considered as the most robust solution between the different experiments taking the mean values for instance would not assure that all the experiments are contained in the optimum solution space on site 9 basically all four approaches lead to a range of n values between 0 5 and 0 7 fig 5 the exponential function and kadlec s power law result in similar optimum roughness functions black lines with n values decreasing with h but the solution space grey functions of kadlec s power law covers also the optimum solution derived with fu s equation the formulation of fu s equation determines an increasing n with flow depth for higher vegetation coverage due to its predefined properties and does not allow much variation for full vegetation coverage accordingly all a b combinations generate similar results as the functions in fig 5 overlap each other the optimum depth dependent functions differ to a minor degree from the constant roughness as the flow process takes in this case completely place in partially submerged vegetation therefore also the constant approach results in a high nse value while the overall best fitting function leads to a slightly decreasing n with h the resulting parameters together with the most important properties of their sites are listed in table 1 to enable a straightforward comparison of the results the n value of each function at a depth of 4 mm is listed to indicate the limitation of the respective function the highest flow depth h achieved during the numeric simulation is also presented since the maximum flow depth of some functions e g sites 13 20 and 23 lies significantly below 4 mm they can nonetheless be seen as valid as they show a nearly constant n which can be extrapolated to 4 mm 3 2 numerical and experimental hydrographs the comparison between the observed and the simulated falling limb of the hydrographs obtained from applying the four roughness approaches in the hydraulic model in fig 6 lead to nearly identical results nse values from 0 94 to 0 99 the respective minimum nse is equivalent to the optimum value derived from the overlay in fig 5 the nse values of the single experiments correspond to the values presented in fig 4 and the position determined by the optimum value the simulation has been conducted with the in section 2 2 described minimum infiltration rate f m i n the criteria for an acceptable shape of a simulated hydrograph is defined as followed first the rise of the simulated hydrograph must be higher or equal to the observed q since infiltration is modelled as the minimum obtained from fitting the difference of precipitation and discharge to the horton function second the simulated descent of the hydrograph must fit to the observed data some deviation at the lower end is tolerable as this is assumed to be caused by soil or vegetation draining effects which cannot be mapped by the roughness formulation the example of site 9 shows that these criteria can be met as well as high nse coefficients can be achieved independently of the applied roughness formulation 3 3 quality and variability of the results the quality of the results is shown in fig 7 comparing the achieved nse values of the four approaches high nse values are achieved if the conducted rainfall experiments resulted in similar hydrographs while low nse values are caused by diverging discharge measurements site 19 is a negative exception because of extremely dense vegetation so that even with a manning value of 1 the hydrograph cannot be modelled correctly considering all sites it can be stated that kadlec s power law gives the best results on average since this formula reflects best the variability of the vegetation with increasing or decreasing roughness the exponential function also achieves a high level of consistency unless on sites where the roughness is strongly increasing with flow depth e g site 8 and 16 fu s equation tends to result in lower nse values since the adaptability of the formula is limited significantly lower results compared to kadlec s power law are achieved on sites where roughness clearly decreases with water depth e g sites 22 and 23 at the same time less iterations are necessary to obtain reasonable results since vegetation coverage is directly considered in the formulation executing a higher number of iterations with a finer parameter sampling interval could not improve the results significantly the quality of the results of constant n varies strongly with the properties of the respective site sites with a dense vegetation tend to have a less pronounced depth dependent roughness and therefore a low difference to the other approaches is achieved e g sites 12 14 and 22 in contrast to sites with low or no vegetation cover the nse values achieved with the constant n decrease significantly compared to the depth dependent approaches e g sites 5 8 and 23 the variation of roughness is shown in fig 8 by comparing roughness at a depth of 4 mm with the results derived with kadlec s power law larger deviations occur mainly at the upper end of the scale in particular the comparison with fu s equation shows a larger variance due to the lower adaptability of the formula the variation compared to the exponential function is lower as both approaches lead in many cases to similar solutions it is noticeable that the constant roughness has the smallest deviations this can be explained by the considered the water depth of 4 mm since the depth independent approach tends to result in a mean roughness value 3 4 correlation of parameters and site characteristics in comparison to the other approaches the strongest correlation between the parameters and vegetation cover could be ascertained with kadlec s power law fig 9 shows the identified n 0 ϵ values calculated with kadlec s power law with a maximum deviation of 1 of their optimum in dependency of the degree of vegetation coverage low vegetation cover corresponds clearly with a low n 0 and an ϵ value approaching zero resulting in a nearly constant roughness function a more differentiated result is obtained focusing on medium vegetation cover 30 60 overall the roughness function tends to become smoother with increasing flow depth corresponding to a negative ϵ exceptions can be caused by different plant types such as at site 18 with alfalfa and clover high vegetation cover 60 results in many cases in a high n 0 lower n 0 values are associated with a significantly positive ϵ corresponding to a rapidly increasing roughness with flow depth going further into detail different clusters with common vegetation characteristics can be obtained from the data table 2 to verify the coincidence of the cluster the minimum nse coefficient of the sites is calculated to find the best possible concordance that is acceptable for all sites for all clusters an adequate parameter combination can be obtained as the nse values indicate the high variability low nse in high density pasture cluster 6 can be substantiated with larger deviations in vegetation texture since there are still major differences even if vegetation coverage is assumed to be 100 as fu s equation implies vegetation cover directly the parameters a and b should represent the plant type according to fu et al 2019 so an overlay summarizing plant types in order to calculate the minimum nse value is conducted fig 10 for the shown vegetation types a best corresponding parameter combination could be determined but it must be admitted that for most of the plant types experiments have been conducted only on one site but as alfalfa mustard and winter barley depict a cluster as well as the recently seeded or harvested types the results can be seen as plausible the most important information for hydraulic modelling is that pasture as a frequently applied land use can be classified by the use of the data of twelve sites resulting in a solution space around the indicated position of a 0 4 and b 0 5 3 5 roughness and consecutive rainfall events ribolzi et al 2011 state that consecutive rainfall may cause severe changes in the surface structure especially for higher rain intensities on bare soil this possibly affects the roughness coefficient to visualize the effect of the consecutive rainfall experiments the deviation from mean n of the experiments conducted at a site at a flow depth of 4 mm is calculated the consideration of a single site does not yet show a clear shift of roughness but the comparison of all sites implies an influence of rain intensity and duration on roughness fig 11 the first and second experiment feature equal rainfall intensity and duration the difference in the distribution of n is probably caused by the size of the sample for the experiments 3 and especially 4 the rainfall duration was shorter while intensity has been increased here a shift towards a higher n can be recognized in contrast to experiment 5 with a long duration and significant smaller rain intensity the roughness decreases the last experiment alters again towards a higher roughness in conclusion a general trend in shifting roughness towards one direction caused by consecutive rain experiments as stated by huang and bradford 1992 cannot be recognized probably the high variability in intensity and duration overlays this effect but it can be concluded that a high intensity and especially a short duration leads to significantly higher roughness values exp 4 and 6 while a long duration has the opposite effect exp 5 during longer rain events more pronounced flow paths and grooves may develop while the raindrop impact may increase roughness during shorter events fraga et al 2013 the effect is slightly stronger on bare soil but the sample size is not sufficient to make robust conclusions 4 discussion our study shows that the presented framework robustly determines roughness values from artificial rainfall experiments without data of flow velocity or water depth independently of the used method all four applied approaches result in similar roughness functions while they offer different advantages a constant roughness is the most straightforward formulation but results only in valid values as long as the depth dependence is negligible which is mainly the case for surface runoff in partially submerged vegetation the exponential function covers all possible decreasing or constant water depth functions and leads in these cases to accurate roughness relations the disadvantage is that there is no clear correlation between the calculated parameters and vegetation cover kadlec s power law covers both decreasing and increasing functions and therefore delivers a wider range of functions the results indicate that increasing or decreasing functions are necessary to describe the near surface roughness as different vegetation types may cause different shapes of the function in addition a clear link between vegetation properties and the parameters could be recognized fig 9 and table 2 fu s equation based on the manning equation and empirical observations needs much less iterations to find a suitable roughness function as vegetation cover is directly implemented in the formulation fu et al 2019 states that the parameters are dependent on plant type which is confirmed by our results and valid parameters for the near surface can be provided fig 10 the result of the study are water depth dependent or constant roughness relationships for water depths under 1 cm further research should generate higher water depths in field experiments which can be achieved using longer test fields in the range of 10 m or higher or higher rain intensities however the relevance of this water depth range for hydraulic heavy rainfall simulations should not be underestimated as very shallow water depths are becoming increasingly important in 2d hydraulic modelling with high resolution terrain models rai et al 2010 the choice of roughness leads to diverging water depth flow velocities and thus different concentration times resulting in a temporal and quantitative diverging peak discharge sauer and ortlepp 2021 sanz ramos et al 2021 our results show clear dependencies of the roughness coefficient with vegetation cover plant type and rain intensity which should be taken into account in hydraulic simulations to improve the quality of the results this study therefore contributes to more robust calibrations in infiltration models since the influence of roughness on the shape of the hydrograph can now be estimated with higher accuracy overall our study is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating the increasing or decreasing roughness with increasing water depth in laboratory and field experiments díaz 2005 fraga et al 2013 wu et al 1999 lubw 2016 graf and chhun 1976 fu et al 2019 a summary of these values is shown in fig 12 for example wu et al 1999 investigated the impact of roughness in dependence to water level using an artificial channel and horsehair mattresses representing the influence of a ground near dense vegetation on surface runoff water depth dependent manning curves were determined for different vegetation heights with fully submerged vegetation the roughness coefficient tends to increase at low depths but then decreases to an asymptotic constant as the water level continues to rise since the mattresses are equivalent to a dense vegetation coverage they correspond well to the results of the present study díaz 2005 combined laboratory and field experiments investigating the influence of different vegetation types on roughness for grassland similar values were determined as in wu et al 1999 fraga et al 2013 conducted rainfall runoff experiments on concrete and grass surfaces and tried to predict the rising and falling limb of the observed hydrograph with a numerical model solving the unsteady shallow water equations compared to the other studies shown a very low vegetation height 5 mm was used which leads to a more rapidly decreasing roughness the results showed also a significant rise of roughness at very low water depths and an increasing surface resistance with higher rain intensities due to the raindrop impact this correlates with our findings as we detected also a coherence of rain intensity and roughness fig 11 several authors compared the roughness functions in dependency of the degree of submergence with a strong agreement between different experimental setups graf and chhun 1976 wilson and horritt 2002 fraga et al 2013 but this comparison is not appropriate for our data because flow depth in the used experimental setup did not submerge vegetation fu et al 2019 conducted laboratory experiments on an inclined flume and varied artificial vegetation cover from almost 0 to 30 their research stated an increasing roughness with flow depth which is contrary to the other studies but can be explained by the used vegetation as the density increases with flow depth the great achievement of their work is the derived empirical formula eq 18 directly considering the influence of vegetation coverage the lubw 2016 an environmental authority of the state of baden wuerttemberg in germany published a range of minimum and maximum plausible depth dependent roughness values for the application in 2d hydraulic surface runoff modelling for a water depth higher than 5 cm they fit quite well to the other values presented although the vegetation height was not considered comparing the given range of short grass and grassland to the present study they highly underestimate the roughness for the near surface runoff we now provide robust values describing roughness for near surface runoff 1 cm for different types of vegetation and degree of vegetation coverage the results give the hydraulic modeller an orientation what range of roughness to choose for near surface runoff fig 12 furthermore the knowledge gained about successive rain events can now help to better assess the influence of rainfall duration and intensity for example the roughness of very short and intense rain events would be underestimated with averaged values fig 11 5 conclusions manning s n or a depth dependent function of n is suitable to calculate the behaviour of surface runoff a general valid roughness function should include the degree of vegetation coverage and the vegetation type based on the main findings of our study roughness values can be determined by measuring the outflow based on a comparably simple framework as this renders the conduction of complex measurements of flow velocity and water level unnecessary the derived roughness values extend the current knowledge for shallow water depths it is shown that roughness has tended to be underestimated in some cases for all examined sites robust values could be derived while surfaces with no vegetation or an extremely high vegetation density showed largest variability for bare soil this can be explained by rapid changes in the surface structure potentially caused by crust formation and erosion the variability of high density vegetation is assumed to be caused by plant type as high vegetation coverage alone is not able to describe the differences between the sites this study contributes also to a more accurate calibration of infiltration models roughness has been estimated using the falling limb of the hydrograph when infiltration is nearly constant based on the identified roughness the impact of infiltration rate and roughness on the increasing segment of the hydrograph can be clearly separated consequently it is possible to precisely calculate the change in infiltration rate for the entire artificial rainfall experiment finally the study shows clearly the possibilities and limitations of estimating roughness coefficients with data from artificial sprinkling experiments the results of the study can be directly applied in hydraulic 2d modelling as they give modellers an orientation for the selection of parameters particularly when low water depths are crucial for the generation of surface runoff which is important for the simulation of heavy rainfall events credit authorship

2451,grass planting is an important and typical measure for soil and water conservation while the roles of stolon and erect grass species in affecting surface subsurface flow and soil erosion processes are little understood experimental plots 2 m 0 5 m 0 5 m using red soil with two rainfall intensities 60 and 120 mm h 1 and grass coverage 30 and 70 were conducted in laboratory rainfall simulation experiments two common and endemic stolon eremochloa ophiuroides and erect lolium perenne grass species were selected due to their fast growth power adaptability and wide application in reducing runoff and soil loss and the bare soil plot was set up as the control the results showed that bare plot had the highest mean surface flow coefficient 73 5 and then were l perenne 57 1 and e ophiuroides 44 9 the mean subsurface flow coefficients were found in order of e ophiuroides 25 7 l perenne 13 0 and bare plot 7 2 the role of stolon grass rather than erect grass in reducing surface flow but improving subsurface flow led to lower surface flow hydraulic characteristics such as flow velocity reynolds number darcy weisbach coefficient and manning friction coefficient and hydrodynamic characteristics like flow shear stress and stream power furthermore the stolon grass generated the lowest soil loss rate 0 8 g m 2 min 1 while the values on erect grass and bare plot were 2 5 and 10 7 g m 2 min 1 respectively the indicator of eroded sediment median size also proved the higher efficiency of stolon grass in soil loss control with values of 31 8 58 6 and 69 6 μm on stolon grass erect grass and bare plots respectively the lower soil loss on stolon grass cover plot was attributed to the lower surface flow and hydraulic hydrodynamic characteristics the stolon grass was more sensitive to the coverage and rainfall intensity which was explained by the higher flow and sediment trapping capability 2 2 4 4 times under lower coverage and rainfall intensity than erect grass even under high rainfall intensity 1 1 3 2 times the stolon grass played more beneficial roles in soil and water conservation than erect grass which was closely related to above ground and under ground parts of grass this study can provide a better understanding of the roles of stolon and erect grass species for soil and water conservation and management practices keywords surface subsurface flow sediment hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics grass species rainfall simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion is a severe eco environmental concern that leads to the loss of soil organic matter fertility and nutrients thus causing the disruption of soil aggregates and affecting agricultural productivity particularly in the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events sadeghi et al 2020 li et al 2021 the soil erosion problems in the southern hilly region of china were caused by the interactions of high precipitation fragmented topography and intensive agricultural activities liu et al 2016a jiang et al 2018 duan et al 2022 vegetation plays a dominant role in alleviating soil erosion and regulating the relationship between runoff and sediment which is a widely adopted measure on hillslopes worldwide wuepper et al 2019 previous research has been conducted to analyze the effects of grass on overland flow and soil erosion processes pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 and the results reveal that the grass cover is effective in reducing runoff and sediment generation and increasing surface roughness zhang et al 2018 duan et al 2022 pan et al 2006 proposed that grass had more significant roles in sediment concentration than in surface runoff and the sediment reductions ranged from 45 to 85 on the loess plateau fattet et al 2011 indicated that grass was more conducive to soil aggregate stability and anti erosion than other vegetation types such as trees li and pan 2018 suggested that grass significantly reduced overland flow rate and velocity and sediment generation with average reductions of 22 29 and 67 respectively sun et al 2019 suggested that grass coverage could significantly affect runoff shear stress and sediment transport capacity by reducing the splash energy of raindrops many studies have also demonstrated that grass had important effects on facilitating water infiltration and improving the topsoil physical property tu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 furthermore grass has been known to help moderate extreme rainfall and balance water for farming which presents the advantages of reducing the rapid response of surface flow to extreme climate and safeguarding subsurface reservoirs li et al 2009 duan et al 2022 therefore it is essential to utilize grass reasonably to reduce fluxes of eroding soil and regulate the relationship between runoff and sediment distinct response of runoff and sediment processes appeared among different grass species zheng et al 2008 wei et al 2014 el kateb et al 2013 highlighted the necessity of selecting suitable grass species for the region to maximize its water and soil control efficiency similar findings were also reported by li et al 2015 and duan et al 2016 that the grass species was the most significant factor affecting the frequency and intensity of soil loss a comparison on three grass species conducted by hatefi et al 2020 found that l prenne performed best in controlling runoff and soil loss compared with agropyron trichophorum and medicago sativafrom on small experimental plots duan et al 2022 demonstrated that the effects of three grass species trifolium repens cynodon dactylon and eremochloa ophiuroides on runoff hydrodynamic parameters and sediment reductions were evidently different exploring the roles of grass components stems leaves and roots etc on soil erosion has been shown to be meaningful for soil erosion control li and pan 2018 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021a b grass canopies increase water infiltration and reduce water hydraulic shear by intercepting rainfall zhang et al 2020 the grass roots can consolidate soil aggregate improve soil structure and reduce soil erosion wang et al 2021a inconsistent results regarding the effects of the above ground and under ground parts of grass on erosion controlling benefits exist de baets et al 2007 highlighted the above ground parts of grass could be considered as a key factor for reducing water erosion and increasing the surface resistance zhou and shangguan 2007 demonstrated that ryegrass could enhance the soil aggregate stability and the above ground parts contributed relatively more to reducing runoff while the root effect on soil loss reduction was greater than the shoot effect sadeghi et al 2017 scientifically proved that canopy can promote the formation of stemflow in favor of the water supply to roots thereby changing the redistribution of water in soil furthermore an experiment conducted by wang et al 2021a found that the root morphology traits of grass species can determine the soil detachment process especially the root surface area density grass density is recognized as a crucial factor in affecting soil and water conservation benefits of grass wei et al 2014 duan et al 2022 the reasonable grass density can effectively improve rainfall interception alter rill erosion and gully erosion fattet et al 2011 tong et al 2018 grass cover thresholds vary significantly in different climates and soils so the effective grass coverage needs to be site specific additionally frequent extreme rainfall events need more attention which exerted disproportionate impacts on the relationship between runoff and sediment wei et al 2014 pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the increase in extreme rainfall events possibly poses a significant threat to achieving sustainable water management wang et al 2020 therefore studying different grass measures under heavy rainfall has practical implications for soil and water conservation hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters which can indicate the mechanism of grass planting in water and soil erosion should be quantified jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 many studies have demonstrated that grass canopies and roots can decrease flow velocity v froude number fr flow shear stress τ and stream power ω increase the hydraulic resistance and weaken the kinetic energy pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 jafarpoor et al 2022 waldron and dakessian 1981 and wang et al 2021a indicated that the primary factors affecting these characteristics of runoff included the morphology and distribution of grass roots in soil jiang et al 2018 reported that the rill flow velocity was the most sensitive hydraulic parameter and the flow power provided the optimal hydrodynamic parameter to characterize the dynamic mechanisms of soil erosion zhang et al 2020 explored the effects of canopies and root systems of two grasses m minutifora and c zizanioides and found they effectively decreased flow velocities v by 35 and 30 and increased darcy weisbach friction coefficients f by 240 and 131 compared to the control treatments respectively however the effects of grass species on the hydraulic and hydrodynamic processes still need to be supplemented by subsequent in depth research wei et al 2014 li et al 2021 numerous studies mainly focus on the effects of grass species from the perspective of surface flow or sediments while ignoring its impact on subsurface flow generation especially for red soil zhou and shangguan 2007 el kateb et al 2013 wang et al 2021b red soil hilly regions are subject to high temperature concentrated precipitation and some unreasonable farming activities resulting in serious water and soil loss the red tillage soil is mainly composed of a loose porous and highly permeable top layer while a compact and weakly permeable bottom layer ma et al 2022 which facilitates the lateral flow of runoff after infiltration to form subsurface flow liu et al 2016b the soil covered by dense grass can significantly increase the soil infiltration and promote the subsurface flow generation zheng et al 2014 indicated that subsurface flow accounted for 52 68 of the total runoff on red soil sloping farmland through simulated laboratory rainfall experiments nespoulous et al 2019 proposed grass diversity and their fine roots were significant for promoting the incidence of subsurface flow thus reducing water and soil erosion in tropical ferralsols while the roles of stolon and erect grass species on surface subsurface flow are still unclear in this study two common native grass species e ophiuroides stolon type and l perenne erect type were selected in the rainfall simulation experiment they were widely used in ecological restoration in the red soil hilly region of south china owing to their rapid growth strong tillering ability and large biomass the study objectives were to identify the roles of stolon and erect grass species on the spatial vertical distribution of surface flow and subsurface flow test the efficiencies of two grass species on sediment trapping and reveal the soil erosion mechanisms from the perspective of hydraulics and hydrodynamics the results can provide references for guiding the choice of grass species for soil and water conservation 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 study area and experimental soil the study area is located in the soil and water conservation ecological technology park in the de an county of jiangxi province approximately between 29 14 29 29 n and 115 32 115 45 e in the southern hilly region of china rugged hills and low mountains comprise this region the soil parent material is dominated by quaternary sediment and featured by the high erodibility cao et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 over 70 of the total annual precipitation primarily occurs between march and july mainly due to its subtropical monsoon climate the sloping farmland is the main land use type in the hilly red soil region meanwhile the high intensity sloping farmland cultivation coincided with the high intensity rainfall contributes more than half of soil erosion during the rainy season the experimental soil was collected from the 0 30 cm layer of the long term cultivated sloping farmland the soil texture was silty clay with clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm contents being 26 8 61 8 and 11 4 respectively according to the united states department of agriculture classification standards the basic physical and chemical properties of the experimental soil were shown in table 1 soil organic matter content om was measured by the walkley black wet oxidation method and potassium permanganate oxidation method total nitrogen tn was identified by the kjel dahl method total phosphorus tp was determined by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method cation exchange capacity cec was measured on the fine earth fraction ph was measured by phs 3c ph meters at a 1 2 5 soil to water ratio and free iron oxide fed was extracted by sodium dithionite citrate bicarbonate treatment method issas 1978 2 2 soil plot design and installation the soil plots were constructed of iron and steel plates in three replicates with the size of 2 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep fig 1 this small scale plot can simplify the process and minimize the uncertainties in a relatively homogeneous slope surface thereby excluding confounding factors other than vegetation sadeghi et al 2016 wang et al 2021b the experiment was conducted at a slope gradient of approximately 10 18 to simulate the typical gradient of the sloping farmland in the hilly red soil region liu et al 2016a b duan et al 2022 the soil was filled into the plot and compacted in every 5 cm layers and the soil used in each 5 cm layer was weighed to ensure the soil bulk density were compacted at 1 3 g cm 3 an upper outlet flush with topsoil was installed to collect the surface flow and sediment during the rainfall simulation and a lower outlet flush with the bottom of the soil plot was set up to collect the subsurface flow the outlet of the subsurface flow was set at a soil depth of 0 5 m which was collected into the flow storage container by a pipe connected to a hole that in the l type subsurface flow collector liu et al 2016b uniform small holes were arranged at the bottom of the soil plot to ensure that the water could flow freely downward the percolating water was collected by a plate that was set beneath the soil plot bottom before planting the studied grass on the plots artificial surface levelling was undertaken to minimize the impact of microtopographic changes li and pan 2018 2 3 grass planting and management two kinds of common native grasses e ophiuroides and l perenne were employed in this study which can function for soil and water conservation after 3 5 months growth li et al 2021 e ophiuroides is a perennial warm season grass with approximately 20 cm height and well developed strong stolons the fast growing perennial l perenne is suitable for the warm and humid climate which has skinny and supple erect stems with approximately 30 90 cm heights three surface coverage gradients were set a bare soil plot bsp as the control ec30 lc30 and ec70 lc70 represent e ophiuroides l perenne plots with 30 and 70 coverage respectively the two grass species were strip sowed on the soil plots and then managed by regular watering and fertilization until the desired coverage was achieved zhang et al 2018 once the grass coverage requirements 30 and 70 were met by digital image analysis the simulated rainfall tests were initiated the no grass ng plots were treated to the same watering and fertilization conditions as the grass covered plots all treatments were replicated thrice with complete combinations of coverage and rainfall intensity 2 4 rainfall simulation the rainfall simulator was composed of a water source pipeline pump rainfall control cabinet rain shelter and a spraco cone jet nozzle liu et al 2016b the rainfall process was computer operated and supported by manual operation the rainfall intensity was adjusted by regulating the water pressure of the pump and nozzle sizes which could range from 10 to 300 mm h 1 the height of the rainfall simulator was 22 4 m so that the final raindrop speed was similar to that of the natural rainfall before it reached the soil surface the simulated raindrops were produced by two opposite nozzles before each rainfall simulation several rainfall collection buckets were set up within the effective rainfall range with a density of 20 20 cm and the uniformity of the simulated rainfall device was calculated at a 10 min rainfall with intensity of 60 mm h 1 under 5 times repetitions and the rainfall uniformity coefficient was more than 85 in this study the representative erosive rainfall intensities 60 and 120 mm h 1 were conducted considering the high intensity and short duration rainstorms that occur in the humid hilly region of south china respectively liu et al 2016a zhang et al 2020 prior to the simulation calibrations of the rainfall intensity and uniformity were conducted the test plot was pre wetted with a low intensity rainfall 10 mm h 1 to eliminate the difference in antecedent soil moisture cao et al 2015 and prior surface levelling was undertaken to minimize differences in microtopographic variations jiang et al 2018 li and pan 2018 through these measures the micro topography early soil moisture and dry bulk weight of the whole block were basically the same before each experiment rainfall simulations were conducted with 90 minute duration during each simulated rainfall event the initial generation time of surface and subsurface flow were recorded three bottles 200 ml for each of water mixed with sediment samples were collected at 3 minute intervals and then the mixed samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighed to determine the sediment concentration and soil loss rate the surface flow velocity was measured by a kmno4 solution coloration at 15 minute intervals after rainfall simulation and each measure interval was repeated four times simultaneously three bottles of 100 ml mixed water and sediment samples were collected to test the eroded sediment particle size the sediment samples were analyzed by the malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk the instrument s agitator speed was 2500 r min 1 and the range of shading and measurement were 20 30 and 0 01 2000 μm respectively liu et al 2016a each sample was transferred to the fluid module that contained 1 7 l of deionized water 20 c and then subjected to three consecutive 1 minute runs at a pump speed of 8 to12 l min 1 shi et al 2013 and the particle diameter of the total cumulative sediment particles of 50 d50 were calculated the sediment particle sizes under different treatments were compared based on sediment median size d50 sadeghi et al 2018 when the rainfall simulation was complete a lagged subsurface flow was collected to calculate its total generation amount 2 5 data

surface flow generation differed more significantly under lower rainfall intensity fig 2 when the rainfall intensity was 60 mm h 1 ri60 the average surface flow coefficient on bare soil was 58 8 while the values sharply decreased to 42 1 on lc30 and 30 0 on lc70 with values of 17 1 on ec30 and 12 5 on ec70 table 2 the ratios of bare soil surface flow coefficient divided by the values of grass treatments ranged from 1 4 to 4 7 for the 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity ri120 the ratios became lower with values ranging from 1 1 to 1 3 particularly the average surface flow coefficient of bsp was 88 2 while those of lc30 and lc70 were 83 1 and 72 5 and those of ec30 and ec70 were 80 0 and 69 4 respectively 3 2 subsurface flow generation the subsurface flow of the grass covered plots was higher than that of the bsp table 3 the bsp displayed the lowest average subsurface flow coefficient with values ranging from 4 8 to 13 0 under ri60 and from 1 0 to 5 5 under ri120 furthermore the lowest mean subsurface flow was 185 ml ri60 and 172 ml ri120 with poor vegetation cover conditions on the bsp followed by lc30 with values of 216 ml ri60 and 293 ml ri120 the subsurface flow initial generation mean 27 min took more time than the surface flow mean 8 min fig 3 shows the subsurface flow coefficient of the entire duration in the experimental process compared to the l perenne plots the e ophiuroides plots contributed more to increasing the subsurface flow the mean subsurface flow coefficients were 28 7 on ec30 and 48 7 on ec70 under ri60 which were 20 1 and 32 2 larger than those on lc30 and lc70 respectively for the ri120 the l perenne plots produced slightly more subsurface flow than the e ophiuroides plots during the early stage with lc30 and lc70 starting to be lower than ec30 and ec70 after 48 and 30 min respectively eventually with the increase in the rainfall duration the fluctuation of subsurface flow in each experimental plot stabilized 3 3 sediment yield the influence of different land cover types on the sediment yield is shown in table 4 the mean value of sediment concentration and soil loss rate generally decreased with increasing coverage the bsp had the higher mean sediment concentration with values of 6 0 and 4 9 times higher than e ophiuroides and l perenne respectively similarly the highest mean soil loss rate occurred on the bsp with values of 4 3 g m 2 min 1 under ri60 and 17 1 g m 2 min 1 under ri120 the soil loss rate on e ophiuroides plots was less than that on l perenne plots fig 4 ec30 contributed more to reducing the soil loss rate with mean values of 0 4 and 1 8 g m 2 min 1 for ri60 and ri120 which were 4 0 and 3 2 times lower than those observed for lc30 respectively moreover lc70 had a higher soil loss rate than ec70 with an average of 0 4 and 2 1 g m 2 min 1 for ri60 and ri120 respectively the values being 4 0 and 2 3 times higher than those recorded for the e ophiuroides plots furthermore the generation time of the sediment yield on e ophiuroides plots was relatively later than on other land cover types under ri60 with values of 27 min on 30 cover and 33 min on 70 cover the standard deviations of the soil loss rate for bsp were significantly higher than that for the grass covered plots once the plots were covered with grass the values of these standard deviations fell below 1 0 3 4 hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics the flow velocity decreased with the increase in grass coverage as shown in table 5 the flow velocity reached its maximum on the bsp with values being 6 1 10 2 and 9 4 10 2 m s under ri60 and ri120 respectively the mean v decreased from 2 5 10 2 to 2 3 10 2 m s during ri60 and from 3 4 10 2 to 2 8 10 2 m s during ri120 when the coverage increased from 30 to 70 for the e ophiuroides plots the similar variation trend was observed for the l perenne plots in addition e ophiuroides was more effective in reducing the flow velocity than l perenne for example when the rainfall was 60 mm h 1 the mean v on ec30 was 1 8 10 2 m s lower than that on lc30 and that on ec70 was 1 6 10 2 m s lower than that on lc70 the significance statistics showed that mean re increased from 10 62 ri60 to 51 52 ri120 with the increase of rainfall intensity table 6 the lower coverage of grass plots led to relatively higher re the mean re of e ophiuroides plots decreased from 3 58 to 2 63 as the coverage increased from 30 to 70 under ri60 and that of l perenne plots declined from 20 26 to 14 74 under the same conditions the re for ec30 and lc30 was 56 15 and 52 08 under ri120 with mean values of 7 52 and 6 64 higher than ec70 and lc70 respectively in addition re ranged from 0 84 to 56 16 for all treatments which suggested that the experimental overland flows were regarded as laminar flows re 500 according to the open channel standard fr for the bsp kept ranged from 1 24 to 2 01 being the highest when compared to the grass covered plots fr 1 with mean values of 1 41 ri60 and 1 31 ri120 the lowest mean value of f was found for the bsp ranging from 11 25 to 23 99 during ri60 and from 17 03 to 29 38 during ri120 similarly the f for the e ophiuroides plots for 70 cover was 930 43 under ri120 with values of 351 78 higher than that for 30 cover the f for the l perenne plots varied very little from 128 02 to 126 39 respectively the lowest n was recorded for the bsp with mean values of 0 12 ri60 and 0 17 ri120 there was a slight shift in mean τ from 2 41 to 9 82 n m 2 during ri60 while a sharper fluctuation was observed under ri120 ranging from 12 25 to 36 82 n m 2 statistical analysis showed that the e ophiuroides plots had the lowest mean τ amongst the plots with an average value of 2 94 n m 2 on ec30 and 2 41 n m 2 on ec70 under ri60 with regard to w the mean values for the l perenne plots were 0 42 and 0 31 j m 2 s 1 for low and high coverage during ri60 which were approximately 5 66 and 5 60 times more than the corresponding values for the e ophiuroides plots 3 5 correlation analysis as shown in fig 5 the surface flow had positive relations with some hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters p 0 05 with the correlation coefficients in the descending order of re ω τ f n v this indicated that flow regimes had considerable effects on overland flow generation additionally the w has a stronger correlation with the surface flow compared with the τ the subsurface flow showed a significantly negative relationship with v and sc which can reflect soil erosion and sediment yield the movement of sediment is based on runoff as the driving force thereby the hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameter of runoff profoundly affected the sediment transportation the velocity is a crucial hydraulic parameter influencing sediment transport capacity specifically the sediment concentration was positively correlated with v and fr whereas it decreased with increasing values of f n and τ the f was expected to increase with the increments of n and τ in contrast with velocity re and w were poor predictors for sediment concentration generally the correlation of each hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameter was mainly dependent on grass species soil property rainfall intensity and surface roughness the combination of multiple hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters can lead to more rational and scientific analysis of soil and water erosion process 4 discussion 4 1 effects of grass species on runoff components in this study the maximum distribution proportion of the surface flow more than 15 0 and the minimum subsurface flow 2 0 were observed for the bsp when the l perenne plots were exposed to ri60 the increment of coverage increased the subsurface flow rate from 2 0 to 4 4 and decreased the surface flow rate from 27 2 to 19 9 similar observations were recorded for the e ophiuroides plots the conclusion aligned with the finding of zhou and shangguan 2007 who explained that the contribution of grass canopy to runoff reduction performed best for l perenne plots based on rainfall simulation the above ground parts of grass could reduce soil temperatures and evaporation by shading the soil surface thus improving soil water storage capacity zhang et al 2022 furthermore grass could form root channels which facilitate water entry increase soil porosity and infiltration stolon and erect grass species played various roles in surface subsurface flow generation by affecting the rainfall redistribution zhang et al 2018 tu et al 2021 e ophiuroides accounted for less proportion of surface flow 18 8 and more proportion of subsurface flow 6 7 with mean values of 9 3 lower and 3 1 higher than the l perenne plots respectively in addition the proportion of surface flow was significantly larger than that of the subsurface flow except for the e ophiuroides plot under ri60 in this study whose subsurface flow accounted for 7 0 and 11 4 for 30 and 70 coverage the values being 3 5 and 9 1 larger than those of the surface flow respectively the runoff interception efficiency of e ophiuroides was the highest reaching 72 0 at low cover and 79 0 at high cover these results above indicated stolon grass had higher water retention capacity to regulate rainfall runoff relationship compared to erect grass wei et al 2014 this is probably owing to different mulching patterns and morphology of stolon and erect grass the stolons of e ophiuroides spread out in all directions and formed a net like structure thus gradually reducing the flow velocity increasing flow tortuosity and providing sufficient time for infiltration li and pan 2018 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021b local investigation in south china found that l perenne has a higher stalk height than e ophiuroides the higher leaves and cluster stems of the l perenne above ground caused a higher significant rainfall interception however the shorter but stronger spread ability of the stolon grass could easily receive a higher surface coverage which was more crucial in reducing soil crust formation gao et al 2017 digiovanni white et al 2018 once the soil crust existed more and faster surface flow generated and this more important under the higher rainfall intensity gómez and nearing 2005 besides the erect grass had a relatively weaker impact in retaining and intercepting rainfall due to its tender canopies and thin leaves li et al 2021 wang et al 2021b zhou and shangguan 2007 also proposed that soil infiltration rate had linear correlation with root density based on field investigation and literature the e ophiuroides formed dense fine root networks which played a predominant role in retaining rainfall altering the distribution of raindrops and enhancing soil infiltration capacity compared with bare soil land and erect grass e ophiuroides stolon grass was observed to perform best in delaying the time of surface flow generation by contrast l perenne erect grass had a tufted morphology and sparse roots resulting in relatively less soil porosity 4 2 effects of grass species on hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics excepted for the role of grass in altering rainfall redistribution stolon and erect grass species exerted different effects on flow pathway dong et al 2018 wang et al 2021b which led to the differences of water flow movement and hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics wei et al 2014 nicosia et al 2020 the maximum v occurred on the bsp while e ophiuroides and l perenne effectively decreased mean v by 64 1 and 38 4 respectively the mean v for the e ophiuroides plots 2 7 10 2 m s was significantly lower than that for the l perenne plots 4 7 10 2 m s which is confirmed by zhang et al 2020 who explained that the difference in v variation between two grass species melinis minutifora and chrysopogon zizanioides was mainly due to their grass components the creeping interlaced roots of the e ophiuroides grass had the more capability in intercepting and slowing down the surface flow even under a low coverage though the l perenne had dense roots and stems above ground the erect root systems still provided numerous gaps to allow surface flow to path through moreover the creeping interlaced roots provided a higher surface roughness nearby the ground than the erect roots system pan et al 2019 li et al 2021 duan et al 2022 the hydraulic parameters like f fr and n also proved the differences the f for the grass covered plots was higher than that for the bsp with mean values of 397 74 e ophiuroides plots and 91 26 l perenne plots higher than bsp 21 49 respectively the mean fr values for the bsp were clearly more than one while for the grass covered plots were below one some observations have demonstrated the impacts and differences of grass species above and below ground parts in altering the surface flow hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters pan et al 2016 li et al 2021 li et al 2021 also revealed that grass stems leaves and roots played important roles in increasing the critical hydrodynamic forces and resistance coefficient thus reducing flow velocity and stream power specifically the grass stems and leaves change the diameter of the raindrops by intercepting and buffering them hence attenuating their kinetic energy zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the denser root systems of e ophiuroides could significantly promote the soil agglomerate formation and enhance soil erosion resistance through the interpenetration and entanglement of soil particles xiao et al 2011 li et al 2021 jafarpoor et al 2022 the root diameter of e ophiuroides was coarser and thicker than l perenne which decreased the soil erodibility better because fine roots could attain the quicker root growth and decay than coarse roots fattet et al 2011 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2021a additionally the e ophiuroides was composed of large amount of dense fibrous roots which could cause wrapping and twisting of the surrounding soil mass in a three dimensional stress state hence the soil shear strength was enhanced li et al 2021 wang et al 2021a b 4 3 effects of grass species on soil loss a comprehensive understanding of the impact of runoff processes hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics on sediment yield would greatly facilitate future soil erosion control duan et al 2022 specifically raindrops fall from a high altitude with speed and energy transforming the potential energy of water droplets into kinetic energy which damage soil structure disperse the soil aggregates and produce more transportable sediment jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 the largest mean sediment concentration soil loss and d50 values were found on bare soil land table 4 fig 6 the conclusion was consistent with the results of zhou and shangguan 2007 who reported the greater capability of l perenne in reducing soil loss compared with bare soil explanations were found in fattet et al 2011 and hatefi et al 2020 who proposed that grass roots could contributed to suppressing the movement of sediments by releasing root exudates which increased the soil particle viscosity and soil aggregate stability furthermore ten grasslands were investigated by wang et al 2018 who demonstrated that grass species and their root systems could significantly change the process of soil detachment and result in great differences in sediment yield in general grass improved soil physical properties and enhanced their anti scouring ability through the interpenetration and winding of soil particles thus reducing sediment concentrations and soil loss guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 the results revealed that the sediment yield decreased with the increment of grass density li et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 as the grass coverage increased from 30 to 70 the sediment concentration decreased by 44 5 and 60 0 on e ophiuroides and l perenne plots respectively moreover the results showed d50 decreased with increasing coverage consistent with the variation trends of surface flow and velocity with grass density when grass coverage increased from 30 to 70 the e ophiuroides and l perenne plots presented a decreasing average d50 varying from 36 3 to 28 5 μm and 61 4 to 55 7 μm respectively fig 7 many previous experiments from different regions also highlighted that the increased grass cover further weakened the impact of raindrop splash erosion reduced the transportation capacity of overland flow and trapped sediment li et al 2009 sun et al 2019 jafarpoor et al 2022 distinct response of sediment yield and soil erosion processes appeared among stolon and erect grass species li and pan 2018 statistics indicated that d50 for stolon grass was smaller than that of erect grass the lowest d50 occurred for the e ophiuroides plots with total average values of 32 4 μm moreover the mean d50 and soil loss rate for the l perenne plots were 1 8 and 3 1 times higher than that for the e ophiuroides plots respectively these results suggested that the stolon grass performed better in depressing flow scouring and shearing on the surface and improving the efficiency of soil erosion reduction an explanation reported by zheng et al 2008 and duan et al 2016 was that grass canopies and roots were critical factors that determined the magnitude of soil loss e ophiuroides had relatively higher root density and larger root diameter and these root traits were experimentally confirmed to reduce soil detachment and transportation by wang et al 2018 and wang et al 2021a according to some studies grass components affected the composition and structure of soil particles as well as the vertical movement channel and flow section of soil water thus changing the water and sediment movement and forming rill erosion cao et al 2015 wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 8 the rill erosion dominated the bare land plots especially under larger rainfall intensity and the concentrated water flowed faster along the multiple rills which was also observed by previous research gyssels and poesen 2003 palmeri et al 2018 pan et al 2019 suggested that the grass measures could control the development and occurrence of rill erosion there was no obvious rills development on the e ophiuroides plots in our experiments however the erect grass of l perenne made the surface flow channel relatively narrow and curved resulting in the development of rills which increased sediment yield and soil loss several times zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2021a jafarpoor et al 2022 the roles of grass and their components decreased with increasing rainfall intensities zhang et al 2020 li et al 2021 the study found that the mean d50 under ri60 35 4 μm was significantly lower than that under ri120 65 2 μm this was related to stronger raindrop splash and runoff scouring influenced by increasing precipitation arnaez et al 2007 elucidated that grass was more conducive to erosion caused by low rainfall intensity specifically the heavy precipitation events accelerate soil erosion causing the disruption of soil aggregates and produce more transportable sediment and the ability of grass to trap sediment would be weakened nespoulous et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the integration of grass planting and other supplemental measures should be implemented scientifically in some extreme rainfall events kheirfam et al 2020 noteworthy even under heavy rainfall with intensity of 120 mm h 1 the sediment conservation efficiency of e ophiuroides reached 88 0 at low cover and 94 0 at high cover with values of 30 0 and 10 0 higher than l perenne respectively thus the stolon grass showed a considerable improvement in sediment and flow trapping efficacy which was more important to control the concentrated flow scouring under extreme rainfall events 5 conclusions this study focused on exploring two grass species on surface subsurface flow generation sediment loss and hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics in the red soil hilly region the surface flow and sediment generation on bare land were significantly higher compared to grass covered land indicating that grass species played important roles in controlling soil loss the e ophiuroides plots generally showed the lower surface flow and higher subsurface flow than the l perenne plots the lower fr and higher f occurred on e ophiuroides compared to other treatments all the experimental plots exhibited laminar flow re 100 the mean velocity was in the decreasing order of bare plot l perenne e ophiuroides these results highlighted that e ophiuroides performed better than l perenne in soil and water conservation the different roles of the two grass species in controlling soil erosion are mainly due to their above ground canopy density leaf area quality and hardness stem etc and under ground parts root systems etc grass coverage and rainfall intensity were important determinants of soil erosion stolon grass represented by e ophiuroides performed the best in controlling soil loss than erect grass represented by l perenne even in low coverage and high rainfall intensity the practical benefits of stolon grass were more available and easier to achieve in the fields therefore stolon grass such as e ophiuroides is highly recommended for soil and water conservation when concerned with concentration flow scouring and extreme rainfall events in the changing

2451,grass planting is an important and typical measure for soil and water conservation while the roles of stolon and erect grass species in affecting surface subsurface flow and soil erosion processes are little understood experimental plots 2 m 0 5 m 0 5 m using red soil with two rainfall intensities 60 and 120 mm h 1 and grass coverage 30 and 70 were conducted in laboratory rainfall simulation experiments two common and endemic stolon eremochloa ophiuroides and erect lolium perenne grass species were selected due to their fast growth power adaptability and wide application in reducing runoff and soil loss and the bare soil plot was set up as the control the results showed that bare plot had the highest mean surface flow coefficient 73 5 and then were l perenne 57 1 and e ophiuroides 44 9 the mean subsurface flow coefficients were found in order of e ophiuroides 25 7 l perenne 13 0 and bare plot 7 2 the role of stolon grass rather than erect grass in reducing surface flow but improving subsurface flow led to lower surface flow hydraulic characteristics such as flow velocity reynolds number darcy weisbach coefficient and manning friction coefficient and hydrodynamic characteristics like flow shear stress and stream power furthermore the stolon grass generated the lowest soil loss rate 0 8 g m 2 min 1 while the values on erect grass and bare plot were 2 5 and 10 7 g m 2 min 1 respectively the indicator of eroded sediment median size also proved the higher efficiency of stolon grass in soil loss control with values of 31 8 58 6 and 69 6 μm on stolon grass erect grass and bare plots respectively the lower soil loss on stolon grass cover plot was attributed to the lower surface flow and hydraulic hydrodynamic characteristics the stolon grass was more sensitive to the coverage and rainfall intensity which was explained by the higher flow and sediment trapping capability 2 2 4 4 times under lower coverage and rainfall intensity than erect grass even under high rainfall intensity 1 1 3 2 times the stolon grass played more beneficial roles in soil and water conservation than erect grass which was closely related to above ground and under ground parts of grass this study can provide a better understanding of the roles of stolon and erect grass species for soil and water conservation and management practices keywords surface subsurface flow sediment hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics grass species rainfall simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion is a severe eco environmental concern that leads to the loss of soil organic matter fertility and nutrients thus causing the disruption of soil aggregates and affecting agricultural productivity particularly in the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events sadeghi et al 2020 li et al 2021 the soil erosion problems in the southern hilly region of china were caused by the interactions of high precipitation fragmented topography and intensive agricultural activities liu et al 2016a jiang et al 2018 duan et al 2022 vegetation plays a dominant role in alleviating soil erosion and regulating the relationship between runoff and sediment which is a widely adopted measure on hillslopes worldwide wuepper et al 2019 previous research has been conducted to analyze the effects of grass on overland flow and soil erosion processes pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 and the results reveal that the grass cover is effective in reducing runoff and sediment generation and increasing surface roughness zhang et al 2018 duan et al 2022 pan et al 2006 proposed that grass had more significant roles in sediment concentration than in surface runoff and the sediment reductions ranged from 45 to 85 on the loess plateau fattet et al 2011 indicated that grass was more conducive to soil aggregate stability and anti erosion than other vegetation types such as trees li and pan 2018 suggested that grass significantly reduced overland flow rate and velocity and sediment generation with average reductions of 22 29 and 67 respectively sun et al 2019 suggested that grass coverage could significantly affect runoff shear stress and sediment transport capacity by reducing the splash energy of raindrops many studies have also demonstrated that grass had important effects on facilitating water infiltration and improving the topsoil physical property tu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 furthermore grass has been known to help moderate extreme rainfall and balance water for farming which presents the advantages of reducing the rapid response of surface flow to extreme climate and safeguarding subsurface reservoirs li et al 2009 duan et al 2022 therefore it is essential to utilize grass reasonably to reduce fluxes of eroding soil and regulate the relationship between runoff and sediment distinct response of runoff and sediment processes appeared among different grass species zheng et al 2008 wei et al 2014 el kateb et al 2013 highlighted the necessity of selecting suitable grass species for the region to maximize its water and soil control efficiency similar findings were also reported by li et al 2015 and duan et al 2016 that the grass species was the most significant factor affecting the frequency and intensity of soil loss a comparison on three grass species conducted by hatefi et al 2020 found that l prenne performed best in controlling runoff and soil loss compared with agropyron trichophorum and medicago sativafrom on small experimental plots duan et al 2022 demonstrated that the effects of three grass species trifolium repens cynodon dactylon and eremochloa ophiuroides on runoff hydrodynamic parameters and sediment reductions were evidently different exploring the roles of grass components stems leaves and roots etc on soil erosion has been shown to be meaningful for soil erosion control li and pan 2018 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021a b grass canopies increase water infiltration and reduce water hydraulic shear by intercepting rainfall zhang et al 2020 the grass roots can consolidate soil aggregate improve soil structure and reduce soil erosion wang et al 2021a inconsistent results regarding the effects of the above ground and under ground parts of grass on erosion controlling benefits exist de baets et al 2007 highlighted the above ground parts of grass could be considered as a key factor for reducing water erosion and increasing the surface resistance zhou and shangguan 2007 demonstrated that ryegrass could enhance the soil aggregate stability and the above ground parts contributed relatively more to reducing runoff while the root effect on soil loss reduction was greater than the shoot effect sadeghi et al 2017 scientifically proved that canopy can promote the formation of stemflow in favor of the water supply to roots thereby changing the redistribution of water in soil furthermore an experiment conducted by wang et al 2021a found that the root morphology traits of grass species can determine the soil detachment process especially the root surface area density grass density is recognized as a crucial factor in affecting soil and water conservation benefits of grass wei et al 2014 duan et al 2022 the reasonable grass density can effectively improve rainfall interception alter rill erosion and gully erosion fattet et al 2011 tong et al 2018 grass cover thresholds vary significantly in different climates and soils so the effective grass coverage needs to be site specific additionally frequent extreme rainfall events need more attention which exerted disproportionate impacts on the relationship between runoff and sediment wei et al 2014 pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the increase in extreme rainfall events possibly poses a significant threat to achieving sustainable water management wang et al 2020 therefore studying different grass measures under heavy rainfall has practical implications for soil and water conservation hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters which can indicate the mechanism of grass planting in water and soil erosion should be quantified jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 many studies have demonstrated that grass canopies and roots can decrease flow velocity v froude number fr flow shear stress τ and stream power ω increase the hydraulic resistance and weaken the kinetic energy pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 jafarpoor et al 2022 waldron and dakessian 1981 and wang et al 2021a indicated that the primary factors affecting these characteristics of runoff included the morphology and distribution of grass roots in soil jiang et al 2018 reported that the rill flow velocity was the most sensitive hydraulic parameter and the flow power provided the optimal hydrodynamic parameter to characterize the dynamic mechanisms of soil erosion zhang et al 2020 explored the effects of canopies and root systems of two grasses m minutifora and c zizanioides and found they effectively decreased flow velocities v by 35 and 30 and increased darcy weisbach friction coefficients f by 240 and 131 compared to the control treatments respectively however the effects of grass species on the hydraulic and hydrodynamic processes still need to be supplemented by subsequent in depth research wei et al 2014 li et al 2021 numerous studies mainly focus on the effects of grass species from the perspective of surface flow or sediments while ignoring its impact on subsurface flow generation especially for red soil zhou and shangguan 2007 el kateb et al 2013 wang et al 2021b red soil hilly regions are subject to high temperature concentrated precipitation and some unreasonable farming activities resulting in serious water and soil loss the red tillage soil is mainly composed of a loose porous and highly permeable top layer while a compact and weakly permeable bottom layer ma et al 2022 which facilitates the lateral flow of runoff after infiltration to form subsurface flow liu et al 2016b the soil covered by dense grass can significantly increase the soil infiltration and promote the subsurface flow generation zheng et al 2014 indicated that subsurface flow accounted for 52 68 of the total runoff on red soil sloping farmland through simulated laboratory rainfall experiments nespoulous et al 2019 proposed grass diversity and their fine roots were significant for promoting the incidence of subsurface flow thus reducing water and soil erosion in tropical ferralsols while the roles of stolon and erect grass species on surface subsurface flow are still unclear in this study two common native grass species e ophiuroides stolon type and l perenne erect type were selected in the rainfall simulation experiment they were widely used in ecological restoration in the red soil hilly region of south china owing to their rapid growth strong tillering ability and large biomass the study objectives were to identify the roles of stolon and erect grass species on the spatial vertical distribution of surface flow and subsurface flow test the efficiencies of two grass species on sediment trapping and reveal the soil erosion mechanisms from the perspective of hydraulics and hydrodynamics the results can provide references for guiding the choice of grass species for soil and water conservation 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 study area and experimental soil the study area is located in the soil and water conservation ecological technology park in the de an county of jiangxi province approximately between 29 14 29 29 n and 115 32 115 45 e in the southern hilly region of china rugged hills and low mountains comprise this region the soil parent material is dominated by quaternary sediment and featured by the high erodibility cao et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 over 70 of the total annual precipitation primarily occurs between march and july mainly due to its subtropical monsoon climate the sloping farmland is the main land use type in the hilly red soil region meanwhile the high intensity sloping farmland cultivation coincided with the high intensity rainfall contributes more than half of soil erosion during the rainy season the experimental soil was collected from the 0 30 cm layer of the long term cultivated sloping farmland the soil texture was silty clay with clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm

soil plots were constructed of iron and steel plates in three replicates with the size of 2 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep fig 1 this small scale plot can simplify the process and minimize the uncertainties in a relatively homogeneous slope surface thereby excluding confounding factors other than vegetation sadeghi et al 2016 wang et al 2021b the experiment was conducted at a slope gradient of approximately 10 18 to simulate the typical gradient of the sloping farmland in the hilly red soil region liu et al 2016a b duan et al 2022 the soil was filled into the plot and compacted in every 5 cm layers and the soil used in each 5 cm layer was weighed to ensure the soil bulk density were compacted at 1 3 g cm 3 an upper outlet flush with topsoil was installed to collect the surface flow and sediment during the rainfall simulation and a lower outlet flush with the bottom of the soil plot was set up to collect the subsurface flow the outlet of the subsurface flow was set at a soil depth of 0 5 m which was collected into the flow storage container by a pipe connected to a hole that in the l type subsurface flow collector liu et al 2016b uniform small holes were arranged at the bottom of the soil plot to ensure that the water could flow freely downward the percolating water was collected by a plate that was set beneath the soil plot bottom before planting the studied grass on the plots artificial surface levelling was undertaken to minimize the impact of microtopographic changes li and pan 2018 2 3 grass planting and management two kinds of common native grasses e ophiuroides and l perenne were employed in this study which can function for soil and water conservation after 3 5 months growth li et al 2021 e ophiuroides is a perennial warm season grass with approximately 20 cm height and well developed strong stolons the fast growing perennial l perenne is suitable for the warm and humid climate which has skinny and supple erect stems with approximately 30 90 cm heights three surface coverage gradients were set a bare soil plot bsp as the control ec30 lc30 and ec70 lc70 represent e ophiuroides l perenne plots with 30 and 70 coverage respectively the two grass species were strip sowed on the soil plots and then managed by regular watering and fertilization until the desired coverage was achieved zhang et al 2018 once the grass coverage requirements 30 and 70 were met by digital image analysis the simulated rainfall tests were initiated the no grass ng plots were treated to the same watering and fertilization conditions as the grass covered plots all treatments were replicated thrice with complete combinations of coverage and rainfall intensity 2 4 rainfall simulation the rainfall simulator was composed of a water source pipeline pump rainfall control cabinet rain shelter and a spraco cone jet nozzle liu et al 2016b the rainfall process was computer operated and supported by manual operation the rainfall intensity was adjusted by regulating the water pressure of the pump and nozzle sizes which could range from 10 to 300 mm h 1 the height of the rainfall simulator was 22 4 m so that the final raindrop speed was similar to that of the natural rainfall before it reached the soil surface the simulated raindrops were produced by two opposite nozzles before each rainfall simulation several rainfall collection buckets were set up within the effective rainfall range with a density of 20 20 cm and the uniformity of the simulated rainfall device was calculated at a 10 min rainfall with intensity of 60 mm h 1 under 5 times repetitions and the rainfall uniformity coefficient was more than 85 in this study the representative erosive rainfall intensities 60 and 120 mm h 1 were conducted considering the high intensity and short duration rainstorms that occur in the humid hilly region of south china respectively liu et al 2016a zhang et al 2020 prior to the simulation calibrations of the rainfall intensity and uniformity were conducted the test plot was pre wetted with a low intensity rainfall 10 mm h 1 to eliminate the difference in antecedent soil moisture cao et al 2015 and prior surface levelling was undertaken to minimize differences in microtopographic variations jiang et al 2018 li and pan 2018 through these measures the micro topography early soil moisture and dry bulk weight of the whole block were basically the same before each experiment rainfall simulations were conducted with 90 minute duration during each simulated rainfall event the initial generation time of surface and subsurface flow were recorded three bottles 200 ml for each of water mixed with sediment samples were collected at 3 minute intervals and then the mixed samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighed to determine the sediment concentration and soil loss rate the surface flow velocity was measured by a kmno4 solution coloration at 15 minute intervals after rainfall simulation and each measure interval was repeated four times simultaneously three bottles of 100 ml mixed water and sediment samples were collected to test the eroded sediment particle size the sediment samples were analyzed by the malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk the instrument s agitator speed was 2500 r min 1 and the range of shading and measurement were 20 30 and 0 01 2000 μm respectively liu et al 2016a each sample was transferred to the fluid module that contained 1 7 l of deionized water 20 c and then subjected to three consecutive 1 minute runs at a pump speed of 8 to12 l min 1 shi et al 2013 and the particle diameter of the total cumulative sediment particles of 50 d50 were calculated the sediment particle sizes under different treatments were compared based on sediment median size d50 sadeghi et al 2018 when the rainfall simulation was complete a lagged subsurface flow was collected to calculate its total generation amount 2 5 data

zhang et al 2020 7 w τ v ρ g j q the pearson correlation analysis was conducted to describe the relationships between surface subsurface flow sediment concentration and hydraulic hydrodynamic parameters p value was 0 05 for significant difference 3 results 3 1 surface flow generation the grass significantly decreased the surface flow coefficient and the effect of two grass species in surface flow generation differed more significantly under lower rainfall intensity fig 2 when the rainfall intensity was 60 mm h 1 ri60 the average surface flow coefficient on bare soil was 58 8 while the values sharply decreased to 42 1 on lc30 and 30 0 on lc70 with values of 17 1 on ec30 and 12 5 on ec70 table 2 the ratios of bare soil surface flow coefficient divided by the values of grass treatments ranged from 1 4 to 4 7 for the 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity ri120 the ratios became lower with values ranging from 1 1 to 1 3 particularly the average surface flow coefficient of bsp was 88 2 while those of lc30 and lc70 were 83 1 and 72 5 and those of ec30 and ec70 were 80 0 and 69 4 respectively 3 2 subsurface flow generation the subsurface flow of the grass covered plots was higher than that of the bsp table 3 the bsp displayed the lowest average subsurface flow coefficient with values ranging from 4 8 to 13 0 under ri60 and from 1 0 to 5 5 under ri120 furthermore the lowest mean subsurface flow was 185 ml ri60 and 172 ml ri120 with poor vegetation cover conditions on the bsp followed by lc30 with values of 216 ml ri60 and 293 ml ri120 the subsurface flow initial generation mean 27 min took more time than the surface flow mean 8 min fig 3 shows the subsurface flow coefficient of the entire duration in the experimental process compared to the l perenne plots the e ophiuroides plots contributed more to increasing the subsurface flow the mean subsurface flow coefficients were 28 7 on ec30 and 48 7 on ec70 under ri60 which were 20 1 and 32 2 larger than those on lc30 and lc70 respectively for the ri120 the l perenne plots produced slightly more subsurface flow than the e ophiuroides plots during the early stage with lc30 and lc70 starting to be lower than ec30 and ec70 after 48 and 30 min respectively eventually with the increase in the rainfall duration the fluctuation of subsurface flow in each experimental plot stabilized 3 3 sediment yield the influence of different land cover types on the sediment yield is shown in table 4 the mean value of sediment concentration and soil loss rate generally decreased with increasing coverage the bsp had the higher mean sediment concentration with values of 6 0 and 4 9 times higher than e ophiuroides and l perenne respectively similarly the highest mean soil loss rate occurred on the bsp with values of 4 3 g m 2 min 1 under ri60 and 17 1 g m 2 min 1 under ri120 the soil loss rate on e ophiuroides plots was less than that on l perenne plots fig 4 ec30 contributed more to reducing the soil loss rate with mean values of 0 4 and 1 8 g m 2 min 1 for ri60 and ri120 which were 4 0 and 3 2 times lower than those observed for lc30 respectively moreover lc70 had a higher soil loss rate than ec70 with an average of 0 4 and 2 1 g m 2 min 1 for ri60 and ri120 respectively the values being 4 0 and 2 3 times higher than those recorded for the e ophiuroides plots furthermore the generation time of the sediment yield on e ophiuroides plots was relatively later than on other land cover types under ri60 with values of 27 min on 30 cover and 33 min on 70 cover the standard deviations of the soil loss rate for bsp were significantly higher than that for the grass covered plots once the plots were covered with grass the values of these standard deviations fell below 1 0 3 4 hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics the flow velocity decreased with the increase in grass coverage as shown in table 5 the flow velocity reached its maximum on the bsp with values being 6 1 10 2 and 9 4 10 2 m s under ri60 and ri120 respectively the mean v decreased from 2 5 10 2 to 2 3 10 2 m s during ri60 and from 3 4 10 2 to 2 8 10 2 m s during ri120 when the coverage increased from 30 to 70 for the e ophiuroides plots the similar variation trend was observed for the l perenne plots in addition e ophiuroides was more effective in reducing the flow velocity than l perenne for example when the rainfall was 60 mm h 1 the mean v on ec30 was 1 8 10 2 m s lower than that on lc30 and that on ec70 was 1 6 10 2 m s lower than that on lc70 the significance statistics showed that mean re increased from 10 62 ri60 to 51 52 ri120 with the increase of rainfall intensity table 6 the lower coverage of grass plots led to relatively higher re the mean re of e ophiuroides plots decreased from 3 58 to 2 63 as the coverage increased from 30 to 70 under ri60 and that of l perenne plots declined from 20 26 to 14 74 under the same conditions the re for ec30 and lc30 was 56 15 and 52 08 under ri120 with mean values of 7 52 and 6 64 higher than ec70 and lc70 respectively in addition re ranged from 0 84 to 56 16 for all treatments which suggested that the experimental overland flows were regarded as laminar flows re 500 according to the open channel standard fr for the bsp kept ranged from 1 24 to 2 01 being the highest when compared to the grass covered plots fr 1 with mean values of 1 41 ri60 and 1 31 ri120 the lowest mean value of f was found for the bsp ranging from 11 25 to 23 99 during ri60 and from 17 03 to 29 38 during ri120 similarly the f for the e ophiuroides plots for 70 cover was 930 43 under ri120 with values of 351 78 higher than that for 30 cover the f for the l perenne plots varied very little from 128 02 to 126 39 respectively the lowest n was recorded for the bsp with mean values of 0 12 ri60 and 0 17 ri120 there was a slight shift in mean τ from 2 41 to 9 82 n m 2 during ri60 while a sharper fluctuation was observed under ri120 ranging from 12 25 to 36 82 n m 2 statistical analysis showed that the e ophiuroides plots had the lowest mean τ amongst the plots with an average value of 2 94 n m 2 on ec30 and 2 41 n m 2 on ec70 under ri60 with regard to w the mean values for the l perenne plots were 0 42 and 0 31 j m 2 s 1 for low and high coverage during ri60 which were approximately 5 66 and 5 60 times more than the corresponding values for the e ophiuroides plots 3 5 correlation analysis as shown in fig 5 the surface flow had positive relations with some hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters p 0 05 with the correlation coefficients in the descending order of re ω τ f n v this indicated that flow regimes had considerable effects on overland flow generation additionally the w has a stronger correlation with the surface flow compared with the τ the subsurface flow showed a significantly negative relationship with v and sc which can reflect soil erosion and sediment yield the movement of sediment is based on runoff as the driving force thereby the hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameter of runoff profoundly affected the sediment transportation the velocity is a crucial hydraulic parameter influencing sediment transport capacity specifically the sediment concentration was positively correlated with v and fr whereas it decreased with increasing values of f n and τ the f was expected to increase with the increments of n and τ in contrast with velocity re and w were poor predictors for sediment concentration generally the correlation of each hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameter was mainly dependent on grass species soil property rainfall intensity and surface roughness the combination of multiple hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters can lead to more rational and scientific analysis of soil and water erosion process 4 discussion 4 1 effects of grass species on runoff components in this study the maximum distribution proportion of the surface flow more than 15 0 and the minimum subsurface flow 2 0 were observed for the bsp when the l perenne plots were exposed to ri60 the increment of coverage increased the subsurface flow rate from 2 0 to 4 4 and decreased the surface flow rate from 27 2 to 19 9 similar observations were recorded for the e ophiuroides plots the conclusion aligned with the finding of zhou and shangguan 2007 who explained that the contribution of grass canopy to runoff reduction performed best for l perenne plots based on rainfall simulation the above ground parts of grass could reduce soil temperatures and evaporation by shading the soil surface thus improving soil water storage capacity zhang et al 2022 furthermore grass could form root channels which facilitate water entry increase soil porosity and infiltration stolon and erect grass species played various roles in surface subsurface flow generation by affecting the rainfall redistribution zhang et al 2018 tu et al 2021 e ophiuroides accounted for less proportion of surface flow 18 8 and more proportion of subsurface flow 6 7 with mean values of 9 3 lower and 3 1 higher than the l perenne plots respectively in addition the proportion of surface flow was significantly larger than that of the subsurface flow except for the e ophiuroides plot under ri60 in this study whose subsurface flow accounted for 7 0 and 11 4 for 30 and 70 coverage the values being 3 5 and 9 1 larger than those of the surface flow respectively the runoff interception efficiency of e ophiuroides was the highest reaching 72 0 at low cover and 79 0 at high cover these results above indicated stolon grass had higher water retention capacity to regulate rainfall runoff relationship compared to erect grass wei et al 2014 this is probably owing to different mulching patterns and morphology of stolon and erect grass the stolons of e ophiuroides spread out in all directions and formed a net like structure thus gradually reducing the flow velocity increasing flow tortuosity and providing sufficient time for infiltration li and pan 2018 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021b local investigation in south china found that l perenne has a higher stalk height than e ophiuroides the higher leaves and cluster stems of the l perenne above ground caused a higher significant rainfall interception however the shorter but stronger spread ability of the stolon grass could easily receive a higher surface coverage which was more crucial in reducing soil crust formation gao et al 2017 digiovanni white et al 2018 once the soil crust existed more and faster surface flow generated and this more important under the higher rainfall intensity gómez and nearing 2005 besides the erect grass had a relatively weaker impact in retaining and intercepting rainfall due to its tender canopies and thin leaves li et al 2021 wang et al 2021b zhou and shangguan 2007 also proposed that soil infiltration rate had linear correlation with root density based on field investigation and literature the e ophiuroides formed dense fine root networks which played a predominant role in retaining rainfall altering the distribution of raindrops and enhancing soil infiltration capacity compared with bare soil land and erect grass e ophiuroides stolon grass was observed to perform best in delaying the time of surface flow generation by contrast l perenne erect grass had a tufted morphology and sparse roots resulting in relatively less soil porosity 4 2 effects of grass species on hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics excepted for the role of grass in altering rainfall redistribution stolon and erect grass species exerted different effects on flow pathway dong et al 2018 wang et al 2021b which led to the differences of water flow movement and hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics wei et al 2014 nicosia et al 2020 the maximum v occurred on the bsp while e ophiuroides and l perenne effectively decreased mean v by 64 1 and 38 4 respectively the mean v for the e ophiuroides plots 2 7 10 2 m s was significantly lower than that for the l perenne plots 4 7 10 2 m s which is confirmed by zhang et al 2020 who explained that the difference in v variation between two grass species melinis minutifora and chrysopogon zizanioides was mainly due to their grass components the creeping interlaced roots of the e ophiuroides grass had the more capability in intercepting and slowing down the surface flow even under a low coverage though the l perenne had dense roots and stems above ground the erect root systems still provided numerous gaps to allow surface flow to path through moreover the creeping interlaced roots provided a higher surface roughness nearby the ground than the erect roots system pan et al 2019 li et al 2021 duan et al 2022 the hydraulic parameters like f fr and n also proved the differences the f for the grass covered plots was higher than that for the bsp with mean values of 397 74 e ophiuroides plots and 91 26 l perenne plots higher than bsp 21 49 respectively the mean fr values for the bsp were clearly more than one while for the grass covered plots were below one some observations have demonstrated the impacts and differences of grass species above and below ground parts in altering the surface flow hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters pan et al 2016 li et al 2021 li et al 2021 also revealed that grass stems leaves and roots played important roles in increasing the critical hydrodynamic forces and resistance coefficient thus reducing flow velocity and stream power specifically the grass stems and leaves change the diameter of the raindrops by intercepting and buffering them hence attenuating their kinetic energy zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the denser root systems of e ophiuroides could significantly promote the soil agglomerate formation and enhance soil erosion resistance through the interpenetration and entanglement of soil particles xiao et al 2011 li et al 2021 jafarpoor et al 2022 the root diameter of e ophiuroides was coarser and thicker than l perenne which decreased the soil erodibility better because fine roots could attain the quicker root growth and decay than coarse roots fattet et al 2011 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2021a additionally the e ophiuroides was composed of large amount of dense fibrous roots which could cause wrapping and twisting of the surrounding soil mass in a three dimensional stress state hence the soil shear strength was enhanced li et al 2021 wang et al 2021a b 4 3 effects of grass species on soil loss a comprehensive understanding of the impact of runoff processes hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics on sediment yield would greatly facilitate future soil erosion control duan et al 2022 specifically raindrops fall from a high altitude with speed and energy transforming the potential energy of water droplets into kinetic energy which damage soil structure disperse the soil aggregates and produce more transportable sediment jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 the largest mean sediment concentration soil loss and d50 values were found on bare soil land table 4 fig 6 the conclusion was consistent with the results of zhou and shangguan 2007 who reported the greater capability of l perenne in reducing soil loss compared with bare soil explanations were found in fattet et al 2011 and hatefi et al 2020 who proposed that grass roots could contributed to suppressing the movement of sediments by releasing root exudates which increased the soil particle viscosity and soil aggregate stability furthermore ten grasslands were investigated by wang et al 2018 who demonstrated that grass species and their root systems could significantly change the process of soil detachment and result in great differences in sediment yield in general grass improved soil physical properties and enhanced their anti scouring ability through the interpenetration and winding of soil particles thus reducing sediment concentrations and soil loss guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 the results revealed that the sediment yield decreased with the increment of grass density li et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 as the grass coverage increased from 30 to 70 the sediment concentration decreased by 44 5 and 60 0 on e ophiuroides and l perenne plots respectively moreover the results showed d50 decreased with increasing coverage consistent with the variation trends of surface flow and velocity with grass density when grass coverage increased from 30 to 70 the e ophiuroides and l perenne plots presented a decreasing average d50 varying from 36 3 to 28 5 μm and 61 4 to 55 7 μm respectively fig 7 many previous experiments from different regions also highlighted that the increased grass cover further weakened the impact of raindrop splash erosion reduced the transportation capacity of overland flow and trapped sediment li et al 2009 sun et al 2019 jafarpoor et al 2022 distinct response of sediment yield and soil erosion processes appeared among stolon and erect grass species li and pan 2018 statistics indicated that d50 for stolon grass was smaller than that of erect grass the lowest d50 occurred for the e ophiuroides plots with total average values of 32 4 μm moreover the mean d50 and soil loss rate for the l perenne plots were 1 8 and 3 1 times higher than that for the e ophiuroides plots respectively these results suggested that the stolon grass performed better in depressing flow scouring and shearing on the surface and improving the efficiency of soil erosion reduction an explanation reported by zheng et al 2008 and duan et al 2016 was that grass canopies and roots were critical factors that determined the magnitude of soil loss e ophiuroides had relatively higher root density and larger root diameter and these root traits were experimentally confirmed to reduce soil detachment and transportation by wang et al 2018 and wang et al 2021a according to some studies grass components affected the composition and structure of soil particles as well as the vertical movement channel and flow section of soil water thus changing the water and sediment movement and forming rill erosion cao et al 2015 wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 8 the rill erosion dominated the bare land plots especially under larger rainfall intensity and the concentrated water flowed faster along the multiple rills which was also observed by previous research gyssels and poesen 2003 palmeri et al 2018 pan et al 2019 suggested that the grass measures could control the development and occurrence of rill erosion there was no obvious rills development on the e ophiuroides plots in our experiments however the erect grass of l perenne made the surface flow channel relatively narrow and curved resulting in the development of rills which increased sediment yield and soil loss several times zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2021a jafarpoor et al 2022 the roles of grass and their components decreased with increasing rainfall intensities zhang et al 2020 li et al 2021 the study found that the mean d50 under ri60 35 4 μm was significantly lower than that under ri120 65 2 μm this was related to stronger raindrop splash and runoff scouring influenced by increasing precipitation arnaez et al 2007 elucidated that grass was more conducive to erosion caused by low rainfall intensity specifically the heavy precipitation events accelerate soil erosion causing the disruption of soil aggregates and produce more transportable sediment and the ability of grass to trap sediment would be weakened nespoulous et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the integration of grass planting and other supplemental measures should be implemented scientifically in some extreme rainfall events kheirfam et al 2020 noteworthy even under heavy rainfall with intensity of 120 mm h 1 the sediment conservation efficiency of e ophiuroides reached 88 0 at low cover and 94 0 at high cover with values of 30 0 and 10 0 higher than l perenne respectively thus the stolon grass showed a considerable improvement in sediment and flow trapping efficacy which was more important to control the concentrated flow scouring under extreme rainfall events 5 conclusions this study focused on exploring two grass species on surface subsurface flow generation sediment loss and hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics in the red soil hilly region the surface flow and sediment generation on bare land were significantly higher compared to grass covered land indicating that grass species played important roles in controlling soil loss the e ophiuroides plots generally showed the lower surface flow and higher subsurface flow than the l perenne plots the lower fr and higher f occurred on e ophiuroides compared to other treatments all the experimental plots exhibited laminar flow re 100 the mean velocity was in the decreasing order of bare plot l perenne e ophiuroides these results highlighted that e ophiuroides performed better than l perenne in soil and water conservation the different roles of the two grass species in controlling soil erosion are mainly due to their above ground canopy density leaf area quality and hardness stem etc and under ground parts root systems etc grass coverage and rainfall intensity were important determinants of soil erosion stolon grass represented by e ophiuroides performed the best in controlling soil loss than erect grass represented by l perenne even in low coverage and high rainfall intensity the practical benefits of stolon grass were more available and easier to achieve in the fields therefore stolon grass such as e ophiuroides is highly recommended for soil and water conservation when concerned with concentration flow scouring and extreme rainfall events in the changing

of materials the global energy balance biochemical cycles and water cycles yue et al 2019 taddeo et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 vegetation also tends to interfere with abnormal climatic phenomena environmental pollution and land management patterns which in turn complicate vegetation coverage trends and cause them to fluctuate or mutate zhong et al 2021 soab et al 2020 changes in any one of these factors can exert different influences on the growth and distribution of vegetation zhu et al 2020 thus given the background of global warming and environmental pollution analyzing the changing trends in vegetation coverage and investigating their response to changes in climate factors and environmental quality are both significant and of paramount importance for the protection and sustainable development of vegetation resources and the ecological environment carvalho et al 2019 huo et al 2021 liu et al 2021 vegetation coverage change is a complex long term process affected by climate change and human activities yang et al 2021 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which reflects the greenness growth and coverage of vegetation through red and near infrared reflection data is a mature index that is commonly used to depict the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation coverage and the connected spatial patterns bianchi et al 2019 michael et al 2003 hill et al 2004 chen et al 2021 esquerdo et al 2011 tang et al 2020 presently linear analyses especially piecewise linear regression pan et al 2018 jiang et al 2013 theil sen estimation fernandes and leblanc 2005 the mann kendall mk test bihrat et al 2012 and polynomial fit methods jamali et al 2014 have been applied to evaluate vegetation coverage changes tang et al 2020 pan et al 2018 however most time series analyses of vegetation coverage changes have focused only on linear and monotonic trends and ignored the implicit characteristics of nonlinear and gradual changes in ndvi trends gu et al 2018 cheng et al 2017 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the methods are unable to precisely analyze the spatiotemporal assessment of vegetation coverage change trends such that obvious greening trends can mask underlying vegetation browning yang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 numerous studies have attempted to establish a correlation between the ndvi and climate factors to better understand ecosystem changes under climatic impacts dong et al 2020 horák terra et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 vegetation growth in high latitudes and high altitude mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere is more affected by global warming and experiences more significant trends in vegetation greening and the extension of the growing season edwards and treitz 2017 in the arid and semiarid african continent research on the relationship between vegetation change and precipitation is more mature and can provide an important theoretical basis for analyzing the causes of vegetation change in arid areas of northwest china li et al 2021 jia et al 2011 in the belt and road region precipitation temperature and human activities have a high correlation with vegetation growth rainfall controlled areas are collectively distributed in arid semiarid and tropical regions yang et al 2020 in most parts of china the ndvi has a significant correlation with temperature and precipitation li et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 from 2000 to 2009 in the bohai region annual changes in the ndvi indicated a high correlation with precipitation and human activities liang et al 2015 temperature and precipitation are vital driving mechanisms that affect vegetation activities and their impacts on vegetation are spatially heterogeneous with changes in the temporal and spatial scales and the climate overall yang et al 2021 in addition some recent studies have indicated that the ndvi and particulate matter pm2 5 have relatively high correlations irga et al 2015 showed that in sydney australia the ndvi had a significant correlation with pm2 5 in beijing and henan province china the ndvi and pm2 5 also had a significant correlation wang et al 2016 du et al 2019 to investigate the mechanisms driving the spatiotemporal evolution of vegetation coverage studies have primarily focused on statistical analyses e g linear regression models correlation coefficients li et al 2021 du et al 2019 however such studies cannot reliably depict the response relationship of variables yang et al 2021 zahra et al 2020 thus to address the problems of spatial nonstationarity and heterogeneity geographically weighted regression gwr has been introduced to analyze the relationships between vegetation patterns and their influencing factors to effectively increase spatial locality wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the bohai region is the golden coast of northern china and is the core region of the belt and road initiative in recent decades rapid industrialization and urbanization have increased the intensity of human activities increasing chemical pollutant discharge population growth urban expansion etc in the bohai region and led to various environmental problems increasing aerosol concentrations decreasing wetlands reducing agricultural land vegetation degradation etc shi et al 2016 bo et al 2014 luo et al 2010 such that a remarkable conflict still exists between ecological conservation and economic growth chao et al 2017 zong et al 2021 therefore investigating vegetation coverage dynamics and their influencing factors is critical in the bohai region to protect vegetation improve the ecological environment and project future ecosystem dynamics and this approach can play a crucial role in promoting the green development of the belt and road initiative he et al 2018 with regard to changes in the ecological environment of the bohai economic zone this study aimed to identify the problems of spatiotemporal nonstationarity and the dependence between vegetation coverage and driving forces climate factors i e temperature precipitation and relative humidity and pm2 5 first the annual and seasonal ndvi change trends for the different vegetation types and land use types were investigated based on theil sen trend analysis according to the significance test mann kendall test and hurst exponent the vegetation degradation status over the last 15 years was evaluated and the sustainability of the change trend into the near future was predicted the significance of the change trend for climate variability and environmental pollution factors pm2 5 was analyzed and the initial difference in the trend changes in the ndvi and selected factors was determined finally considering both single and multiple explanatory variables the gwr model was built to further confirm the heterogeneous relationship between the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 and their influence on different vegetation coverage and land use types was assessed 2 study area and methods 2 1 description of the study area fig 1 shows the locations of the study area n34 25 43 35 e113 23 125 52 the bohai economic zone is surrounded by liaoning province hebei province shandong province

regions in china it has an advantageous geographical location rich resources and a good foundation for the development of the marine economy however the vigorous development of the marine economy has also seriously disturbed and damaged the ecosystems of the bohai rim region xin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 explaining the dynamic changes in the ecological environment and recognizing the factors such change have great significance in developing the eco economy of the bohai economic belt 2 2 datasets and preprocessing in this study the available data were composed of three groups fig 2 the first group includes monthly ndvi data to investigate vegetation coverage changes in the bohai rim terra moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis ndvi mod13q1 data with 250 m 250 m spatial resolution and 16 days of temporal resolution for 2002 2017 from march to december the study area was covered by four images h26v04 h26v05 h27v04 and h27v05 thus a total of 1440 images were used this dataset was downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov to extract all ndvi bands and quality assessment qa bands from the mod13q1 data products the modis reprojection tool mrt was used and batch processing such as resampling mosaic and projection conversion was performed to derive monthly ndvi data and eliminate the influence of clouds the maximum value composite mvc method clark et al 2010 was used the second group includes meteorological data and pm2 5 concentration data these data were derived from the china meteorological station and china national greenhouse data system http data sheshiyuanyi com representing a total of 66 meteorological stations and 44 pm2 5 observation cities in the study area fig 1 a the meteorological data and environmental pollution data included the temperature t c precipitation p mm relative humidity rh and pm2 5 concentration μg m3 from 2002 to 2017 in this study we used the annual average value of every climate factor and pm2 5 inverse distance weighting idw was applied to interpolate these datasets and identify heterogeneous relationships between the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 concentrations the third group consists of other auxiliary data the digital elevation model dem dataset with a spatial resolution of 30 m vegetation regionalization data and the spatial distribution of terrestrial ecosystem types in china were provided by the chinese academy of sciences resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn and geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the land use classification map from 2002 to 2017 300 m fig 1 b was obtained from université catholique de louvain ucl http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer these data were used to analyze spatiotemporal changes in the vegetation coverage of different vegetation types and land use types in the bohai rim region 2 3 methods 2 3 1 theil sen trend analysis the theil sen approach is a nonparametric method that calculates the slope from two data points in the time series and then arranges them in ascending order then the median of the slope series is considered the overall trend of the series kumar et al 2016 talchabhadel et al 2020 1 q i x a x b a b i 1 n 2 q m q n 1 2 n i s o d d n u m b e r q n 2 q n 2 2 2 n i s e v e n n u m b e r where q i is the slope obtained from the ith pair of data x a and x b are the sample eigenvalues of years a and b in the time series a b in this study years a and b are any years in the time series from 2002 to 2017 q m represents the change trend in the data and its positive and negative values indicate the direction of the trend when q m 0 the change in the data shows an upward trend when q m 0 the trend is downward talchabhadel et al 2020 in this study matlab 2019b software was used to calculate the theil sen trend for the vegetation coverage climate factors and pm2 5 2 3 2 mann kendall significance test the mann kendall test is a nonparametric test method that does not require samples to follow a certain distribution and that is not disturbed by a few outliers it is suitable for data with a nonnormal distribution and is simple to calculate waked et al 2016 yang et al 2020 for a time series ndvi i ndvi 1 ndvi 2 ndvi n the essence of the mann kendall trend test set as s slope is to compare the sizes of ndvi i and ndvi j the formula is as follows yang et al 2020 3 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn n d v i j ndvi i 4 sgn ndvi j ndvi i 1 ndvi j ndvi i 0 0 n d v i j ndvi i 0 1 ndvi j ndvi i 0 where n is the number of sequence samples and ndvi j and ndvi i are the ndvi values of years j and i j i respectively the results indicate that when n 8 s roughly obeys a normal distribution after standardizing s the test statistic zmk can be obtained and standardization is calculated according to the following formula 5 z mk s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 when using a two tailed test if the significance level α 0 05 then the normal distribution table is checked to determine z0 05 1 96 when zmk z0 05 h0 is accepted and there is no significant change trend in the time series in contrast when zmk z0 05 h0 is rejected and the time series data have an obvious increasing or decreasing trend martínez et al 2009 based on related studies zhang et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 and considering the normal distribution of slopendvi reflects the change trend of ndvi sndvi sndvi was classified into four classes in this study namely severe degradation sndvi 0 003 slight degradation 0 003 sndvi 0 002 unchanged 0 002 sndvi 0 002 and improved sndvi 0 002 the regions with z 1 96 and z 1 96 mann kendall test were divided into regions with significant changes and those with 1 96 z 1 96 were divided into areas with nonsignificant changes significance level α 0 05 2 3 3 hurst exponent the hurst exponent h exponent is used to quantitatively qualify the persistence or long range dependence of a time series chandrasekaran et al 2019 it is generally calculated by the rescaled range r s analysis method rehman et al 2009 r s is the most widely used method to calculate the h index rehman et al 2009 m fernández martínez et al 2014 rather than other analysis methods the calculation steps are as follows for time series ndvi i i 1 2 3 n 6 ndvi t 1 t i 1 t ndvi t t 1 2 3 n 7 s t 1 t i 1 t ndvi i ndvi t

concentrated in this way the slope is affected by the weight when using the least square method for linear fitting tong et al 2018 2 3 4 gwr model the gwr model is the most widely applied approach in the study of spatial heterogeneity yu et al 2020 the model is widely used because it can describe the variability of different spatial heterogeneities yang et al 2021 the core of the geographic weighted regression model is the spatial weight matrix which mainly describes the spatial relationship between variables by selecting various spatial weight functions brian et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 the established model is as follows 10 y i β io u i v i k 1 i β ik u i v i x ik ε where u i v i is the coordinate of the j th sampling point β ik u i v i is an independent variable x ik is a local regression coefficient at point i and β io and ε are the regression constant and error term of the model at point i respectively the adaptive kernel index akaike information criterion corrected aicc when comparing among many alternative models the one with the minimum aicc value assures a good balance of goodness of fit and complexity was applied to confirm the optimal number of variables in the geographically weighted regression model in most cases when the aicc difference is 2 there is a significant difference in the performance of a model yang et al 2021 in this study the construction of multivariate gwr models was accomplished in gwr4 0 software and arcgis10 5 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation in vegetation coverage in the bohai rim 3 1 1 annual and seasonal changes in vegetation coverage fig 3 shows the annual changes and differences in the seasonal average ndvi from 2002 to 2017 the mean ndvi value andvimean for the entire period for the bohai rim was 0 79 and in summer and spring the ndvi values reached 0 92 and 0 84 respectively the monthly changes in the ndvi indicated that high values mainly appeared from july to september all reaching 0 9 and the highest values were observed in june and august 0 99 the ndvi values from november to december were below andvimean the vegetation types of the bohai rim mainly include deciduous broad leaved forest in the warm temperate zone dblf temperate coniferous and deciduous broad leaved forest tc dblf and some temperate grasslands tg based on the vegetation type coverage boundary map of the study area we analyzed the annual and seasonal ndvi changes for each vegetation type fig 4 a b from 2002 to 2017 the ndvi ndviaverage values for dblf tc dblf and tg were 0 48 0 59 and 0 37 respectively and the ndvimax values were 0 82 0 81 and 0 77 respectively based on the dynamic changes in the ndvi the study period was divided into three stages the early stage 2002 2008 the mid term stage 2009 2010 and the late stage 2011 2017 in the early stage the ndvis of dblf tc dblf and tg were close to the annual ndviaverage in the mid term stage 2009 2010 the ndvis of the three vegetation zones were lower than the ndviaverage and the 2009 ndvis of tc dblf and tg decreased to 0 57 and 0 33 respectively in the late stage 2011 2017 the ndvis of dblf tc dblf and tg were higher than the ndviaverage with values of 0 38 0 49 and 0 60 respectively and an increasing trend fig 4 a the seasonal growth status of the vegetation types illustrated the significant differences in the seasonal ndvi which was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter compared to the other vegetation types tc dblf had the highest ndvi values throughout the seasons from 2002 to 2014 between spring and autumn the ndvis of tc dblf tg and dblf showed unstable change trends fig 4 b in recent years especially 2016 and 2017 the ndvi values were high dblf and tg reached 0 51 and 0 40 in 2016 respectively and tc dblf increased to 0 63 in 2017 during the 2016 2017 period in the spring and winter seasons the ndvi values of dblf and tg showed an upward trend and in summer they decreased slightly 1 ndvi value of tg temperate grasslands in spring of each year 2 ndvi value of dblf deciduous broad leaved forest in spring of each year 3 ndvi value of tc dblf temperate coniferous and deciduous broad leaved forest in spring of

analyze the vegetation cover variation in the bohai rim the classification and grading standard of soil erosion sl190 2007 zhang et al 2019 is applied to classify the vegetation cover into four classes namely low vegetation cover ndvi 0 30 medium 0 30 ndvi 0 50 medium high 0 50 ndvi 0 66 and high the value of ndvi 0 66 zhang et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 the classification statistics for the ndvi at multiple time scales in the study area are shown in fig 5 from 2002 to 2017 the medium high vegetation cover and high vegetation cover areas occupied 26 8 and 63 9 of the total area respectively with the average distribution in the northeast of liaoning province central hebei and most of shandong low vegetation cover and medium vegetation cover represented 1 7 and 7 5 of the total study area and were evenly divided among the northwest of liaoning province mainly around liao he river and the coastal area hebei province and the coastal area of shandong province based on the land use classification map of the study area from 2002 to 2017 http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php the vegetation coverage changes for the six different land use types agricultural land forest grassland wetland shrubland and sparse vegetation were analyzed fig 1 b from 2002 to 2017 the mean vegetation coverages of agricultural land forest grassland wetland shrubland and sparse vegetation were 0 64 0 75 0 63 0 41 0 67 and 0 32 respectively fig 6 agricultural land forest and shrubland had high rates of vegetation coverage accounting for approximately 66 0 98 7 and 79 4 of the land use types respectively fig 6 from 2002 to 2017 the mean vegetation coverages of agricultural land forest grassland wetland shrubland and sparse vegetation were 0 64 0 75 0 63 0 41 0 67 and 0 32 respectively fig 6 the other three types of vegetation cover accounted for a small portion in particular forest represented only 1 3 during the study period the high vegetation cover area of forest remained almost unchanged but the medium vegetation cover and medium high vegetation cover areas decreased by approximately 1 5 for agricultural land the medium vegetation cover and medium high vegetation cover areas decreased by 15 7 from 2002 to 2017 however the high vegetation cover area showed an increasing trend reaching 14 2 the medium high vegetation cover and high vegetation cover areas accounted for approximately 35 of the total grassland and wetland areas dynamic changes showed a decreasing trend for the high vegetation cover area of wetlands which decreased by approximately 5 6 and most coastal wetlands around the liao river significantly decreased wang et al 2020 in contrast grassland increased by approximately 12 2 with increases basically distributed in the northwestern and eastern parts of hebei province the medium vegetation cover area of grassland showed decreases that were mainly divided between the northwestern and southeastern parts of liaoning province mainly the coastal area these areas have a low altitude and human activities are more frequent jia et al 2007 in contrast in the past decade the economic development level of the bohai rim region has continuously increased showing a good momentum of development at the same time the expansion speed of coastal cities and the number of people have increased rapidly but the development level of the ecological environment of the bohai rim region has shown a fluctuating downward trend yang et al 2020 some of the sparse vegetation areas in this area are obviously occupied by construction land and roads and urban environmental problems such as soil and water pollution are one of the reasons for the degradation of the sparse vegetation in coastal areas yang et al 2020 in summary over the last 15 years the low vegetation cover area decreased and the medium and high vegetation cover areas had unstable change trends in particular the variation in the medium vegetation cover area fluctuated greatly among the six land use types the medium high cover area of agricultural land and shrubland the high cover area of wetlands and the sparse vegetation areas had decreasing trends the areas with other levels of coverage and land use types showed fluctuating changes fig 6 3 2 analysis of vegetation ndvi change trend 3 2 1 theil sen trend analysis of the ndvi table 1 shows that in the study area 5 5 2 85 104 km2 of the vegetation covered area was severely degraded with 1 4 showing significant change the severely degraded area with an obvious change was mainly distributed in the northern and southern parts of the temperate deciduous forest region forest and steppe in the south temperate zone which accounted for 35 7 63 5 and 4 7 respectively fig 7 the degradation status of the land use types indicated that agricultural land forest grassland and wetland in the study area accounted for 81 2 5 4 5 1 and 8 3 fig 8 of the severely degraded area with significant changes respectively the slightly degraded area accounted for 34 5 the slightly degraded area with significant changes represented approximately 3 6 and was mainly located in the northern part of the temperate deciduous forest region which accounted for approximately 91 4 of the slightly degraded area with significant change among the four main land use types of the study area agricultural land and forest accounted for 72 3 and 14 5 of the slightly degraded area with nonsignificant changes respectively whereas grassland and wetland accounted for only approximately 8 0 and 5 2 respectively fig 8 among the land use types agricultural land forest and grassland accounted for approximately 45 1 39 2 and 13 3 of the total unchanged area respectively and wetlands accounted for only approximately 2 5 fig 7 for the improved area the improved area with nonsignificant changes represented approximately 25 5 improved areas with significant changes were mainly observed in the northern and southern parts of the temperate deciduous forest region and agricultural land forest and grassland accounted for approximately 51 7 24 6 and 19 2 of these improved areas with significant changes respectively generally over the last 15 years the vegetation coverage of the bohai rim either slightly degraded or remained unchanged and the improved area 26 3 was significantly larger than the severely degraded area 5 5 among the land use types wetland agricultural land grassland and forest had slight degradation with nonsignificant changes while the severely degraded area represented a larger portion of wetlands approximately 10 than the other land use types fig 7 fig 8 the seasonal trend results fig 8 indicate that due to differences in the phenological characteristics of the vegetation types the order of the growth status of the vegetation in the bohai rim was as follows in spring slightly degraded area 53 5 unchanged area 35 6 severely degraded area 6 9 improved area 4 1 in summer and autumn fig 8 the order was unchanged area 43 6 45 3 slightly degraded area 39 4 35 1 improved area 12 4 15 5 severely degraded area 4 6 4 1 and in winter the order was severely degraded area 31 4 slightly degraded area 30 2 unchanged area 26 3 improved area 12 1 during the spring summer and autumn periods slightly degraded areas with nonsignificant changes and unchanged areas represented approximately 60 of agricultural land forest grassland and wetland and in the winter season the severely degraded area showing significant changes was approximately 20 greater than that in the other seasons in the bohai rim slightly degraded and unchanged vegetation covered areas accounted for a larger proportion of the total area the slightly degraded area was much larger than the improved area over the 15 year study period 3 2 2 the sustainability of the ndvi change trend into the future to evaluate the sustainability of the ndvi change trend of the study area we classified the hurst exponent into three classes namely h 0 5 with long term dependent and persistent time series i e future changes are consistent with past trends h 0 5 where the ndvi time series is a random series and there is no long term correlation and h 0 5 where the time series has anti persistence that is the future trend is contrary to the past trend li et al 2021 the dynamic trend in the ndvi was overlain with the hurst exponent to obtain its persistence distribution fig 10 table 2 the results indicate that severely degraded slightly degraded and persistently ameliorated areas represented approximately 3 2 15 8 and 20 9 of the total study area respectively and were mainly distributed fig 9 in agricultural lands forests and some grasslands the unchanged areas accounted for a larger proportion of approximately 34 01 anti persistent severely and slightly degraded areas and anti persistent improved areas accounted for approximately 2 1 16 8 and 4 7 respectively and were distributed in agricultural lands forests and some parts of grasslands and wetlands figs 9 10 the area with an uncertain change accounted for 2 5 of the total area and had a random distribution throughout the study area based on the results two main change trends will exist in the future for vegetation coverage in the bohai economic zone persistent slight degradation and improvement interestingly the persistent slight degradation areas were basically distributed in the coastal cities and large parts of the improved areas were located in northwest hebei province and liaoning province thus the protection and improvement of vegetation coverage in coastal areas need to be strengthened in the bohai economic zone seasonal hurst exponential changes fig 10 indicate that persistent unchanged areas and anti persistent slightly degraded areas accounted for a large proportion of the area from spring to autumn representing approximately 36 0 and 44 0 spring 45 8 and 52 4 summer and 38 4 and 34 4 autumn respectively table 2 the anti persistent improved area from spring to autumn showed an increasing trend and comprised approximately 4 0 12 5 and 15 6 of the total during the winter season persistent slight degradation areas and continuous degradation areas significantly increased accounting for 14 9 and 14 0 respectively table 2 the seasonal change trend for the sustainability of the land use types indicates that in spring grassland forest agricultural land and wetland were in a state of continuous improvement from summer to autumn persistently degraded areas increased and in the winter season the continually slightly and severely degraded areas significantly increased overall it can be concluded that from spring to autumn in the study area the vegetation covered area showed anti persistent slight degradation with nonsignificant changes in winter because most of the vegetation entered the late green stage vegetation degraded slightly 3 3 spatial heterogeneity of vegetation coverage dynamics 3 3 1 spatiotemporal variation and trend analysis of climate factors and pm2 5 in this study before analyzing the relationship between the vegetation coverage climate factors and pm2 5 we applied theil sen mk trend analysis to further understand the change trend for the annual average t p rh and pm2 5 value for the 2002 2017 period fig 13 the trend analysis showed that the range of average temperatures was 4 3 c 16 5 c fig 11 a high temperatures were recorded in southwestern hebei province and shandong province the mean temperatures of areas characterized by the four vegetation cover types from low vegetation cover to high were 12 4 c 10 9 c 11 6 c and 11 4 c respectively from the spatial distribution of the slope st and z zt values the temperature of most parts of the bohai rim showed an increasing trend except for some parts of northwestern hebei province the st of the four different vegetation cover types was 0 among them the st of the low vegetation covered area was the highest 0 03 and the maximum st values for forest and grassland reached 0 31 and 0 30 respectively table 3 the significance test showed that the zt 1 96 and zt 1 96 values were distributed only around the cities of dandong weifang beijing and tianjin although temperature had an increasing trend the trend was not significant in large parts of the study area fig 13 changes in precipitation indicated fig 11 b that the range for the average precipitation was 101 7 mm 445 8 mm the high precipitation area was mainly located in the eastern part of liaoning northeast of shandong province and this area also had medium and high vegetation cover the spatial distribution of the slope sp and z zp values shows that the entire study area was mainly sp 0 and included four types of vegetation cover areas sp 0 values appeared only around the cities of weifang and linyi in shandong province the areas with agricultural land forest grassland and wetland also showed sp 0 values table 3 for the significance test results zp 1 24 and zp 1 96 were mainly distributed in hebei liaoning and the eastern and western parts of shandong province where grassland forest agricultural land and wetland were distributed at zp 1 96 fig 13 the precipitation in the bohai rim had a significant decreasing trend over the last 15 years the relative humidity ranged from 50 5 to 94 6 fig 11 c and its change trend shows that the srh of agricultural land forest and wetland in shandong the southwestern and northern parts of hebei eastern liaoning province and the city of tianjin was below 0 srh 0 and had a decreasing trend the rh of grassland in eastern liaoning in northwestern hebei province and around the city of jining was sp 0 and showed an increasing trend fig 12 c table 3 the significance of the rh change trend indicates that the zrh value of most parts of the study area was between 1 96 and 1 96 showing an insignificant decrease except in the cities of chengde and langan fig 12 c the average pm2 5 changes in the last 15 years indicated fig 11 d that the pm2 5 of most cities in the bohai economic zone exceeded the national standard 35 µg m3 year of china meaning that these cities were in states of light to heavy pollution fig 11 d illustrates the spatial distribution of pm2 5 the area with pm2 5 35 µg m3 was mainly distributed in eastern and western liaoning province the pm2 5 concentration of the central part of liaoning province northern hebei province beijing and eastern shandong province was 35 µg m3 pm2 5 55 µg m3 and the pm2 5 value for the medium medium high and high vegetation cover areas was 55 µg m3 the areas with pm2 5 55 µg m3 were distributed in western shandong province southern hebei province and tianjin and these were also low vegetation cover areas the pm2 5 change trend indicated that the pm2 5 concentrations in the bohai rim showed an upward trend spm2 5 0 and the significance test indicated that except for the southwestern part of liaoning province west of liaodong bay the study region had a significant increasing trend zpm2 5 1 96 the zpm2 5 area was grassland while agricultural land forest and wetland were higher than 1 96 fig 12 d fig 13 d in conclusion during the last 15 years in the bohai region the temperature and pm2 5 concentration had upward trends and the pm2 5 change trend was significant the precipitation and relative humidity showed decreasing trends and both were mainly insignificant 3 3 2 modeling ndvi with climatic factors and pm2 5 by gwr the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 have spatial heterogeneity wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 thus in this study the gwr model was applied to determine the strength and direction of the spatially heterogeneous relationship between the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 in the bohai rim to build the gwr model we first determined a suitable grid size and built a 3 3 km grid based on formula 11 the coefficient of variation cv of each size grid was calculated and compared the calculation results show that the cv values of each category in the 3 km grid were the smallest at 0 06 ndvi 3 2 t 4 2 p 10 9 rh and 5 2 pm2 5 the data fluctuated greatly and the homogeneity of the grid varied therefore a 3 km grid is one of the best grid units for studying the spatial differentiation of ndvi and four different selected factors c p rh and pm2 5 11 cv s x 100 where s is the standard deviation of the grid unit at each scale and is the average value of the grid unit at each scale the second step was to calculate the latitude longitude temperature precipitation relative humidity pm2 5 and ndvi of each grid point at the pixel level based on the interpolation results and the ndvi distribution data in the third step the ndvi was set as the independent variable and the climatic factors and pm2 5 were set as the explanatory variables to build the gwr model the accuracy of the model was evaluated by adjusted r2 r2 adjusted local r2 r2 local and the second order akaike information criterion aicc the results indicate that when the temperature was the explanatory variable the model gwr t had a high r2 adjusted of 0 89 and r2 local of 0 91 and a low aicc of 127 indicating a relatively high predictive accuracy fig 14 a and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 88 fig 15 a the order of r2 local for the different types of vegetation cover is as follows table 4 r2 local medium 0 85 r2 local medium high 0 81 r2 local high 0 80 r2 local low 0 75 which illustrates that temperature had a significant influence on the medium to high vegetation covered area in the study area low vegetation coverage was mainly distributed around the coastal area thus human activities may be the vital factor causing ndvi changes in that area wu et al 2014 liang et al 2015 for the model constructed with the explanatory variables of precipitation gwr p fig 14 b r2 adjusted and r2 local were 0 83 and 0 86 respectively and aicc was 487 the accuracy of the model was also high and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 86 fig 15 b indicating that precipitation is also one of the crucial factors affecting ndvi changes in the bohai rim the order of r2 local for the four types of vegetation cover is as follows r2 local high 0 87 r2 local medium high 0 84 r2 local low 0 83 r2 local medium 0 81 the accuracy of the model shows that the influence of precipitation on high vegetation cover was obvious table 4 the r2 local distribution table 5 indicated that in hebei province and shandong province the influence of precipitation on the ndvi was relatively obvious and r2 local reached 0 86 and 0 84 respectively the model gwr rh built with the relative humidity factor fig 14 c showed a reliable prediction accuracy with a higher r2 adjusted of 0 71 and r2 local of 0 76 and a low aicc of 232 the accuracy of the model indicated that the relative humidity in the study area especially shandong and liaoning provinces exerted a significant influence on vegetation coverage and r2 local reached 0 86 and 0 79 respectively fig 15 c considering the degree to which the relative humidity influenced the different types of vegetation coverage rh had an obvious effect on the medium and medium high vegetation cover areas table 4 and the order of r2 local for the four types of vegetation cover was as follows r2 local medium 0 86 r2 local medium high 0 84 r2 local high 0 79 r2 local low 0 74 to analyze the relationship between the vital environmental quality index pm2 5 and vegetation coverage a gwr pm2 5 model was constructed fig 14 d the accuracy of the model r2 adjusted reached 0 86 while r2 local and aicc were 0 88 and 208 respectively indicating that vegetation coverage and pm2 5 had a significant correlation differences in the relationship between the pm2 5 concentration and the degree of vegetation coverage were observed the order of r2 local for the four types of vegetation cover was as follows r2 local low 0 93 r2 local high 0 88 r2 local medium high 0 82 r2 local medium 0 86 table 4 this ranking shows that pm2 5 played a significant role in explaining the changes in the vegetation coverage especially for low and high vegetation cover areas the predictive map fig 15 d shows that the spatial distributions of the predicted and observed ndvi were very similar and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 87 fig 14 d the special distribution of r2 local indicated that in hebei shandong province pm2 5 had a significant influence on ndvi changes and r2 local reached 0 91 and 0 82 table 5 we evaluated the accuracy of the model constructed by single explanatory variables gwr t 0 89 gwr pm2 5 0 86 gwr p 0 83 gwr rh 0 71 by comparing the accuracy results it can be concluded that in the bohai rim the temperature pm2 5 and precipitation have a significant spatially heterogeneous relationship with the vegetation coverage especially for medium low and high vegetation cover areas clearly these explanatory variables exert a joint influence on vegetation thus a model built using four explanatory variables can further explain the relationship between the vegetation coverage and the selected factors the model gwr m constructed with multiple explanatory variables temperature precipitation relative humidity and pm2 5 and gwr rh c showed a high accuracy with an r2 adjusted value of 0 84 and a low aicc value 137 and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 85 fig 14 e the order of r2 local of the four types of vegetation cover was as follows r2 local medium high 0 85 r2 local medium 0 83 r2 local high 0 80 r2 local low 0 61 table 4 these results show that in the bohai rim other factors such as urban expansion port construction shipping emissions and heavy metal pollution zhang et al 2014 xin et al 2011 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 influenced the low vegetation cover area in addition to climate factors and pm2 5 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of vegetation coverage change trend based on the theil sen trend analysis at both annual 2002 2017 and seasonal scales the changing trends of vegetation coverage in bohai rim were evaluated the results show that in the last 15 years slightly degraded and unchanged vegetation cover areas accounted for a larger proportion of the total vegetation cover area the slightly degraded area was much larger than the improved area and large parts of the degraded area were only slightly degraded and exhibited nonsignificant changes in recent years research wu et al 2014 liang et al 2015 on changes in the vegetation coverage in the bohai rim has been limited wu et al 2014 used the satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation s10 spot vgt s10 product and semivariogram analysis to evaluate the spatial pattern of the ndvi across the bohai region and found that the ndvi was stable in 1999 2009 1999 2003 and 2009 in this study based on the mod13q1 data we found the same changing trend for the ndvi during the 2002 2008 period called the early stage in this stage the ndvimean value was close to the average ndvi of 2002 2017 according to the ndvi changes in 2009 2017 the study period was divided into two periods in the mid term stage 2009 2010 ndvimain had a decreasing trend and in the late stage 2011 2017 ndvimain was higher than the average ndvi value of the entire study period showing an increasing trend liang et al 2015 used the modis ndvi product to study the vegetation coverage change trend of the bohai region and according to the slope value concluded that during 2000 2009 the vegetation coverage in the bohai region had an increasing trend but this trend showed spatial differences such that some areas still had a decreasing trend hou et al 2010 and cui et al 2010 found the same trends in the vegetation coverage in the study area based on spot data wang et al 2020 used data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa avhrr to evaluate the changes in the vegetation coverage in china and proposed that from 1982 to 2016 moderately decreased regions made up approximately 11 0 of the total decreased area and were mainly located in northeastern china in terms of the quality of the vegetation ecology northeastern china is in a state of slight decrease and stability li et al 2021 in the bohai region the ecological environment level from 2004 to 2014 showed a decreasing trend dropping from 0 65 to 0 34 hua et al 2017 although from 2012 to 2014 a slight increase was observed overall the volatility trend decreased based on previous studies the results for the vegetation coverage change trend from 2002 to 2017 in the bohai rim are reasonable thus the different vegetation type change trends from 2002 to 2017 were further analyzed slight degradation was identified as the main change trend for vegetation coverage and observed in agricultural land forest wetland and grassland with agricultural land accounting for the largest proportion guo et al 2013 also found that agricultural land in the bohai region decreased by 139 2 104 hm2 during the 1985 2010 period considering the seasonal change trends for vegetation we found that in spring the order of the degradation degree was slightly degraded area unchanged area and severely degraded and improved areas were relatively small in summer and autumn the order was unchanged area slightly degraded area while the improved area was beginning to show an increasing trend in winter the order of the degradation degree was as follows degraded area slightly degraded area unchanged area improved area to determine the sustainability of the change trend of the vegetation coverage in the bohai rim based on the above discussed theil sen trend results the hurst exponent was applied other recent studies cheng et al 2017 li et al 2021 yang et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 have also analyzed the persistence of vegetation change trends into the near future on the basis of the sen mann kendall and hurst exponents li et al 2021 predicted the vegetation ecology quality veq of china and found that the veq in china has continually improved over the past 18 years and should maintain an improving trend in the bohai region in the future in our study the prediction results also indicate that although continuous degradation and continuous slight degradation still exist h 0 5 a larger area is experiencing continued improvement in the future the vegetation coverage in the bohai region may show an improving trend especially for agricultural land forest and grassland while wetlands may maintain a slight degradation trend and the improved area will likely be very small thus in the bohai region the protection of wetlands needs to be further strengthened 4 2 relationship between vegetation coverage and driving factors the temperature precipitation relative humidity and pm2 5 concentration were each individually applied as explanatory variables to explore the climate and environmental quality factors of the evolution of the vegetation pattern using a spatiotemporal nonstationary gwr model based on the accuracy the relationships between these variables and the vegetation coverage were evaluated in the bohai economic zone the temperature pm2 5 concentration and precipitation had a significant influence on the ndvi and r2 adjusted reached 0 89 0 86 and 0 83 respectively the gwr rh accuracy indicated that the relative humidity had a high but not significant correlation with the ndvi a number of recent studies li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 yang et al 2020 shen et al 2019 qu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 have also indicated that climate factors have a significant effect on vegetation coverage in china from 2002 to 2017 during the growing season the vegetation greenness had a negative correlation with temperature and a positive correlation with precipitation and the effects of precipitation were stronger than those of temperature li et al 2021 from 1982 to 2016 the ndvi and land surface temperature lst had a higher correlation than the ndvi and precipitation in china and the increase in the lst could stimulate vegetation growth in most parts of china wang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 increased precipitation with a minimum temperature during the growing season could motivate the growth of marsh vegetation across china shen et al 2021 in northeast china the vegetation growing season sos in arid or semiarid regions has a significant influence on precipitation songnen plain and liaohe plain while the sanjiang plain and the temperatures in the area of the three cold mountains played vital roles in determining the sos from 2002 to 2016 shen et al 2019 during 2000 2009 temperature and precipitation influenced vegetation growth in the bohai region and the increase in the precipitation and ndvi was positively correlated liang et al 2015 in the yangtze river basin temperature and evapotranspiration had positive correlations with the ndvi and precipitation and the humidity index showed a negative correlation with the ndvi zhang et al 2019 fang et al 2021 in our study we found that in the bohai region the temperature had a more significant influence on the medium vegetation cover area while the high vegetation cover area was mainly affected by the precipitation the low vegetation covered areas were mainly distributed in coastal areas and in addition to being affected by the climate factors they were also affected by human activities such as maritime traffic development industrial activities in coastal areas and port construction zhang et al 2014 xin et al 2011 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 lü et al 2014 in recent years some studies wang et al 2016 irga et al 2015 have proposed a significant correlation between pm2 5 and vegetation coverage the influence of vegetation coverage on pm2 5 concentration is complex and the increase in vegetation coverage has a positive influence on the decrease in pm2 5 and the correlation change in different seasons wang et al 2016 du et al 2019 in china pm2 5 was spatially heterogeneous and significantly higher in cities in eastern china than in cities in the west wang et al 2019 in the last decade in the bohai region the aerosol optical depth aod showed an intimate relationship with the population density industrial and agricultural activities and climate conditions xin et al 2011 in this study we found that from 2002 to 2017 in the bohai economic zone the pm2 5 concentration had a significant upward trend while the vegetation coverage had a slight decreasing trend the mean pm2 5 concentration varied for different vegetation cover areas in low vegetation areas the pm2 5 concentration was higher than in the medium high and high vegetation areas and it was the lowest in the medium vegetation cover areas although the pm2 5 change in the four types of vegetation covered areas showed a significant increasing trend the slopepm2 5 values were 0 the model constructed using pm2 5 further showed a spatiotemporally nonstationary relationship between the pm2 5 concentration and the ndvi and the r2 adjusted reached 0 86 the accuracy of the model indicates that in the bohai economic zone pm2 5 is an environmental factor that exerts a significant influence on vegetation growth especially in areas with low vegetation coverage the effective inhibitory effect of vegetation on pm2 5 in the atmospheric environment has been widely recognized the main reason is that the effective removal rate of pm2 5 by negative oxygen ions in the air can reach approximately 90 wang et al 2016 vegetation is an important factor in the production of negative oxygen ions in the ecological environment the increase in vegetation area has a positive impact on the decline in the pm2 5 concentration wang et al 2016 in contrast the concentration of negative oxygen ions in the air in areas with sparse vegetation is also low thus the concentration of pm2 5 in this area may rise rapidly and affect the photosynthesis of vegetation to some degree these consequences also further affirm that the gwr model can be used in managing nonstationary features such as human activities and environmental variation yang et al 2021 chun et al 2014 5 conclusion the results of this study reveal the spatiotemporal changes in the vegetation activity and its heterogeneous relationship with and response to climate drivers and pm2 5 from 2002 to 2017 in the bohai rim vegetation degradation ranked from slightly degraded area unchanged area improved area severely degraded area the slightly degraded and unchanged vegetation covered areas accounted for a larger proportion of the total area the slightly degraded area was much larger than the improved area over the 15 year study period sustainable slight degradation and persistent improvement coexisted mainly in agricultural land forest grassland and wetland although in coastal wetlands some severe degradation occurred thus the protection and improvement of vegetation coverage in coastal areas need to be strengthened in the bohai economic zone the accuracies of the models constructed with single explanatory variables were gwr t 0 89 gwr pm2 5 0 86 gwr p 0 83 gwr rh 0 71 further the temperature precipitation and pm2 5 showed intense spatially heterogeneous relationships and had a significant influence on the medium high and low vegetation cover areas when considering the joint influence of the factors the order of r2 local of the four types of vegetation coverage was as follows r2 local medium high 0 85 r2 local medium 0 83 r2 local high 0 80 r2 local low 0 61 the high and medium vegetation cover areas were the most strongly affected by the climate factors and pm2 5 it can also be concluded that in the bohai rim other factors such as urban expansion port construction shipping emissions and heavy metal pollution may influence the low vegetation cover area in addition to the climate factors and pm2 5 thus these results can help in the development of sustainable coastal region ecosystem management strategies and provide a theoretical basis for making scientific decisions about vegetation protection and ecological construction in the belt and road

2452,variations in vegetation patterns can provide a scientific basis for assessing environmental quality and monitoring ecosystem dynamics under environmental pollution and global warming conditions to evaluate the ecological environment of the bohai rim theil sen trend analysis the mann kendall mk test and the hurst exponent were applied to analyze the patterns of variation in the vegetation coverage climate factors temperature precipitation relative humidity and particulate matter and to assess sustainability in the near future fine particulate matter also known as pm2 5 pm2 5 μ g m 3 refers to atmospheric particles with a diameter of less than or equal to 2 5 μm also known as respirable particles these not only lead to a decline in atmospheric visibility but also increase human mortality and respiratory disease rates given the spatiotemporal nonstationarity of climate factors and pm2 5 geographically weighted regression gwr was applied to confirm the spatially heterogeneous relationship among the vegetation coverage climate factors and pm2 5 the vegetation coverage in the bohai rim was mostly comprised of slightly degraded areas followed by unchanged areas improved areas and severely degraded areas from 2002 to 2017 the slightly degraded area accounted for 30 9 while 15 8 of the area remained at the same level during the period and 16 8 improved slight degradation was mainly observed on agricultural lands and forests whereas severely degraded areas were distributed among grasslands and wetlands approximately 20 9 of the improved area most of which was agricultural lands forests and grasslands continued to improve seasonal trends indicated that a large proportion of the areas remained unchanged or were slightly degraded from autumn to spring whereas areas improved from spring to autumn during the winter slightly and severely degraded areas continuously expanded gwr indicated that temperature pm2 5 and precipitation displayed a significant heterogeneous spatial relationship with the vegetation coverage and had an obvious influence on the medium high and low vegetation cover areas when considering the joint influence of climate factors and pm2 5 on the vegetation coverage the model accuracy was not high for the high and medium vegetation cover areas in the bohai region human activities significantly affect coastal areas these results can support

important carbon pool and a climate change indicator that serves as a vital component of ecological systems shen et al 2019 yang et al 2021 it plays an essential and regulatory role in the circulation of materials the global energy balance biochemical cycles and water cycles yue et al 2019 taddeo et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 vegetation also tends to interfere with abnormal climatic phenomena environmental pollution and land management patterns which in turn complicate vegetation coverage trends and cause them to fluctuate or mutate zhong et al 2021 soab et al 2020 changes in any one of these factors can exert different influences on the growth and distribution of vegetation zhu et al 2020 thus given the background of global warming and environmental pollution analyzing the changing trends in vegetation coverage and investigating their response to changes in climate factors and environmental quality are both significant and of paramount importance for the protection and sustainable development of vegetation resources and the ecological environment carvalho et al 2019 huo et al 2021 liu et al 2021 vegetation coverage change is a complex long term process affected by climate change and human activities yang et al 2021 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which reflects the greenness growth and coverage of vegetation through red and near infrared reflection data is a mature index that is commonly used to depict the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation coverage and the connected spatial patterns bianchi et al 2019 michael et al 2003

leblanc 2005 the mann kendall mk test bihrat et al 2012 and polynomial fit methods jamali et al 2014 have been applied to evaluate vegetation coverage changes tang et al 2020 pan et al 2018 however most time series analyses of vegetation coverage changes have focused only on linear and monotonic trends and ignored the implicit characteristics of nonlinear and gradual changes in ndvi trends gu et al 2018 cheng et al 2017 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the methods are unable to precisely analyze the spatiotemporal assessment of vegetation coverage change trends such that obvious greening trends can mask underlying vegetation browning yang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 numerous studies have attempted to establish a correlation between the ndvi and climate factors to better understand ecosystem changes under climatic impacts dong et al 2020 horák terra et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 vegetation growth in high latitudes and high altitude mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere is more affected by global warming and experiences more significant trends in vegetation greening and the extension of the growing season edwards and treitz 2017 in the arid and semiarid african continent research on the relationship between vegetation change and precipitation is more mature and can provide an important theoretical basis for analyzing the causes of vegetation change in arid areas of northwest china li et al 2021 jia et al 2011 in the belt and road region precipitation temperature and human activities have a high correlation with vegetation growth rainfall controlled areas are collectively distributed in arid semiarid and tropical regions yang et al 2020 in most parts of china the ndvi has a significant correlation with temperature and precipitation li et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 from 2000 to 2009 in the bohai region annual changes in the ndvi indicated a high correlation with precipitation and human activities liang et al 2015 temperature and precipitation are vital driving mechanisms that affect vegetation activities and their impacts on vegetation are spatially heterogeneous with changes in the temporal and spatial scales and the climate overall yang et al 2021 in addition some recent studies have indicated that the ndvi and particulate matter pm2 5 have relatively high correlations irga et al 2015 showed that in sydney australia the ndvi had a significant correlation with pm2 5 in beijing and henan province china the ndvi and pm2 5 also had a significant correlation wang et al 2016 du et al 2019 to investigate the mechanisms driving the spatiotemporal evolution of vegetation coverage studies have primarily focused on statistical analyses e g linear regression models correlation coefficients li et al 2021 du et al 2019 however such studies cannot reliably depict the response relationship of variables yang et al 2021 zahra et al 2020 thus to address the problems of spatial nonstationarity and heterogeneity geographically weighted regression gwr has been introduced to analyze the relationships between vegetation patterns and their influencing factors to effectively increase spatial locality wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the bohai region is the golden coast of northern china and is the core region of the belt and road initiative in recent decades rapid industrialization and urbanization have increased the intensity of human activities increasing chemical pollutant discharge population growth urban expansion etc in the bohai region and led to various environmental problems increasing aerosol concentrations decreasing wetlands reducing agricultural land vegetation degradation etc shi et al 2016 bo et al 2014 luo et al 2010 such that a remarkable conflict still exists between ecological conservation and economic growth chao et al 2017 zong et al 2021 therefore investigating vegetation coverage dynamics and their influencing factors is critical in the bohai region to protect vegetation improve the ecological environment and project future ecosystem dynamics and this approach can play a crucial role in promoting the green development of the belt and road initiative he et al 2018 with regard to changes in the ecological environment of the bohai economic zone this study aimed to identify the problems of spatiotemporal nonstationarity and the dependence between vegetation coverage and driving forces climate factors i e temperature precipitation and relative humidity and pm2 5 first the annual and seasonal ndvi change trends for the different vegetation types and land use types were investigated based on theil sen trend analysis according to the significance test mann kendall test and hurst exponent the vegetation degradation status over the last 15 years was evaluated and the sustainability of the change trend into the near future was predicted the significance of the change trend for climate variability and environmental pollution factors pm2 5 was analyzed and the initial difference in the trend changes in the ndvi and selected factors was determined finally considering both single and multiple explanatory variables the gwr model was built to further confirm the heterogeneous relationship between the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 and their influence on different vegetation coverage and land use types was assessed 2 study area and methods 2 1 description of the study area fig 1 shows the locations of the study area n34 25 43 35 e113 23 125 52 the bohai economic zone is surrounded by liaoning province hebei province shandong province and the cities of tianjin and beijing it has a temperate monsoon climate and an annual precipitation of 300 450 mm liang et al 2015 the region is one of the three most important marine economic regions in china it has an advantageous geographical location rich resources and a good foundation for the development of the marine economy however the vigorous development of the marine economy has also seriously disturbed and damaged the ecosystems of the bohai rim region xin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 explaining the dynamic changes in the ecological environment and recognizing the factors such change have great significance in developing the eco economy of the bohai economic belt 2 2 datasets and preprocessing in this study the available data were composed of three groups fig 2 the first group includes monthly ndvi data to investigate vegetation coverage changes in the bohai rim terra moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis ndvi mod13q1 data with 250 m 250 m spatial resolution and 16 days of temporal resolution for 2002 2017 from march to december the study area was covered by four images h26v04 h26v05 h27v04 and h27v05 thus a total of 1440 images were used this dataset was downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov to extract all ndvi bands and quality assessment qa bands from the mod13q1 data products the modis reprojection tool mrt was used and batch processing such as resampling mosaic and projection conversion was performed to derive monthly ndvi data and eliminate the influence of clouds the maximum value composite mvc method clark et al 2010 was used the second group includes meteorological data and pm2 5 concentration data these data were derived from the china meteorological station and china national greenhouse data system http data sheshiyuanyi com representing a total of 66 meteorological stations and 44 pm2 5 observation cities in the study area fig 1 a the meteorological data and environmental pollution data included the temperature t c precipitation p mm relative humidity rh and pm2 5 concentration μg m3 from 2002 to 2017 in this study we used the annual average value of every climate factor and pm2 5 inverse distance weighting idw was applied to interpolate these datasets and identify heterogeneous relationships between the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 concentrations the third group consists of other auxiliary data the digital elevation model dem dataset with a spatial resolution of 30 m vegetation regionalization data and the spatial distribution of terrestrial ecosystem types in china were provided by the chinese academy of sciences resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn and geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the land use classification map from 2002 to 2017 300 m fig 1 b was obtained from université catholique de louvain ucl http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer these data were used to analyze spatiotemporal changes in the vegetation coverage of different vegetation types and land use types in the bohai rim region 2 3 methods 2 3 1 theil sen trend analysis the theil sen approach is a nonparametric method that calculates the slope from two data points in the time series and then arranges them in ascending order then the median of the slope series is considered the overall trend of the series kumar et al 2016 talchabhadel et al 2020 1 q i x a x b a b i 1 n 2 q m q n 1 2 n i s o d d n u m b e r q n 2 q n 2 2 2 n i s e v e n n u m b e r where q i is the slope obtained from the ith pair of data x a and x b are the sample eigenvalues of years a and b in the time series a b in this study years a and b are any years in the time series from 2002 to 2017 q m represents the change trend in the data and its positive and negative values indicate the direction of the trend when q m 0 the change in the data shows an upward trend when q m 0 the trend is downward talchabhadel et al 2020 in this study matlab 2019b software was used to calculate the theil sen trend for the vegetation coverage climate factors and pm2 5 2 3 2 mann kendall significance test the mann kendall test is a nonparametric test method that does not require samples to follow a certain distribution and that is not disturbed by a few outliers it is suitable for data with a nonnormal distribution and is simple to calculate waked et al 2016 yang et al 2020 for a time series ndvi i ndvi 1 ndvi 2 ndvi n the essence of the mann kendall trend test set as s slope is to compare the sizes of ndvi i and ndvi j the formula is as follows yang et al 2020 3 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn n d v i j ndvi i 4 sgn ndvi j ndvi i 1 ndvi j ndvi i 0 0 n d v i j ndvi i 0 1 ndvi j ndvi i 0 where n is the number of sequence samples and ndvi j and ndvi i are the ndvi values of years j and i j i respectively the results indicate that when n 8 s roughly obeys a normal distribution after

the study of spatial heterogeneity yu et al 2020 the model is widely used because it can describe the variability of different spatial heterogeneities yang et al 2021 the core of the geographic weighted regression model is the spatial weight matrix which mainly describes the spatial relationship between variables by selecting various spatial weight functions brian et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 the established model is as follows 10 y i β io u i v i k 1 i β ik u i v i x ik ε where u i v i is the coordinate of the j th sampling point β ik u i v i is an independent variable x ik is a local regression coefficient at point i and β io and ε are the regression constant and error term of the model at point i respectively the adaptive kernel index akaike information criterion corrected aicc when comparing among many alternative models the one with the minimum aicc value assures a good balance of goodness of fit and complexity was applied to confirm the optimal number of variables in the geographically weighted regression model in most cases when the aicc difference is 2 there is a significant difference in the performance of a model yang et al 2021 in this study the construction of multivariate gwr models was accomplished in gwr4 0 software and arcgis10 5 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation in vegetation coverage in the bohai rim 3 1 1 annual and seasonal changes in vegetation coverage fig 3 shows the annual changes and differences in the seasonal average ndvi from 2002 to 2017 the mean ndvi value andvimean for the entire period for the bohai rim was 0 79 and in summer and spring the ndvi values reached 0 92 and 0 84 respectively the monthly changes in the ndvi indicated that high values mainly appeared from july to september all reaching 0 9 and the highest values were observed in june and august 0 99 the ndvi values from november to december were below andvimean the vegetation types of the bohai rim mainly include deciduous broad leaved forest in the warm temperate zone dblf temperate coniferous and deciduous broad leaved forest tc dblf and some temperate grasslands tg based on the vegetation type coverage boundary map of the study area we analyzed the annual and seasonal ndvi changes for each vegetation type fig 4 a b from 2002 to 2017 the ndvi ndviaverage values for dblf tc dblf and tg were 0 48 0 59 and 0 37 respectively and the ndvimax values were 0 82 0 81 and 0 77 respectively based on the dynamic changes in the ndvi the study period was divided into three stages the early stage 2002 2008 the mid term stage 2009 2010 and the late stage 2011 2017 in the early stage the ndvis of dblf tc dblf and tg were close to the annual ndviaverage in the mid term stage 2009 2010 the ndvis of the three vegetation zones were lower than the ndviaverage and the 2009 ndvis of tc dblf and tg decreased to 0 57 and 0 33 respectively in the late stage 2011 2017 the ndvis of dblf tc dblf and tg were higher than the ndviaverage with values of 0 38 0 49 and 0 60 respectively and an increasing trend fig 4 a the seasonal growth status of the vegetation types illustrated the significant differences in the seasonal ndvi which was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter compared to the other vegetation types tc dblf had the highest ndvi values throughout the seasons from 2002 to 2014 between spring and autumn the ndvis of tc dblf tg and dblf showed unstable change trends fig 4 b in recent years especially 2016 and 2017 the ndvi values were high dblf and tg reached 0 51 and 0 40 in 2016 respectively and tc dblf increased to 0 63 in 2017 during the 2016 2017 period in the spring and winter seasons the ndvi values of dblf and tg showed an upward trend and in summer they decreased slightly 1 ndvi value of tg temperate

analyze the vegetation cover variation in the bohai rim the classification and grading standard of soil erosion sl190 2007 zhang et al 2019 is applied to classify the vegetation cover into four classes namely low vegetation cover ndvi 0 30 medium 0 30 ndvi 0 50 medium high 0 50 ndvi 0 66 and high the value of ndvi 0 66 zhang et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 the classification statistics for the ndvi at multiple time scales in the study area are shown in fig 5 from 2002 to 2017 the medium high vegetation cover and high vegetation cover areas occupied 26 8 and 63 9 of the total area respectively with the average distribution in the northeast of liaoning province central hebei and most of shandong low vegetation cover and medium vegetation cover represented 1 7 and 7 5 of the total study area and were evenly divided among the northwest of liaoning province mainly around liao he river and the coastal area hebei province and the coastal area of shandong province based on the land use classification map of the study area from 2002 to 2017 http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php the vegetation coverage changes for the six different land use types agricultural land forest grassland wetland shrubland and sparse vegetation were analyzed fig 1 b from 2002 to 2017 the mean vegetation coverages of agricultural land forest grassland wetland shrubland and sparse vegetation were 0 64 0 75 0 63 0 41 0 67 and 0 32 respectively fig 6 agricultural land forest and shrubland had high rates of vegetation coverage accounting for approximately 66 0 98 7 and 79 4 of the land use types respectively fig 6 from 2002 to 2017 the mean vegetation coverages of agricultural land forest grassland wetland shrubland and sparse vegetation were 0 64 0 75 0 63 0 41 0 67 and 0 32 respectively fig 6 the other three types of vegetation cover accounted for a small portion in particular forest represented only 1 3 during the study period the high vegetation cover area of forest remained almost unchanged but the medium vegetation cover and medium high vegetation cover areas decreased by approximately 1 5 for agricultural land the medium vegetation cover and medium high vegetation cover areas decreased by 15 7 from 2002 to 2017 however the high vegetation cover area showed an increasing trend reaching 14 2 the medium high vegetation cover and high vegetation cover areas accounted for approximately 35 of the total grassland and wetland areas dynamic changes showed a decreasing trend for the high vegetation cover area of wetlands which decreased by approximately 5 6 and most coastal wetlands around the liao river significantly decreased wang et al 2020 in contrast grassland increased by approximately 12 2 with increases basically distributed in the northwestern and eastern parts of hebei province the medium vegetation cover area of grassland showed decreases that were mainly divided between the northwestern and southeastern parts of liaoning province mainly the coastal area these areas have a low altitude and human activities are more frequent jia et al 2007 in contrast in the past decade the economic development level of the bohai rim region has continuously increased showing a good momentum of development at the same time the expansion speed of coastal cities and the number of people have increased rapidly but the development level of the ecological environment of the bohai rim region has shown a fluctuating downward trend yang et al 2020 some of the sparse vegetation areas in this area are obviously occupied by construction land and roads and urban environmental problems such as soil and water pollution are one of the reasons for the degradation of the sparse vegetation in coastal areas yang et al 2020 in summary over the last 15 years the low vegetation cover area decreased and the medium and high vegetation cover areas had unstable change trends in particular the variation in the medium vegetation cover area fluctuated greatly among the six land use types the medium high cover area of agricultural land and shrubland the high cover area of wetlands and the sparse vegetation areas had decreasing trends the areas with other levels of coverage and land use types showed fluctuating changes fig 6 3 2 analysis of vegetation ndvi change trend 3 2 1 theil sen trend analysis of the ndvi table 1 shows that in the study area 5 5 2 85 104 km2 of the vegetation covered area was severely degraded with 1 4 showing significant change the severely degraded area with an obvious change was mainly distributed in the northern and southern parts of the temperate deciduous forest region forest and steppe in the south temperate zone which accounted for 35 7 63 5 and 4 7 respectively fig 7 the degradation status of the land use types indicated that agricultural land forest grassland and wetland in the study area accounted for 81 2 5 4 5 1 and 8 3 fig 8 of the severely degraded area with significant changes respectively the slightly degraded area accounted for 34 5 the slightly degraded area with significant changes represented approximately 3 6 and was mainly located in the northern part of the temperate deciduous forest region which accounted for approximately 91 4 of the slightly degraded area with significant change among the four main land use types of the study area agricultural land and forest accounted for 72 3 and 14 5 of the slightly degraded area with nonsignificant changes respectively whereas grassland and wetland accounted for only approximately 8 0 and 5 2 respectively fig 8 among the land use types agricultural land forest and grassland accounted for approximately 45 1 39 2 and 13 3 of the total unchanged area respectively and wetlands accounted for only approximately 2 5 fig 7 for the improved area the improved area with nonsignificant changes represented approximately 25 5 improved areas with significant changes were mainly observed in the northern and southern parts of the temperate deciduous forest region and agricultural land forest and grassland accounted for approximately 51 7 24 6 and 19 2 of these improved areas with significant changes respectively generally over the last 15 years the vegetation coverage of the bohai rim either slightly degraded or remained unchanged and the improved area 26 3 was significantly larger than the severely degraded area 5 5 among the land use types wetland agricultural land grassland and forest had slight degradation with nonsignificant changes while the severely degraded area represented a larger portion of wetlands approximately 10 than the other land use types fig 7 fig 8 the seasonal trend results fig 8 indicate that due to differences in the phenological characteristics of the vegetation types the order of the growth status of the vegetation in the bohai rim was as follows in spring slightly degraded area 53 5 unchanged area 35 6 severely degraded area 6 9 improved area 4 1 in summer and autumn fig 8 the order was unchanged area 43 6 45 3 slightly degraded area 39 4 35 1 improved area 12 4 15 5 severely degraded area 4 6 4 1 and in winter the order was severely degraded area 31 4 slightly degraded area 30 2 unchanged area 26 3 improved area 12 1 during the spring summer and autumn periods slightly degraded areas with nonsignificant changes and unchanged areas represented approximately 60 of agricultural land forest grassland and wetland and in the winter season the severely degraded area showing significant changes was approximately 20 greater than that in the other seasons in the bohai rim slightly degraded and unchanged vegetation covered areas accounted for a larger proportion of the total area the slightly degraded area was much larger than the improved area over the 15 year study period 3 2 2 the sustainability of the ndvi change trend into the future to evaluate the sustainability of the ndvi change trend of the study area we classified the hurst exponent into three classes namely h 0 5 with long term dependent and persistent time series i e future changes are consistent with past trends h 0 5 where the ndvi time series is a random series and there is no long term correlation and h 0 5 where the time series has anti persistence that is the future trend is contrary to the past trend li et al 2021 the dynamic trend in the ndvi was overlain with the hurst exponent to obtain its persistence distribution fig 10 table 2 the results indicate that severely degraded slightly degraded and persistently ameliorated areas represented approximately 3 2 15 8 and 20 9 of the total study area respectively and were mainly distributed fig 9 in agricultural lands forests and some grasslands the unchanged areas accounted for a larger proportion of approximately 34 01 anti persistent severely and slightly degraded areas and anti persistent improved areas accounted for approximately 2 1 16 8 and 4 7 respectively and were distributed in agricultural lands forests and some parts of grasslands and wetlands figs 9 10 the area with an uncertain change accounted for 2 5 of the total area and had a random distribution throughout the study area based on the results two main change trends will exist in the future for vegetation coverage in the bohai economic zone persistent slight degradation and improvement interestingly the persistent slight degradation areas were basically distributed in the coastal cities and large parts of the improved areas were located in northwest hebei province and liaoning province thus the protection and improvement of vegetation coverage in coastal areas need to be strengthened in the bohai economic zone seasonal hurst exponential changes fig 10 indicate that persistent unchanged areas and anti persistent slightly degraded areas accounted for a large proportion of the area from spring to autumn representing approximately 36 0 and 44 0 spring 45 8 and 52 4 summer and 38 4 and 34 4 autumn respectively table 2 the anti persistent improved area from spring to autumn showed an increasing trend and comprised approximately 4 0 12 5 and 15 6 of the total during the winter season persistent slight degradation areas and continuous degradation areas significantly increased accounting for 14 9 and 14 0 respectively table 2 the seasonal change trend for the sustainability of the land use types indicates that in spring grassland forest agricultural land and wetland were in a state of continuous improvement from summer to autumn persistently degraded areas increased and in the winter season the continually slightly and severely degraded areas significantly increased overall it can be concluded that from spring to autumn in the study area the vegetation covered area showed anti persistent slight degradation with nonsignificant changes in winter because most of the vegetation entered the late green stage vegetation degraded slightly 3 3 spatial heterogeneity of vegetation coverage dynamics 3 3 1 spatiotemporal variation and trend analysis of climate factors and pm2 5 in this study before analyzing the relationship between the vegetation coverage climate factors and pm2 5 we applied theil sen mk trend analysis to further understand the change trend for the annual average t p rh and pm2 5 value for the 2002 2017 period fig 13 the trend analysis showed that the range of average temperatures was 4 3 c 16 5 c fig 11 a high temperatures were recorded in southwestern hebei province and shandong province the mean temperatures of areas characterized by the four vegetation cover types from low vegetation cover to high were 12 4 c 10 9 c 11 6 c and 11 4 c respectively from the spatial distribution of the slope st and z zt values the temperature of most parts of the bohai rim showed an increasing trend except for some parts of northwestern hebei province the st of the four different vegetation cover types was 0 among them the st of the low vegetation covered area was the highest 0 03 and the maximum st values for forest and grassland reached 0 31 and 0 30 respectively table 3 the significance test showed that the zt 1 96 and zt 1 96 values were distributed only around the cities of dandong weifang beijing and tianjin although temperature had an increasing trend the trend was not significant in large parts of the study area fig 13 changes in precipitation indicated fig 11 b that the range for the average precipitation was 101 7 mm 445 8 mm the high precipitation area was mainly located in the eastern part of liaoning northeast of shandong province and this area also had medium and high vegetation cover the spatial distribution of the slope sp and z zp values shows that the entire study area was mainly sp 0 and included four types of vegetation cover areas sp 0 values appeared only around the cities of weifang and linyi in shandong province the areas with agricultural land forest grassland and wetland also showed sp 0 values table 3 for the significance test results zp 1 24 and zp 1 96 were mainly distributed in hebei liaoning and the eastern and western parts of shandong province where grassland forest agricultural land and wetland were distributed at zp 1 96 fig 13 the precipitation in the bohai rim had a significant decreasing trend over the last 15 years the relative humidity ranged from 50 5 to 94 6 fig 11 c and its change trend shows that the srh of agricultural land forest and wetland in shandong the southwestern and northern parts of hebei eastern liaoning province and the city of tianjin was below 0 srh 0 and had a decreasing trend the rh of grassland in eastern liaoning in northwestern hebei province and around the city of jining was sp 0 and showed an increasing trend fig 12 c table 3 the significance of the rh change trend indicates that the zrh value of most parts of the study area was between 1 96 and 1 96 showing an insignificant decrease except in the cities of chengde and langan fig 12 c the average pm2 5 changes in the last 15 years indicated fig 11 d that the pm2 5 of most cities in the bohai economic zone exceeded the national standard 35 µg m3 year of china meaning that these cities were in states of light to heavy pollution fig 11 d illustrates the spatial distribution of pm2 5 the area with pm2 5 35 µg m3 was mainly distributed in eastern and western liaoning province the pm2 5 concentration of the central part of liaoning province northern hebei province beijing and eastern shandong province was 35 µg m3 pm2 5 55 µg m3 and the pm2 5 value for the medium medium high and high vegetation cover areas was 55 µg m3 the areas with pm2 5 55 µg m3 were distributed in western shandong province southern hebei province and tianjin and these were also low vegetation cover areas the pm2 5 change trend indicated that the pm2 5 concentrations in the bohai rim showed an upward trend spm2 5 0 and the significance test indicated that except for the southwestern part of liaoning province west of liaodong bay the study region had a significant increasing trend zpm2 5 1 96 the zpm2 5 area was grassland while agricultural land forest and wetland were higher than 1 96 fig 12 d fig 13 d in conclusion during the last 15 years in the bohai region the temperature and pm2 5 concentration had upward trends and the pm2 5 change trend was significant the precipitation and relative humidity showed decreasing trends and both were mainly insignificant 3 3 2 modeling ndvi with climatic factors and pm2 5 by gwr the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 have spatial heterogeneity wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 thus in this study the gwr model was applied to determine the strength and direction of the spatially heterogeneous relationship between the ndvi climate factors and pm2 5 in the bohai rim to build the gwr model we first determined a suitable grid size and built a 3 3 km grid based on formula 11 the coefficient of variation cv of each size grid was calculated and compared the calculation results show that the cv values of each category in the 3 km grid were the smallest at 0 06 ndvi 3 2 t 4 2 p 10 9 rh and 5 2 pm2 5 the data fluctuated greatly and the homogeneity of the grid varied therefore a 3 km grid is one of the best grid units for studying the spatial differentiation of ndvi and four different selected factors c p rh and pm2 5 11 cv s x 100 where s is the standard deviation of the grid unit at each scale and is the average value of the grid unit at each scale the second step was to calculate the latitude longitude temperature precipitation relative humidity pm2 5 and ndvi of each grid point at the pixel level based on the interpolation results and the ndvi distribution data in the third step the ndvi was set as the independent variable and the climatic factors and pm2 5 were set as the explanatory variables to build the gwr model the accuracy of the model was evaluated by adjusted r2 r2 adjusted local r2 r2 local and the second order akaike information criterion aicc the results indicate that when the temperature was the explanatory variable the model gwr t had a high r2 adjusted of 0 89 and r2 local of 0 91 and a low aicc of 127 indicating a relatively high predictive accuracy fig 14 a and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 88 fig 15 a the order of r2 local for the different types of vegetation cover is as follows table 4 r2 local medium 0 85 r2 local medium high 0 81 r2 local high 0 80 r2 local low 0 75 which illustrates that temperature had a significant influence on the medium to high vegetation covered area in the study area low vegetation coverage was mainly distributed around the coastal area thus human activities may be the vital factor causing ndvi changes in that area wu et al 2014 liang et al 2015 for the model constructed with the explanatory variables of precipitation gwr p fig 14 b r2 adjusted and r2 local were 0 83 and 0 86 respectively and aicc was 487 the accuracy of the model was also high and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 86 fig 15 b indicating that precipitation is also one of the crucial factors affecting ndvi changes in the bohai rim the order of r2 local for the four types of vegetation cover is as follows r2 local high 0 87 r2 local medium high 0 84 r2 local low 0 83 r2 local medium 0 81 the accuracy of the model shows that the influence of precipitation on high vegetation cover was obvious table 4 the r2 local distribution table 5 indicated that in hebei province and shandong province the influence of precipitation on the ndvi was relatively obvious and r2 local reached 0 86 and 0 84 respectively the model gwr rh built with the relative humidity factor fig 14 c showed a reliable prediction accuracy with a higher r2 adjusted of 0 71 and r2 local of 0 76 and a low aicc of 232 the accuracy of the model indicated that the relative humidity in the study area especially shandong and liaoning provinces exerted a significant influence on vegetation coverage and r2 local reached 0 86 and 0 79 respectively fig 15 c considering the degree to which the relative humidity influenced the different types of vegetation coverage rh had an obvious effect on the medium and medium high vegetation cover areas table 4 and the order of r2 local for the four types of vegetation cover was as follows r2 local medium 0 86 r2 local medium high 0 84 r2 local high 0 79 r2 local low 0 74 to analyze the relationship between the vital environmental quality index pm2 5 and vegetation coverage a gwr pm2 5 model was constructed fig 14 d the accuracy of the model r2 adjusted reached 0 86 while r2 local and aicc were 0 88 and 208 respectively indicating that vegetation coverage and pm2 5 had a significant correlation differences in the relationship between the pm2 5 concentration and the degree of vegetation coverage were observed the order of r2 local for the four types of vegetation cover was as follows r2 local low 0 93 r2 local high 0 88 r2 local medium high 0 82 r2 local medium 0 86 table 4 this ranking shows that pm2 5 played a significant role in explaining the changes in the vegetation coverage especially for low and high vegetation cover areas the predictive map fig 15 d shows that the spatial distributions of the predicted and observed ndvi were very similar and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 87 fig 14 d the special distribution of r2 local indicated that in hebei shandong province pm2 5 had a significant influence on ndvi changes and r2 local reached 0 91 and 0 82 table 5 we evaluated the accuracy of the model constructed by single explanatory variables gwr t 0 89 gwr pm2 5 0 86 gwr p 0 83 gwr rh 0 71 by comparing the accuracy results it can be concluded that in the bohai rim the temperature pm2 5 and precipitation have a significant spatially heterogeneous relationship with the vegetation coverage especially for medium low and high vegetation cover areas clearly these explanatory variables exert a joint influence on vegetation thus a model built using four explanatory variables can further explain the relationship between the vegetation coverage and the selected factors the model gwr m constructed with multiple explanatory variables temperature precipitation relative humidity and pm2 5 and gwr rh c showed a high accuracy with an r2 adjusted value of 0 84 and a low aicc value 137 and the fitting degree of the regression straight line r2 was 0 85 fig 14 e the order of r2 local of the four types of vegetation cover was as follows r2 local medium high 0 85 r2 local medium 0 83 r2 local high 0 80 r2 local low 0 61 table 4 these results show that in the bohai rim other factors such as urban expansion port construction shipping emissions and heavy metal pollution zhang et al 2014 xin et al 2011 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 influenced the low vegetation cover area in addition to climate factors and pm2 5 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of vegetation coverage change trend based on the theil sen trend analysis at both annual 2002 2017 and seasonal scales the changing trends of vegetation coverage in bohai rim were evaluated the results show that in the last 15 years slightly degraded and unchanged vegetation cover areas accounted for a larger proportion of the total vegetation cover area the slightly degraded area was much larger than the improved area and large parts of the degraded area were only slightly degraded and exhibited nonsignificant changes in recent years research wu et al 2014 liang et al 2015 on changes in the vegetation coverage in the bohai rim has been limited wu et al 2014 used the satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation s10 spot vgt s10 product and semivariogram analysis to evaluate the spatial pattern of the ndvi across the bohai region and found that the ndvi was stable in 1999 2009 1999 2003 and 2009 in this study based on the mod13q1 data we found the same changing trend for the ndvi during the 2002 2008 period called the early stage in this stage the ndvimean value was close to the average ndvi of 2002 2017 according to the ndvi changes in 2009 2017 the study period was divided into two periods in the mid term stage 2009 2010 ndvimain had a decreasing trend and in the late stage 2011 2017 ndvimain was higher than the average ndvi value of the entire study period showing an increasing trend liang et al 2015 used the modis ndvi product to study the vegetation coverage change trend of the bohai region and according to the slope value concluded that during 2000 2009 the vegetation coverage in the bohai region had an increasing trend but this trend showed spatial differences such that some areas still had a decreasing trend hou et al 2010 and cui et al 2010 found the same trends in the vegetation coverage in the study area based on spot data wang et al 2020 used data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa avhrr to evaluate the changes in the vegetation coverage in china and proposed that from 1982 to 2016 moderately decreased regions made up approximately 11 0 of the total decreased area and were mainly located in northeastern china in terms of the quality of the vegetation ecology northeastern china is in a state of slight decrease and stability li et al 2021 in the bohai region the ecological environment level from 2004 to 2014 showed a decreasing trend dropping from 0 65 to 0 34 hua et al 2017 although from 2012 to 2014 a slight increase was observed overall the volatility trend decreased based on previous studies the results for the vegetation coverage change trend from 2002 to 2017 in the bohai rim are reasonable thus the different vegetation type change trends from 2002 to 2017 were further analyzed slight degradation was identified as the main change trend for vegetation coverage and observed in agricultural land forest wetland and grassland with agricultural land accounting for the largest proportion guo et al 2013 also found that agricultural land in the bohai region decreased by 139 2 104 hm2 during the 1985 2010 period considering the seasonal change trends for vegetation we found that in spring the order of the degradation degree was slightly degraded area unchanged area and severely degraded and improved areas were relatively small in summer and autumn the order was unchanged area slightly degraded area while the improved area was beginning to show an increasing trend in winter the order of the degradation degree was as follows degraded area slightly degraded area unchanged area improved area to determine the sustainability of the change trend of the vegetation coverage in the bohai rim based on the above discussed theil sen trend results the hurst exponent was applied other recent studies cheng et al 2017 li et al 2021 yang et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 have also analyzed the persistence of vegetation change trends into the near future on the basis of the sen mann kendall and hurst exponents li et al 2021 predicted the vegetation ecology quality veq of china and found that the veq in china has continually improved over the past 18 years and should maintain an improving trend in the bohai region in the future in our study the prediction results also indicate that although continuous degradation and continuous slight degradation still exist h 0 5 a larger area is experiencing continued improvement in the future the vegetation coverage in the bohai region may show an improving trend especially for agricultural land forest and grassland while wetlands may maintain a slight degradation trend and the improved area will likely be very small thus in the bohai region the protection of wetlands needs to be further strengthened 4 2 relationship between vegetation coverage and driving factors the temperature precipitation relative humidity and pm2 5 concentration were each individually applied as explanatory variables to explore the climate and environmental quality factors of the evolution of the vegetation pattern using a spatiotemporal nonstationary gwr model based on the accuracy the relationships between these variables and the vegetation coverage were evaluated in the bohai economic zone the temperature pm2 5 concentration and precipitation had a significant influence on the ndvi and r2 adjusted reached 0 89 0 86 and 0 83 respectively the gwr rh accuracy indicated that the relative humidity had a high but not significant correlation with the ndvi a number of recent studies li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 yang et al 2020 shen et al 2019 qu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 have also indicated that climate factors have a significant effect on vegetation coverage in china from 2002 to 2017 during the growing season the vegetation greenness had a negative correlation with temperature and a positive correlation with precipitation and the effects of precipitation were stronger than those of temperature li et al 2021 from 1982 to 2016 the ndvi and land surface temperature lst had a higher correlation than the ndvi and precipitation in china and the increase in the lst could stimulate vegetation growth in most parts of china wang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 increased precipitation with a minimum temperature during the growing season could motivate the growth of marsh vegetation across china shen et al 2021 in northeast china the vegetation growing season sos in arid or semiarid regions has a significant influence on precipitation songnen plain and liaohe plain while the sanjiang plain and the temperatures in the area of the three cold mountains played vital roles in determining the sos from 2002 to 2016 shen et al 2019 during 2000 2009 temperature and precipitation influenced vegetation growth in the bohai region and the increase in the precipitation and ndvi was positively correlated liang et al 2015 in the yangtze river basin temperature and evapotranspiration had positive correlations with the ndvi and precipitation and the humidity index showed a negative correlation with the ndvi zhang et al 2019 fang et al 2021 in our study we found that in the bohai region the temperature had a more significant influence on the medium vegetation cover area while the high vegetation cover area was mainly affected by the precipitation the low vegetation covered areas were mainly distributed in coastal areas and in addition to being affected by the climate factors they were also affected by human activities such as maritime traffic development industrial activities in coastal areas and port construction zhang et al 2014 xin et al 2011 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 lü et al 2014 in recent years some studies wang et al 2016 irga et al 2015 have proposed a significant correlation between pm2 5 and vegetation coverage the influence of vegetation coverage on pm2 5 concentration is complex and the increase in vegetation coverage has a positive influence on the decrease in pm2 5 and the correlation change in different seasons wang et al 2016 du et al 2019 in china pm2 5 was spatially heterogeneous and significantly higher in cities in eastern china than in cities in the west wang et al 2019 in the last decade in the bohai region the aerosol optical depth aod showed an intimate relationship with the population density industrial and agricultural activities and climate conditions xin et al 2011 in this study we found that from 2002 to 2017 in the bohai economic zone the pm2 5 concentration had a significant upward trend while the vegetation coverage had a slight decreasing trend the mean pm2 5 concentration varied for different vegetation cover areas in low vegetation areas the pm2 5 concentration was higher than in the medium high and high vegetation areas and it was the lowest in the medium vegetation cover areas although the pm2 5 change in the four types of vegetation covered areas showed a significant increasing trend the slopepm2 5 values were 0 the model constructed using pm2 5 further showed a spatiotemporally nonstationary relationship between the pm2 5 concentration and the ndvi and the r2 adjusted reached 0 86 the accuracy of the model indicates that in the bohai economic zone pm2 5 is an environmental factor that exerts a significant influence on vegetation growth especially in areas with low vegetation coverage the effective inhibitory effect of vegetation on pm2 5 in the atmospheric environment has been widely recognized the main reason is that the effective removal rate of pm2 5 by negative oxygen ions in the air can reach approximately 90 wang et al 2016 vegetation is an important factor in the production of negative oxygen ions in the ecological environment the increase in vegetation area has a positive impact on the decline in the pm2 5 concentration wang et al 2016 in contrast the concentration of negative oxygen ions in the air in areas with sparse vegetation is also low thus the concentration of pm2 5 in this area may rise rapidly and affect the photosynthesis of vegetation to some degree these consequences also further affirm that the gwr model can be used in managing nonstationary features such as human activities and environmental variation yang et al 2021 chun et al 2014 5 conclusion the results of this study reveal the spatiotemporal changes in the vegetation activity and its heterogeneous relationship with and response to climate drivers and pm2 5 from 2002 to 2017 in the bohai rim vegetation degradation ranked from slightly degraded area unchanged area improved area severely degraded area the slightly degraded and unchanged vegetation covered areas accounted for a larger proportion of the total area the slightly degraded area was much larger than the improved area over the 15 year study period sustainable slight degradation and persistent improvement coexisted mainly in agricultural land forest grassland and wetland although in coastal wetlands some severe degradation occurred thus the protection and improvement of vegetation coverage in coastal areas need to be strengthened in the bohai economic zone the accuracies of the models constructed with single explanatory variables were gwr t 0 89 gwr pm2 5 0 86 gwr p 0 83 gwr rh 0 71 further the temperature precipitation and pm2 5 showed intense spatially heterogeneous relationships and had a significant influence on the medium high and low vegetation cover areas when considering the joint influence of the factors the order of r2 local of the four types of vegetation coverage was as follows r2 local medium high 0 85 r2 local medium 0 83 r2 local high 0 80 r2 local low 0 61 the high and medium vegetation cover areas were the most strongly affected by the climate factors and pm2 5 it can also be concluded that in the bohai rim other factors such as urban expansion port construction shipping emissions and heavy metal pollution may influence the low vegetation cover area in addition to the climate factors and pm2 5 thus these results can help in the development of sustainable coastal region ecosystem management strategies and provide a theoretical basis for making scientific decisions about vegetation protection and ecological construction in the belt and road

2453,effective management of groundwater resources requires accurate estimates of aquifer hydraulic parameters one approach for estimating these parameters is to use aquifer water level responses to natural perturbations such as barometric pressure and earth tides in this study the time and frequency domain methods of barometric pressure and earth tide response are used to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties transmissivity and specific storage and taking the rongchang well in southwest china as an example in application the results show that the specific storage and transmissivity estimated by the four different methods vary widely with specific storage ranging from 8 43 10 7 4 68 10 5 m and transmissivity ranging from 6 90 10 7 3 40 10 6 m2 s however the differences in aquifer transmissivity are smaller than the aquifer specific storage the transmissivity obtained by the slug test is one order lager than those from barometric frequency barometric time and tidal turnadge methods and two orders of magnitude greater than those of tidal merrit method the ss value obtained by the barometric time method is closer to the results of the slug test while the ss values obtained by the other three methods are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the slug test results in the tidal turnadge method the uncertainty in the effective porosity introduces an additional uncertainty in the results the errors in the calculation process are minor in comparing to the uncertainties caused by the model assumptions for the rongchang well the tidal response method averages the hydraulic properties on a larger area than that of cbp model keywords water level perturbations aquifer parameters barometric response function earth tide scale effects data availability data could be accessed freely by the link in the acknowledgement section 1 introduction permeability controls fluid flow in the earth s crust affecting deformation heat energy and solute transport ingebritsen and gleeson 2017 manga et al 2012 specific storage is also important representing changes in fluid storage that result from changes in fluid pressure or mechanical stress kuang et al 2020 leakage is used in conjunction with the head drop across a confining layer to quantify recharge to individual aquifers these parameters are important for understanding and predicting aquifer hydraulic behavior which is needed for groundwater resource modeling and management folnagy et al 2013 aquifer pumping tests and slug tests are conventionally used to estimate hydraulic parameters by inducing hydraulic stresses in boreholes that cause hydraulic perturbations in time and space alley et al 2002 famiglietti 2014 yet aquifer tests i require the installation of water pumps and observation wells ii depend on expert execution and data interpretation which is time consuming and labor intensive and iii are not suitable for continuous observations of hydraulic parameters while indirect methods using subsurface geophysical properties e g electrical seismic can also be used to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties binley et al 2015 wang and barbour 2017 these methods are limited by non unique relationships between geophysical and hydromechanical subsurface properties while remote sensing methods have also been used deckers et al 2018 they are only applicable to the near surface and their estimates are qualitative or semiquantitative in the absence of supplementary data the responses of well water level to natural perturbations provide the ability to monitor aquifer hydraulic properties continuously and also eliminating the need for direct aquifer stimulation earth and atmospheric tides eat occur naturally and globally mcmillan et al 2019 and their relationship to groundwater hydraulic properties has been derived bredehoeft 1967 vanderkamp and gale 1983 and demonstrated for both barometric pressure jacob 1940 rojstaczer 1988 spane 2002 weeks 1979 and earth tides ferris 1951 responses fig 1 barometric pressure response methods have been used to estimate aquifer properties in the time domain furbish 1991 pozdniakov et al 2021 rasmussen and crawford 1997 spane 2002 spane and mackley 2011 and in the frequency domain hsieh et al 1987 hussein et al 2013 rojstaczer 1988 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2018 rasmussen and crawford 1997 used furbish s 1991 regression deconvolution procedure in the time domain to obtain the barometric response function and they identified three different forms which could be used to diagnose the types of aquifers rojstaczer 1988 proposed a model of water level responses to the atmospheric tides to estimate the hydraulic properties of aquifers and aquitards in the frequency domain a subsequent study rojstaczer and agnew 1989 extended this method to incorporate groundwater responses to earth tides these methods use the amplitude attenuation and phase lags between periodic inputs and groundwater levels to estimate aquifer parameters using analytic solutions for both confined and semi confined aquifers many studies that only use earth or atmospheric tides to estimate hydraulic conductivity allegre et al 2016 sun et al 2019b turnadge et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in additional although previous studies have used either time or frequency domain methods to estimate aquifer parameters there are few studies comparing these two methods in this study we compare time and frequency domain methods to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties transmissivity and specific storage using groundwater level responses to earth and atmospheric tides taking the rongchang well in southwestern china as an example we compare the transmissivity and specific storage obtained by the four methods with the traditional slug test estimates then the assumptions uncertainties and applicability of each method are investigated 2 groundwater fluctuations analysis techniques earth and atmospheric tides eat occur naturally and globally mcmillan et al 2019 and the water level in the borehole can always record periodically barometric pressure jacob 1940 rojstaczer 1988 spane 2002 weeks 1979 and earth tides signal bredehoeft 1967 ferris 1951 continuously observing the responses of the water level to earth tides and barometric pressure provides passive methods for obtaining the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer we employ the frequency and time domain water level response to barometric pressure response methods and the frequency domain water level response to earth tides methods to estimate the aquifer transmissivity and specific storage 2 1 conceptual model we use the frequency domain rojstaczer 1988 model and time domain regression deconvolution method rasmussen and crawford 1997 rasmussen and mote 2007 to determine the response of water levels to barometric pressure in open hole wells in aquifers and the cooper cooper et al 1967 model hereafter referred to as cbp model is used in the time domain barometric pressure response to estimate the aquifer transmissivity and storage coefficient wang s wang et al 2018 tidal leaky response model is used in the frequency domain to determine the response of water level to earth tide loads in open hole wells in aquifers it assumes that the aquitard is incompressible and has zero storage the aquifer is laterally extensive and that flow through the semi confining aquitard is vertical for the frequency domain barometric pressure response method the model proposed by rojstaczer 1988 is suitable for semi confined aquifers and for the time domain barometric pressure response the regression deconvolution method rasmussen and crawford 1997 and cbp model cooper et al 1967 could also be used for the semi confined aquifer for frequency domain tidal response methods wang et al 2018 s tidal leaky response model could also be used for semi confined aquifers therefore the same conceptual model of the semi confined aquifer can be used for different models fig 2 which is also suitable for describing the geologic setting of the rongchang well aquifer system 2 2 water level response to barometric pressure fluctuation barometric pressure is generated by the atmosphere and the pressure is loaded and unloaded due to changes in the weight of the atmosphere these changes are related to the periodic day and night and half day and night changes of atmospheric pressure and the non periodic long term movement of the atmosphere the barometric pressure response of aquifer system is that the pressure imbalance in the system caused by barometric pressure leads to the instantaneous change of the water level in the well resulting in the flow between the groundwater in the aquifer and the well furbish 1991 jacob 1940 weeks 1979 which leads to the fluctuation of the water level fig 2 the response of a well to atmospheric loading can be divided into four stages hussein et al 2013 rojstaczer 1988 in the first stage the barometric pressure acts directly on the surface of well water and water in the well flows into the aquifer leading to a drop in water level in the second stage the water level and the aquifer reach a balance within the hydraulic heads in the third stage the pressure increases in the aquifer results in the flow of water from the confined aquifer to the phreatic zone through the confining layer and the water level continues to drop in the fourth stage the barometric pressure acting on the ground surface is transmitted downward through the unsaturated zone and the confining layer and as the pressure acting on the water surface gradually offsets the equilibrium is finally reached then the water level began to slowly return to its original state rojstaczer 1988 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the response of barometric pressure to water level can be used to identify the aquifer confinement whether the wellbore storage or skin effect is significant or to determine the pneumatic diffusivity in the unsaturated zone near the well 2 2 1 frequency domain approach water levels in confined aquifers and semi confined aquifers are easily to be affected by the barometric pressure fluctuations the characteristics of the barometric pressure response are affected by the well radius the transmissivity of aquifer the thickness and vertical pneumatic diffusivity of the unsaturated zone and the thickness and vertical hydraulic diffusivity of the confining layer since the significant different of time scale on the different processes during water level changes to the barometric response the response of water level to atmospheric loading can be divided into high intermediate and low frequency responses rojstaczer 1988 sun et al 2020 the high frequency response is governed largely by the well radius and lateral diffusivity of the aquifer the intermediate frequency response is governed by the loading efficiency of the aquifer the low frequency response is governed by the vertical pneumatic diffusivity the thickness of the unsaturated zone the vertical hydraulic diffusivity and thickness of the confining layer rojstaczer 1988 proposed the barometric pressure response model which is applicable to confined and semi confined aquifers and converted the processes of barometric pressure response into three one dimensional flow problems 1 the vertical airflow between the ground surface and the groundwater level 2 the relationship between the groundwater level and the aquifer vertical groundwater flow 3 the horizontal groundwater flow between the aquifer and the wellbore jacob 1946 the gain be and the phase lag η of the water level in the well to barometric pressure response are as follows 1 be ω x 0 ρ g a p 0 a s 0 ρ g a 2 η ω arg x 0 ρ g a 3 p 0 a m i n 1 b

denote the amplitude of the atmospheric load and the water level fluctuation in the well ρ is the density of water and g is the acceleration of gravity p0 is the far field pore pressure of the aquifer pore pressure at the radial distance where the influence of the well can be ignored s0 is the drawdown of the aquifer and k0 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order zero the eq 1 describes the ratio of the amplitude of the water level fluctuation to the amplitude of the atmospheric load in terms of the equivalent water level eq 2 describes the phase shift between atmospheric load wave and water level fluctuations where r q and w are three dimensionless parameters regarding the three response processes and are defined as 7 r l unsat 2 ω 2 d unsat 8 q l con 2 ω 2 d con 9 w

distance between the water table and the top of the aquifer dcon is the vertical hydraulic diffusivity of this confining layer taqu is the horizontal transmissivity of aquifer be is the static confined barometric efficiency saqu and scon are the storage coefficients of the aquifer and the confining layer respectively the response of the well water level to the barometric pressure mainly depends on these three dimensionless parameters r q w if the observed pressure response of the well is fitted with the three theoretical solutions the aquifer parameters contained in the three dimensionless parameters can be estimated in order to fit the response of the well water level to the theoretical solution we need to determine its transfer function or barometric efficiency and the relationship between phase and frequency spectrum estimation can be used to find the transfer function that relates atmospheric load to water level bendat and piersol 2011 10 bb bt tb tt hb ht bw tw where bb and tt denote the auto power spectra of the barometric pressure and tidal volumetric strain respectively bt and tb denote the cross spectrum and complex conjugate of the cross spectrum between the barometric pressure and tidal strain respectively bw and tw denote the cross spectra between the barometric pressure and water level and between the tidal strain and the water level respectively and hb and ht denote the transfer function between the water level and barometric pressure and the water level and tidal strain respectively the influence of the tide on the water level can be separated by this transfer function 2 2 2 time domain approach regression deconvolution in the time domain furbish 1991 provides another method for analyzing the barometric pressure response of the well water level which is based on correlating incremental changes in barometric pressure with incremental changes in groundwater pressure 2 2 2 1 regression deconvolution to determine the barometric efficiency barometric efficiency can be regarded as a function of the lag time between the change in barometric pressure and the response in the well the regression deconvolution method can be used to estimate the time lag response between the pressure change and the well water level response the method is as follows butler et al 2011 rasmussen and crawford 1997 11 min n 0 n δ g w t n k 0 k α k δ b p t n τ k β k δ e t t n τ k 2 the barometric pressure response function in the time domain can be expressed as 12 brf τ k k 0 k α k τ k where δgw δbp and δet are the changes in borehole water level barometric pressure and earth tide potential gravity or strain respectively tn is the time of sample n k is the total time lag of relative time τk kδt αk and βk are the time lag coefficients for the barometric pressure and earth tide response respectively δt is the sampling period it is a condition that k n rasmussen et al rasmussen and crawford 1997 proposed a set of characteristic curves for the barometric pressure response of unconfined confined and semi confined aquifers according to the characteristic curves we can obtain the barometric efficiency be of the semi confined aquifer as 13 be max brf τ k 2 2 2 2 fitting the response model due to the pressure imbalance between the well and aquifer at the moment of pressure change previous researchers for example furbish 1991 have noticed that these instantaneous pressure imbalances can be regarded as single steps change of pressure and these applied barometric pressure steps can be regarded as separate slug tests therefore the cbp model can be used to fit the parameters cooper et al 1967 proposed a model for water level changes following sudden injection or pumping of a known volume of water in confined aquifers and semi confined aquifers with a finite diameter a set of type curves calculated by this model can determine the transmissivity of aquifer 14 h h 0 8 α π 2 0 e β u 2 α du u

aquifer t is elapsed time since initiation of test rc is the radius of the well casing rw is the radius of the well aquifer parameters could be estimated by combining regression deconvolution with cbp model in time domain 2 3 water level changes in response to earth tide the earth tide is caused by the gravity exerted on the earth by celestial bodies including the moon and the sun resulting in deformation of aquifers and pressure changes or fluid flow at aquifers and boreholes fig 2 tides are composed of various tidal components each tidal component is a sine function of time the cycle of the tide is determined by the cyclic motion of the moon the sun and the earth bartels 1957 hicks 2006 melchior 1983 generally tidal data can be analyzed from the perspectives of amplitude and phase in this study wang et al 2018 s tidal leaky response model is used to analyze the earth tide response 2 3 1 wang s tidal leaky response model because of the time it takes for water to flow in and out of the well there is a phase shift or time lag between the earth tide dilatation of the aquifer and the response to the water level in the well wang et al 2018 used harmonic disturbance to provide an analytical solution to the groundwater flow equation of the leaky aquifer the model takes into account the vertical leakage in aquitard which is expressed by the specific leakage σ kcon lcon it is assumed that the aquifer is laterally extensive and the flow through the semi confining aquitard is vertical the amplification factor a and phase lag η of wang s tidal leaky response model are as follows 18 a h w 0 b k u ε 0 ρ g 19 η arg h w 0 b k u ε 0 ρ g where 20 h w 0 i ω s i ω s k con l con ζ 21 ζ 1 r c r w 2 i ω r w 2 t β k 0 β r w k 1 β r w 22 β k con t l con i ω s t 1 2 where b and ku are the skempton s coefficient and the undrained bulk modulus of the aquifer ε is the tidal oscillation volumetric strain of the aquifer the compression is positive t and s are transmissivity and storage coefficient of the aquifer ρ is the density of groundwater g is the acceleration due to gravity kcon and lcon are vertical hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the aquitard ω is the frequency rc is the radius of the well casing rw is the radius of the well k0 and k1 are the zeroth and first order of the second modified bessel function respectively periodic water level in well hw

confining layer kcon hydraulic parameters such as transmissivity t specific leakage σ and storage coefficient s of the target aquifer can be calculated by fitting the observed data to the wang s tidal leaky response model 2 3 2 estimate the specific storage of aquifer when estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters using the tidal response model of wang et al 2018 it is necessary to assign value to one of the three parameters σ σ kcon lcon t and s and then invert the other two hydraulic parameters sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 in this study we first estimate the ss ss s d by two different methods and then obtain σ and t by fitting wang s tidal leaky response model 1 turnadge s model the specific storage ss of the aquifer can be obtained from the equation related to barometric efficiency be turnadge et al 2019 23 s s ρ w g θ e c w be where ρw is the density of groundwater g is the acceleration due to gravity θe is the effective porosity and cw is the matrix compressibility

incompressible in the aquifer with consolidated rock the incompressibility of the particles can be assumed in addition the porosity in the formula needs to be estimated in advance in the following analysis the tidal response method which use the specific storage that estimated by turnadge s model is called the tidal turnadge method 2 merrit s model building upon poroelastic theory developed by biot 1941 and the work of vanderkamp and gale 1983 hsieh et al 1988 modified bredehoeft s expression to allow for compressibility of the solid grains merrit 2004 provides an expression that associates ss with theoretical tidal potential w2 including the effect of compressibility of solid particles 24 s s 7 88 10 9 d w 2 dh the minus sign in eq 24 indicates that when the tide generating potential increases head in the aquifer decreases where h is the water level in the well according to merrit 2004 if the ratio of dw2 to dh is proportional to the ratio of the amplitude of harmonic component of tidal potential a2 to the amplitude of water head change ah in the same period τ the derivative in eq 24 can be approximated as finite difference 25 δ w 2 δ h a 2 τ θ a h τ the tidal component is 26 a

θ 0 5cos 2 θ for m2 wave merrit 2004 table 1 through harmonic analysis of the relationship between well water level and tide ah τ can be obtained in the following analysis the method of applying the specific storage calculated by the merrit s model to the wang s tidal leaky response model is called the tidal merrit method in summary the four methods for estimating aquifer transmissivity and specific storage are the barometric frequency the barometric time the tidal turnadge and the tidal merrit methods the process of estimating aquifer transmissivity and specific storage for each method is shown in the flowchart fig 3 where the black blue red and green lines represent the processes of estimating aquifer parameters by barometric frequency barometric time tidal turnadge and tidal merrit methods respectively 3 application to the rongchang well the rongchang rc well is located in chongqing city southwestern china with elevation of 363 m above sea level the well is on the southwest side of the huayingshan fault zone a relatively large fault zone in the area fig 4 b shows the well aquifer system and the wellbore structure this well has a depth of 251 m with no casing and the open hole diameter is 130 mm the lithology of the observed aquifer is quartz sandstone with a thickness of 213 8 m and the buried depth of the aquifer roof is 5 2 m the confining layer is mainly composed of shale with a thickness of 32 m table 1 the unsaturated zone is mainly composed of sandy clay fractures developed in several depths of the quartz sandstone while the major facture zone is developed at depth of 155 188 m in most cases the weathered and fractured formations are considered as equivalent to homogeneous media considering that the fractures are evenly distributed over a larger area neuman 1994 rong et al 2013 singh et al 1999 and the rongchang well is located near the huayingshan fault zone which may lead to the development of fractures in the sandstone aquifer system thus it may reasonable to regard it as an equivalent homogeneous for simplification we take the quartz sandstone as an equivalent homogeneous aquifer as did in many previous studies allegre et al 2016 elkhoury et al 2006 hsieh et al 1987 sun et al 2020 xue et al 2016 the ln 3a water level gauge and wyy 1 meteorological three element instrument produced by the institute of earthquake cea are used to record the water level and barometric pressure shi et al 2015 the ln 3a water level gauge has a measurement accuracy of 0 2 full scale with stabilization of 0 2 full scale and a resolution of 1 mm the water level measurement system consists of a pressure sensor and a data collector the sampling rate of the water level and barometric pressure is 1 min earth tide data are calculated from the theoretical volumetric strain via the venedikov s method venedikov et al 2003 since the well is far away from the coast the impact of the ocean tide on the groundwater level is ignored in this paper here we focus on the period from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 during this period the well water level shows a clear response to the earth tide and barometric pressure fluctuation fig 5 which provides suitable field observation data for model comparisons 3 1 barometric pressure response function we calculate aquifer parameters by the water level response to barometric pressure in frequency domain and time domain in the barometric frequency method the water level and barometric pressure data from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 are selected fig 6 the barometric efficiency be value is estimated to be 0 86 during the study period in the frequency domain and then the transfer function is used to fit the parameters sun et al 2019 the specific storage and the horizontal transmissivity of the aquifer in the best fitting are ss 6 08 10 6 m t 2 89 10 6 m2 s due to the pressure imbalance between the well and aquifer at the moment of pressure change these instantaneous pressure imbalances can be regarded as single steps change of pressure and these applied atmospheric pressure steps can be regarded as individual slug tests furbish 1991 therefore the cbp model can be used to fit the parameters in the barometric time fig 7 a presents the barometric pressure response function in the time domain for the rongchang well that represents the time lagged response of water levels to a unit step change in barometric pressure noting that approximately 90 min are required before a steady response is achieved with the delay representing the time required for borehole water levels to equilibrate with fluid pressures within the aquifer fig 7 b compares the barometric pressure response to the cbp type curves with a best fit for aquifer transmissivity t 3 40 10 6 m2 s and storage coefficient s 1 00 10 2 which can also be expressed in term of the aquifer specific storage ss 4 68 10 5 m 3 2 earth tide response function according to the amplitude spectra for water levels barometric pressure and earth tide potentials fig 5 the water level shows a clear response to earth tides with only a few frequencies dominating individual spectrum therefore we can use the earth tide response function to estimate aquifer parameters in the method of groundwater level in response to earth tide we choose m 2 constituent for further analysis because it shows a reliable and strong responses to the tide and it is more stable than other waves and is less affected by external influences fig 8 presents the impact of transmissivity t and leakage coefficient σ on a amplification factor and b phase lag in wang s tidal leaky response model when the aquifer storage coefficient is given which can be iterated using the amplification factor and phase lag equation to fit appropriate transmissivity and leakage coefficient the barometric pressure effect is first removed from the sampling data of water level minute from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 and then the baytap08 program tamura et al 1991 is used for harmonic analysis of tides the m 2 amplification factor and phase lag η between aquifer and borehole responses are 0 17 0 001 mm 10 9 and 22 76 0 84 respectively the phase shift is positive which indicates that the observed water level leads to tidal volume strain implying that the aquifer is semi confined the results of the barometric frequency method and previous studies also indicate the presence of leakage in the aquifer where the rongchang well is located lai et al 2021 therefore we choose the wang s tidal leaky response model with the leakage to fit the aquifer transmissivity and specific storage in tidal turnadge method the specific storage ss is calculated using eq 23 where we use the barometric efficiency estimated in the barometric time method be 0 85 and an effective porosity of 2 30 for quartz sandstone chowdhury et al 2022 table 1 the estimated ss is around 0 11 1 58 10 6 m based on wang s tidal leaky response model and the method of hydraulic parameters estimation fig 8 c the obtained transmissivity t of the aquifer is around 0 85 1 25 10 6 m2 s here we average hydraulic parameters as the calculated one that is ss 8 43 10 7 m and t 1 05 10 6 m2 s in the tidal merrit method the specific storage ss eq 27 is estimated as ss 5 00 5 11 10 6 m with a mean value of 5 06 10 6 m and the fitted transmissivity t value for the aquifer is around 6 70 7 10 10 7 m2 s with a mean value of 6 90 10 7 m2 s fig 8 d 4 discussion in this section we analyze the possibilities that cause the differences in the results from these different methods as well as the uncertainty and scale effects among the different methods 4 1 simplifications and assumptions of the original models of different methods many assumptions and simplifications are used in the establishment of the original models to obtain the analytic solutions which may lead to differences between the estimated and real values of transmissivity and specific storage and may result in less effective information of aquifers in the barometric frequency method rojstaczer 1988 model is applicable to the response of water level in open hole wells in confined and semi confined aquifers to barometric pressure loading this model assumes that 1 the loading efficiency of confining layer is equal to the load coefficient of aquifer the compressibility porosity and poisson s ratio of the aquifer are vertically and laterally uniform 2 air flow between the earth s surface and the water table and groundwater flow in the partial coning layer are vertical besides 3 the groundwater flow between the aquifer and the borehole is horizontal thus the three dimensional problem is decomposed into two vertical flows and a horizontal flow problem in the model of rojstaczer 1988 the response of a water well to atmospheric loading does not produce much information about the permeability of the aquifer and only the lower limit of the flow parameters can be obtained however in low permeability environments the response of wells water level to atmospheric loading can help estimate the transmissivity of the aquifer in the barometric time method the regression deconvolution model does not make too many assumptions however in the fitted cbp model in order to simplify the problem it assumes that 1 the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and uniform in thickness 2 the inertia of the water column in the well is ignored 3 the aquifer is completely closed without leakage and the groundwater is immediately released from the storage with the decrease of water head these assumptions in the cbp model leads to its application to confined aquifers in nature a perfectly confined aquifer is extremely rare the cbp model has been used to estimate aquifer parameters for semi confined aquifers and fractured aquifers kuang et al 2020 ostendorf et al 2015 ren et al 2018 sun et al 2019a xiang et al 2019 but it will overestimate ss for a leaky aquifer turnadge et al 2019 in both the tidal turnadge and tidal merrit methods we choose the wang s tidal leaky response model to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer wang s tidal leaky response model takes into account the influence of vertical leakage in the confining layer which makes it suitable to confined and semi confined aquifers wang s tidal leaky response model assumes that 1 the aquitard is incompressible and has zero storage 2 the flow through the semi confining aquitard is vertical 3 the aquifer is laterally extensive and 4 the inertia of the water column in the well is ignored the simplifications in the model limit its applicability to aquifers with relatively small thickness and leakage in addition the model is not applicable to estimate parameters in aquifers with t 10 4 m2 s furthermore a priori knowledge of specific storage is needed in order to estimate the aquifer transmissivity and specific leakage in addition turnadge s model and merrit s also make some assumptions which are summarized in table 2 the biggest difference between these two model assumptions is that turnadge s model does not consider the compressibility of solid grains while merrit s model considers the compressibility of solid grains turnadge s model assumes that the volume change in the aquifer in response to a change in stress could be approximated as occurring as a change in porosity and the solid grains making up the aquifer are incompressible this assumption is not very good for aquifers in competent rocks especially those with small porosity the compressibility of solid grains is neglected may overestimate the ss values of consolidated rocks because in low porosity and compressible consolidated rocks the amount of water extracted from the aquifer is always lower than the amount of water extracted from the aquifer is always less than the change in bulk volume turnadge et al 2019 in merrit s model the overall effect of assuming compressible solids is a reduction in ss cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 4 2 comparison of methods the hydraulic parameters obtained using different response models and methods are listed in table 3 overall the best fit specific storage estimated by the different methods vary widely ranging from ss 8 43 10 7 4 68 10 5 m the largest specific storage is inferred from the barometric time method 4 68 10 5 m whereas the values obtained with tidal turnadge method is two orders of magnitude smaller there are also quantitative differences in the best fit aquifer transmissivity inferred from the four different methods with transmissivity in the range of 6 90 10 7 3 40 10 6 m2 s but the differences are smaller than the aquifer specific storage obviously there are differences in the aquifer transmissivity and specific storage estimated by different methods in order to compare the results with traditional hydraulic test we collect slug test data from the rongchang well a field slug test is conducted on the rongchang well at 12 30 00 on 8 august 2010 and the water level data during the slug test from 8 august 2010 12 35 00 to 8 august 2010 14 28 18 is analyzed using aqtesolv software we select the mathematical solution of cbp cooper et al 1967 which is appropriate for confined and semi confined aquifers the type curve solution is matched to the water level displacement data collected during the slug test to estimate the aquifer parameters the result shows that the aquifer transmissivity is 1 07 10 5 m2 s with specific storage of 8 19 10 5 m the ss value obtained by the barometric time method is closer to the result of the slug test while the ss values obtained by the barometric frequency and the tidal merrit methods are one order of magnitude smaller than the result of the slug test and the ss value obtained by the tidal turnadge method is two orders of magnitude smaller than the slug test the cbp model in the barometric time method and slug test was originally developed for fully confined aquifers and later can be used for semi confined aquifers using the model developed by fully confined aquifers for semi confined aquifers will result in large estimates of ss the different values of ss estimated by the four methods are related to whether the compressibility of solid grains is considered and the dimensions of different loadings the barometric frequency barometric time and tidal turnadge methods assume that the grains are incompressible turnadge et al 2019 whereas the tidal merritt method allows for the compressibility of solid grains barometric pressure and tidal loadings act on aquifers in different ways in semi confined aquifers barometric pressure loading at the land surface is transmitted downward from grain to grain to the interface between the aquifer and an overlying confining layer hussein et al 2013 rojstaczer 1988 the process of barometric pressure loading is assumed to be three one dimensional processes tidal volumetric strain loads the aquifer and the well water level responds to aquifer deformation dilation and compression caused by earth tides biot 1941 hsieh et al 1987 the loading process of tidal volumetric strain is three dimensional the barometric time method can only roughly estimate the order of magnitude of the aquifer storage coefficient when the data plot is moved from one type curve to another fig 7 b the estimated value of s will change by an order of magnitude which may lead to over or under estimation of the obtained storage coefficient thus the transmissivity obtained by the slug test is one order larger than those from barometric frequency barometric time and tidal turnadge methods and two orders of magnitude greater than this of tidal merrit method one possibility is that the different scales existed in slug test and these passive methods which we will be discussed in later section among the two tidal response methods the transmissivity obtained by the tidal turnadge method is closer to that of the barometric pressure response methods because the matrix compressibility is included via be the differences between the barometric time and tidal turnadge methods in estimating t are smaller than those in estimating ss as shown in fig 9 the barometric pressure response method in time domain is insensitive to the storage coefficient s in the aquifer whereas the determined value of s will change by an order of magnitude when the data plot is shifted from one type curve to another with small changes in t in the rongchang well if the parameter α α rw 2s rc 2 is changed by four orders of magnitude the value of the parameter β β tt rc 2 is changed by no more than one order of magnitude and the smaller the borehole storage response the smaller the effect of the s value on the t value therefore the order of magnitude difference of ss calculated by the water level response to barometric pressure in time domain model is not obvious in the method of estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters using tidal response the m2 phase shift between the aquifer and borehole response is 22 76 0 84 and the transmissivity t does not change much with the change of the specific storage ss therefore there is little difference in transmissivity t inferred by the tidal turnadge method in comparing with other methods 4 3 uncertainties of model parameters in the frequency domain and time domain methods of the barometric pressure response barometric frequency and barometric time we fit the observed value to the theoretical curve to obtain the best parameters of the aquifer for goodness of fit we use the mean square deviation method mse and correlation coefficient r 28 mse 1 n i 1 n y y 2 29 r σ y y σ y σ y where y and y are the observed and fitted responses respectively σyy σy and σy are the covariances between y and y and the variances of y and y n is the number of sample points in both barometric frequency and barometric time methods we find the best fitting parameters by searching the minimum mse and obtain the correlation coefficients r the mse values and r values for the best fitting of different methods are shown in table 4 when the best fitting of each method is obtained the correlation coefficient of the barometric frequency method is r 0 9856 the mean square error is mse 3 69 10 4 and the hydraulic parameters obtained by the best fitting are t 2 89 10 6 m2 s and ss 6 08 10 6 m the correlation coefficient of barometric time method is r 0 9988 the mean square error is mse 6 57 10 4 and the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer obtained by the best fitting are t 3 40 10 6 m2 s and ss 4 68 10 5 m for the barometric frequency and barometric time methods the errors of the transmissivity estimates are about 2 77 and 0 29 while the errors of the specific storage estimates are about 2 80 and 0 24 respectively for the tidal responses of wang s tidal leaky response model the inversion errors inherent in the method was examined in detail by xue et al 2013 the calculated phase lag has subsample resolution due to the long time windows when we set the window length of each set of data to 30 days the errors of amplitude and phase lag during from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 in the rongchang well given by the baytap08 program tamura et al 1991 are 1 10 3 m strain and 0 84 respectively in the tidal response method we use both turnadge s model and merrit s model to obtain the specific storage of the aquifer in the tidal turnadge method we use the barometric efficiency be value in the barometric time method and the effective porosity of the aquifer medium in the rongchang well the main medium type of the aquifer is quartz sandstone with an effective porosity range of 2 30 chowdhury et al 2022 the errors of specific storage and transmissivity estimation are 87 54 and 19 05 in the tidal merrit method we first obtain the aquifer specific storage with an error value of 1 09 and then estimate the aquifer transmissivity with an error of 2 90 in the tidal turnadge method the uncertainty in the empirical value of the effective porosity of the aquifer media leads to larger errors in specific storage and transmissivity than that by the tidal merrit method based on the uncertainty analysis we conclude that for the rongchang well the errors of aquifer specific storage and transmissivity obtained in the other three methods are smaller than 3 except for the tidal turnadge method and such errors do not cause an order of magnitude difference in the parameter estimates table 3 the errors of the barometric time method are smallest among all methods in the rongchang well and of the using of empirical effective porosity will bring additional uncertainty to the results causing the largest errors in the tidal turnadge method therefore tidal turnadge method could be considered only when the effective porosity of the aquifer media is known and the difference in the estimated transmissivity is much smaller than those in specific storage indicating the reliability of the methods in transmissivity estimating all of these errors are secondary to the uncertainties introduced by the model assumptions allegre et al 2016 and the differences between the model selections provide the inherent uncertainties in the tidal response and barometric pressure response interpretation whether the estimated values of each model are close to the real values depends on the homogeneity of the aquifer the estimated parameters are to average the hydraulic characteristics at the scale that the model can measure and the effectiveness of these models depends on the existence of limits sun et al 2020 4 4 scale effects transmissivity have been observed to vary with the scale of observation sánchez vila et al 1996 increasing approximately linearly with test radius to an upper threshold less than a few hundred meters rovey and cherkauer 1995 while a scale effect has been observed at multiple locations carrera et al 1990 rovey and cherkauer 1995 samper calvete and garcia vera 1998 vesselinov et al 2001 the cause is not universal because of the different heterogeneity in different geological settings possible explanations for the scale effect include near borehole skin effects due to incomplete development of the well butler 1988 rovey 1998 rovey and niemann 2001 turbulent flow near the well lee and lee 1999 an artifact of data interpretation zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 higher connectivity within conductive zones martinez landa and carrera 2005 sánchez vila et al 1996 and the use of different estimation approaches that yield estimates over disparate ranges rovey and cherkauer 1995 sanchez vila et al 2006 introduce the concept of the representative hydraulic conductivity that is based on the ensemble average of flux divided by the corresponding hydraulic gradient and note that this value is often consistent with values interpreted from conventional hydraulic tests the cbp model is used to fit the parameters of the aquifer in both the barometric time method and the slug test in the cbp model the change value of the head at the distance r caused by water injection is 30 h v 4 π t t e r 2 s 4 t t t is the average transmissivity of aquifer t is the duration of slug test s is the storage coefficient of aquifer v is the volume of extracted water r is the distance from the well center we assume that the variation of storage coefficient with location or scale is negligible compared with the transmissivity the relationship between the ratio of drawdown in aquifer to drawdown in well and the distance of well is shown in fig 10 the red line represents the variation of the drawdown ratio with distance for the barometric time method and the blue line represents the variation of the drawdown ratio with distance for the slug test method in both barometric time and slug test methods the most sensitive area around the rongchang well is 5 m the aquifer transmissivity inferred by different methods represents the different scale ranges of aquifer characteristics allegre et al 2016 elkhoury et al 2006 and the scale range represented by t estimated by barometric time method is slightly larger than the scale range of t measured by slug test in the rongchang well both the barometric time method and the slug test used the cbp model but with different water injection methods the instantaneous pressure imbalance between the well and the aquifer can be regarded as a single step change of pressure and these steps of applying barometric pressure can be considered as individual slug tests thus the use of the cbp model in the barometric time method is equivalent to performing multiple slug tests for the tidal response method we employ the drawdown of water level as suggested by hsieh et al 1987 the drawdown in the aquifer could be expressed as 31 s w q 0 2 π t ϕ k e r α ψ k e i α i ψ k e r α ϕ k e i α exp i ω t among them 32 α ω s t 1 2 r where ker α and kei α are the kelvin functions of order zero q 0 exp iωt is the discharge from the aquifer to the well ω is the frequency of fluctuation r is the distance from the well center t is the average transmissivity of aquifer s is the storage coefficient of aquifer assuming ϕ 1 and ψ 0 eq 31 becomes 33 s w q 0 2 π t ker α i k e i α exp i ω t in this model the drawdown is determined by the transmissivity and the specific storage but they have opposite effect on the drawdown eq 32 to determine scale range represented by transmissivity in the tidal method we assume that the specific storage is constant relative to the transmissivity near the borehole we choose ss 2 00 10 6 m as a representative value of sandstone chowdhury et al 2022 in the analysis we also define the zone of influence using an attenuation of 5 relative to its maximum xue et al 2013 which reflects the measurement scale for the parameter the relationship between the ratio of drawdown in aquifer to drawdown in wellbore and the distance of well is shown in fig 10 in wang s tidal leaky response model the most sensitive area around the rongchang well is 10 15 m at present there is no method to quantitatively estimate the measurement scale of the frequency domain method for barometric pressure response in this method we use the averaged transmissivity to represent aquifer characteristics the scales of different methods are different table 4 the aquifer transmissivity that is estimated by wang s tidal leaky response model represents larger scale ranges of aquifer characteristics than those estimated by the barometric time method and the slug test method thus the differences of hydraulic parameters inferred by different methods maybe due to the scales that these methods measured and such differences also reflect the heterogeneity of the aquifer 5 summary and conclusions four methods of well water level response to periodic loads namely the barometric frequency barometric time tidal turnadge and tidal merrit methods are employed to estimate hydraulic properties of the well aquifer system in the rongchang well the results show that there are differences in the magnitudes of aquifer parameters calculated with different methods and that the difference in uncertainties and scales effect are due to the different assumptions of the models the result shows that the transmissivity inferred from four different methods are similar while there are orders different in specific storage by the different methods transmissivity is estimated around 0 69 10 6 m2 s to 3 40 10 6 m2 s while specific storage is estimated around 8 43 10 7 m to 4 68 10 5 m the result of specific storage is much variable than the transmissivity and hydraulic properties inferred by slug test show orders of difference with the four methods the scale effect could explain the difference in estimation among the tidal barometric pressure and slug test water level responses to natural perturbations in time and frequency domain provide a way to estimate hydraulic properties on the magnitude but cautions should be paid as different methods has its specific assumptions and simplifications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

2453,effective management of groundwater resources requires accurate estimates of aquifer hydraulic parameters one approach for estimating these parameters is to use aquifer water level responses to natural perturbations such as barometric pressure and earth tides in this study the time and frequency domain methods of barometric pressure and earth tide response are used to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties transmissivity and specific storage and taking the rongchang well in southwest china as an example in application the results show that the specific storage and transmissivity estimated by the four different methods vary widely with specific storage ranging from 8 43 10 7 4 68 10 5 m and transmissivity ranging from 6 90 10 7 3 40 10 6 m2 s however the differences in aquifer transmissivity are smaller than the aquifer specific storage the transmissivity obtained by the slug test is one order lager than those from barometric frequency barometric time and tidal turnadge methods and two orders of magnitude greater than those of tidal merrit method the ss value obtained by the barometric time method is closer to the results of the slug test while the ss values obtained by the other three methods are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the slug test results in the tidal turnadge method the uncertainty in the effective porosity introduces an additional uncertainty in the results the errors in the calculation process are minor in comparing to the uncertainties caused by the model assumptions for the rongchang well the tidal response method averages

ingebritsen and gleeson 2017 manga et al 2012 specific storage is also important representing changes in fluid storage that result from changes in fluid pressure or mechanical stress kuang et al 2020 leakage is used in conjunction with the head drop across a confining layer to quantify recharge to individual aquifers these parameters are important for understanding and predicting aquifer hydraulic behavior which is needed for groundwater resource modeling and management folnagy et al 2013 aquifer pumping tests and slug tests are conventionally used to estimate hydraulic parameters by inducing hydraulic stresses in boreholes that cause hydraulic perturbations in time and space alley et al 2002 famiglietti 2014 yet aquifer tests i require the installation of water pumps and observation wells ii depend on expert execution and data interpretation which is time consuming and labor intensive and iii are not suitable for continuous observations of hydraulic parameters while indirect methods using subsurface geophysical properties e g electrical seismic can also be used to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties binley et al 2015 wang and barbour 2017 these methods are limited by non unique relationships between geophysical and hydromechanical subsurface properties while remote sensing methods have also been used deckers et al 2018 they are only applicable to the near surface and their estimates are qualitative or semiquantitative in the absence of supplementary data the responses of well water level to natural perturbations provide the ability to monitor aquifer hydraulic properties continuously and also eliminating the need for direct aquifer stimulation earth and atmospheric tides eat occur naturally and globally mcmillan et al 2019 and their relationship to groundwater hydraulic properties has been derived bredehoeft 1967 vanderkamp and gale 1983 and demonstrated for both barometric pressure jacob 1940 rojstaczer 1988 spane 2002 weeks 1979 and earth tides ferris 1951 responses fig 1 barometric pressure response methods have been used to estimate aquifer properties in the time domain furbish 1991 pozdniakov et al 2021 rasmussen and crawford 1997 spane 2002 spane and mackley 2011 and in the frequency domain hsieh et al 1987 hussein et al 2013 rojstaczer 1988 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2018 rasmussen and crawford 1997 used furbish s 1991 regression deconvolution procedure in the time domain to obtain the barometric response function and they identified three different forms which could be used to diagnose the types of aquifers rojstaczer 1988 proposed a model of water level responses to the atmospheric tides to estimate the hydraulic properties of aquifers and aquitards in the frequency domain a subsequent study rojstaczer and agnew 1989 extended this method to incorporate groundwater responses to earth tides these methods use the amplitude attenuation and phase lags between periodic inputs and groundwater levels to estimate aquifer parameters using analytic solutions for both confined and semi confined aquifers many studies that only use earth or atmospheric tides to estimate hydraulic conductivity allegre et al 2016 sun et al 2019b turnadge et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in additional although previous studies have used either time or frequency domain methods to estimate aquifer parameters there are few studies comparing these two methods in this study we compare time and frequency domain methods to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties transmissivity and specific storage using groundwater level responses to earth and atmospheric tides taking the rongchang well in southwestern china as an example we compare the transmissivity and specific storage obtained by the four methods with the traditional slug test estimates then the assumptions uncertainties and applicability of each method are investigated 2 groundwater fluctuations analysis techniques earth and atmospheric tides eat occur naturally and globally mcmillan et al 2019 and the water level in the borehole can always record periodically barometric pressure jacob 1940 rojstaczer 1988 spane 2002 weeks 1979 and earth tides signal bredehoeft 1967 ferris 1951 continuously observing the responses of the water level to earth tides and barometric pressure provides passive methods for obtaining the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer we employ the frequency and time domain water level response to barometric pressure response methods and the frequency domain water level response to earth tides methods to estimate the aquifer transmissivity and specific storage 2 1 conceptual model we use the frequency domain rojstaczer 1988 model and time domain regression deconvolution method rasmussen and crawford 1997 rasmussen and mote 2007 to determine the response of water levels to barometric pressure in open hole wells in aquifers and the cooper cooper et al 1967 model hereafter referred to as cbp model is used in the time domain barometric pressure response to estimate the aquifer transmissivity and storage coefficient wang s wang et al 2018 tidal leaky response model is used in the frequency domain to determine the response of water level to earth tide loads in open hole wells in aquifers it assumes that the aquitard is incompressible and has zero storage the aquifer is laterally extensive and that flow through the semi confining aquitard is vertical for the frequency domain barometric pressure response method the model proposed by rojstaczer 1988 is suitable for semi confined aquifers and for the time domain barometric pressure response the regression deconvolution method rasmussen and crawford 1997 and cbp model cooper et al 1967 could also be used for the semi confined aquifer for frequency domain tidal response methods wang et al 2018 s tidal leaky response model could also be used for semi confined aquifers therefore the same conceptual model of the semi confined aquifer can be used for different models fig 2 which is also suitable for describing the geologic setting of the rongchang well aquifer system 2 2 water level response to barometric pressure fluctuation barometric pressure is generated by the atmosphere and the pressure is loaded and unloaded due to changes in the weight of the atmosphere these changes are related to the periodic day and night and half day and night changes of atmospheric pressure and the non periodic long term movement of the atmosphere the barometric pressure response of aquifer system is that the pressure imbalance in the system caused by barometric pressure leads to the instantaneous change of the water level in the well resulting in the flow between the groundwater in the aquifer and the well furbish 1991 jacob 1940 weeks 1979 which leads to the fluctuation of the water level fig 2 the response of a well to atmospheric loading can be divided into four stages hussein et al 2013 rojstaczer 1988 in the first stage the barometric pressure acts directly on the surface of well water and water in the well flows into the aquifer leading to a drop in water level in the second stage the water level and the aquifer reach a balance within the hydraulic heads in the third stage the pressure increases in the aquifer results in the flow of water from the confined aquifer to the phreatic zone through the confining layer and the water level continues to drop in the fourth stage the barometric pressure acting on the ground surface is transmitted downward through the unsaturated zone and the confining layer and as the pressure acting on the water surface gradually offsets the equilibrium is finally reached then the water level began to slowly return to its original state rojstaczer 1988 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the response of barometric pressure to water level can be used to identify the aquifer confinement whether the wellbore storage or skin effect is significant or to determine the pneumatic diffusivity in the unsaturated zone near the well 2 2 1 frequency domain approach water levels in confined aquifers and semi confined aquifers are easily to be affected by the barometric pressure fluctuations the characteristics of the barometric pressure response are affected by the well radius the transmissivity of aquifer the thickness and vertical pneumatic diffusivity of the unsaturated zone and the thickness and vertical hydraulic diffusivity of the confining layer since the significant different of time scale on the different processes during water level changes to the barometric response the response of water level to atmospheric loading can be divided into high intermediate and low frequency responses rojstaczer 1988 sun et al 2020 the high frequency response is governed largely by the well radius and lateral diffusivity of the aquifer the intermediate frequency response is governed by the loading efficiency of the aquifer the low frequency response is governed by the vertical pneumatic diffusivity the thickness of the unsaturated zone the vertical hydraulic diffusivity and thickness of the confining layer rojstaczer 1988 proposed the barometric pressure response model which is applicable to confined and semi confined aquifers and converted the processes of barometric pressure response into three one dimensional flow problems 1 the vertical airflow between the ground surface and the groundwater level 2 the relationship between the groundwater level and the aquifer vertical groundwater flow 3 the horizontal groundwater flow between the aquifer and the wellbore jacob 1946 the gain be and the phase lag η of the water level in the well to barometric pressure response are as follows 1 be ω x 0 ρ g a p 0 a s 0 ρ g a 2 η ω arg x 0 ρ g a 3 p 0 a m i n 1 b

can be separated by this transfer function 2 2 2 time domain approach regression deconvolution in the time domain furbish 1991 provides another method for analyzing the barometric pressure response of the well water level which is based on correlating incremental changes in barometric pressure with incremental changes in groundwater pressure 2 2 2 1 regression deconvolution to determine the barometric efficiency barometric efficiency can be regarded as a function of the lag time between the change in barometric pressure and the response in the well the regression deconvolution method can be used to estimate the time lag response between the pressure change and the well water level response the method is as follows butler et al 2011 rasmussen and crawford 1997 11 min n 0 n δ g w t n k 0 k α k δ b p t n τ k β k δ e t t n τ k 2 the barometric pressure response function in the time domain can be expressed as 12 brf τ k k 0 k α k τ k where δgw δbp and δet are the changes in borehole water level barometric pressure and earth tide potential gravity or strain respectively tn is the time of sample n k is the total time lag of relative time τk kδt αk and βk are the time lag coefficients for the barometric pressure and earth tide response respectively δt is the sampling period it is a condition that k n rasmussen et al rasmussen and crawford 1997 proposed a set of characteristic curves for the barometric pressure response of unconfined confined and semi confined aquifers according to the characteristic curves we can obtain the barometric efficiency be of the semi confined aquifer as 13 be max brf τ k 2 2 2 2 fitting the response model due to the pressure imbalance between the well and aquifer at the moment of pressure change previous researchers for example furbish 1991 have noticed that these instantaneous pressure imbalances can be regarded as single steps change of pressure and these applied barometric pressure steps can be regarded as separate slug tests therefore the cbp model can be used to fit the parameters cooper et al 1967 proposed a model for water level changes following sudden injection or pumping of a known volume of water in confined aquifers and semi confined aquifers with a finite diameter a set of type curves calculated by this model can determine the transmissivity of aquifer 14 h h 0 8 α π 2 0 e β u 2 α du u

functions of the first kind and y0 and y1 are the zero order and first order bessel functions of the second kind respectively t is the transmissivity of the aquifer s is the storage coefficient of the aquifer t is elapsed time since initiation of test rc is the radius of the well casing rw is the radius of the well aquifer parameters could be estimated by combining regression deconvolution with cbp model in time domain 2 3 water level changes in response to earth tide the earth tide is caused by the gravity exerted on the earth by celestial bodies including the moon and the sun resulting in deformation of aquifers and pressure changes or fluid flow at aquifers and boreholes fig 2 tides are composed of various tidal components each tidal component is a sine function of time the cycle of the tide is determined by the cyclic motion of the moon the sun and the earth bartels 1957 hicks 2006 melchior 1983 generally tidal data can be analyzed from the perspectives of amplitude and phase in this study wang et al 2018 s tidal leaky response model is used to analyze the earth tide response 2 3 1 wang s tidal leaky response model because of the time it takes for water to flow in and out of the well there is a phase shift or time lag between the earth tide dilatation of the aquifer and the response to the water level in the well wang et al 2018 used harmonic disturbance to provide an analytical solution to the groundwater flow equation of the leaky aquifer the model takes into account the vertical leakage in aquitard which is expressed by the specific leakage σ kcon lcon it is assumed that the aquifer is laterally extensive and the flow through the semi confining aquitard is vertical the amplification factor a and phase lag η of wang s tidal leaky response model are as follows 18 a h w 0 b k u ε 0 ρ g 19 η arg h w 0 b k u ε 0 ρ g where 20 h w 0 i ω s i ω s k con l con ζ 21 ζ 1 r c r w 2 i ω r w 2 t β k 0 β r w k 1 β r w 22 β k con t l con i ω s t 1 2 where b and ku

storage coefficient of the aquifer ρ is the density of groundwater g is the acceleration due to gravity kcon and lcon are vertical hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the aquitard ω is the frequency rc is the radius of the well casing rw is the radius of the well k0 and k1 are the zeroth and first order of the second modified bessel function respectively periodic water level in well hw m hw 0eiωt hw 0 is complex amplitude the response amplitude and phase shift are related to the aquifer transmissivity t aquifer storage coefficient s and the aquitard hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer kcon hydraulic parameters such as transmissivity t specific leakage σ and storage coefficient s of the target aquifer can be calculated by fitting the observed data to the wang s tidal leaky response model 2 3 2 estimate the specific storage of aquifer when estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters using the tidal response model of wang et al 2018 it is necessary to assign value to one of the three parameters σ σ kcon lcon t and s and then invert the other two hydraulic parameters sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 in this study we first estimate the ss ss s d by two different methods and then obtain σ and t by fitting wang s tidal leaky response model 1 turnadge s model the specific storage ss of the aquifer can be obtained from the equation related to barometric efficiency be turnadge et al 2019 23 s s ρ w g θ e c w be where ρw is the density of groundwater g is the acceleration due to gravity θe is the effective porosity and cw is the matrix compressibility generally the approximate value of the three variables can be assumed ρw 1000 kg m3 g 9 81 m s2 and cw 4 58 10 10 pa turnadge et al 2019 table 1 in this equation the grain is required to be incompressible in the aquifer with consolidated rock the incompressibility of the particles can be assumed in addition the porosity in the formula needs to be estimated in advance in the following analysis the tidal response method which use the specific storage that estimated by turnadge s model is called the tidal turnadge method 2 merrit s model building upon poroelastic theory developed by biot 1941 and the work of vanderkamp and gale 1983 hsieh et al 1988 modified bredehoeft s expression to allow for compressibility of the solid grains merrit 2004 provides an expression that associates ss with theoretical tidal potential w2 including the effect of compressibility of solid particles 24 s s 7 88 10 9 d w 2 dh the minus sign in eq 24 indicates that when the tide generating potential increases head in the aquifer decreases where h is the water level in the well according to merrit 2004 if the ratio of dw2 to dh is proportional to the ratio of the amplitude of harmonic component of tidal potential a2 to the amplitude of water head change ah in the same period τ the derivative in eq 24 can be approximated as finite difference 25 δ w 2 δ h a 2 τ θ a h τ the tidal component is 26 a

earth radius g is the acceleration due to gravity the amplitude factor b 0 908 munk and macdonald 1960 is a constant related to the tidal wave composition period τ f θ is a function of latitude θ so f θ 0 5cos 2 θ for m2 wave merrit 2004 table 1 through harmonic analysis of the relationship between well water level and tide ah τ can be obtained in the following analysis the method of applying the specific storage calculated by the merrit s model to the wang s tidal leaky response model is called the tidal merrit method in summary the four methods for estimating aquifer transmissivity and specific storage are the barometric frequency the barometric time the tidal turnadge and the tidal merrit methods the process of estimating aquifer transmissivity and specific storage for each method is shown in the flowchart fig 3 where the black blue red and green lines represent the processes of estimating aquifer parameters by barometric frequency barometric time tidal turnadge and tidal merrit methods respectively 3 application to the rongchang well the rongchang rc well is located in chongqing city southwestern china with elevation of 363 m above sea level the well is on the southwest side of the huayingshan fault zone a relatively large fault zone in the area fig 4 b shows the well aquifer system and the wellbore structure this well has a depth of 251 m with no casing and the open hole diameter is 130 mm the lithology of the observed aquifer is quartz sandstone with a thickness of 213 8 m and the buried depth of the aquifer roof is 5 2 m the confining layer is mainly composed of shale with a thickness of 32 m table 1 the unsaturated zone is mainly composed of sandy clay fractures developed in several depths of the quartz sandstone while the major facture zone is developed at depth of 155 188 m in most cases the weathered and fractured formations are considered as equivalent to homogeneous media considering that the fractures are evenly distributed over a larger area neuman 1994 rong et al 2013 singh et al 1999 and the rongchang well is located near the huayingshan fault zone which may lead to the development of fractures in the sandstone aquifer system thus it may reasonable to regard it as an equivalent homogeneous for simplification we take the quartz sandstone as an equivalent homogeneous aquifer as did in many previous studies allegre et al 2016 elkhoury et al 2006 hsieh et al 1987 sun et al 2020 xue et al 2016 the ln 3a water level gauge and wyy 1 meteorological three element instrument produced by the institute of earthquake cea are used to record the water level and barometric pressure shi et al 2015 the ln 3a water level gauge has a measurement accuracy of 0 2 full scale with stabilization of 0 2 full scale and a resolution of 1 mm the water level measurement system consists of a pressure sensor and a data collector the sampling rate of the water level and barometric pressure is 1 min earth tide data are calculated from the theoretical volumetric strain via the venedikov s method venedikov et al 2003 since the well is far away from the coast the impact of the ocean tide on the groundwater level is ignored in this paper here we focus on the period from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 during this period the well water level shows a clear response to the earth tide and barometric pressure fluctuation fig 5 which provides suitable field observation data for model comparisons 3 1 barometric pressure response function we calculate aquifer parameters by the water level response to barometric pressure in frequency domain and time domain in the barometric frequency method the water level and barometric pressure data from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 are selected fig 6 the barometric efficiency be value is estimated to be 0 86 during the study period in the frequency domain and then the transfer function is used to fit the parameters sun et al 2019 the specific storage and the horizontal transmissivity of the aquifer in the best fitting are ss 6 08 10 6 m t 2 89 10 6 m2 s due to the pressure imbalance between the well and aquifer at the moment of pressure change these instantaneous pressure imbalances can be regarded as single steps change of pressure and these applied atmospheric pressure steps can be regarded as individual slug tests furbish 1991 therefore the cbp model can be used to fit the parameters in the barometric time fig 7 a presents the barometric pressure response function in the time domain for the rongchang well that represents the time lagged response of water levels to a unit step change in barometric pressure noting that approximately 90 min are required before a steady response is achieved with the delay representing the time required for borehole water levels to equilibrate with fluid pressures within the aquifer fig 7 b compares the barometric pressure response to the cbp type curves with a best fit for aquifer transmissivity t 3 40 10 6 m2 s and storage coefficient s 1 00 10 2 which can also be expressed in term of the aquifer specific storage ss 4 68 10 5 m 3 2 earth tide response function according to the amplitude spectra for water levels barometric pressure and earth tide potentials fig 5 the water level shows a clear response to earth tides with only a few frequencies dominating individual spectrum therefore we can use the earth tide response function to estimate aquifer parameters in the method of groundwater level in response to earth tide we choose m 2 constituent for further analysis because it shows a reliable and strong responses to the tide and it is more stable than other waves and is less affected by external influences fig 8 presents the impact of transmissivity t and leakage coefficient σ on a amplification factor and b phase lag in wang s tidal leaky response model when the aquifer storage coefficient is given which can be iterated using the amplification factor and phase lag equation to fit appropriate transmissivity and leakage coefficient the barometric pressure effect is first removed from the sampling data of water level minute from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 and then the baytap08 program tamura et al 1991 is used for harmonic analysis of tides the m 2 amplification factor and phase lag η between aquifer and borehole responses are 0 17 0 001 mm 10 9 and 22 76 0 84 respectively the phase shift is positive which indicates that the observed water level leads to tidal volume strain implying that the aquifer is semi confined the results of the barometric frequency method and previous studies also indicate the presence of leakage in the aquifer where the rongchang well is located lai et al 2021 therefore we choose the wang s tidal leaky response model with the leakage to fit the aquifer transmissivity and specific storage in tidal turnadge method the specific storage ss is calculated using eq 23 where we use the barometric efficiency estimated in the barometric time method be 0 85 and an effective porosity of 2 30 for quartz sandstone chowdhury et al 2022 table 1 the estimated ss is around 0 11 1 58 10 6 m based on wang s tidal leaky response model and the method of hydraulic parameters estimation fig 8 c the obtained transmissivity t of the aquifer is around 0 85 1 25 10 6 m2 s here we average hydraulic parameters as the calculated one that is ss 8 43 10 7 m and t 1 05 10 6 m2 s in the tidal merrit method the specific storage ss eq 27 is estimated as ss 5 00 5 11 10 6 m with a mean value of 5 06 10 6 m and the fitted transmissivity t value for the aquifer is around 6 70 7 10 10 7 m2 s with a mean value of 6 90 10 7 m2 s fig 8 d 4 discussion in this section we analyze the possibilities that cause the differences in the results from these different methods as well as the uncertainty and scale effects among the different methods 4 1 simplifications and assumptions of the original models of different methods many assumptions and simplifications are used in the establishment of the original models to obtain the analytic solutions which may lead to differences between the estimated and real values of transmissivity and specific storage and may result in less effective information of aquifers in the barometric frequency method rojstaczer 1988 model is applicable to the response of water level in open hole wells in confined and semi confined aquifers to barometric pressure loading this model assumes that 1 the loading efficiency of confining layer is equal to the load coefficient of aquifer the compressibility porosity and poisson s ratio of the aquifer are vertically and laterally uniform 2 air flow between the earth s surface and the water table and groundwater flow in the partial coning layer are vertical besides 3 the groundwater flow between the aquifer and the borehole is horizontal thus the three dimensional problem is decomposed into two vertical flows and a horizontal flow problem in the model of rojstaczer 1988 the response of a water well to atmospheric loading does not produce much information about the permeability of the aquifer and only the lower limit of the flow parameters can be obtained however in low permeability environments the response of wells water level to atmospheric loading can help estimate the transmissivity of the aquifer in the barometric time method the regression deconvolution model does not make too many assumptions however in the fitted cbp model in order to simplify the problem it assumes that 1 the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and uniform in thickness 2 the inertia of the water column in the well is ignored 3 the aquifer is completely closed without leakage and the groundwater is immediately released from the storage with the decrease of water head these assumptions in the cbp model leads to its application to confined aquifers in nature a perfectly confined aquifer is extremely rare the cbp model has been used to estimate aquifer parameters for semi confined aquifers and fractured aquifers kuang et al 2020 ostendorf et al 2015 ren et al 2018 sun et al 2019a xiang et al 2019 but it will overestimate ss for a leaky aquifer turnadge et al 2019 in both the tidal turnadge and tidal merrit methods we choose the wang s tidal leaky response model to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer wang s tidal leaky response model takes into account the influence of vertical leakage in the confining layer which makes it suitable to confined and semi confined aquifers wang s tidal leaky response model assumes that 1 the aquitard is incompressible and has zero storage 2 the flow through the semi confining aquitard is vertical 3 the aquifer is laterally extensive and 4 the inertia of the water column in the well is ignored the simplifications in the model limit its applicability to aquifers with relatively small thickness and leakage in addition the model is not applicable to estimate parameters in aquifers with t 10 4 m2 s furthermore a priori knowledge of specific storage is needed in order to estimate the aquifer transmissivity and specific leakage in addition turnadge s model and merrit s also make some assumptions which are summarized in table 2 the biggest difference between these two model assumptions is that turnadge s model does not consider the compressibility of solid grains while merrit s model considers the compressibility of solid grains turnadge s model assumes that the volume change in the aquifer in response to a change in stress could be approximated as occurring as a change in porosity and the solid grains making up the aquifer are incompressible this assumption is not very good for aquifers in competent rocks especially those with small porosity the compressibility of solid grains is neglected may overestimate the ss values of consolidated rocks because in low porosity and compressible consolidated rocks the amount of water extracted from the aquifer is always lower than the amount of water extracted from the aquifer is always less than the change in bulk volume turnadge et al 2019 in merrit s model the overall effect of assuming compressible solids is a reduction in ss cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 4 2 comparison of methods the hydraulic parameters obtained using different response models and methods are listed in table 3 overall the best fit specific storage estimated by the different methods vary widely ranging from ss 8 43 10 7 4 68 10 5 m the largest specific storage is inferred from the barometric time method 4 68 10 5 m whereas the values obtained with tidal turnadge method is two orders of magnitude smaller there are also quantitative differences in the best fit aquifer transmissivity inferred from the four different methods with transmissivity in the range of 6 90 10 7 3 40 10 6 m2 s but the differences are smaller than the aquifer specific storage obviously there are differences in the aquifer transmissivity and specific storage estimated by different methods in order to compare the results with traditional hydraulic test we collect slug test data from the rongchang well a field slug test is conducted on the rongchang well at 12 30 00 on 8 august 2010 and the water level data during the slug test from 8 august 2010 12 35 00 to 8 august 2010 14 28 18 is analyzed using aqtesolv software we select the mathematical solution of cbp cooper et al 1967 which is appropriate for confined and semi confined aquifers the type curve solution is matched to the water level displacement data collected during the slug test to estimate the aquifer parameters the result shows that the aquifer transmissivity is 1 07 10 5 m2 s with specific storage of 8 19 10 5 m the ss value obtained by the barometric time method is closer to the result of the slug test while the ss values obtained by the barometric frequency and the tidal merrit methods are one order of magnitude smaller than the result of the slug test and the ss value obtained by the tidal turnadge method is two orders of magnitude smaller than the slug test the cbp model in the barometric time method and slug test was originally developed for fully confined aquifers and later can be used for semi confined aquifers using the model developed by fully confined aquifers for semi confined aquifers will result in large estimates of ss the different values of ss estimated by the four methods are related to whether the compressibility of solid grains is considered and the dimensions of different loadings the barometric frequency barometric time and tidal turnadge methods assume that the grains are incompressible turnadge et al 2019 whereas the tidal merritt method allows for the compressibility of solid grains barometric pressure and tidal loadings act on aquifers in different ways in semi confined aquifers barometric pressure loading at the land surface is transmitted downward from grain to grain to the interface between the aquifer and an overlying confining layer hussein et al 2013 rojstaczer 1988 the process of barometric pressure loading is assumed to be three one dimensional processes tidal volumetric strain loads the aquifer and the well water level responds to aquifer deformation dilation and compression caused by earth tides biot 1941 hsieh et al 1987 the loading process of tidal volumetric strain is three dimensional the barometric time method can only roughly estimate the order of magnitude of the aquifer storage coefficient when the data plot is moved from one type curve to another fig 7 b the estimated value of s will change by an order of magnitude which may lead to over or under estimation of the obtained storage coefficient thus the transmissivity obtained by the slug test is one order larger than those from barometric frequency barometric time and tidal turnadge methods and two orders of magnitude greater than this of tidal merrit method one possibility is that the different scales existed in slug test and these passive methods which we will be discussed in later section among the two tidal response methods the transmissivity obtained by the tidal turnadge method is closer to that of the barometric pressure response methods because the matrix compressibility is included via be the differences between the barometric time and tidal turnadge methods in estimating t are smaller than those in estimating ss as shown in fig 9 the barometric pressure response method in time domain is insensitive to the storage coefficient s in the aquifer whereas the determined value of s will change by an order of magnitude when the data plot is shifted from one type curve to another with small changes in t in the rongchang well if the parameter α α rw 2s rc 2 is changed by four orders of magnitude the value of the parameter β β tt rc 2 is changed by no more than one order of magnitude and the smaller the borehole storage response the smaller the effect of the s value on the t value therefore the order of magnitude difference of ss calculated by the water level response to barometric pressure in time domain model is not obvious in the method of estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters using tidal response the m2 phase shift between the aquifer and borehole response is 22 76 0 84 and the transmissivity t does not change much with the change of the specific storage ss therefore there is little difference in transmissivity t inferred by the tidal turnadge method in comparing with other methods 4 3 uncertainties of model parameters in the frequency domain and time domain methods of the barometric pressure response barometric frequency and barometric time we fit the observed value to the theoretical curve to obtain the best parameters of the aquifer for goodness of fit we use the mean square deviation method mse and correlation coefficient r 28 mse 1 n i 1 n y y 2 29 r σ y y σ y σ y where y and y are the observed and fitted responses respectively σyy σy and σy are the covariances between y and y and the variances of y and y n is the number of sample points in both barometric frequency and barometric time methods we find the best fitting parameters by searching the minimum mse and obtain the correlation coefficients r the mse values and r values for the best fitting of different methods are shown in table 4 when the best fitting of each method is obtained the correlation coefficient of the barometric frequency method is r 0 9856 the mean square error is mse 3 69 10 4 and the hydraulic parameters obtained by the best fitting are t 2 89 10 6 m2 s and ss 6 08 10 6 m the correlation coefficient of barometric time method is r 0 9988 the mean square error is mse 6 57 10 4 and the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer obtained by the best fitting are t 3 40 10 6 m2 s and ss 4 68 10 5 m for the barometric frequency and barometric time methods the errors of the transmissivity estimates are about 2 77 and 0 29 while the errors of the specific storage estimates are about 2 80 and 0 24 respectively for the tidal responses of wang s tidal leaky response model the inversion errors inherent in the method was examined in detail by xue et al 2013 the calculated phase lag has subsample resolution due to the long time windows when we set the window length of each set of data to 30 days the errors of amplitude and phase lag during from 1 june 2018 to 2 june 2019 in the rongchang well given by the baytap08 program tamura et al 1991 are 1 10 3 m strain and 0 84 respectively in the tidal response method we use both turnadge s model and merrit s model to obtain the specific storage of the aquifer in the tidal turnadge method we use the barometric efficiency be value in the barometric time method and the effective porosity of the aquifer medium in the rongchang well the main medium type of the aquifer is quartz sandstone with an effective porosity range of 2 30 chowdhury et al 2022 the errors of specific storage and transmissivity estimation are 87 54 and 19 05 in the tidal merrit method we first obtain the aquifer specific storage with an error value of 1 09 and then estimate the aquifer transmissivity with an error of 2 90 in the tidal turnadge method the uncertainty in the empirical value of the effective porosity of the aquifer media leads to larger errors in specific storage and transmissivity than that by the tidal merrit method based on the uncertainty analysis we conclude that for the rongchang well the errors of aquifer specific storage and transmissivity obtained in the other three methods are smaller than 3 except for the tidal turnadge method and such errors do not cause an order of magnitude difference in the parameter estimates table 3 the errors of the barometric time method are smallest among all methods in the rongchang well and of the using of empirical effective porosity will bring additional uncertainty to the results causing the largest errors in the tidal turnadge method therefore tidal turnadge method could be considered only when the effective porosity of the aquifer media is known and the difference in the estimated transmissivity is much smaller than those in specific storage indicating the reliability of the methods in transmissivity estimating all of these errors are secondary to the uncertainties introduced by the model assumptions allegre et al 2016 and the differences between the model selections provide the inherent uncertainties in the tidal response and barometric pressure response interpretation whether the estimated values of each model are close to the real values depends on the homogeneity of the aquifer the estimated parameters are to average the hydraulic characteristics at the scale that the model can measure and the effectiveness of these models depends on the existence of limits sun et al 2020 4 4 scale effects transmissivity have been observed to vary with the scale of observation sánchez vila et al 1996 increasing approximately linearly with test radius to an upper threshold less than a few hundred meters rovey and cherkauer 1995 while a scale effect has been observed at multiple locations carrera et al 1990 rovey and cherkauer 1995 samper calvete and garcia vera 1998 vesselinov et al 2001 the cause is not universal because of the different heterogeneity in different geological settings possible explanations for the scale effect include near borehole skin effects due to incomplete development of the well butler 1988 rovey 1998 rovey and niemann 2001 turbulent flow near the well lee and lee 1999 an artifact of data interpretation zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 higher connectivity within conductive zones martinez landa and carrera 2005 sánchez vila et al 1996 and the use of different estimation approaches that yield estimates over disparate ranges rovey and cherkauer 1995 sanchez vila et al 2006 introduce the concept of the representative hydraulic conductivity that is based on the ensemble average of flux divided by the corresponding hydraulic gradient and note that this value is often consistent with values interpreted from conventional hydraulic tests the cbp model is used to fit the parameters of the aquifer in both the barometric time method and the slug test in the cbp model the change value of the head at the distance r caused by water injection is 30 h v 4 π t t e r 2 s 4 t t t is the average transmissivity of aquifer t is the duration of slug test s is the storage coefficient of aquifer v is the volume of extracted water r is the distance from the well center we assume that the variation of storage coefficient with location or scale is negligible compared with the transmissivity the relationship between the ratio of drawdown in aquifer to drawdown in well and the distance of well is shown in fig 10 the red line represents the variation of the drawdown ratio with distance for the barometric time method and the blue line represents the variation of the drawdown ratio with distance for the slug test method in both barometric time and slug test methods the most sensitive area around the rongchang well is 5 m the aquifer transmissivity inferred by different methods represents the different scale ranges of aquifer characteristics allegre et al 2016 elkhoury et al 2006 and the scale range represented by t estimated by barometric time method is slightly larger than the scale range of t measured by slug test in the rongchang well both the barometric time method and the slug test used the cbp model but with different water injection methods the instantaneous pressure imbalance between the well and the aquifer can be regarded as a single step change of pressure and these steps of applying barometric pressure can be considered as individual slug tests thus the use of the cbp model in the barometric time method is equivalent to performing multiple slug tests for the tidal response method we employ the drawdown of water level as suggested by hsieh et al 1987 the drawdown in the aquifer could be expressed as 31 s w q 0 2 π t ϕ k e r α ψ k e i α i ψ k e r α ϕ k e i α exp i ω t among them 32 α ω s t 1 2 r where ker α and kei α are the kelvin functions of order zero q 0 exp iωt is the discharge from the aquifer to the well ω is the frequency of fluctuation r is the distance from the well center t is the average transmissivity of aquifer s is the storage coefficient of aquifer assuming ϕ 1 and ψ 0 eq 31 becomes 33 s w q 0 2 π t ker α i k e i α exp i ω t in this model the drawdown is determined by the transmissivity and the specific storage but they have opposite effect on the drawdown eq 32 to determine scale range represented by transmissivity in the tidal method we assume that the specific storage is constant relative to the transmissivity near the borehole we choose ss 2 00 10 6 m as a representative value of sandstone chowdhury et al 2022 in the analysis we also define the zone of influence using an attenuation of 5 relative to its maximum xue et al 2013 which reflects the measurement scale for the parameter the relationship between the ratio of drawdown in aquifer to drawdown in wellbore and the distance of well is shown in fig 10 in wang s tidal leaky response model the most sensitive area around the rongchang well is 10 15 m at present there is no method to quantitatively estimate the measurement scale of the frequency domain method for barometric pressure response in this method we use the averaged transmissivity to represent aquifer characteristics the scales of different methods are different table 4 the aquifer transmissivity that is estimated by wang s tidal leaky response model represents larger scale ranges of aquifer characteristics than those estimated by the barometric time method and the slug test method thus the differences of hydraulic parameters inferred by different methods maybe due to the scales that these methods measured and such differences also reflect the heterogeneity of the aquifer 5 summary and conclusions four methods of well water level response to periodic loads namely the barometric frequency barometric time tidal turnadge and tidal merrit methods are employed to estimate hydraulic properties of the well aquifer system in the rongchang well the results show that there are differences in the magnitudes of aquifer parameters calculated with different methods and that the difference in uncertainties and scales effect are due to the different assumptions of the models the result shows that the transmissivity inferred from four different methods are similar while there are orders different in specific storage by the different methods transmissivity is estimated around 0 69 10 6 m2 s to 3 40 10 6 m2 s while specific storage is estimated around 8 43 10 7 m to 4 68 10 5 m the result of specific storage is much variable than the transmissivity and hydraulic properties inferred by slug test show orders of difference with the four methods the scale effect could explain the difference in estimation among the tidal barometric pressure and slug test water level responses to natural perturbations in time and frequency domain provide a way to estimate hydraulic

2454,the intensity duration frequency idf curves that inform engineering design must reflect the effects of changing climate on extreme precipitation events these changes can be addressed in part by statistically assessing synthetic data outputs from high resolution climate model projections to develop idf curves the estimation of idf curves is associated with multiple sources of uncertainty most studies that characterize uncertainty in idf curves under climate change only address the uncertainty due to the choice and processing of climate model outputs but neglect uncertainty from statistical modeling choices this study assesses the uncertainty introduced by developing idf curves for maryland usa from model simulations of current and future climate using statistical methods that are used in u s practice the study analyzes output time series from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap suite which consists of 6 atmosphere ocean general circulation models each spatially downscaled with two different regional climate models in a separate study the 3 hour narccap model output was temporally downscaled to 15 min using two different machine learning models uncertainty is assessed both across and within models across model uncertainty arises from the differences among synthetic time series for precipitation and other meteorological variables produced by the 12 narccap climate model projections within model uncertainty arises from the modeling choices used to develop statistical idf curves from a single climate model time series these choices include temporal downscaling method time series type distribution and parameter estimation method the choice of climate model across model uncertainty is the dominant contributor under both current and future climate conditions on the within model level the other sources of uncertainty contribute differently for different climate models the development and application of future climate idf curves should

sources that have been referenced herein 1 introduction human activities in the past century have led to excessive greenhouse gas emissions that have caused an increase in average global temperature cheng and aghakouchak 2014 min et al 2011 extreme precipitation events are affected by the thermodynamic laws such as clausius clapeyron cc relation clausius 1850 trenberth et al 2003 which suggests an increase in the atmospheric moisture content with higher air temperatures at 7 per degree celsius warming emmanouil et al 2022 guerreiro et al 2018 prein and mearns 2021 therefore the rising temperature due to climate change eventually leads to an increase in the intensity and frequency of the precipitation events while these arguments are valid on a larger spatiotemporal resolution divergence from thermodynamic laws is expected on finer resolutions due to multiple meteorology and climate factors such as local features of atmospheric convection moustakis et al 2020 consistent with this trend most regions in the united states are expected to undergo more frequent extreme precipitation through the 21st century than under current climate conditions field et al 2012 kunkel et al 2013 intensity duration frequency idf curves are used in a range of engineering applications to assess risk and design stormwater management systems and other water related infrastructure emmanouil et al 2020 langousis and veneziano 2007 veneziano and furcolo 2002 zhu 2013 statistically derived idf curves are obtained through statistical analysis of rainfall data and represent the frequency of exceedance associated with averaged rainfall intensities for representative durations idf curves are developed based on historical precipitation records and the assumption that extreme precipitation characteristics such as frequency intensity and return period remain stationary over time temporal stationarity hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 however under climate change conditions these characteristics are altered and therefore the temporal stationarity assumption is violated cheng and aghakouchak 2014 thus idf curves need to be updated to account for the potential effects of climate change this is usually done by leveraging synthetic data outputs from high resolution climate model projections the future extreme precipitation scenarios used in climate model projections are developed using different combinations of general circulation models gcms and emission scenarios hailegeorgis et al 2009 these gcms are subject to epistemic uncertainties arising from several sources such as their parameterization and initial and boundary conditions emmanouil et al 2022 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 in addition to the uncertainty from climate change projections the frequency analysis of extreme precipitation is affected by the statistical modeling choices such as the type of distribution and parameter estimation method pem comprehensive quantification and characterization of uncertainty associated with the development of idf curves using future climate projection are essential for robust assessment of extreme precipitation however existing studies that have characterized uncertainty in idf curves under climate change conditions have only addressed the uncertainty due to the choice of climate models and associated procedures performed to employ such models in developing idf curves namely in addition to uncertainty arising from the choice of gcm regional climate models rcms and representative concentration pathways rcps numerous studies have investigated other related processes such as the short simulation periods of rcms spatial and temporal downscaling methods choice of reference periods for bias correction of climate models the spatial resolution of the rcm ensemble the spatial adjustment technique and rcm downscaling ratios most studies demonstrated that among the factors related to the climate model projections the variability in the values provided by the climate models is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty however few studies have addressed the uncertainty derived from statistical modeling choices such as the choice of distribution or pem in the process of developing idf curves hailegeorgis et al 2009 overeem et al 2008 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 furthermore few studies have investigated and compared the relative effects of the uncertainty due to both the choice of the climate models and statistical modeling choices this study produces sets of current and mid 21st century future climate projections in the form of an ensemble of idf curves for the state of maryland these idf curves are developed from statistical analyses of synthetic data from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap under a high carbon emission projection mearns et al 2007 the narccap is an international program containing climate scenarios used to investigate uncertainties in future climate projections on a regional scale the narccap suite consists of 6 atmosphere ocean general circulation models each spatially downscaled with two different regional climate models for a total of 12 models furthermore this study explores the uncertainty associated with the choice of the climate model and compares it to the effects of uncertainties associated with statistical modeling choices including different analysis types distributions and pems in addition to these factors two different machine learning ml algorithms used for the temporal downscaling of climate models are considered as an additional source of uncertainty this study further provides a graphical framework to explore and compare the contribution of sources of uncertainty 1 1 objective and framework this study assesses uncertainty on two levels 1 across model uncertainty and 2 within model uncertainty these two uncertainty assessments are illustrated in fig 1 using a logic tree structure across model uncertainty refers to the uncertainty arising from the differences in synthetic precipitation and other meteorological variable time series resulting from the 12 climate model projections within model uncertainty refers to the uncertainty arising from the modeling choices i e temporal downscaling methods analysis types distributions and pems used to develop idf curves using the synthetic time series from a single climate model projection the purpose of investigating the uncertainty on the within model level is to explore the relative contributions of the different choices and whether the contribution of the sources of uncertainty is different from one climate model to the others fig 1 shows 12 logic tree branches corresponding to the climate model projections from narccap which are listed in table 2 the synthetic precipitation time series outputs of the climate models are available in 3 hour intervals two temporal downscaling ml models artificial neural networks ann and boosted trees bt are selected and employed based on a series of analyses a summary of which is provided in section 2 2 the ml models are utilized to temporally downscale the 3 hour time series of the narccap models to durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min for the statistical analysis used to develop idf curves two time series analysis types are considered annual maximum series ams and partial duration series pds noaa n d for the ams branch of the logic tree five distributions 4 4 as noted in skahill and kanney 2019 many distributions have been documented for modeling extreme precipitation e g kappa exponential weibull gamma gumbel generalized extreme value log pearson iii and others many of these distributions are not derived from extreme value theory and the extent to which they are statistically appropriate is not clear nonetheless this descriptive study seeks to understand how different choices that practitioners and analysts might make in the process translate into variation uncertainty in precipitation frequency estimates with this goal in mind this study considers the suite of candidate distributions used in noaa atlas 14 of generalized extreme value gev generalized pareto gp generalized logistic glo generalized normal gno and pearson type 3 pe 3 and three pems of l moments l mom method of moments mom and maximum likelihood estimation mle are considered the pds branch has similar pems to the ams branch however it only considers the gp distribution hypothesis tests i e kolmogorov smirnov and chi square are performed on the fitted distributions and branches of the tree corresponding to combinations of distribution and pem that are rejected by these tests are pruned the remaining branches are used to create an ensemble of idf curves from which an average is calculated for each grid location of the climate models located in the study region additional details regarding each step of the analysis are provided in section 3 1 2 summary of existing work while an existing body of literature addresses uncertainty within the fields of meteorology hydrology and hydraulics this literature review focuses on the studies that have explored sources of uncertainty that affect idfs for precipitation events under current and changing climate conditions table 1 summarizes essential information for each reference and facilitates the comparison among the studies regarding several factors specifically table 1 includes the following information for each study the region for which the study was conducted data types e g observation reanalysis data used in the process of analysis climate models considered emission scenarios not included source of uncertainty addressed the method used for assessment of uncertainty and the durations and return periods that are considered in the study hailegeorgis et al 2009 quantified the uncertainties associated with extreme precipitation analysis under climate change effects in the form of idf curves they used at site and regional frequency analysis and employed a non parametric bootstrap resampling approach to assess uncertainty in the delineation of homogeneous groups additionally they investigated uncertainties associated with different pems and distributions and showed that uncertainties due to sampling for regional groups exceed the uncertainties attributable to various distributions and pems solaiman 2011 investigated the uncertainty associated with the choice of atmosphere ocean global climate models used for the estimation of extreme precipitation under climate change conditions they proposed an approach for quantifying uncertainties using a statistical downscaling method based on a non parametric data driven kernel estimator and compared it to the bayesian reliability ensemble average method the comparison showed that while the bayesian approach is suitable for predicting mean changes in precipitation unlike the kernel method it has limited capabilities in analyzing climate responses and cannot estimate the uncertainty of extreme events on a daily time scale zhu et al 2013 proposed an integrated approach to assess the uncertainty of extreme rainfall intensity for the united states under future climate projections they considered uncertainty arising from short simulation periods of rcms and the differences in idf curves derived from multiple rcms of the narccap their approach used the likelihood of rcms which was obtained based on the goodness of fit between the extreme rainfall intensities from the rcms and the reanalysis data of the national centers for environmental prediction they used bayesian model averaging for the assessment of uncertainty in idf curves they divided the drivers of uncertainty to within due to short simulation periods of rcms and among model uncertainty due to multiple rcms they concluded that among model uncertainty is the dominant source of uncertainty it is noted that the terms within and among used in zhu et al 2013 study is different from the terms defined in this study for referring to types of uncertainty alam and elshorbagy 2015 constructed future idf curves under different climate change scenarios and quantified future changes in idf curves and uncertainties using a large ensemble of climate projections their study included spatial and temporal downscaling using the k nearest neighbor k nn algorithm they converted daily precipitation to hourly precipitation and hourly precipitation to sub hourly durations their results indicated that global climate models are the main contributor to the uncertainty followed by rcps and the downscaling method fadhel et al 2017 analyzed the uncertainty in idf curves due to different climate baseline periods they developed idf curves considering eight reference periods for future climate and compared them to idf curves for the current climate comparing the idf curves of the current climate with those of the future suggested that the uncertainty in the percentage of change in the projected rainfall intensity significantly varies over the different reference periods switzman et al 2017 characterized the variability in the ensemble of idf curves considering future climate and combinations of different climate models climate change scenarios and spatial downscaling methods they developed an ensemble of idf curves for two local study sites in canada their analysis indicated that the uncertainty due to the choice of the climate model is greater than that arising from spatial variability in extreme rainfall spatial downscaling method and emission scenarios hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 investigated uncertainties related to gcms gcm initial conditions and rcps associated with the precipitation projections of future climate models they found the choice of gcm to be the dominant contributor to the uncertainty followed by gcm initial conditions and rcps their result emphasized the importance of ensemble size in accounting for the uncertainty in climate change projections yang et al 2018 analyzed the uncertainty associated with rcm temporal downscaling ratios scale driven for weather stations their results showed a significant level of uncertainty in idf curves that was more evident at shorter durations and longer return periods noor et al 2018 developed a framework to update the idf curves under climate change scenarios and used boxplots to demonstrate the associated uncertainties due to the choice of gcm and rcp their results showed that the uncertainty in rainfall intensity for shorter durations in different return periods is 2 to 6 times more than longer duration rainfalls kim et al 2020 quantified the uncertainty of future idf curves considering various combinations of climate models they calculated the uncertainty of the ensemble averaged idf curves as a function of the coefficient of variation of the ensemble their results suggest that including many climate models does not reduce the uncertainty and it is significantly affected by considering specific climate models at each location finally they proposed a method to reduce the uncertainty by excluding rcms in the ensemble of idf curves that contributed heavily to the site specific uncertainty cook et al 2020 explored the effect of the spatial resolution of the rcm ensemble and the spatial adjustment technique on climate corrected idf curves and resulting stormwater infrastructure designs they performed the study considering multiple locations in the united states representative of different climate zones their results suggested that these two sources of uncertainty can significantly change the idf values and potentially the size of stormwater systems in most locations most existing studies focus on the uncertainty that arises from the choice of climate models e g choice of gcm rcm and rcps and the associated procedures used to employ such models in the development of idf curves e g the short simulation periods of rcms choice of spatial and temporal downscaling methods few studies have explored the uncertainty due to the statistical modeling choices such as the choice of distribution or pem in the process of developing idf curves in addition few studies have investigated and compared the relative effects of the uncertainty due to both the choice of the climate models and statistical modeling choices hence the objective of this study is to perform an uncertainty assessment to explore the relative contribution of the choice of the climate model 12 narccap models temporal downscaling methods ann bt and statistical modeling choices including analysis types ams versus pds distributions gev gp gno glo pe 3 and pems l mom mom mle 2 data and region of study 2 1 synthetic data and extraction of analysis points the narccap is an international program containing climate scenarios used to investigate variability in future climate projections on a regional scale the regional climate models rcms of narccap are forced by sets of atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms over a domain covering the united states canada and northern mexico these aogcms are run for the current historical period 1971 2000 and driven with the sres a2 emissions scenario for the 21st century 2041 2070 table 2 shows the twelve narccap model combinations considered in this study for all models the narccap data consists of different fields categorized by their spatial and temporal structures the model output is organized into five groups 1 daily fields e g maximum and minimum daily surface air temperature 2 primary 3 hourly surface fields e g surface specific humidity and precipitation 3 additional 3 hourly fields e g snowmelt surface runoff 4 fixed static surface fields e g latitude longitude and surface altitude and 5 atmospheric fields e g vertical wind component and cloud ice fraction of layer mearns et al 2007 the narccap rcms are discretized into 50 km grid cells climate model outputs provide precipitation in units of kg m 2 s 1 they are converted to units of inches of depth by multiplying by 425 19708 the values of precipitation in the rcms are treated as average or uniform values over the grid cells 2500 km 2 in area the conversion from areal averages to point values applied the inversion of a widely used point to area adjustment areal reduction factor or arf leclerc and schaake s 1972 graphical arf a function of duration hr and area mi 2 was manually curve fitted then inverted such that the area to point conversion factor equals 1 arf noaa does not recommend exceeding 350 mi 2 in areal reduction procedures therefore the values for 2 500 km 2 grid cells were evaluated and applied at 350 mi2 906 5 km 2 using these curve fit equations resulted in the following adjustment

are based on six regional models narccap rcms that use slightly different 50 km spatial grids across the north american domain fig 2 a shows the grid centers for the six rcms shown with square symbols that are located inside maryland and neighboring states the outputs need to be obtained at common locations to develop the ensemble of idfs curves that considers all climate models therefore the locations of a series of analysis points shown with pin symbol in fig 2a and separately shown in perspective view in fig 2b are chosen using a nearest neighbor approach to create a common grid the analysis point locations in the common grid were selected to cover the state of maryland while balancing distance to the nearest neighbor grid centers of the narccap regional models then for each location in the common grid the data associated with the nearest grid cell in the climate model is assigned this nearest neighbor approach is equivalent to the assumption that the model predicted precipitation is constant over a grid cell this approach prevents introducing further variability by interpolating 2 2 observational data and application of ml in temporal downscaling of climate model projections as noted in the previous section the narccap synthetic time series are available at a 3 hour temporal resolution in a precursor to the present study al kajbaf et al 2022 a series of candidate ml models were developed for temporal downscaling of 3 hour narccap precipitation time series to durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min the trained ml models use data collected from the narccap data groups 1 and 2 identified above including 3 hour precipitation and maximum and minimum daily temperature several ml models including ann bt random forest rf and support vector regression svr were considered candidates for temporal downscaling of observational data the models were trained with observational data hourly and 15 minute precipitation time series collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national center for environmental information ncei noaa cdo n d database for gauges located in a defined study area that covers maryland delaware and parts of virginia west virginia pennsylvania and new jersey as shown in fig 3 the behavior of the ml models was evaluated from the perspective of their performance in predicting large target response quantities identifying systematic trends in errors and investigating input output relationships using response functions furthermore a multi criteria metric was used that accounts for multiple error metrics in comparing model performance error metrics included mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse coefficient of determination r 2 and correlation coefficient r ultimately ann and bt were selected for use in the analysis based on their efficiency higher accuracy in terms of performance metrics such as r in predicting important events larger precipitation values and the calculated multi criteria metric 3 development of idf curves following the temporal downscaling of climate model generated precipitation time series from 3 hour time steps to durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min 15 min idf curves are developed considering all combinations of the climate models and modeling assumptions shown in the logic tree branches in fig 1 the overall analysis procedure consists of the following key components 1 data series preparation for each of the 12 climate models shown in fig 1 synthetic time series are prepared or generated for selected durations of 15 minutes to 48 h for durations lower than 3 h ann and bt are used to temporally downscale the 3 hour time series available from the climate models for durations longer than 3 h time series are generated by cumulatively summing 3 hour precipitation over the specified duration then annual maxima values are extracted to generate ams for each precipitation duration pds 5 5 a number of strategies and heuristics have been employed to select the pds threshold several authors e g lang et al 1999 have noted the challenges associated with threshold selection in this study the threshold is implicitly set for each location and duration by selecting the n largest observations in the period of record where n is the number of years in the record this overall selection approach is consistent with the approach used in noaa atlas 14 as an additional step for durations longer than three hours an independent event check was performed this check required that peak precipitation intensities retained in the pds for a specified duration were separated by a time period of at least eight times the specified duration results were compared with and without the independence check and differences were negligible are generated by selecting all values in excess of a threshold that is set such that the number of selected pds points is consistent with the size of the ams 2 statistical analysis for the ams analysis type fives distributions gev gp gno glo and pe 3 are fitted to the precipitation intensities precipitation depth divided by the associated duration inches hour using three pems l mom 6 6 l mom l moms are analogous to conventional moments e g standard deviation skewness and are estimated by linear combinations of the elements of an ordered sample and can be used to summarize the shape of a probability distribution and calculate its parameters hosking 1990 the equations that equate distribution parameters considered in this study to l moms and l mom ratios are provided by hosking 1990 mom 7 7 mom mom is a method of estimating parameters of a probability distribution based on equating sample moments to the distribution moments bowman and shenton 2004 in this study all considered distributions have three parameters therefore mean standard deviation and skewness of the sample and the distribution are used to obtain the parameters and mle 8 8 mle mle estimates the parameters of a probability model that maximizes the likelihood of a set of data in this study matlab software matlab 2020 is used negative log likelihood function of a distribution is minimized with constraints that are defined with respect to the domain of data precipitation data which is greater than or equal to zero and parameters of the distribution for the pds analysis type the gp distribution is fitted to the precipitation intensities using three pems l mom mom and mle kolmogorov smirnov and chi square hypothesis tests are performed on the fitted distributions the tree branches i e combinations of distribution and pem that are rejected by these tests are pruned and eliminated from the rest of the analyses l mom is considered because it is the pem used by noaa atlas 14 bonnin et al 2006 l moms are more robust to outliers than conventional moments and can provide more reliable estimates from small samples furthermore they yield more efficient parameter estimates compared to mle hosking 1990 mom and mle are two other frequently used pems that are considered in this study to explore the uncertainty due to the choice of pem however it should be noted that when working with small samples mom might yield results that are outside the parameter space and mle estimates can be heavily biased 3 development of suites of candidate idf curves the idf curves are developed using the inverse complementary cdf of the selected distribution the inverse function is evaluated at different annual exceedance probabilities the idf curves are generated considering durations of 15 and 30 min 1 2 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 and 48 h and for return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 500 and 1000 years 4 development of averaged idf curve the generated ensemble of idf curves considering the different modeling choices in the logic tree are averaged to generate an averaged mean idf curve and to support subsequent uncertainty assessment analyses in this study all modeling assumptions are equally weighted therefore the averaged idf curves are simply calculated by averaging the available precipitation intensity values for a specific duration and return period the uncertainty assessment is next performed for the across and within model uncertainties described in section 1 1 4 uncertainty assessment and comparison next the results of uncertainty assessment for the across and within model levels are presented two graphical mechanisms are used to facilitate the comparative assessment of the sources of uncertainty conventional tornado plots and a plotting strategy inspired by both tornado and violin plots that provide insights about the distribution results obtained when considering a particular sensitivity case these latter plots are referred to here as kernel density tornado plots or kdt plots a tornado plot is a graphical mechanism that delineates the sensitivity of a specific outcome to a group of selected variables in the context of this study the tornado plot shows the sensitivity of the estimated precipitation intensity for a selected duration and return period to the individual modeling choices shown in the logic tree in fig 1 to generate a tornado plot one source of uncertainty is considered at a time the minimum and maximum outcome values are obtained when varying that source of uncertainty while locking in all other variables assumptions at the base case the outcome values associated with the base case are identified with a vertical line and the minimum and maximum values obtained when varying each source of uncertainty are shown as horizontal bars relative to the base case the bars sources of uncertainty are ordered from the one that causes the highest variation with respect to a base case to the variable that causes the lowest variation which creates the tornado shape however such a base case does not exist in this study since there is no preference regarding the best climate model distribution or pem therefore a different approach is used the base case value of intensity for a specific duration and return period is determined from the averaged idf curve that considers all branches of the logic tree that were not pruned to calculate the contribution of each source of uncertainty a strategy is used that involves partitioning and averaging idf curves considering each source of uncertainty individually to illustrate this process the calculation of the sensitivity of results to the choice of distribution model is described first the branches of the logic tree that involve each of the six possible distributions i e gev gp gno glo pe 3 for ams and gp for pds are partitioned for example assuming no branches have been pruned there will be 72 idfs curves associated with each of the distributions 12 climate models 2 downscaling methods 3 pems then the average idf curve is computed by averaging over the 72 alternatives for each of the six partitioned groups yielding an averaged idf curve that corresponds to each distribution this averaged idf curve assigned to a selected distribution is equivalent to assigning a weight of one to the selected distribution and a weight of zero to all other distributions in the logic tree next the minimum and maximum precipitation intensity for a given duration and return period are determined from each of the six averaged idf curves and used to represent the limits of the bars shown in the tornado plot for the specified duration and return period the process is repeated for each source of uncertainty finally the sources are ordered from the one that causes the highest variation with respect to a base case averaged idf curve obtained from all eligible branches in the logic tree to the source that causes the lowest variation even though tornado plots are useful graphics to show the order of contribution of sources of uncertainty the information they provide is limited because they do not provide insights regarding the distribution of outcomes between the minimum and maximum values and a single or few outlier cases may affect the minimum and maximum of averaged idf curves moreover using the procedure outlined above they only present the minimum and maximum of the averaged idf curves rather than the extreme values that may be present before the averaging is performed to address some of the shortcomings of regular tornado plots this study proposes a new graphical mechanism that is inspired by tornado and violin plots violin plots present similar information as box plots with the addition of kernel density plots on each side hintze and nelson 1998 kernel density estimation is a fundamental data smoothing approach in which inferences about the underlying population are made based on a limited data sample parzen 1962 the combination of the tornado and violin plotting structure results in kdt plots in these proposed kdt plots the kernel density estimation derived distributions are obtained using the possible outcomes when considering a particular modeling assumption for example once again using the illustration described above for generating the tornado plot a kernel density distribution would be developed using the 72 combinations of results associated with each of the candidate distributions these kernel density distributions are then superimposed on the tornado plots where areas under the kernel density curve are filled with a transparent color in this way when multiple kernel density plots are available darker colors represent values that are common between different alternatives of a source of uncertainty additionally the kernel density plots are truncated at the minimum and maximum values available among all alternatives and those provide information about extreme cases 4 1 across model uncertainty assessment to delineate across model uncertainty averaged idf curves are calculated considering all unpruned branches in the logic tree the number of candidate idf curves is as follows a m s 12 c l i m a t e m o d

d i s t r i b u t i o n 3 p a r a m e t e r e s t i m a t i o n m e t h o d s 432 i d f c u r v e s some of these idf curves are not considered in the final set since the hypothesis tests have rejected them for grid point 7 circled in fig 2b fig 4 left shows the averaged idf curves for the current climate and fig 4 right shows the results for future period climate models comparing the current and future idf curves shows that the precipitation intensities are shifted up higher under future climate which is more evident in lower durations and higher return periods tornado plots are developed for precipitation intensities for selected durations and return periods extracted from the idf curves for grid point 7 to demonstrate the contribution of sources of uncertainty to variation in the intensities fig 5 and 6 show the current and future period tornado plots for durations below and above 3 h respectively in these plots and other figures in the remainder of the study the sources of uncertainty are abbreviated for brevity in this respect climate model distribution parameter estimation method downscaling method and analysis type are abbreviated as cm dist pem dm and at respectively the axes limits of each set of plots in fig 5 and 6 are set to the same range to facilitate comparison between the current and future climate results for all durations and return periods and for both current and future periods the choice of the climate model is the dominant contributor and has a notably larger contribution to uncertainty relative to other sources the tornado plots show an increase in the base case shown as the vertical black line from current to future conditions which corresponds to a systematic increase in the average value determined from all unpruned branches of the logic tree additionally the length of bars which represents the calculated variability in the results due to a specific factor are longer in the future period than in the current time indicating increased uncertainty in all factors this trend is more evident in lower durations and higher return periods the order of the other source of uncertainty including distribution pem temporal downscaling method and analysis type differs from one duration and return period to the others the order of the source of uncertainty also differs from the current to the future period however distribution and pem more frequently show up ranked second and third after the climate model which is ranked first in terms of producing the highest variability downscaling method and analysis type contribute less to the uncertainty as mentioned above the information provided by the tornado plot may not be sufficient as it only depicts the minimum and maximum values of the results from the averaged idf curves rather than the full range possible values that can be obtained when varying modeling assumptions further the tornado plots do not provide information about the distribution of possible values obtained when varying assumptions the kdt plots are used to address this issue to illustrate the concept of this graphical mechanism the kdt plots are generated for 15 minute duration precipitation intensities and two return periods 1000 years 50 years the resulting plots are shown in fig 7 the left and right panels show the kdt plots for current and future periods respectively the maximum and minimum precipitation intensity among all eligible cases are shown with dashed lines on both sides of the kernel tornado plots the shape of the curves provides an estimation of the underlying distribution of values for a specific category of idf curves while the tornado plots showing the minimum and maximum values of the precipitation intensity from the averaged idf curves are shown below for example each climate model corresponds to 36 idf curves assuming no pruning i e 2 downscaling methods 5 distributions for ams 1 distribution for pds 3 pems the kernel density plot estimates the distributions of the 36 values for each of the climate models the areas under the kdt plots are filled with transparent color and therefore darker areas indicate more common values between different climate models the top panels of fig 7 kdt plots for the return period of 1000 years show that the distribution of values resulting from the sensitivity studies for all sources of uncertainty except for the choice of climate models are almost evenly distributed on both sides of the base value vertical solid line this is also reflected in the length of horizontal bars associated with the distribution pem downscaling method and analysis type which is almost equal on both sides of the vertical base case line however the darker region accumulation of kernel density curves for the climate model is mostly centered around the base value the horizontal bars are affected by the few cases placed farther on the left and right of the average values this illustrates how the range of the bars in the tornado plots is influenced by the presence of large and small values coming from a small number of sensitivity cases the kdt plots also helps to illustrate an additional insight that cannot be gleaned from the calculation of the averaged value base case or the tornado plots for the 15 minute duration and 50 year return period bottom right panel of fig 7 the distribution of values is somewhat bimodal with most outcomes on either side of the base case but few modeling outcomes resulting in that averaged value 4 1 1 spatial analysis of results idf curves are developed for all the analysis points in the study region see fig 2b and two analyses are performed to investigate the spatial variability of results in the first analysis precipitation intensity values at selected durations i e 15 min and 24 h and return periods i e 50 and 1000 years for current and future periods are presented as bar charts located over each grid cell as shown in fig 8 in the second analysis the contribution of sources of uncertainty at the same durations and return periods for current and future periods are portrayed as pie charts as shown in fig 9 comparison of bars in fig 8 indicates a spatial variability in the magnitude of the difference between precipitation intensities under current and future climate for some grid points a higher difference is observed for values in current and future periods with the future bar being expectedly taller than the current bar e g see grid point 1 in the top panel and grid point 20 in the bottom panel of fig 8 on the other hand the current and future bars are closer in some grid points e g see grid points 8 and 9 in the bottom panel of fig 8 in some cases it is seen that the current value is slightly higher than the future value e g grid points 20 and 11 for the duration of 15 min and return period of 1000 years and grid points 5 9 13 14 and 18 for the duration of 24 h and return period of 1000 years fig 9 show the contribution of sources of uncertainty for current left column and future right column periods as defined by the relative length of the bars in the tornado plots i e the relative difference in the maximum and minimum values of the averaged precipitation intensity for each source of uncertainty the pie charts suggest that the choice of the climate model is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty for both durations of 15 min and 24 h and both return periods of 1000 and 50 years over the entire study region for most of the grid points the contribution of the choice of distribution and pem to the uncertainty rank second and third followed by downscaling method and analysis type the contribution of the choice of distribution and pem is more evident in the 1000 year return period for both durations in current and future periods compared to the return period of 50 years as seen by the increased fraction of non blue colors in the pie charts for the 1000 year intensities relative to the 50 year intensities for the return period of 50 years the choice of distribution and pem contribute more to the uncertainty in the future period than in the current period 4 2 within model uncertainty assessment for the within model uncertainty assessment averaged idf curves are calculated considering all unpruned branches in the logic tree corresponding to each climate model separately the number of idf curves that are being averaged for each climate model is as follows a m s 2 d o w n s c a l i n g m e t h o d s 5 d i s t r i b u t i o n s 3 p a r a m e t e r e s t i m a t i o n m e t h o d s

final set since they have been rejected by the hypothesis tests so the average may be taken over a smaller number of curves as an example averaged idf curves are developed for grid point 7 using data from the climate model hrm3 gfdl the results are shown in fig 10 similar to the averaged idf curves considering all climate models depicted in fig 4 the intensities shift up under future climate compared to the current climate furthermore the idf curves at different return periods are more scattered under future conditions demonstrating a more significant difference between precipitation intensity values associated with different return periods tornado plots are developed for the idf curves of climate model hrm3 gfdl for grid point 7 to demonstrate the contribution of sources of uncertainty including distribution pem temporal downscaling method and analysis type to the variation in the obtained idf kdt plots are not presented due to the relatively smaller number of sensitivity cases considered as part of the within model uncertainty assessment fig 11 and 12 show the current and future period tornado plots for durations below and above 3 h respectively the axes limits of each set of plots in fig 11 and 12 are adjusted to the same range to facilitate comparing current and future periods similar to the trend seen in tornado plots in section 4 1 above comparing the current and future period tornado plots indicates an increasing shift in the base case averaged value of precipitation intensity in addition the length of the bars for the future period results is longer compared to the current timeline the order of the other sources of uncertainty including distribution pem downscaling method and analysis type differs from one duration and return period to the others the order of the source of uncertainty also differs from the current to the future period however in the current period the distribution choice is the dominant contributor to the variation in the resulting idf curves for most of the durations and return periods on the other hand in the future period both the choice of distribution and pem show up at the highest order of the tornado plot with pem taking over the first rank in most of the durations and return periods in durations above 3 h the results obtained from the tornado plots in fig 11 and 12 are specific to the climate model hrm3 gfdl the order and magnitude of the contribution of sources of uncertainty are potentially different for other climate models the analysis outlined above is repeated for the other 11 climate models to explore this potential variability in the results the results are presented as stacked bars as shown in fig 13 that show for what fraction of the 12 climate models a particular source of uncertainty is ranked first second third etc as representative cases a set of stacked bars is shown in fig 13 for selected durations i e 15 min and 24 h and return periods i e 50 and 1000 years for the current top panel and future bottom panel periods for the 15 minute duration there are four bars because there are four sets of modeling choices considered in the analysis for each climate model for the 24 hour duration there are three sets of bars for the same reason the numbers on top of the stacked bars correspond to the rank order and the colors in the bars show in what fraction of sensitivity runs considering the twelve climate models a particular source of uncertainty is ranked first second third etc for example for the 1000 year 15 minute precipitation intensity in current period the downscaling method is the first ranked i e most impactful source of uncertainty for five climate models the distribution choice is the first ranked source of uncertainty for six climate models and pem is the first ranked source for only one climate model the plots suggest that the order of contribution of sources of uncertainty is different from one climate model to the other the choice of distribution more frequently shows up on the higher rank such as first and second the choice of pem can have a different magnitude of contribution to the uncertainty as it takes different ranks from the highest to the lowest however it more frequently shows up on the middle and lowest ranks similarly the analysis type mostly appears in the middle and lowest ranks the downscaling method which is used for durations lower than 3 h therefore it is only shown for the duration of 15 min in fig 13 demonstrates a less consistent contribution as it mostly shows up on either highest or lowest ranks while there are differences between current and future climate there is some consistency in the overall pattern 5 conclusions this study explores a range of potential sources of uncertainty that may affect the development of statistically derived idf curves under the current and mid 21st century future climate projections idf curves for selected durations from 15 min to 48 h are developed for the state of maryland based on statistical analyses of synthetic data from the narccap suite of climate models narccap synthetic time series are available at a 3 hour temporal resolution ann and bt ml models trained using observational data from the noaa ncei database are employed to temporally downscale the precipitation time series of the narccap climate models to shorter durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min using the developed time series this study performs a comparative assessment that considers a range of assumptions related to the choice of the climate model climate model temporal downscaling methods ann and bt as well as statistical modeling choices such as analysis types ams and pds the choice of distribution gev gp gno glo and pe 3 and pems l mom mom mle this study assesses uncertainty on two levels across model uncertainty and within model uncertainty this assessment is performed using a graphical framework that leverages tornado plots and a new proposed plot called a kdt plot to explore and compare the contribution of sources of uncertainty under current and future climate conditions in general idf curves for current and future climate conditions indicate an increase in the precipitation intensities under future climate across different durations and return periods over most of the analysis grid points in the study region the increase in precipitation intensity is generally expected however for a limited number of grid points precipitation intensity associated with long return periods decreased under future climate conditions while the uncertainty arising from climate models are widely acknowledged and incorporated into estimates of future precipitation probabilities this study demonstrates that the statistical modeling choices can also impact estimated quantiles under both current and future climate conditions comparison of the sources of uncertainty on the across model level shows that amongst the sources of uncertainty considered the choice of the climate model is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty under both current and future climate conditions the order of importance of the other sources of uncertainty including distribution pem temporal downscaling method and analysis type differs from one duration and return period to the others the order of the sources of uncertainty also differs from the current to the future period however distribution choice and pem most frequently are ranked second and third after the climate model which is ranked first in terms of producing the highest variability downscaling method and analysis type contribute less to the uncertainty in conjunction with the assessment of across model uncertainty kdt plots that are proposed to address the shortcomings of tornado plots can be helpful graphical tools as they depict the full range and distribution of possible values that can be obtained when varying modeling assumptions in some cases the kdt plots also show that averaged precipitation quantiles base case values reflect values that commonly appear across the modeling choices however in other cases bimodal distributions are observed in which averaged precipitation quantiles base case values are not reflective of the outcomes of candidate models which highlights a potential challenge associated with model averaging approaches investigating the uncertainty on the within model level shows that the contribution of sources of uncertainty is different from one climate model to the other that is the driver on uncertainty changes with the source of synthetic data however the choice of distribution and analysis type more frequently have the highest and lowest contributions respectively overall there is general agreement that a variety of climate models and emissions scenarios should be considered when estimating future precipitation probabilities this study demonstrates that using different statistical models and modeling choices to estimate precipitation exceedance probabilities will also generally result in different statistically derived idf curves while this study does not recommend a particular analytical approach the outcomes of this study suggest that the effects of statistical modeling choice should be considered together with the effects of variation in climate models the proposed graphical models namely kdt plots provide a strategy for exploring the impact of uncertainties and understanding whether averaged ensemble values are reflective of the outcomes of candidate modeling assumptions credit authorship contribution

2454,the intensity duration frequency idf curves that inform engineering design must reflect the effects of changing climate on extreme precipitation events these changes can be addressed in part by statistically assessing synthetic data outputs from high resolution climate model projections to develop idf curves the estimation of idf curves is associated with multiple sources of uncertainty most studies that characterize uncertainty in idf curves under climate change only address the uncertainty due to the choice and processing of climate model outputs but neglect uncertainty from statistical modeling choices this study assesses the uncertainty introduced by developing idf curves for maryland usa from model simulations of current and future climate using statistical methods that are used in u s practice the study analyzes output time series from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap suite which consists of 6 atmosphere ocean general circulation models each spatially downscaled with two different regional climate models in a separate study the 3 hour narccap model output was temporally downscaled to 15 min using two different machine learning models uncertainty is assessed both across and within models across model uncertainty arises from the differences among synthetic time series for precipitation and other meteorological variables produced by the 12 narccap climate model projections within model uncertainty arises from the modeling choices used to develop statistical idf curves from a single climate model time series these choices include temporal downscaling method time series type distribution and parameter estimation method the choice of climate model across model uncertainty is the dominant contributor under both current and future climate conditions on the within model level the other sources of uncertainty contribute differently for different climate models the development and application of future climate idf curves should

sources that have been referenced herein 1 introduction human activities in the past century have led to excessive greenhouse gas emissions that have caused an increase in average global temperature cheng and aghakouchak 2014 min et al 2011 extreme precipitation events are affected by the thermodynamic laws such as clausius clapeyron cc relation clausius 1850 trenberth et al 2003 which suggests an increase in the atmospheric moisture content with higher air temperatures at 7 per degree celsius warming emmanouil et al 2022 guerreiro et al 2018 prein and mearns 2021 therefore the rising temperature due to climate change eventually leads to an increase in the intensity and frequency of the precipitation events while these arguments are valid on a larger spatiotemporal resolution divergence from thermodynamic laws is expected on finer resolutions due to multiple meteorology and climate factors such as local features of atmospheric convection moustakis et al 2020 consistent with this trend most regions in the united states are expected to undergo more frequent extreme precipitation through the 21st century than under current climate conditions field et al 2012 kunkel et al 2013 intensity duration frequency idf curves are used in a range of engineering applications to assess risk and design stormwater management systems and other water related infrastructure emmanouil et al 2020 langousis and veneziano 2007 veneziano and furcolo 2002 zhu 2013 statistically derived idf curves are obtained through statistical analysis of rainfall data and represent the frequency of exceedance associated with averaged rainfall intensities for representative durations idf curves are developed based on historical precipitation records and the assumption that extreme precipitation characteristics such as frequency intensity and return period remain stationary over time temporal stationarity hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 however under climate change conditions these characteristics are altered and therefore the temporal stationarity assumption is violated cheng and aghakouchak 2014 thus idf curves need to be updated to account for the potential effects of climate change this is usually done by leveraging synthetic data outputs from high resolution climate model projections the future extreme precipitation scenarios used in climate model projections are developed using different combinations of general circulation models gcms and emission scenarios hailegeorgis et al 2009 these gcms are subject to epistemic uncertainties arising from several sources such as their parameterization and initial and boundary conditions emmanouil et al 2022 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 in addition to the uncertainty from climate change projections the frequency analysis of extreme precipitation is affected by the statistical modeling choices such as the type of distribution and parameter estimation method pem comprehensive quantification and characterization of uncertainty associated with the development of idf curves using future climate projection are essential for robust assessment of extreme precipitation however existing studies that have characterized uncertainty in idf curves under climate change conditions have only addressed the uncertainty due to the choice of climate models and associated procedures performed to employ such models in developing idf curves namely in addition to uncertainty arising from the choice of gcm regional climate models rcms and representative concentration pathways rcps numerous studies have investigated other related processes such as the short simulation periods of rcms spatial and temporal downscaling methods choice of reference periods for bias correction of climate models the spatial resolution of the rcm ensemble the spatial adjustment technique and rcm downscaling ratios most studies demonstrated that among the factors related to the climate model projections the variability in the values provided by the climate models is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty however few studies have addressed the uncertainty derived from statistical modeling choices such as the choice of distribution or pem in the process of developing idf curves hailegeorgis et al 2009 overeem et al 2008 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 furthermore few studies have investigated and compared the relative effects of the uncertainty due to both the choice of the climate models and statistical modeling choices this study produces sets of current and mid 21st century future climate projections in the form of an ensemble of idf curves for the state of maryland these idf curves are developed from statistical analyses of synthetic data from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap under a high carbon emission projection mearns et al 2007 the narccap is an international program containing climate scenarios used to investigate uncertainties in future climate projections on a regional scale the narccap suite consists of 6 atmosphere ocean general circulation models each spatially downscaled with two different regional climate models for a total of 12 models furthermore this study explores the uncertainty associated with the choice of the climate model and compares it to the effects of uncertainties associated with statistical modeling choices including different analysis types distributions and pems in addition to these factors two different machine learning ml algorithms used for the temporal downscaling of climate models are considered as an additional source of uncertainty this study further provides a graphical framework to explore and compare the contribution of sources of uncertainty 1 1 objective and framework this study assesses uncertainty on two levels 1 across model uncertainty and 2 within model uncertainty these two uncertainty assessments are illustrated in fig 1 using a logic tree structure across model uncertainty refers to the uncertainty arising from the differences in synthetic precipitation and other meteorological variable time series resulting from the 12 climate model projections within model uncertainty refers to the uncertainty arising from the modeling choices i e temporal downscaling methods analysis types distributions and pems used to develop idf curves using the synthetic time series from a single climate model projection the purpose of investigating the uncertainty on the within model level is to explore the relative contributions of the different choices and whether the contribution of the sources of uncertainty is different from one climate model to the others fig 1 shows 12 logic tree branches corresponding to the climate model projections from narccap which are listed in table 2 the synthetic precipitation time series outputs of the climate models are available in 3 hour intervals two temporal downscaling ml models artificial neural networks ann and boosted trees bt are selected and employed based on a series of analyses a summary of which is provided in section 2 2 the ml models are utilized to temporally downscale the 3 hour time series of the narccap models to durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min for the statistical analysis used to develop idf curves two time series analysis types are considered annual maximum series ams and partial duration series pds

exponential weibull gamma gumbel generalized extreme value log pearson iii and others many of these distributions are not derived from extreme value theory and the extent to which they are statistically appropriate is not clear nonetheless this descriptive study seeks to understand how different choices that practitioners and analysts might make in the process translate into variation uncertainty in precipitation frequency estimates with this goal in mind this study considers the suite of candidate distributions used in noaa atlas 14 of generalized extreme value gev generalized

branch has similar pems to the ams branch however it only considers the gp distribution hypothesis tests i e kolmogorov smirnov and chi square are performed on the fitted distributions and branches of the tree corresponding to combinations of distribution and pem that are rejected by these tests are pruned the remaining branches are used to create an ensemble of idf curves from which an average is calculated for each grid location of the climate models located in the study region additional details regarding each step of the analysis are provided in section 3 1 2 summary of existing work while an existing body of literature addresses uncertainty within the fields of meteorology hydrology and hydraulics this literature review focuses on the studies that have explored sources of uncertainty that affect idfs for precipitation events under current and changing climate conditions table 1 summarizes essential information for each reference and facilitates the comparison among the studies regarding several factors specifically table 1 includes the following information for each study the region for which the study was conducted data types e g observation reanalysis data used in the process of analysis climate models considered emission scenarios not included source of uncertainty addressed the method used for assessment of uncertainty and the durations and return periods that are considered in the study hailegeorgis et al 2009 quantified the uncertainties associated with extreme precipitation analysis under climate change effects in the form of idf curves they used at site and regional frequency analysis and employed a non parametric bootstrap resampling approach to assess uncertainty in the delineation of homogeneous groups additionally they investigated uncertainties associated with different pems and distributions and showed that uncertainties due to sampling for regional groups exceed the uncertainties attributable to various distributions and pems solaiman 2011 investigated the uncertainty associated with the choice of atmosphere ocean global climate models used for the estimation of extreme precipitation under climate change conditions they proposed an approach for quantifying uncertainties using a statistical downscaling method based on a non parametric data driven kernel estimator and compared it to the bayesian reliability ensemble average method the comparison showed that while the bayesian approach is suitable for predicting mean changes in precipitation unlike the kernel method it has limited capabilities in analyzing climate responses and cannot estimate the uncertainty of extreme events on a daily time scale zhu et al 2013 proposed an integrated approach to assess the uncertainty of extreme rainfall intensity for the united states under future climate projections they considered uncertainty arising from short simulation periods of rcms and the differences in idf curves derived from multiple rcms of the narccap their approach used the likelihood of rcms which was obtained based on the goodness of fit between the extreme rainfall intensities from the rcms and the reanalysis data of the national centers for environmental prediction they used bayesian model averaging for the assessment of uncertainty in idf curves they divided the drivers of uncertainty to within due to short simulation periods of rcms and among model uncertainty due to multiple rcms they concluded that among model uncertainty is the dominant source of uncertainty it is noted that the terms within and among used in zhu et al 2013 study is different from the terms defined in this study for referring to types of uncertainty alam and elshorbagy 2015 constructed future idf curves under different climate change scenarios and quantified future changes in idf curves and uncertainties using a large ensemble of climate projections their study included spatial and temporal downscaling using the k nearest neighbor k nn algorithm they converted daily precipitation to hourly precipitation and hourly precipitation to sub hourly durations their results indicated that global climate models are the main contributor to the uncertainty followed by rcps and the downscaling method fadhel et al 2017 analyzed the uncertainty in idf curves due to different climate baseline periods they developed idf curves considering eight reference periods for future climate and compared them to idf curves for the current climate comparing the idf curves of the current climate with those of the future suggested that the uncertainty in the percentage of change in the projected rainfall intensity significantly varies over the different reference periods switzman et al 2017 characterized the variability in the ensemble of idf curves considering future climate and combinations of different climate models climate change scenarios and spatial downscaling methods they developed an ensemble of idf curves for two local study sites in canada their analysis indicated that the uncertainty due to the choice of the climate model is greater than that arising from spatial variability in extreme rainfall spatial downscaling method and emission scenarios hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 investigated uncertainties related to gcms gcm initial conditions and rcps associated with the precipitation projections of future climate models they found the choice of gcm to be the dominant contributor to the uncertainty followed by gcm initial conditions and rcps their result emphasized the importance of ensemble size in accounting for the uncertainty in climate change projections yang et al 2018 analyzed the uncertainty associated with rcm temporal downscaling ratios scale driven for weather stations their results showed a significant level of uncertainty in idf curves that was more evident at shorter durations and longer return periods noor et al 2018 developed a framework to update the idf curves under climate change scenarios and used boxplots to demonstrate the associated uncertainties due to the choice of gcm and rcp their results showed that the uncertainty in rainfall intensity for shorter durations in different return periods is 2 to 6 times more than longer duration rainfalls kim et al 2020 quantified the uncertainty of future idf curves considering various combinations of climate models they calculated the uncertainty of the ensemble averaged idf curves as a function of the coefficient of variation of the ensemble their results suggest that including many climate models does not reduce the uncertainty and it is significantly affected by considering specific climate models at each location finally they proposed a method to reduce the uncertainty by excluding rcms in the ensemble of idf curves that contributed heavily to the site specific uncertainty cook et al 2020 explored the effect of the spatial resolution of the rcm ensemble and the spatial adjustment technique on climate corrected idf curves and resulting stormwater infrastructure designs they performed the study considering multiple locations in the united states representative of different climate zones their results suggested that these two sources of uncertainty can significantly change the idf values and potentially the size of stormwater systems in most locations most existing studies focus on the uncertainty that arises from the choice of climate models e g choice of gcm rcm and rcps and the associated procedures used to employ such models in the development of idf curves e g the short simulation periods of rcms choice of spatial and temporal downscaling methods few studies have explored the uncertainty due to the statistical modeling choices such as the choice of distribution or pem in the process of developing idf curves in addition few studies have investigated and compared the relative effects of the uncertainty due to both the choice of the climate models and statistical modeling choices hence the objective of this study is to perform an uncertainty assessment to explore the relative contribution of the choice of the climate model 12 narccap models temporal downscaling methods ann bt and statistical

narccap is an international program containing climate scenarios used to investigate variability in future climate projections on a regional scale the regional climate models rcms of narccap are forced by sets of atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms over a domain covering the united states canada and northern mexico these aogcms are run for the current historical period 1971 2000 and driven with the sres a2 emissions scenario for the 21st century 2041 2070 table 2 shows the twelve narccap model combinations considered in this study for all models the narccap data consists of different fields categorized by their spatial and temporal structures the model output is organized into five groups 1 daily fields e g maximum and minimum daily surface air temperature 2 primary 3 hourly surface fields e g surface specific humidity and precipitation 3 additional 3 hourly fields e g snowmelt surface runoff 4 fixed static surface fields e g latitude longitude and surface altitude and 5 atmospheric fields e g vertical wind component and cloud ice fraction of layer mearns et al 2007 the narccap rcms are discretized into 50 km grid cells climate model outputs provide precipitation in units of kg m 2 s 1 they are converted to units of inches of depth by multiplying by 425 19708 the values of precipitation in the rcms are treated as average or uniform values over the grid cells 2500 km 2 in area the conversion from areal averages to point values applied the inversion of a widely used point to area adjustment areal reduction factor or arf leclerc and schaake s 1972 graphical arf a function of duration hr and area mi 2 was manually curve fitted then inverted such that the area to point conversion factor equals 1 arf noaa does not recommend exceeding 350 mi 2 in areal reduction procedures therefore the values for 2 500 km 2 grid cells were evaluated and applied at 350 mi2 906 5 km 2 using these curve fit equations resulted in the following adjustment

are based on six regional models narccap rcms that use slightly different 50 km spatial grids across the north american domain fig 2 a shows the grid centers for the six rcms shown with square symbols that are located inside maryland and neighboring states the outputs need to be obtained at common locations to develop the ensemble of idfs curves that considers all climate models therefore the locations of a series of analysis points shown with pin symbol in fig 2a and separately shown in perspective view in fig 2b are chosen using a nearest neighbor approach to create a common grid the analysis point locations in the common grid were selected to cover the state of maryland while balancing distance to the nearest neighbor grid centers of the narccap regional models then for each location in the common grid the data associated with the nearest grid cell in the climate model is assigned this nearest neighbor approach is equivalent to the assumption that the model predicted precipitation is constant over a grid cell this approach prevents introducing further variability by interpolating 2 2 observational data and application of ml in temporal downscaling of climate model projections as noted in the previous section the narccap synthetic time series are available at a 3 hour temporal resolution in a precursor to the present study al kajbaf et al 2022 a series of candidate ml models were developed for temporal downscaling of 3 hour narccap precipitation time series to durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min the trained ml models use data collected from the narccap data groups 1 and 2 identified above including 3 hour precipitation and maximum and minimum daily temperature several ml models including ann bt random forest rf and support vector regression svr were considered candidates for temporal downscaling of observational data the models were trained with observational data hourly and 15 minute precipitation time series collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national center for environmental information ncei noaa cdo n d database for gauges located in a defined study area that covers maryland delaware and parts of virginia west virginia pennsylvania and new jersey as shown in fig 3 the behavior of the ml models was evaluated from the perspective of their performance in predicting large target response quantities identifying systematic trends in errors and investigating input output relationships using response functions furthermore a multi criteria metric was used that accounts for multiple error metrics in comparing model performance error metrics included mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse coefficient of determination r 2 and correlation coefficient r ultimately ann and bt were selected for use in the analysis based on their efficiency higher accuracy in terms of performance metrics such as r in predicting important events larger precipitation values and the calculated multi criteria metric 3 development of idf curves following the temporal downscaling of climate model generated precipitation time series from 3 hour time steps to durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min 15 min idf curves are developed considering all combinations of the climate models and modeling assumptions shown in the logic tree branches in fig 1 the overall analysis procedure consists of the following key components 1 data series preparation for each of the 12 climate models shown in fig 1 synthetic time series are prepared or generated for selected durations of 15 minutes to 48 h for durations lower than 3 h ann and bt are used to temporally downscale the 3 hour time series available from the climate models for durations longer than 3 h time series are generated by cumulatively summing 3 hour precipitation over the specified duration then annual maxima values are extracted to generate ams for each precipitation duration pds 5 5 a number of strategies and heuristics have been employed to select the pds threshold several authors e g lang et al 1999 have noted the challenges associated with threshold selection in this study the threshold is implicitly set for each location and duration by selecting the n largest observations in the period of record where n is the number of years in the record this overall selection approach is consistent with the approach used in noaa atlas 14 as an additional step for durations longer than three hours an independent event check was performed this check required that peak precipitation intensities retained in the pds for a specified duration were separated by a time period of at least eight times the specified duration results were compared with and without the independence check and differences were negligible are generated by selecting all values in excess of a threshold that is set such that the number of selected pds points is consistent with the size of the ams 2 statistical analysis for the ams analysis type fives

distribution and pem that are rejected by these tests are pruned and eliminated from the rest of the analyses l mom is considered because it is the pem used by noaa atlas 14 bonnin et al 2006 l moms are more robust to outliers than conventional moments and can provide more reliable estimates from small samples furthermore they yield more efficient parameter estimates compared to mle hosking 1990 mom and mle are two other frequently used pems that are considered in this study to explore the uncertainty due to the choice of pem however it should be noted that when working with small samples mom might yield results that are outside the parameter space and mle estimates can be heavily biased 3 development of suites of candidate idf curves the idf curves are developed using the inverse complementary cdf of the selected distribution the inverse function is evaluated at different annual exceedance probabilities the idf curves are generated considering durations of 15 and 30 min 1 2 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 and 48 h and for return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 500 and 1000 years 4 development of averaged idf curve the generated ensemble of idf curves considering the different modeling choices in the logic tree are averaged to generate an averaged mean idf curve and to support subsequent uncertainty assessment analyses in this study all modeling assumptions are equally weighted therefore the averaged idf curves are simply calculated by averaging the available precipitation intensity values for a specific duration and return period the uncertainty assessment is next performed for the across and within model uncertainties described in section 1 1 4 uncertainty assessment and comparison next the results of uncertainty assessment for the across and within model levels are presented two graphical mechanisms are used to facilitate the comparative assessment of the sources of uncertainty conventional tornado plots and a plotting strategy inspired by both tornado and violin plots that provide insights about the distribution results obtained when considering a particular sensitivity case these latter plots are referred to here as kernel density tornado plots or kdt plots a tornado plot is a graphical mechanism that delineates the sensitivity of a specific outcome to a group of selected variables in the context of this study the tornado plot shows the sensitivity of the estimated precipitation intensity for a selected duration and return period to the individual modeling choices shown in the logic tree in fig 1 to generate a tornado plot one source of uncertainty is considered at a time the minimum and maximum outcome values are obtained when varying that source of uncertainty while locking in all other variables assumptions at the base case the outcome values associated with the base case are identified with a vertical line and the minimum and maximum values obtained when varying each source of uncertainty are shown as horizontal bars relative to the base case the bars sources of uncertainty are ordered from the one that causes the highest variation with respect to a base case to the variable that causes the lowest variation which creates the tornado shape however such a base case does not exist in this study since there is no preference regarding the best climate model distribution or pem therefore a different approach is used the base case value of intensity for a specific duration and return period is determined from the averaged idf curve that considers all branches of the logic tree that were not pruned to calculate the contribution of each source of uncertainty a strategy is used that involves partitioning and averaging idf curves considering each source of uncertainty individually to illustrate this process the calculation of the sensitivity of results to the choice of distribution model is described first the branches of the logic tree that involve each of the six possible distributions i e gev gp gno glo pe 3 for ams and gp for pds are partitioned for example assuming no branches have been pruned there will be 72 idfs curves associated with each of the distributions 12 climate models 2 downscaling methods 3 pems then the average idf curve is computed by averaging over the 72 alternatives for each of the six partitioned groups yielding an averaged idf curve that corresponds to each distribution this averaged idf curve assigned to a selected distribution is equivalent to assigning a weight of one to the selected distribution and a weight of zero to all other distributions in the logic tree next the minimum and maximum precipitation intensity for a given duration and return period are determined from each of the six averaged idf curves and used to represent the limits of the bars shown in the tornado plot for the specified duration and return period the process is repeated for each source of uncertainty finally the sources are ordered from the one that causes the highest variation with respect to a base case averaged idf curve obtained from all eligible branches in the logic tree to the source that causes the lowest variation even though tornado plots are useful graphics to show the order of contribution of sources of uncertainty the information they provide is limited because they do not provide insights regarding the distribution of outcomes between the minimum and maximum values and a single or few outlier cases may affect the minimum and maximum of averaged idf curves moreover using the procedure outlined above they only present the minimum and maximum of the averaged idf curves rather than the extreme values that may be present before the averaging is performed to address some of the shortcomings of regular tornado plots this study proposes a new graphical mechanism that is inspired by tornado and violin plots violin plots present similar information as box plots with the addition of kernel density plots on each side hintze and nelson 1998 kernel density estimation is a fundamental data smoothing approach in which inferences about the underlying population are made based on a limited data sample parzen 1962 the combination of the tornado and violin plotting structure results in kdt plots in these proposed kdt plots the kernel density estimation derived distributions are obtained using the possible outcomes when considering a particular modeling assumption for example once again using the illustration described above for generating the tornado plot a kernel density distribution would be developed using the 72 combinations of results associated with each of the candidate distributions these kernel density distributions are then superimposed on the tornado plots where areas under the kernel density curve are filled with a transparent color in this way when multiple kernel density plots are available darker colors represent values that are common between different alternatives of a source of uncertainty additionally the kernel density plots are truncated at the minimum and maximum values available among all alternatives and those provide information about extreme cases 4 1 across model uncertainty assessment to delineate across model uncertainty averaged idf curves are calculated considering all unpruned branches in the logic tree the number of candidate idf curves is as follows a m s 12 c l i m a t e m o d

d i s t r i b u t i o n 3 p a r a m e t e r e s t i m a t i o n m e t h o d s 432 i d f c u r v e s some of these idf curves are not considered in the final set since the hypothesis tests have rejected them for grid point 7 circled in fig 2b fig 4 left shows the averaged idf curves for the current climate and fig 4 right shows the results for future period climate models comparing the current and future idf curves shows that the precipitation intensities are shifted up higher under future climate which is more evident in lower durations and higher return periods tornado plots are developed for precipitation intensities for selected durations and return periods extracted from the idf curves for grid point 7 to demonstrate the contribution of sources of uncertainty to variation in the intensities fig 5 and 6 show the current and future period tornado plots for durations below and above 3 h respectively in these plots and other figures in the remainder of the study the sources of uncertainty are abbreviated for brevity in this respect climate model distribution parameter estimation method downscaling method and analysis type are abbreviated as cm dist pem dm and at respectively the axes limits of each set of plots in fig 5 and 6 are set to the same range to facilitate comparison between the current and future climate results for all durations and return periods and for both current and future periods the choice of the climate model is the dominant contributor and has a notably larger contribution to uncertainty relative to other sources the tornado plots show an increase in the base case shown as the vertical black line from current to future conditions which corresponds to a systematic increase in the average value determined from all unpruned branches of the logic tree additionally the length of bars which represents the calculated variability in the results due to a specific factor are longer in the future period than in the current time indicating increased uncertainty in all factors this trend is more evident in lower durations and higher return periods the order of the other source of uncertainty including distribution pem temporal downscaling method and analysis type differs from one duration and return period to the others the order of the source of uncertainty also differs from the current to the future period however distribution and pem more frequently show up ranked second and third after the climate model which is ranked first in terms of producing the highest variability downscaling method and analysis type contribute less to the uncertainty as mentioned above the information provided by the tornado plot may not be sufficient as it only depicts the minimum and maximum values of the results from the averaged idf curves rather than the full range possible values that can be obtained when varying modeling assumptions further the tornado plots do not provide information about the distribution of possible values obtained when varying assumptions the kdt plots are used to address this issue to illustrate the concept of this graphical mechanism the kdt plots are generated for 15 minute duration precipitation intensities and two return periods 1000 years 50 years the resulting plots are shown in fig 7 the left and right panels show the kdt plots for current and future periods respectively the maximum and minimum precipitation intensity among all eligible cases are shown with dashed lines on both sides of the kernel tornado plots the shape of the curves provides an estimation of the underlying distribution of values for a specific category of idf curves while the tornado plots showing the minimum and maximum values of the precipitation intensity from the averaged idf curves are shown below for example each climate model corresponds to 36 idf curves assuming no pruning i e 2 downscaling methods 5 distributions for ams 1 distribution for pds 3 pems the kernel density plot estimates the distributions of the 36 values for each of the climate models the areas under the kdt plots are filled with transparent color and therefore darker areas indicate more common values between different climate models the top panels of fig 7 kdt plots for the return period of 1000 years show that the distribution of values resulting from the sensitivity studies for all sources of uncertainty except for the choice of climate models are almost evenly distributed on both sides of the base value vertical solid line this is also reflected in the length of horizontal bars associated with the distribution pem downscaling method and analysis type which is almost equal on both sides of the vertical base case line however the darker region accumulation of kernel density curves for the climate model is mostly centered around the base value the horizontal bars are affected by the few cases placed farther on the left and right of the average values this illustrates how the range of the bars in the tornado plots is influenced by the presence of large and small values coming from a small number of sensitivity cases the kdt plots also helps to illustrate an additional insight that cannot be gleaned from the calculation of the averaged value base case or the tornado plots for the 15 minute duration and 50 year return period bottom right panel of fig 7 the distribution of values is somewhat bimodal with most outcomes on either side of the base case but few modeling outcomes resulting in that averaged value 4 1 1 spatial analysis of results idf curves are developed for all the analysis points in the study region see fig 2b and two analyses are performed to investigate the spatial variability of results in the first analysis precipitation intensity values at selected durations i e 15 min and 24 h and return periods i e 50 and 1000 years for current and future periods are presented as bar charts located over each grid cell as shown in fig 8 in the second analysis the contribution of sources of uncertainty at the same durations and return periods for current and future periods are portrayed as pie charts as shown in fig 9 comparison of bars in fig 8 indicates a spatial variability in the magnitude of the difference between precipitation intensities under current and future climate for some grid points a higher difference is observed for values in current and future periods with the future bar being expectedly taller than the current bar e g see grid point 1 in the top panel and grid point 20 in the bottom panel of fig 8 on the other hand the current and future bars are closer in some grid points e g see grid points 8 and 9 in the bottom panel of fig 8 in some cases it is seen that the current value is slightly higher than the future value e g grid points 20 and 11 for the duration of 15 min and return period of 1000 years and grid points 5 9 13 14 and 18 for the duration of 24 h and return period of 1000 years fig 9 show the contribution of sources of uncertainty for current left column and future right column periods as defined by the relative length of the bars in the tornado plots i e the relative difference in the maximum and minimum values of the averaged precipitation intensity for each source of uncertainty the pie charts suggest that the choice of the climate model is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty for both durations of 15 min and 24 h and both return periods of 1000 and 50 years over the entire study region for most of the grid points the contribution of the choice of distribution and pem to the uncertainty rank second and third followed by downscaling method and analysis type the contribution of the choice of distribution and pem is more evident in the 1000 year return period for both durations in current and future periods compared to the return period of 50 years as seen by the increased fraction of non blue colors in the pie charts for the 1000 year intensities relative to the 50 year intensities for the return period of 50 years the choice of distribution and pem contribute more to the uncertainty in the future period than in the current period 4 2 within model uncertainty assessment for the within model uncertainty assessment averaged idf curves are calculated considering all unpruned branches in the logic tree corresponding to each climate model separately the number of idf curves that are being averaged for each climate model is as follows a m s 2 d o w n s c a l i n g m e t h o d s 5 d i s t r i b u t i o n s 3 p a r a m e t e r e s t i m a t i o n m e t h o d s p d s 2 d o w n s c a l i n g m e t h o d s 1 d i s t r i b u t i o n 3 p a r a m e t e r e s t i m a t i o n m e t h o d s 36 i d f c u r v e s some of these idf curves are not considered in the final set since they have been rejected by the hypothesis tests so the average may be taken over a smaller number of curves as an example averaged idf curves are developed for grid point 7 using data from the climate model hrm3 gfdl the results are shown in fig 10 similar to the averaged idf curves considering all climate models depicted in fig 4 the intensities shift up under future climate compared to the current climate furthermore the idf curves at different return periods are more scattered under future conditions demonstrating a more significant difference between precipitation intensity values associated with different return periods tornado plots are developed for the idf curves of climate model hrm3 gfdl for grid point 7 to demonstrate the contribution of sources of uncertainty including distribution pem temporal downscaling method and analysis type to the variation in the obtained idf kdt plots are not presented due to the relatively smaller number of sensitivity cases considered as part of the within model uncertainty assessment fig 11 and 12 show the current and future period tornado plots for durations below and above 3 h respectively the axes limits of each set of plots in fig 11 and 12 are adjusted to the same range to facilitate comparing current and future periods similar to the trend seen in tornado plots in section 4 1 above comparing the current and future period tornado plots indicates an increasing shift in the base case averaged value of precipitation intensity in addition the length of the bars for the future period results is longer compared to the current timeline the order of the other sources of uncertainty including distribution pem downscaling method and analysis type differs from one duration and return period to the others the order of the source of uncertainty also differs from the current to the future period however in the current period the distribution choice is the dominant contributor to the variation in the resulting idf curves for most of the durations and return periods on the other hand in the future period both the choice of distribution and pem show up at the highest order of the tornado plot with pem taking over the first rank in most of the durations and return periods in durations above 3 h the results obtained from the tornado plots in fig 11 and 12 are specific to the climate model hrm3 gfdl the order and magnitude of the contribution of sources of uncertainty are potentially different for other climate models the analysis outlined above is repeated for the other 11 climate models to explore this potential variability in the results the results are presented as stacked bars as shown in fig 13 that show for what fraction of the 12 climate models a particular source of uncertainty is ranked first second third etc as representative cases a set of stacked bars is shown in fig 13 for selected durations i e 15 min and 24 h and return periods i e 50 and 1000 years for the current top panel and future bottom panel periods for the 15 minute duration there are four bars because there are four sets of modeling choices considered in the analysis for each climate model for the 24 hour duration there are three sets of bars for the same reason the numbers on top of the stacked bars correspond to the rank order and the colors in the bars show in what fraction of sensitivity runs considering the twelve climate models a particular source of uncertainty is ranked first second third etc for example for the 1000 year 15 minute precipitation intensity in current period the downscaling method is the first ranked i e most impactful source of uncertainty for five climate models the distribution choice is the first ranked source of uncertainty for six climate models and pem is the first ranked source for only one climate model the plots suggest that the order of contribution of sources of uncertainty is different from one climate model to the other the choice of distribution more frequently shows up on the higher rank such as first and second the choice of pem can have a different magnitude of contribution to the uncertainty as it takes different ranks from the highest to the lowest however it more frequently shows up on the middle and lowest ranks similarly the analysis type mostly appears in the middle and lowest ranks the downscaling method which is used for durations lower than 3 h therefore it is only shown for the duration of 15 min in fig 13 demonstrates a less consistent contribution as it mostly shows up on either highest or lowest ranks while there are differences between current and future climate there is some consistency in the overall pattern 5 conclusions this study explores a range of potential sources of uncertainty that may affect the development of statistically derived idf curves under the current and mid 21st century future climate projections idf curves for selected durations from 15 min to 48 h are developed for the state of maryland based on statistical analyses of synthetic data from the narccap suite of climate models narccap synthetic time series are available at a 3 hour temporal resolution ann and bt ml models trained using observational data from the noaa ncei database are employed to temporally downscale the precipitation time series of the narccap climate models to shorter durations of 2 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min using the developed time series this study performs a comparative assessment that considers a range of assumptions related to the choice of the climate model climate model temporal downscaling methods ann and bt as well as statistical modeling choices such as analysis types ams and pds the choice of distribution gev gp gno glo and pe 3 and pems l mom mom mle this study assesses uncertainty on two levels across model uncertainty and within model uncertainty this assessment is performed using a graphical framework that leverages tornado plots and a new proposed plot called a kdt plot to explore and compare the contribution of sources of uncertainty under current and future climate conditions in general idf curves for current and future climate conditions indicate an increase in the precipitation intensities under future climate across different durations and return periods over most of the analysis grid points in the study region the increase in precipitation intensity is generally expected however for a limited number of grid points precipitation intensity associated with long return periods decreased under future climate conditions while the uncertainty arising from climate models are widely acknowledged and incorporated into estimates of future precipitation probabilities this study demonstrates that the statistical modeling choices can also impact estimated quantiles under both current and future climate conditions comparison of the sources of uncertainty on the across model level shows that amongst the sources of uncertainty considered the choice of the climate model is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty under both current and future climate conditions the order of importance of the other sources of uncertainty including distribution pem temporal downscaling method and analysis type differs from one duration and return period to the others the order of the sources of uncertainty also differs from the current to the future period however distribution choice and pem most frequently are ranked second and third after the climate model which is ranked first in terms of producing the highest variability downscaling method and analysis type contribute less to the uncertainty in conjunction with the assessment of across model uncertainty kdt plots that are proposed to address the shortcomings of tornado plots can be helpful graphical tools as they depict the full range and distribution of possible values that can be obtained when varying modeling assumptions in some cases the kdt plots also show that averaged precipitation quantiles base case values reflect values that commonly appear across the modeling choices however in other cases bimodal distributions are observed in which averaged precipitation quantiles base case values are not reflective of the outcomes of candidate models which highlights a potential challenge associated with model averaging approaches investigating the uncertainty on the within model level shows that the contribution of sources of uncertainty is different from one climate model to the other that is the driver on uncertainty changes with the source of synthetic data however the choice of distribution and analysis type more frequently have the highest and lowest contributions respectively overall there is general agreement that a variety of climate models and emissions scenarios should be considered when estimating future precipitation probabilities this study demonstrates that using different statistical models and modeling choices to estimate precipitation exceedance probabilities will also generally result in different statistically derived idf curves while this study does not recommend a particular analytical approach the outcomes of this study suggest that the effects of statistical modeling choice should be considered together with the effects of variation in climate models the proposed graphical models namely kdt plots provide a strategy for exploring the impact of uncertainties and understanding whether averaged ensemble values are reflective of the outcomes of candidate modeling assumptions credit authorship contribution
