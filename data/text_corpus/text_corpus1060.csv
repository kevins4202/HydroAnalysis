5300,groundwater is crucial for the economic development in arid and semi arid areas however groundwater resources have been over exploited for meeting the increasing demands in agriculture industry and domestic use therefore the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the economic development has been indeed reduced which made a challenge for the assessment of the groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc the present study constructed a new grcc index d for assessing the long term grcc variation in zhangjiakou of hebei province china zjk using budyko equation gravity recovery and climate experiment data grace global land data assimilation system data gldas sector water consumption data and gdp data our results shows that the short term 2002 2017 annual and monthly anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa and groundwater storage appeared to be decreased the anomalies in soil moisture storage tend to be zero while anomalies in snow water tend to be increased with annual rate of 2 cm year 1 the budyko derived long term 1948 2018 groundwater storage changes gwc has declined from 310 9 to 455 6 cm and the large number of constructed wells for irrigation has accelerated the decline of groundwater resources in zjk our results also shows the time series of d in zjk were 30 30 d 50 and d 50 during 1948 1988 1990 1993 and 1994 2018 indicating that the degree of groundwater resources exploitation were in the state of no overload overload and heavy overload respectively the contribution of groundwater resources for the economic development has exceeded 50 which indicated that the economic development of zjk depend much more on groundwater resources improving the water use efficiency cannot improve groundwater resources carrying capacity however reducing the absolute use of groundwater resources should be the effective way to alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources and improve groundwater resources carrying capacity keywords groundwater depletion economic development groundwater withdrawal water use efficiency 1 introduction groundwater is not only the largest freshwater source for human drinking but also the crucial water source for irrigation and an important component of terrestrial water storage tws in many parts of the world rodell et al 2009 siebert et al 2010 döll et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 pei et al 2015 li and ren 2019 however with rapid increase in population and food demand groundwater depletion has been reported in many countries liu et al 2001 feng et al 2018 scanlon et al 2012 graaf et al 2019 with the groundwater depletion intensified many environmental and social problems have occurred such as groundwater level decline huang et al 2015 land subsidence guo et al 2015 gong et al 2018 saltwater intrusion sherif and singh 1999 and food production reduction tamea et al 2016 a good case in point can be found in north china plain ncp where groundwater level has declined from approximately 10 m to 48 m below the ground surface during 1980 2011 shen et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 zhang et al 2011b additionally feng et al 2018 reported groundwater resources in ncp has drastically depleted with annual rate of 7 2 1 1 km3 year 1 during 2002 2014 due to groundwater depletion the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the regional economic development has been indeed reduced for example in india governments have to subsidize electricity costs for extracting groundwater in order to improve agricultural productivity at the expanse of declining groundwater level shah et al 2008 dai et al 2019 also reported groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is overloaded and the socioeconomic development would not be sustainable in the future if no effective measures are taken furthermore grcc has become limited in some groundwater depended regions due to the increasing pressure placed on groundwater by population growing and economic development chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 therefore the assessment of the grcc is really needed in groundwater depended region for the regional groundwater resources management and sustainable economic development many researchers have assessed the grcc by using multi objective algorithm giuliani and castelletti 2013 principal component analysis zhou et al 2016 and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method duan et al 2018 however a large amount of input data such as precipitation water resources data urbanization level green coverage rate of built district are needed in these studies to construct multiple index for assessing grcc zhang et al 2019 however these data are not accessible in the poor data regions which limited the application of these methods zhang et al 2019 in addition these methods rarely integrated groundwater withdrawal w data gwc data and gdp datato reflect relationships between the quantity of groundwater resources and its capacity for supporting the regional economic development leading to the concern in comprehensive assessment of groundwater resources and regional economic development also these studies have assessed the regional grcc for a short time periods owing to the limited data of w and gwc long term assessment of regional grcc is still a challenge therefore assessing long term grcc with gdp data gwc data and w could help policy makers to better manage regional groundwater resources and economic development famiglietti et al 2011 long et al 2016 traditionally gwc were estimated by using in situ observation data within the study area of interest pool and schmidt 1997 however this method is time consuming and labor intensive also it is difficult to obtain long term gwc due to the insufficient in situ observed wells and restrictive data access polices in some countries chen et al 2016 especially in arid and mountainous regions yin et al 2018 w as the major outflow component of groundwater resources is also an important indicator for balancing the paradox between groundwater exploitation and economic development long term estimation of w is essential for identify the relationship between grcc and economic development due to the reward and punishment policy short term w was generally obtained from the local governments which are often smaller than its actual value zhang et al 2018 therefore long term estimation of gwc and w should be precisely determined before the regional grcc assessment satellites particularly the grace satellite can provide an opportunity to address the observational gap of measuring gwc and w at wells limited regions rodell and famiglietti 2001 strassberg et al 2009 gwc can be isolated from grace based estimates of total terrestrial water storage change twsc by subtracting other water storage compartments of twsc yeh et al 2006 recently many studies have incorporated the grace based twsc into the regional hydrological models to estimate gwc and w and evaluated the impacts of climate changes and human activities on gwc pokhrel et al 2015 sun et al 2012 niu et al 2014 döll et al 2012 applied the grace derived twsc data and well observations with water use model watergap to estimate gwc and documented that the performance of method in detecting the temporal dynamics of gwc are really improved wada et al 2014 also coupled a global water demand model with a global hydrological model to simulate w from 1979 to 2010 and compared the simulated twsc and gwc with those of the grace derived results the application of these studies required both grace derived twsc data and complicated hydrological model however it is by no means easy to construct and apply the hydrologic model in poor data areas therefore this method is also limited in the long term estimation of gwc and w in addition grace satellite only provides twsc data from 2002 to 2017 which constraining the long term estimation of gwc and w therefore it is imperative to develop a simple equation to estimate twsc and gwc for a long period of time in poor data regions nie et al 2016 constructed linear regression model between grace based twsc and hydrologic variables e g evapotranspiration rainfall runoff to obtain the long term twsc and gwc in the amazon basin and found that precipitation and runoff have the significant positive correlations with grace derived twsc also yang et al 2018 used the general linear model random forest support vector model to construct the long term twsc in northwest china during 1948 2002 tang et al 2017 also used annual water balance models to estimate long term twsc and gwc in wells limited region although these methods are widely used for the long term estimation of gwc in many parts of the world the application of these methods should be evaluated in a certain study region due to the temporal and spatial variation in climates and geography features if the linear regression model is not suitable for the certain study region other simple method should be further employed the budyko equation is a simple but useful model for assessing the water energy balance in regional hydrology studies williams et al 2012 the budyko equation describes that the mean annual precipitation p is partitioned into mean annual actual evapotranspiration et and runoff when the long term twsc equals zero the regional et is actually controlled by potential evapotranspiration eto and wang 2012 reported that there has been a competition between et and runoff when twsc not equals to zero at inter annual time scale therefore effective precipitation pe can be defined as the difference between p and twsc thus p can be replaced by pe in the budyko equation chen et al 2013 as a result twsc was incorporated into budyko equation to estimate long term twsc and gwc at inter annual time scale when the parameters in the budyko equation are solved long term w can be further estimated after gwc were derived using groundwater balance model the study area which is the zhang jia kou region zjk is located in the northwest of hebei province china and represents an overexploited groundwater area fig 1 in recent years growing groundwater resources demands in agriculture industry and service industry has led to concerns of groundwater resources depletion and related environment problems song et al 2018 the overuse of groundwater resources lead to the decline in groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc in zjk where the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the regional development has been indeed reduced however the long term gwc and degree of grcc are rarely reported in this region and the answers to the question whether the exploitation of groundwater resources has excessed its maximum carrying capacity for economic development remain unknown the objectives of this paper are to 1 determine whether the long term twsc can be obtained by the linear regression equation in zjk 2 incorporate the grace derived twsc data with budyko equation to reconstructed long term twsc gwc and groundwater withdrawal in zjk 3 construct a new and simple index with less input data to assess the spatiotemporal variability of the grcc based on the reconstructed long term gwc and groundwater withdrawal flow chart of this study was displayed in fig 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area zjk lies between latitude 39 30 42 10 n and longitude 113 50 116 30 e with an area of 36965 km2 and administratively covers 14 counties fig 1a and c the surface elevation of zjk ranges from 406 to 2815 m above the sea level from southeast to northwest the dominant geomorphological types are plateau in ba shang area bs and plain in ba xia bx fig 1b and d the major land use in zjk is classified into farmlands forests grasslands water bodies and urban areas in 2015 the crop land area is around 17 686 km2 accounting for approximately 50 of the total lands the major crops in this region are grain crops 68 vegetables 18 and other crops 14 the climates of zjk is characterized by continental monsoon semi arid with an annual rainfall of 300 400 mm and average temperature of 8 6 the dominant soil types are sand and silt agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 70 of the total water consumption in all counties except for in chongli 31 fig 3 a the proportion of water consumption for agricultural industrial and domestic use was 84 12 and 4 respectively for the entirely zjk fig 3b crop irrigation constitutes 70 of the agricultural water consumption in zjk and nearly 60 of these available water resources come from groundwater resources due to the limited surface water resources in this area national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 global land data assimilation system gldas data is produced by national aeronautics and space administration nasa national centers for environmental prediction ncep national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa gldas has assimilated the satellite based data and observed data into a land surface model to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 datasets in gldas include surface meteorological data hydrological variables and outputs of noah community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic and catchment land surface models rodell et al 2004 in this study the monthly products of 1 degree resolution data sets from noah were chosen to calculate the parameter in the budyko equation fu 1981 and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of long term twsc and gwc these datasets includes p et canopy water cw soil moisture sm subsurface runoff qsb surface runoff qsr the sum of subsurface runoff and surface runoff snow water sn since our study area is located in the arid and semi arid region the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration eto based on the maximum and minimum temperature from gldas the hargreaves method can be described as 1 e t 0 0 000939 r a t max t min ta 17 8 where eto is the potential evapotranspiration mm ta is the daily average temperature c tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum temperature respectively c ra is the daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 eto was used to calculate the parameter in the budyko equation 2 2 2 grace data the grace satellites were launched by nasa and german aerospace center dlr in low earth orbit to measure changes in earth s gravity field and detect the anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa based on the proportional relationship between gravity and earth density tapley et al 2004 grace data is composed of three different data level 1 level 2 and level 3 the level 1 product is calibrated and time tagged raw data and the level 2 data are produced by three data centers jet propulsion laboratory jpl center for space research csr and geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz the twsa products from csr are determined by the level 2 data and were chosen in the present study the monthly grace based twsa from 2002 to 2017 at 1 1 resolution can be obtained from the nasa jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website http grace jpl nasa gov the time periods of the grace data are between april 2002 and january 2017 in this study the missing data occurred at june and july in 2002 june in 2003 january and june in 2011 may and october in 2012 march august and september in 2013 february and december in 2014 june in 2015 the missing values were interpolated by averaging the values of 2 months before and after the month with missing data yin et al 2018 long et al 2015 the monthly twsc can be estimated by the time derivative of twsa using simple derivative in eq 2 long et al 2014 2 twsc t dtwsa dt twsa t t w s a t 1 δ t to match with resolution of water consumption data and gridded gdp data see section 2 2 4 grace data are re gridded to a horizontal grid resolution of 0 5 0 5 using arc gis 10 4 software esri environmental systems research institute 2 2 3 observed groundwater table depth in this study the groundwater table depth data of unconfined aquifer between 2005 and 2014 were obtained from six wells provided by china institute of geo environmental monitoring china geological environmental monitoring institute 2014 the location information of these six monitoring wells can be found in table 1 and the time series of groundwater table depth can be found in table 2 the groundwater table depth data were used to test the reliability of the budyko based estimation of gwc 2 2 4 water consumption data and gdp data the annual gridded water consumption data and gdp data at resolution of 0 5 0 5 during 1948 2018 in zjk were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isimip2b https www isimip org isimip2b data is initiated by the potsdam institute for climate impact research and international institute for applied systems analysis the objectives of the isimip2b project are to study the response of agriculture production and global water cycle and environment to climate change and human activities the water consumption data were consisted of agricultural industrial and domestic use at monthly time scale and gdp data were also classified into gdp for agriculture industry and service industry 2 3 construction of the grcc index groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is the function of allowable groundwater withdrawal wke and water use efficiency η liu et al 2017 and can be defined as 3 grcc η w ke 4 η a η indu b η agri c η third 5 η agri g agri q agri η indu g indu q indu η third g third q third where grcc is the groundwater resources carrying capacity which represented by gdp yuan η is the comprehensive water use efficiency yuan mm 1 η is further classified into agriculture water use efficiency ηagri industry water use efficiency ηindu and service water use efficiency ηthird gagri gindu and gthird are gdp for agriculture industry and service industry yuan qagri qindu and qthird are water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry mm a b c are the ratio between water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry to the total water consumption according to the report of zhang and li 2005 wke in zjk was 5 66 108m3 15 mm 8 52 108m3 23 mm 9 77 108m3 27 mm and 10 5 108m3 29 mm during 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000 2018 respectively the actual grcc and theoretical maximum grcc can be calculated as 6 grc c a η w ke 7 grc c max η max w ke in order to evaluate the degree of groundwater withdrawal for supporting the economic development grcc index d is defined as 8 d rg rq 9 rg grc c a grc c max 10 rq w w ke where ηmax is the maximum η during 1948 2018 across the entire zjk rg is the degree of economic development supported by groundwater resources rq is degree of groundwater withdrawal w is the groundwater withdrawal d is the grcc index the higher d value indicates lower grcc which means the local economic development depend much more on groundwater resources the category standards of the grcc severity for d are defined as no overload d 30 overload 30 d 50 and heavy overload d 50 liu et al 2017 2 4 estimation of w according to the eqs 8 10 w is the key parameter for calculating d is the groundwater balance equation can be used to calculate w 11 q in q out gwc where q in is the annual total groundwater recharge cm q out is the annual total groundwater discharge cm gwc is the groundwater storage change cm according to the report of chen 1999 precipitation contributes 86 of the total groundwater recharge in bs of zjk while in bx of zjk precipitation and lateral flow contributes 60 of the total groundwater recharge and irrigation contributes 20 of the total groundwater recharge therefore annual total groundwater recharge in bs and bx can be estimated as follows 12 q b 1 q p 13 q b 2 q p q l q i where q b 1 is the total annual groundwater recharge at bs of zjk cm q b 2 is total annual groundwater recharge at bx of zjk cm qp represents the groundwater recharge from precipitation ql represents the lateral recharge qi represent groundwater recharge from irrigation qp can be calculated as 14 q p α p where α is the rainfall infiltration coefficient α q l and q i are influenced by rainfall vegetation and topography therefore it should be assigned different values at different counties table 3 gives the different values of α q l and q i at different counties according to the report of zhang and li 2005 liu 2013 reported most of the crops in zjk were irrigated using groundwater therefore the groundwater discharge are mainly depended on groundwater withdrawal w the groundwater balance equation can be further described as 15 q b 1 w 1 g w c 1 16 q b 2 w 2 g w c 2 where w1 and w2 are groundwater withdrawal in bs and bx of zjk mm gwc1 and gwc2 are groundwater storage change in bs and bx of zjk mm therefore groundwater withdrawal can be estimated when gwc were obtained 2 5 estimation of gwc according to the eqs 15 and 16 w can be determined by the calculation of gwc gwc can be obtained by the water balance equation twsc is composed of water storage changes in groundwater gwc soil moisture changes smc surface water changes swc snow water changes snc and biomass changes pwc therefore twsc can be calculated as 17 twsc s m c s w c s n c p w c g w c liesch and ohmer 2016 reported that the biomass component can be neglected due to its less influence on twsc the previous studies also suggested that swc is considerable small and can be ignored in zjk yin et al 2018 the gwc can be obtained if twsc smc and snc were determined 18 gwc t w s c s m c s n c in order to validate the estimated gwc the measured gwc can be calculated as 19 gw c obs s y δ h where δ h is the change in groundwater table depth δ g w c obs is the measured groundwater storage change sy is the specific yield which is set as 0 15 guo et al 2010 2 6 long term construction of twsc smc and snc one of our objectives is to assess the long term grcc by constructing long term d therefore we need to obtain long term data of twsc smc and snc based on the point of view in section 2 5 the long term gwc can be obtained if long term twsc smc and snc are constructed therefore grace and gldas data are used to construct the long term twsc smc and snc two methods are used in this section include general linear regression method and budyko model 2 6 1 the general linear regression method due to the limited time periods of grace data nie et al 2016 reconstructed long term 1948 2012 annual twsa across the amazon basin by use of short term grace based data gldas data and general linear regression model they found there have been good linear relationships between hydrological variables of gldas and grace based twsa therefore we firstly constructed the linear regression model between hydrological variables from gldas and grace based twsa in a short term 2002 2017 and determine whether it is reasonable to reconstructed long term twsc by using the linear regression model the hydrological variables we used in this study are p et cw runoff sm sm sn cw qsb qsr p et p et qsr p et qsb since the grace data is anomalies relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline this baseline needs to be consistent when comparing grace data to other hydrological anomaly data p et cw runoff sm sm sn cw qsb qsr p et p et qsr p et qsb the general linear regression model can be described as 20 y a x b where a a 1 a n is the regression coefficient matrix for the grid cells from the linear fitting b b 1 b n is the interval matrix for the grid cells from the linear fitting x x 11 x 1 n x n 1 x nn and y y 11 y 1 n y n 1 y nn are the matrix of hydrological variables from gldas and twsa from grace respectively the is products of the elements in the corresponding position of the matrixes i e dot products meanwhile the rows in the matrix x represent the anomaly time series of the processed hydrological variables of gldas while the rows in the matrix y represent those of grace in this study if the r value between twsa and hydrological variables 0 8 we can use the linear regression model to reconstruct the long term twsc else we use budyko equation 2 6 2 budyko model the budyko equation is developed by budyko 1961 to quantify the relationships between mean annual evaporation ratio et p and the mean annual potential evaporation ratio eto p the budyko equation revealed that the mean annual et is controlled by the p and eto when the twsc was negligible the ration between et and p is non linearly dependent on ration between eto and p as 21 et p f e t o p various forms of budyko equations have been derived for quantifying the impact of human activities and watershed characteristics on long term regional water balance fu 1981 yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 among these different type of equations the fu s one parameter budyko equation is widely used to estimate the annual water balance in china fu 1981 and can be proposed as 22 et p 1 e t o p 1 e t o p ω 1 ω where ω is a parameter reflecting the physical properties for a given watershed such as soil vegetation and topography the fu s one parameter budyko equation assumed that the long term twsc should be negligible however wang and alimohammadi 2012 reported twsc can be significant in semi arid and arid regions due to anthropogenic activities therefore twsc should not be assigned as zero when the twsc not equals zero the available water for et and runoff is the difference between p and twsc pe p twsc which is defined as effective precipitation chen et al 2013 wang 2012 as a result p is replaced by pe and eq 22 can be rewrite as 23 et p e 1 e t o p e 1 e t o p e ω 1 ω equation 23 can be further rewrite as 24 et p t w s c 1 e t o p t w s c 1 e t o p t w s c ω 1 ω therefore twsc was incorporated into the fu s one parameter budyko equation and the long term twsc can be estimated by eq 24 we used short term data of et p eto and twsc to estimate parameter ω and then calculate the long term twsc by using the ω and long term et p and eto 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term spatiotemporal variability of water storage changes monthly water storage anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa sm sn and gw between april 2002 and january 2017 in zjk are displayed in fig 4 twsa and anomalies in gw show decreasing trend with the z value of 11 1 cm and 10 1 cm mann kendall test fig 4a d the magnitudes of uncertainty for twsa standard deviation 0 08 to 2 9 cm are lower than sm anomalies 0 6 to 3 9 cm fig 4b and gw anomalies have the largest uncertainty with standard deviation 0 6 to 5 0 cm sn anomalies peaks in winter while approach to zero cm at other seasons fig 4d the cumulative sm anomalies have appeared to be nearly zero cm 0 03 cm between april 2002 and january 2017 indicating soil moisture storage have relative less variation over these years many studies had similar results with the presented study tang et al 2017 reconstructed the long term twsa and gw anomalies between 1980 and 2015 in northern pakistan and reported sm anomalies approached to zero cm rodell et al 2009 also quantify the gwc and smc in northwest of india and found the fluctuation of soil moisture was closer to 0 fig 5 shows the mean annual fig 5a and monthly fig 5b water storage anomalies in tws gw sm and sn during 2002 2017 twsa and anomalies in gw tend to decrease while anomalies in sm and sn had lower fluctuation fig 5 b also shows anomalies in sm from june to september was higher than the other months while anomalies in tws and gw have similar variation twsa had the lower value of 3 1 cm and 2 2 cm in june and october while had the higher value of 1 1 cm and 0 7 cm in april and august anomalies in gw have the lower value of 2 6 cm and 3 6 cm in june and november while had higher value of 0 7 cm and 0 8 cm the spatial distribution of averaged 2002 2017 annual water storage anomalies in tws gw sm and sn are displayed in fig 6 anomalies in tws and gw have declined from the southwest to northeast ranging from 2 5 to 1 1 cm and 3 0 to 1 3 cm respectively since there much more farmlands were located in the west than in the east leading to more groundwater abstractions for irrigation su et al 2018 our results were consistent with studies reported by gong et al 2018 and feng et al 2018 which demonstrated that the depletion of groundwater storage contributed the decline of tws the increasing degree in anomalies for sm was higher in the west than in the east this might be caused by the lower et in the west than in the west since lower et lead to higher soil moisture in the study area zhang 2018 the distribution of anomalies for sn had small difference indicating that the variation of snow water storage remained stable the decreasing trend for both twsa and gw anomalies in zjk during 2002 2017 indicates tws and gw in zjk have experienced the depletion situation fig 4 and fig 5 there are many reasons accounting for the depletion of tws and gw chen et al 2016 demonstrated that the increasing in temperature resulted in depletion of snow water storage and tws in the tianshan mountains additionally the decreasing trend of precipitation and groundwater storage also contributed the decline of tws asoka et al 2017 quantify the influence of groundwater abstraction and climate change on the gwc in india from 2002 to 2013 they found that gw has dropped in northern india but increased in southern india which can be explained by intensive abstraction for irrigation in northern india and obvious changes in precipitation in southern india respectively strassberg et al 2009 and yeh et al 2006 also evaluated the ability of grace based gwc in the high plains aquifer and illinois and they reported the correlation of variation between tws and gwc were 0 9 and 0 8 respectively all these studies indicated gwc has significant influence on depletion of tws compared to other water storage changes component and hydrological variables nie et al 2018 in the presented study gwc has depleted since 1995 with the annual over exploitation use of 47 million m3 for irrigation especially for satisfying the vegetable water requirement ma et al 2014 however precipitation in our study region didn t appear to be decreasing therefore the depletion of tws could be attributed to the depletion of gw in our study area 3 2 method selection for reconstructing long term twsc and gwc distribution of correlation coefficient r between hydrologic variables and twsa is displayed in fig 7 it indicates that all the hydrologic variables we choose had lower linear relationship with twsa with minimum r of 0 2 and maximum r of 0 5 compared to other hydrologic variables sm and sm sn cw had the highest r of 0 5 table 4 gave the coefficient of determination r2 between twsa and hydrologic variables and indicates all the r2 were very low for the entire study region yang et al 2018 and nie et al 2016 reconstructed the long term twsa by using the linear regression model in arid region of western china and amazon river basin both results had higher r value of 0 7 especially the hydrological variables of p et qsr had higher r value of 0 94 with twsa however compared to these two regions the agricultural production in our study region depends much on groundwater resources therefore twsa is more sensitive to the change in groundwater resources rather than other hydrological variables both fig 5 and table 4 reveal that it is unreasonable to use linear regression model in our study region to construct long term twsc and gwc therefore budyko equation should be further validated for this purpose the average standard deviation of annual anomalies in p eto et sm and sn are 8 6 22 7 6 6 2 3 and 0 9 cm during 1948 2018 fig 8 the long term cumulative anomalies in sm approached zero during 1948 2018 indicating less changes in soil moisture in our study region and anomalies in sn had larger fluctuations after 2000 fig 8 the fitted budyko curve during 2003 2016 with scatter points between annual evapotranspiration ratio and annual aridity index are displayed in fig 9 the estimated annual evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index ranged from 0 73 to 0 84 and 5 63 to 7 19 with mean value of 0 7 and 5 6 respectively the fitted budyko curve is under the lower bound the ratio between et and p twsc and all the scatter points are within the curve especially the multiple year average point is located on the fitted curve fig 9 also shows the fitted ω value was 1 47 sun et al 2007 validate the budyko equation among 63 sub river basins in china and reported that ω varies in different climatic regions which ranging from 1 to 3 for arid and semi arid regions in the meantime zjk is just located in the semi arid area therefore the fitted ω value of 1 47 is reasonable and the budyko equation is suitable for constructing the long term twsc and gwc in our study area han et al 2018 yang et al 2006 3 3 long term reconstruction of twsc gwc and groundwater withdrawal 3 3 1 reconstructed long term twsc based on the estimated ω and fitted budyko equation the reconstructed long term twsc during 1948 2018 in comparison with the short term 2002 2017 grace based twsc were displayed in fig 10 in general budyko based twsc in our study area has increased during 1948 and 2018 root mean squared error rmse and r between budyko based and grace based twsc are 4 7 cm and 0 62 the absolute difference between budyko based and grace based twsc have the minimum value of 0 2 cm in 2015 and the maximum value of 9 5 in 2012 the budyko based twsc underestimates the grace based twsc in 1 out of 15 years fig 10 the budyko based twsc were consistent with the grace based twsc even if difference occurred shown in fig 10 many studies had reported that this uncertainty would exist due to the uncertainty in grace data and budyko equation both strassberg et al 2009 and longuevergne et al 2010 compared the in situ observations with grace based twsc and reported the rmse was 3 8 cm which was close to our results tang et al 2017 constructed the twsc and gwc in indus basin and reported the rmse between budyko based twsc and grace based twsc ranged from 2 2 to 8 1 cm apart from the uncertainty in the budyko equation and grace data the input data of budyko equation may also result in the uncertainty in estimating twsc the standard deviation of p had decreased from 9 9 to 8 3 cm during 1948 2018 meanwhile standard deviation of twsc declined from 5 8 to 4 7 some studies revealed that the difference of topography would lead to the uncertainty in precipitation which would further lead to the uncertainty in estimating twsc herold et al 2015 roe 2005 in our study the difference of topography is relative lower than in indus basin therefore the uncertainty in our study in lower than in indus basin and the fitted budyko equation is reasonable for constructing the long term twsc 3 3 2 reconstructed long term gwc and groundwater withdrawal fig 11 shows gwc using budyko equation and groundwater balance equation during 1948 2018 based on the long term p et eto and twsc fig 8 in our study area the observed gwc 2005 2014 based on the groundwater table depth table 2 are also displayed in fig 11 gwc uncertainty in our study region has resulted from both budyko equation and groundwater balance equation shamsudduha et al 2012 thomas et al 2016 sun et al 2010 the absolute difference between budyko based gwc and measured gwc ranged from 33 7 to 36 7 cm rmse and r between budyko based gwc and measured gwc were 21 2 cm and 0 6 indicating the budyko based gwc favorably agrees with the measured gwc fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of gwc in the study region at different time periods in general the groundwater storage appeared to decline since all the gridded gwc value were lower than 0 at these four time periods the short term 2002 2017 grace based gwc ranged from 2 8 to 1 3 cm fig 6 while fig 12 d showed the budyko based gwc during 2002 2017 ranged from 12 2 to 2 4 cm which were much more close to the measured gwc the reason for this is that grace data were less sensitive than the observed data in detecting groundwater storage change in small regions asoka et al 2017 in order to further validate the reliability of the budyko based gwc the cumulative sum of the budyko based annual gwc during 1948 2018 and the total number of monitoring wells during 1993 2016 are displayed in fig 13 the cumulative sum of gwc has declined from 9 5 to 480 5 cm during 1948 2018 with annual rate of 7cm year 1 indicating that the groundwater storage in our study region remains depleting in the past 70 years the depletion of groundwater storage had significant negative correlation r 0 9 with the amount of wells the number of wells has increased from 12 822 to 36 579 during 1993 2016 in the meantime the gwc has declined from 310 9 to 455 6 cm the large number of constructed wells for irrigation has accelerated the decline of groundwater resources in our study region furthermore the groundwater recharge is relative small in our study region which resulting the continuous groundwater depletion in zjk chen 1999 tang et al 2017 also estimate the cumulative sum of gwc in indus basin with annual declining rate of 1 0 0 4 cm year 1 and rodell et al 2009 reported the decline rate of gwc in india was 4 cm year 1 our results was obviously higher than these reported results since zjk had more wells than these two regions for example there had 1000 wells in indus basin in 2013 but nearly 30 000 wells in our study region the spatial distribution of annual groundwater withdrawals at different periods in our study region is displayed in fig 14 in general groundwater withdrawals have ranged from 8 5 to 35 9 cm during 1948 2018 for the entire study region specifically groundwater withdrawals in bs kang bao shang yi zhang bei and gu yuan were lower than in bx for all time periods fig 14 the mean annual groundwater withdrawals in 1980 1999 were higher 16 8 cm than in 2000 2018 14 5 cm which increased by 1 cm for bs but decreased by 6 cm for bx zhang and fang 2018 reported that groundwater withdrawal is mainly used for irrigation in bs while for industrial and domestic use in bx additionally groundwater resources saving technologies for industrial and domestic use have been deeply improved by the local government therefore groundwater withdrawals in bx tend to be decreased in the recent years 2000 2018 groundwater withdrawals tend to be increased from 1980 to 1999 to 2000 2018 in bs this might be caused by the increase in planting areas for vegetables which consumed more groundwater than other grain crops for example zhang and fang 2018 documented that the available cultivated farm land areas have decreased by 22 while the planting areas of vegetables have increased by 120 in zjk 3 4 assessment of groundwater withdrawal in zjk fig 15 shows the time series of groundwater resource carrying capacity index d in zjk during 1948 2018 the d value were 30 30 d 50 and d 50 during 1948 1988 1990 1993 and 1994 2018 respectively the d value at these three different phases indicates that the degree of groundwater resources exploitation were in the state of no overload overload and heavy overload respectively fig 15 also shows the overload state of groundwater exploitation started in 1990 and transformed into heavy overload condition rapidly in 1994 the reason for this is that producers in zjk have started planting high water consumed vegetables in 1990 and large number of wells was constructed for irrigation zhang and fang 2018 when the degree of groundwater resources exploitation were in the state of no overload overload and heavy overload respectively the mean annual gdp supported by groundwater resources were 1 3 billion yuan 3 6 billion yuan and 6 1 billion yuan respectively however the maximum gdp supported by groundwater resources in zjk should be 9 2 billion yuan theoretically which indicates that the exploitation of groundwater resources in zjk is more and more important to economic development in recent years the increasing rate of water consumption and gdp were also in the stage of rapid growth with the d 50 during 1994 2018 fig 16 the contribution of groundwater resources for the economic development has exceeded 50 which indicated that the economic development of zjk depend much more on exploitation of groundwater resources at the same time water use efficiency increased during 1948 2018 fig 16c while the average annual groundwater exploitation during 1948 1988 1990 1993 and 1994 2018 were 39 million m3 43 million m3 and 50 million m3 fig 17 our results further prove that simply improving the water use efficiency cannot improve groundwater resources carrying capacity grafton et al 2018 reducing the absolute use of groundwater resources should be the main way to alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources and improve groundwater resources carrying capacity fig 18 showed the average spatial distribution of d during 1949 1980 1981 2005 and 2006 2018 in zjk the degree of groundwater resources exploitation was in the state of overloaded with d 30 before the 1980 between 1981 and 2005 the degree of groundwater resources exploitation has transformed into the state of overload for bs of zjk in 2018 the degree of groundwater resources exploitation at bs was in the state of heavy overload wang 2008 analyzed the restrictive factors for the development of agriculture in bs and reported that the bs is located in the ecological transition zone with finite fresh water resources additionally agricultural cultivated land is mainly distributed in the bs while the industry and service industry are distributed in central and southern areas of zjk where surface water are mainly used compared with the central and southern areas of zjk the grcc in bs is much more vulnerable and therefore the key area for alleviating the contradiction between the groundwater resources supply and demand in zjk is in bs rather than other areas of zjk 4 conclusions in this paper two methods linear regression model and budyko equation combined with gravity recovery and climate experiment data grace and global land data assimilation system data gldas are used to reconstruct the long term terrestrial water storage change twsc groundwater storage change gwc and groundwater withdrawal in zhangjiakou zjk as a case study the estimated gwc and groundwater withdrawal are further applied to assess the groundwater water resources carrying capacity the main conclusions are 1 the short term 2002 2017 annual and monthly anomalies in terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage appeared to be decreased the anomalies in soil moisture storage tend to be zero while anomalies for snow water tend to be increased with annual rate of 2 cm year 1 the depletion of groundwater storage is the major source accounting for the tremendous depletion of tws in zjk 2 it is unreasonable to apply linear regression model to reconstructed long term twsc and gwc in zjk due to the low correlation coefficient r between hydrological variables and anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa the parameter ω in budyko equation is 1 47 which is suitable for constructing the long term twsc and gwc in our study area 3 the long term gwc has declined rapidly from 310 9 to 455 6 cm due to the over construction of wells for irrigation in zjk additionally groundwater withdrawals in ba shang kang bao shang yi zhang bei and gu yuan were lower than in ba xia for all time periods 4 our results shows the overload state of groundwater exploitation started in 1990 and transformed into heavy overload condition rapidly in 1994 although water use efficiency gdp increased rapidly at these periods indicating that simply improving the water use efficiency cannot improve groundwater resources carrying capacity however reducing the absolute use of groundwater resources should be the effective way to alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources and improve groundwater resources carrying capacity credit

5300,groundwater is crucial for the economic development in arid and semi arid areas however groundwater resources have been over exploited for meeting the increasing demands in agriculture industry and domestic use therefore the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the economic development has been indeed reduced which made a challenge for the assessment of the groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc the present study constructed a new grcc index d for assessing the long term grcc variation in zhangjiakou of hebei province china zjk using budyko equation gravity recovery and climate experiment data grace global land data assimilation system data gldas sector water consumption data and gdp data our results shows that the short term 2002 2017 annual and monthly anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa and groundwater storage appeared to be decreased the anomalies in soil moisture storage tend to be zero while anomalies in snow water tend to be increased with annual rate of 2 cm year 1 the budyko derived long term 1948 2018 groundwater storage changes gwc has declined from 310 9 to 455 6 cm and the large number of constructed wells for irrigation has accelerated the decline of groundwater resources in zjk our results also shows the time series of d in zjk were 30 30 d 50 and d 50 during 1948 1988 1990 1993 and 1994 2018 indicating that the degree of groundwater resources exploitation were in the state of no overload overload and heavy overload respectively the contribution of groundwater resources for the economic development has exceeded 50 which indicated that the economic development of zjk depend much more on groundwater resources improving the water use efficiency cannot improve groundwater resources carrying capacity however reducing the absolute use of groundwater resources should be the effective way to alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources and improve groundwater resources carrying capacity keywords groundwater depletion economic development groundwater withdrawal water use efficiency 1 introduction groundwater is not only the largest freshwater source for human drinking but also the crucial water source for irrigation and an important component of terrestrial water storage tws in many parts of the world rodell et al 2009 siebert et al 2010 döll et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 pei et al 2015 li and ren 2019 however with rapid increase in population and food demand groundwater depletion has been reported in many countries liu et al 2001 feng et al 2018 scanlon et al 2012 graaf et al 2019 with the groundwater depletion intensified many environmental and social problems have occurred such as groundwater level decline huang et al 2015 land subsidence guo et al 2015 gong et al 2018 saltwater intrusion sherif and singh 1999 and food production reduction tamea et al 2016 a good case in point can be found in north china plain ncp where groundwater level has declined from approximately 10 m to 48 m below the ground surface during 1980 2011 shen et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 zhang et al 2011b additionally feng et al 2018 reported groundwater resources in ncp has drastically depleted with annual rate of 7 2 1 1 km3 year 1 during 2002 2014 due to groundwater depletion the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the regional economic development has been indeed reduced for example in india governments have to subsidize electricity costs for extracting groundwater in order to improve agricultural productivity at the expanse of declining groundwater level shah et al 2008 dai et al 2019 also reported groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is overloaded and the socioeconomic development would not be sustainable in the future if no effective measures are taken furthermore grcc has become limited in some groundwater depended regions due to the increasing pressure placed on groundwater by population growing and economic development chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 therefore the assessment of the grcc is really needed in groundwater depended region for the regional groundwater resources management and sustainable economic development many researchers have assessed the grcc by using multi objective algorithm giuliani and castelletti 2013 principal component analysis zhou et al 2016 and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method duan et al 2018 however a large amount of input data such as precipitation water resources data urbanization level green coverage rate of built district are needed in these studies to construct multiple index for assessing grcc zhang et al 2019 however these data are not accessible in the poor data regions which limited the application of these methods zhang et al 2019 in addition these methods rarely integrated groundwater withdrawal w data gwc data and gdp datato reflect relationships between the quantity of groundwater resources and its capacity for supporting the regional economic development leading to the concern in comprehensive assessment of groundwater resources and regional economic development also these studies have assessed the regional grcc for a short time periods owing to the limited data of w and gwc long term assessment of regional grcc is still a challenge therefore assessing long term grcc with gdp data gwc data and w could help policy makers to better manage regional groundwater resources and economic development famiglietti et al 2011 long et al 2016 traditionally gwc were estimated by using in situ observation data within the study area of interest pool and schmidt 1997 however this method is time consuming and labor intensive also it is difficult to obtain long term gwc due to the insufficient in situ observed wells and restrictive data access polices in some countries chen et al 2016 especially in arid and mountainous regions yin et al 2018 w as the major outflow component of groundwater resources is also an important indicator for balancing the paradox between groundwater exploitation and economic development long term estimation of w is essential for identify the relationship between grcc and economic development due to the reward and punishment policy short term w was generally obtained from the local governments which are often smaller than its actual value zhang et al 2018 therefore long term estimation of gwc and w should be precisely determined before the regional grcc assessment satellites particularly the grace satellite can provide an opportunity to address the observational gap of measuring gwc and w at wells limited regions rodell and famiglietti 2001 strassberg et al 2009 gwc can be isolated from grace based estimates of total terrestrial water storage change twsc by subtracting other water storage compartments of twsc yeh et al 2006 recently many studies have incorporated the grace based twsc into the regional hydrological models to estimate gwc and w and evaluated the impacts of climate changes and human activities on gwc pokhrel et al 2015 sun et al 2012 niu et al 2014 döll et al 2012 applied the grace derived twsc data and well observations with water use model watergap to estimate gwc and documented that the performance of method in detecting the temporal dynamics of gwc are really improved wada et al 2014 also coupled a global water demand model with a global hydrological model to simulate w from 1979 to 2010 and compared the simulated twsc and gwc with those of the grace derived results the application of these studies required both grace derived twsc data and complicated hydrological model however it is by no means easy to construct and apply the hydrologic model in poor data areas therefore this method is also limited in the long term estimation of gwc and w in addition grace satellite only provides twsc data from 2002 to 2017 which constraining the long term estimation of gwc and w therefore it is imperative to develop a simple equation to estimate twsc and gwc for a long period of time in poor data regions nie et al 2016 constructed linear regression model between grace based twsc and hydrologic variables e g evapotranspiration rainfall runoff to obtain the long term twsc and gwc in the amazon basin and found that precipitation and runoff have the significant positive correlations with grace derived twsc also yang et al 2018 used the general linear model random forest support vector model to construct the long term twsc in northwest china during 1948 2002 tang et al 2017 also used annual water balance models to estimate long term twsc and gwc in wells limited region although these methods are widely used for the long term estimation of gwc in many parts of the world the application of these methods should be evaluated in a certain study region due to the temporal and spatial variation in climates and geography features if the linear regression model is not suitable for the certain study region other simple method should be further employed the budyko equation is a simple but useful model for assessing the water energy balance in regional hydrology studies williams et al 2012 the budyko equation describes that the mean annual precipitation p is partitioned into mean annual actual evapotranspiration et and runoff when the long term twsc equals zero the regional et is actually controlled by potential evapotranspiration eto and wang 2012 reported that there has been a competition between et and runoff when twsc not equals to zero at inter annual time scale therefore effective precipitation pe can be defined as the difference between p and twsc thus p can be replaced by pe in the budyko equation chen et al 2013 as a result twsc was incorporated into budyko equation to estimate long term twsc and gwc at inter annual time scale when the parameters in the budyko equation are solved long term w can be further estimated after gwc were derived using groundwater balance model the study area which is the zhang jia kou region zjk is located in the northwest of hebei province china and represents an overexploited groundwater area fig 1 in recent years growing groundwater resources demands in agriculture industry and service industry has led to concerns of groundwater resources depletion and related environment problems song et al 2018 the overuse of groundwater resources lead to the decline in groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc in zjk where the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the regional development has been indeed reduced however the long term gwc and degree of grcc are rarely reported in this region and the answers to the question whether the exploitation of groundwater resources has excessed its maximum carrying capacity for economic development remain unknown the objectives of this paper are to 1 determine whether the long term twsc can be obtained by the linear regression equation in zjk 2 incorporate the grace derived twsc data with budyko equation to reconstructed long term twsc gwc and groundwater withdrawal in zjk 3 construct a new and simple index with less input data to assess the spatiotemporal variability of the grcc based on the reconstructed long term gwc and groundwater withdrawal flow chart of this study was displayed in fig 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area zjk lies between latitude 39 30 42 10 n and longitude 113 50 116 30 e with an area of 36965 km2 and administratively covers 14 counties fig 1a and c the surface elevation of zjk ranges from 406 to 2815 m above the sea level from southeast to northwest the dominant geomorphological types are plateau in ba shang area bs and plain in ba xia bx fig 1b and d the major land use in zjk is classified into farmlands forests grasslands water bodies and urban areas in 2015 the crop land area is around 17 686 km2 accounting for approximately 50 of the total lands the major crops in this region are grain crops 68 vegetables 18 and other crops 14 the climates of zjk is characterized by continental monsoon semi arid with an annual rainfall of 300 400 mm and average temperature of 8 6 the dominant soil types are sand and silt agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 70 of the total water consumption in all counties except for in chongli 31 fig 3 a the proportion of water consumption for agricultural industrial and domestic use was 84 12 and 4 respectively for the entirely zjk fig 3b crop irrigation constitutes 70 of the agricultural water consumption in zjk and nearly 60 of these available water resources come from groundwater resources due to the limited surface water resources in this area national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 global land data assimilation system gldas data is produced by national aeronautics and space administration nasa national centers for environmental prediction ncep national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa gldas has assimilated the satellite based data and observed data into a land surface model to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 datasets in gldas include surface meteorological data hydrological variables and outputs of noah community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic and catchment land surface models rodell et al 2004 in this study the monthly products of 1 degree resolution data sets from noah were chosen to calculate the parameter in the budyko equation fu 1981 and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of long term twsc and gwc these datasets includes p et canopy water cw soil moisture sm subsurface runoff qsb surface runoff qsr the sum of subsurface runoff and surface runoff snow water sn since our study area is located in the arid and semi arid region the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration eto based on the maximum and minimum temperature from gldas the hargreaves method can be described as 1 e t 0 0 000939 r a t max t min ta 17 8 where eto is the potential evapotranspiration mm ta is the daily average temperature c tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum temperature respectively c ra is the daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 eto was used to calculate the parameter in the budyko equation 2 2 2 grace data the grace satellites were launched by nasa and german aerospace center dlr in low earth orbit to measure changes in earth s gravity field and detect the anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa based on the proportional relationship between gravity and earth density tapley et al 2004 grace data is composed of three different data level 1 level 2 and level 3 the level 1 product is calibrated and time tagged raw data and the level 2 data are produced by three data centers jet propulsion laboratory jpl center for space research csr and geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz the twsa products from csr are determined by the level 2 data and were chosen in the present study the monthly grace based twsa from 2002 to 2017 at 1 1 resolution can be obtained from the nasa jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website http grace jpl nasa gov the time periods of the grace data are between april 2002 and january 2017 in this study the missing data occurred at june and july in 2002 june in 2003 january and june in 2011 may and october in 2012 march august and september in 2013 february and december in 2014 june in 2015 the missing values were interpolated by averaging the values of 2 months before and after the month with missing data yin et al 2018 long et al 2015 the monthly twsc can be estimated by the time derivative of twsa using simple derivative in eq 2 long et al 2014 2 twsc t dtwsa dt twsa t t w s a t 1 δ t to match with resolution of water consumption data and gridded gdp data see section 2 2 4 grace data are re gridded to a horizontal grid resolution of 0 5 0 5 using arc gis 10 4 software esri environmental systems research institute 2 2 3 observed groundwater table depth in this study the groundwater table depth data of unconfined aquifer between 2005 and 2014 were obtained from six wells provided by china institute of geo environmental monitoring china geological environmental monitoring institute 2014 the location information of these six monitoring wells can be found in table 1 and the time series of groundwater table depth can be found in table 2 the groundwater table depth data were used to test the reliability of the budyko based estimation of gwc 2 2 4 water consumption data and gdp data the annual gridded water consumption data and gdp data at resolution of 0 5 0 5 during 1948 2018 in zjk were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isimip2b https www isimip org isimip2b data is initiated by the potsdam institute for climate impact research and international institute for applied systems analysis the objectives of the isimip2b project are to study the response of agriculture production and global water cycle and environment to climate change and human activities the water consumption data were consisted of agricultural industrial and domestic use at monthly time scale and gdp data were also classified into gdp for agriculture industry and service industry 2 3 construction of the grcc index groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is the function of allowable groundwater withdrawal wke and water use efficiency η liu et al 2017 and can be defined as 3 grcc η w ke 4 η a η indu b η agri c η third 5 η agri g agri q agri η indu g indu q indu η third g third q third where grcc is the groundwater resources carrying capacity which represented by gdp yuan η is the comprehensive water use efficiency yuan mm 1 η is further classified into agriculture water use efficiency ηagri industry water use efficiency ηindu and service water use efficiency ηthird gagri gindu and gthird are gdp for agriculture industry and service industry yuan qagri qindu and qthird are water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry mm a b c are the ratio between water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry to the total water consumption according to the report of zhang and li 2005 wke in zjk was 5 66 108m3 15 mm 8 52 108m3 23 mm 9 77 108m3 27 mm and 10 5 108m3 29 mm during 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000 2018 respectively the actual grcc and theoretical maximum grcc can be calculated as 6 grc c a η w ke 7 grc c max η max w ke in order to evaluate the degree of groundwater withdrawal for supporting the economic development grcc index d is defined as 8 d rg rq 9 rg grc c a grc c max 10 rq w w ke where ηmax is the maximum η during 1948 2018 across the entire zjk rg is the degree of economic development supported by groundwater resources rq is degree of groundwater withdrawal w is the groundwater withdrawal d is the grcc index the higher d value indicates lower grcc which means the local economic development depend much more on groundwater resources the category standards of the grcc severity for d are defined as no overload d 30 overload 30 d 50 and heavy overload d 50 liu et al 2017 2 4 estimation of w according to the eqs 8 10 w is the key parameter for calculating d is the groundwater balance equation can be used to calculate w 11 q in q out gwc where q in is the annual total groundwater recharge cm q out is the annual total groundwater discharge cm gwc is the groundwater storage change cm according to the report of chen 1999 precipitation contributes 86 of the total groundwater recharge in bs of zjk while in bx of zjk precipitation and lateral flow contributes 60 of the total groundwater recharge and irrigation contributes 20 of the total groundwater recharge therefore annual total groundwater recharge in bs and bx can be estimated as follows 12 q b 1 q p 13 q b 2 q p q l q i where q b 1 is the total annual groundwater recharge at bs of zjk cm q b 2 is total annual groundwater recharge at bx of zjk cm qp represents the groundwater recharge from precipitation ql represents the lateral recharge qi represent groundwater recharge from irrigation qp can be calculated as 14 q p α p where α is the rainfall infiltration coefficient α q l and q i are influenced by rainfall vegetation and topography therefore it should be assigned different values at different counties table 3 gives the different values of α q l and q i at different counties according to the report of zhang and li 2005 liu 2013 reported most of the crops in zjk were irrigated using groundwater therefore the groundwater discharge are mainly depended on groundwater withdrawal w the groundwater balance equation can be further described as 15 q b 1 w 1 g w c 1 16 q b 2 w 2 g w c 2 where w1 and w2 are groundwater withdrawal in bs and bx of zjk mm gwc1 and gwc2 are groundwater storage change in bs and bx of zjk mm therefore groundwater withdrawal can be estimated when gwc were obtained 2 5 estimation of gwc according to the eqs 15 and 16 w can be determined by the calculation of gwc gwc can be obtained by the water balance equation twsc is composed of water storage changes in groundwater gwc soil moisture changes smc surface water changes swc snow water changes snc and biomass changes pwc therefore twsc can be calculated as 17 twsc s m c s w c s n c p w c g w c liesch and ohmer 2016 reported that the biomass component can be neglected due to its less influence on twsc the previous studies also suggested that swc is considerable small and can be ignored in zjk yin et al 2018 the gwc can be obtained if twsc smc and snc were determined 18 gwc t w s c s m c s n c in order to validate the estimated gwc the measured gwc can be calculated as 19 gw c obs s y δ h where δ h is the change in groundwater table depth δ g w c obs is the measured groundwater storage change sy is the specific yield which is set as 0 15 guo et al 2010 2 6 long term construction of twsc smc and snc one of our objectives is to assess the long term grcc by constructing long term d therefore we need to obtain long term data of twsc smc and snc based on the point of view in section 2 5 the long term gwc can be obtained if long term twsc smc and snc are constructed therefore grace and gldas data are used to construct the long term twsc smc and snc two methods are used in this section include general linear regression method and budyko model 2 6 1 the general linear regression method due to the limited time periods of grace data nie et al 2016 reconstructed long term 1948 2012 annual twsa across the amazon basin by use of short term grace based data gldas data and general linear regression model they found there have been good linear relationships between hydrological variables of gldas and grace based twsa therefore we firstly constructed the linear regression model between hydrological variables from gldas and grace based twsa in a short term 2002 2017 and determine whether it is reasonable to reconstructed long term twsc by using the linear regression model the hydrological variables we used in this study are p et cw runoff sm sm sn cw qsb qsr p et p et qsr p et qsb since the grace data is anomalies relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline this baseline needs to be consistent when comparing grace data to other hydrological anomaly data p et cw runoff sm sm sn cw qsb qsr p et p et qsr p et qsb the general linear regression model can be described as 20 y a x b where a a 1 a n is the regression coefficient matrix for the grid cells from the linear fitting b b 1 b n is the interval matrix for the grid cells from the linear fitting x x 11 x 1 n x n 1 x nn and y y 11 y 1 n y n 1 y nn are the matrix of hydrological variables from gldas and twsa from grace respectively the is products of the elements in the corresponding position of the matrixes i e dot products meanwhile the rows in the matrix x represent the anomaly time series of the processed hydrological variables of gldas while the rows in the matrix y represent those of grace in this study if the r value between twsa and hydrological variables 0 8 we can use the linear regression model to reconstruct the long term twsc else we use budyko equation 2 6 2 budyko model the budyko equation is developed by budyko 1961 to quantify the relationships between mean annual evaporation ratio et p and the mean annual potential evaporation ratio eto p the budyko equation revealed that the mean annual et is controlled by the p and eto when the twsc was negligible the ration between et and p is non linearly dependent on ration between eto and p as 21 et p f e t o p various forms of budyko equations have been derived for quantifying the impact of human activities and watershed characteristics on long term regional water balance fu 1981 yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 among these different type of equations the fu s one parameter budyko equation is widely used to estimate the annual water balance in china fu 1981 and can be proposed as 22 et p 1 e t o p 1 e t o p ω 1 ω where ω is a parameter reflecting the physical properties for a given watershed such as soil vegetation and topography the fu s one parameter budyko equation assumed that the long term twsc should be negligible however wang and alimohammadi 2012 reported twsc can be significant in semi arid and arid regions due to anthropogenic activities therefore twsc should not be assigned as zero when the twsc not equals zero the available water for et and runoff is the difference between p and twsc pe p twsc which is defined as effective precipitation chen et al 2013 wang 2012 as a result p is replaced by pe and eq 22 can be rewrite as 23 et p e 1 e t o p e 1 e t o p e ω 1 ω equation 23 can be further rewrite as 24 et p t w s c 1 e t o p t w s c 1 e t o p t w s c ω 1 ω therefore twsc was incorporated into the fu s one parameter budyko equation and the long term twsc can be estimated by eq 24 we used short term data of et p eto and twsc to estimate parameter ω and then calculate the long term twsc by using the ω and long term et p and eto 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term spatiotemporal variability of water storage changes monthly water storage anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa sm sn and gw between april 2002 and january 2017 in zjk are displayed in fig 4 twsa and anomalies in gw show decreasing trend with the z value of 11 1 cm and 10 1 cm mann kendall test fig 4a d the magnitudes of uncertainty for twsa standard deviation 0 08 to 2 9 cm are lower than sm anomalies 0 6 to 3 9 cm fig 4b and gw anomalies have the largest uncertainty with standard deviation 0 6 to 5 0 cm sn anomalies peaks in winter while approach to zero cm at other seasons fig 4d the cumulative sm anomalies have appeared to be nearly zero cm 0 03 cm between april 2002 and january 2017 indicating soil moisture storage have relative less variation over these years many studies had similar results with the presented study tang et al 2017 reconstructed the long term twsa and gw anomalies between 1980 and 2015 in northern pakistan and reported sm anomalies approached to zero cm rodell et al 2009 also quantify the gwc and smc in northwest of india and found the fluctuation of soil moisture was closer to 0 fig 5 shows the mean annual fig 5a and monthly fig 5b water storage anomalies in tws gw sm and sn during 2002 2017 twsa and anomalies in gw tend to decrease while anomalies in sm and sn had lower fluctuation fig 5 b also shows anomalies in sm from june to september was higher than the other months while anomalies in tws and gw have similar variation twsa had the lower value of 3 1 cm and 2 2 cm in june and october while had the higher value of 1 1 cm and 0 7 cm in april and august anomalies in gw have the lower value of 2 6 cm and 3 6 cm in june and november while had higher value of 0 7 cm and 0 8 cm the spatial distribution of averaged 2002 2017 annual water storage anomalies in tws gw sm and sn are displayed in fig 6 anomalies in tws and gw have declined from the southwest to northeast ranging from 2 5 to 1 1 cm and 3 0 to 1 3 cm respectively since there much more farmlands were located in the west than in the east leading to more groundwater abstractions for irrigation su et al 2018 our results were consistent with studies reported by gong et al 2018 and feng et al 2018 which demonstrated that the depletion of groundwater storage contributed the decline of tws the increasing degree in anomalies for sm was higher in the west than in the east this might be caused by the lower et in the west than in the west since lower et lead to higher soil moisture in the study area zhang 2018 the distribution of anomalies for sn had small difference indicating that the variation of snow water storage remained stable the decreasing trend for both twsa and gw anomalies in zjk during 2002 2017 indicates tws and gw in zjk have experienced the depletion situation fig 4 and fig 5 there are many reasons accounting for the depletion of tws and gw chen et al 2016 demonstrated that the increasing in temperature resulted in depletion of snow water storage and tws in the tianshan mountains additionally the decreasing trend of precipitation and groundwater storage also contributed the decline of tws asoka et al 2017 quantify the influence of groundwater abstraction and climate change on the gwc in india from 2002 to 2013 they found that gw has dropped in northern india but increased in southern india which can be explained by intensive abstraction for irrigation in northern india and obvious changes in precipitation in southern india respectively strassberg et al 2009 and yeh et al 2006 also evaluated the ability of grace based gwc in the high plains aquifer and illinois and they reported the correlation of variation between tws and gwc were 0 9 and 0 8 respectively all these studies indicated gwc has significant influence on depletion of tws compared to other water storage changes component and hydrological variables nie et al 2018 in the presented study gwc has depleted since 1995 with the annual over exploitation use of 47 million m3 for irrigation especially for satisfying the vegetable water requirement ma et al 2014 however precipitation in our study region didn t appear to be decreasing therefore the depletion of tws could be attributed to the depletion of gw in our study area 3 2 method selection for reconstructing long term twsc and gwc distribution of correlation coefficient r between hydrologic variables and twsa is displayed in fig 7 it indicates that all the hydrologic variables we choose had lower linear relationship with twsa with minimum r of 0 2 and maximum r of 0 5 compared to other hydrologic variables sm and sm sn cw had the highest r of 0 5 table 4 gave the coefficient of determination r2 between twsa and hydrologic variables and indicates all the r2 were very low for the entire study region yang et al 2018 and nie et al 2016 reconstructed the long term twsa by using the linear regression model in arid region of western china and amazon river basin both results had higher r value of 0 7 especially the hydrological variables of p et qsr had higher r value of 0 94 with twsa however compared to these two regions the agricultural production in our study region depends much on groundwater resources therefore twsa is more sensitive to the change in groundwater resources rather than other hydrological variables both fig 5 and table 4 reveal that it is unreasonable to use linear regression model in our study region to construct long term twsc and gwc therefore budyko equation should be further validated for this purpose the average standard deviation of annual anomalies in p eto et sm and sn are 8 6 22 7 6 6 2 3 and 0 9 cm during 1948 2018 fig 8 the long term cumulative anomalies in sm approached zero during 1948 2018 indicating less changes in soil moisture in our study region and anomalies in sn had larger fluctuations after 2000 fig 8 the fitted budyko curve during 2003 2016 with scatter points between annual evapotranspiration ratio and annual aridity index are displayed in fig 9 the estimated annual evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index ranged from 0 73 to 0 84 and 5 63 to 7 19 with mean value of 0 7 and 5 6 respectively the fitted budyko curve is under the lower bound the ratio between et and p twsc and all the scatter points are within the curve especially the multiple year average point is located on the fitted curve fig 9 also shows the fitted ω value was 1 47 sun et al 2007 validate the budyko equation among 63 sub river basins in china and reported that ω varies in different climatic regions which ranging from 1 to 3 for arid and semi arid regions in the meantime zjk is just located in the semi arid area therefore the fitted ω value of 1 47 is reasonable and the budyko equation is suitable for constructing the long term twsc and gwc in our study area han et al 2018 yang et al 2006 3 3 long term reconstruction of twsc gwc and groundwater withdrawal 3 3 1 reconstructed long term twsc based on the estimated ω and fitted budyko equation the reconstructed long term twsc during 1948 2018 in comparison with the short term 2002 2017 grace based twsc were displayed in fig 10 in general budyko based twsc in our study area has increased during 1948 and 2018 root mean squared error rmse and r between budyko based and grace based twsc are 4 7 cm and 0 62 the absolute difference between budyko based and grace based twsc have the minimum value of 0 2 cm in 2015 and the maximum value of 9 5 in 2012 the budyko based twsc underestimates the grace based twsc in 1 out of 15 years fig 10 the budyko based twsc were consistent with the grace based twsc even if difference occurred shown in fig 10 many studies had reported that this uncertainty would exist due to the uncertainty in grace data and budyko equation both strassberg et al 2009 and longuevergne et al 2010 compared the in situ observations with grace based twsc and reported the rmse was 3 8 cm which was close to our results tang et al 2017 constructed the twsc and gwc in indus basin and reported the rmse between budyko based twsc and grace based twsc ranged from 2 2 to 8 1 cm apart from the uncertainty in the budyko equation and grace data the input data of budyko equation may also result in the uncertainty in estimating twsc the standard deviation of p had decreased from 9 9 to 8 3 cm during 1948 2018 meanwhile standard deviation of twsc declined from 5 8 to 4 7 some studies revealed that the difference of topography would lead to the uncertainty in precipitation which would further lead to the uncertainty in estimating twsc herold et al 2015 roe 2005 in our study the difference of topography is relative lower than in indus basin therefore the uncertainty in our study in lower than in indus basin and the fitted budyko equation is reasonable for constructing the long term twsc 3 3 2 reconstructed long term gwc and groundwater withdrawal fig 11 shows gwc using budyko equation and groundwater balance equation during 1948 2018 based on the long term p et eto and twsc fig 8 in our study area the observed gwc 2005 2014 based on the groundwater table depth table 2 are also displayed in fig 11 gwc uncertainty in our study region has resulted from both budyko equation and groundwater balance equation shamsudduha et al 2012 thomas et al 2016 sun et al 2010 the absolute difference between budyko based gwc and measured gwc ranged from 33 7 to 36 7 cm rmse and r between budyko based gwc and measured gwc were 21 2 cm and 0 6 indicating the budyko based gwc favorably agrees with the measured gwc fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of gwc in the study region at different time periods in general the groundwater storage appeared to decline since all the gridded gwc value were lower than 0 at these four time periods the short term 2002 2017 grace based gwc ranged from 2 8 to 1 3 cm fig 6 while fig 12 d showed the budyko based gwc during 2002 2017 ranged from 12 2 to 2 4 cm which were much more close to the measured gwc the reason for this is that grace data were less sensitive than the observed data in detecting groundwater storage change in small regions asoka et al 2017 in order to further validate the reliability of the budyko based gwc the cumulative sum of the budyko based annual gwc during 1948 2018 and the total number of monitoring wells during 1993 2016 are displayed in fig 13 the cumulative sum of gwc has declined from 9 5 to 480 5 cm during 1948 2018 with annual rate of 7cm year 1 indicating that the groundwater storage in our study region remains depleting in the past 70 years the depletion of groundwater storage had significant negative correlation r 0 9 with the amount of wells the number of wells has increased from 12 822 to 36 579 during 1993 2016 in the meantime the gwc has declined from 310 9 to 455 6 cm the large number of constructed wells for irrigation has accelerated the decline of groundwater resources in our study region furthermore the groundwater recharge is relative small in our study region which resulting the continuous groundwater depletion in zjk chen 1999 tang et al 2017 also estimate the cumulative sum of gwc in indus basin with annual declining rate of 1 0 0 4 cm year 1 and rodell et al 2009 reported the decline rate of gwc in india was 4 cm year 1 our results was obviously higher than these reported results since zjk had more wells than these two regions for example there had 1000 wells in indus basin in 2013 but nearly 30 000 wells in our study region the spatial distribution of annual groundwater withdrawals at different periods in our study region is displayed in fig 14 in general groundwater withdrawals have ranged from 8 5 to 35 9 cm during 1948 2018 for the entire study region specifically groundwater withdrawals in bs kang bao shang yi zhang bei and gu yuan were lower than in bx for all time periods fig 14 the mean annual groundwater withdrawals in 1980 1999 were higher 16 8 cm than in 2000 2018 14 5 cm which increased by 1 cm for bs but decreased by 6 cm for bx zhang and fang 2018 reported that groundwater withdrawal is mainly used for irrigation in bs while for industrial and domestic use in bx additionally groundwater resources saving technologies for industrial and domestic use have been deeply improved by the local government therefore groundwater withdrawals in bx tend to be decreased in the recent years 2000 2018 groundwater withdrawals tend to be increased from 1980 to 1999 to 2000 2018 in bs this might be caused by the increase in planting areas for vegetables which consumed more groundwater than other grain crops for example zhang and fang 2018 documented that the available cultivated farm land areas have decreased by 22 while the planting areas of vegetables have increased by 120 in zjk 3 4 assessment of groundwater withdrawal in zjk fig 15 shows the time series of groundwater resource carrying capacity index d in zjk during 1948 2018 the d value were 30 30 d 50 and d 50 during 1948 1988 1990 1993 and 1994 2018 respectively the d value at these three different phases indicates that the degree of groundwater resources exploitation were in the state of no overload overload and heavy overload respectively fig 15 also shows the overload state of groundwater exploitation started in 1990 and transformed into heavy overload condition rapidly in 1994 the reason for this is that producers in zjk have started planting high water consumed vegetables in 1990 and large number of wells was constructed for irrigation zhang and fang 2018 when the degree of groundwater resources exploitation were in the state of no overload overload and heavy overload respectively the mean annual gdp supported by groundwater resources were 1 3 billion yuan 3 6 billion yuan and 6 1 billion yuan respectively however the maximum gdp supported by groundwater resources in zjk should be 9 2 billion yuan theoretically which indicates that the exploitation of groundwater resources in zjk is more and more important to economic development in recent years the increasing rate of water consumption and gdp were also in the stage of rapid growth with the d 50 during 1994 2018 fig 16 the contribution of groundwater resources for the economic development has exceeded 50 which indicated that the economic development of zjk depend much more on exploitation of groundwater resources at the same time water use efficiency increased during 1948 2018 fig 16c while the average annual groundwater exploitation during 1948 1988 1990 1993 and 1994 2018 were 39 million m3 43 million m3 and 50 million m3 fig 17 our results further prove that simply improving the water use efficiency cannot improve groundwater resources carrying capacity grafton et al 2018 reducing the absolute use of groundwater resources should be the main way to alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources and improve groundwater resources carrying capacity fig 18 showed the average spatial distribution of d during 1949 1980 1981 2005 and 2006 2018 in zjk the degree of groundwater resources exploitation was in the state of overloaded with d 30 before the 1980 between 1981 and 2005 the degree of groundwater resources exploitation has transformed into the state of overload for bs of zjk in 2018 the degree of groundwater resources exploitation at bs was in the state of heavy overload wang 2008 analyzed the restrictive factors for the development of agriculture in bs and reported that the bs is located in the ecological transition zone with finite fresh water resources additionally agricultural cultivated land is mainly distributed in the bs while the industry and service industry are distributed in central and southern areas of zjk where surface water are mainly used compared with the central and southern areas of zjk the grcc in bs is much more vulnerable and therefore the key area for alleviating the contradiction between the groundwater resources supply and demand in zjk is in bs rather than other areas of zjk 4 conclusions in this paper two methods linear regression model and budyko equation combined with gravity recovery and climate experiment data grace and global land data assimilation system data gldas are used to reconstruct the long term terrestrial water storage change twsc groundwater storage change gwc and groundwater withdrawal in zhangjiakou zjk as a case study the estimated gwc and groundwater withdrawal are further applied to assess the groundwater water resources carrying capacity the main conclusions are 1 the short term 2002 2017 annual and monthly anomalies in terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage appeared to be decreased the anomalies in soil moisture storage tend to be zero while anomalies for snow water tend to be increased with annual rate of 2 cm year 1 the depletion of groundwater storage is the major source accounting for the tremendous depletion of tws in zjk 2 it is unreasonable to apply linear regression model to reconstructed long term twsc and gwc in zjk due to the low correlation coefficient r between hydrological variables and anomalies in terrestrial water storage twsa the parameter ω in budyko equation is 1 47 which is suitable for constructing the long term twsc and gwc in our study area 3 the long term gwc has declined rapidly from 310 9 to 455 6 cm due to the over construction of wells for irrigation in zjk additionally groundwater withdrawals in ba shang kang bao shang yi zhang bei and gu yuan were lower than in ba xia for all time periods 4 our results shows the overload state of groundwater exploitation started in 1990 and transformed into heavy overload condition rapidly in 1994 although water use efficiency gdp increased rapidly at these periods indicating that simply improving the water use efficiency cannot improve groundwater resources carrying capacity however reducing the absolute use of groundwater resources should be the effective way to alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources and improve groundwater resources carrying capacity credit

5301,climate change which impacts the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources has a significant influence on the future hydropower generation studying the future evolution pattern of hydropower generation under climate change is of great significance for the medium and long term hydropower prediction the objective of this paper is to predict the future hydropower generation of large scale reservoir groups under climate change the innovation of this paper is that the macro scale distributed hydrological model combined with the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs was proposed for hydropower generation prediction the established model considers the specific operation processes of large scale reservoir groups including 62 reservoirs in the case study first the statistical downscaling model sdsm was built and the evolution trend of future rainfall and temperature was predicted second the macro scale distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model was built to predict the future runoff finally the optimal operation generation model of large scale reservoir groups was established to predict the trends of hydropower generation under climate change results demonstrate that under rcp2 6 scenario there is no significant increase or decrease trend of hydropower generation in the future but under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the hydropower generation shows a growing trend and the increase trend under rcp8 5 scenario is more obvious than that under rcp4 5 scenario thus the development of hydropower generation is sensitive to climate change this study can provide a reference for the long term prediction of hydropower generation capacity in the upper yangtze river basin keywords hydropower generation prediction climate change large scale reservoirs vic hydrological model the upper yangtze river basin 1 introduction hydropower generation plays an irreplaceable role in modern power system feng et al 2017 chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in 2015 china s hydropower installed capacity exceeded 300 000 mw li et al 2018 active development of hydropower is an important way to ensure china s energy supply and promote low carbon emission reduction chen et al 2013 chang et al 2010 however climate change directly affects the meteorological factors such as temperature rainfall and evaporation and indirectly affects other factors such as soil moisture content and runoff etc which results in the redistribution of water resources in time and space and the increase or decrease of the total water resources chen et al 2010 huntington 2006 shi and wang 2015 further climate change has a profound impact on the hydropower generation capacity of basins fan et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to predict runoff and hydropower generation under climate change the existing methods for predicting the future runoff can be divided into statistical and data driven approaches and physically based approaches solomatine et al 2007 chen et al 2014a nourani et al 2014 the former methods mainly include classical regression analysis back propagation neural network nonlinear time series analysis and fuzzy mathematical mothed etc which forecasts future runoff by establishing the statistical relationship between weather and runoff data chen et al 2018 chu et al 2016 chen et al 2014b the physically based approaches are based on the hydrological model to simulate the relationship between rainfall and runoff and deduce the evolution trend of runoff through the future rainfall those methods have certain physical mechanisms because they take into accounts the characteristics of atmospheric circulation basin runoff generation and confluence which are now praised by the academia nilawar and waikar 2019 liu et al 2015a chen et al 2012 experts and scholars have conducted a series of studies on the prediction of hydropower generation under climate change based on these runoff prediction results some scholars have carried out the prediction of hydropower generation under climate change based on empirical models such as simplified reservoir regulations and regression models van vliet et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2016 kao et al 2015 for example liu et al 2016 predicted the future runoff and estimated developed hydropower potential dhp under climate change based on a kind of reservoir regulation rules kao et al 2015 built a regression model between runoff and hydropower generation to predict the future hydropower generation although these studies have considered the impact of climate change they did not consider the specific process of reservoir operation in fact the hydropower generation capacity is not only related to input factors such as hydrometeorology information but also depends on the basic characteristics of hydropower stations madani et al 2014 considering the reservoir operation process the hydropower generation process may be simulated more precisely qin et al 2020 some scholars have predicted the hydropower generation of single reservoir considering the specific reservoir operation process under climate change qin et al 2020 yang et al 2015 raje and mujumdar 2010 raje and mujumdar 2010 studied the response of reservoir hydropower generation under climate change for india s hirakud reservoir yang et al 2015 predicted the hydropower generation and water supply of danjiangkou reservoir under climate change by an adaptive multi objective operation model however these studies only took into accounts the specific operation process of a single reservoir since the hydropower prediction is a type of dynamic time delay and nonlinear modeling problem especially with the rapid increase of the number of hydropower stations when establishing the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs there is a problem of the cruse of dimensionality zhou et al 2018 moreover since the intelligent algorithm can t solve the local convergence problem it is difficult to establish a mathematical model for predicting the large scale reservoirs hydropower generation considering climate change and the characteristics of reservoirs liu et al 2015b afshar 2013 moreno 2009 li et al 2014a in order to alleviate the influence of cruse of dimensionality and simplify the modeling process the existing hydropower generation capacity prediction methods mainly focus on the improved dp algorithms such as the discrete differential dynamic programming dddp and the progressive optimality algorithm poa cheng et al 2014 howson and sancho 1975 the decomposition coordination dc is also an effective approach for the optimal operation of large scale reservoir groups which can decompose a large system into many subsystems and reduce the difficulty of single system optimal operation cohen 1978 li et al 2014b however the hydropower generation prediction considering climate change and the specific operation processes of large scale reservoirs still needs to be further studied the objective of this paper is to propose a future hydropower generation prediction method for large scale reservoirs considering climate change and specific reservoir operation processes the innovation of this paper is summarized as follows the runoff prediction based on macro scale distributed hydrological model combined with the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs was proposed to predict the future hydropower generation under climate change second the macro scale distributed vic hydrological model of the whole upper yangtze river basin with an area of one million square kilometers was first established third the optimal operation model of large scale reservoir groups including 62 reservoirs was built the proposed method overcomes the limitation that the current generation prediction methods did not consider the specific operation process or only consider the operation processes of single reservoir the main framework of the study is as follows first the data of the general circulation models gcms under different representative concentration pathways rcps emission scenarios was used in this paper and the statistical downscaling model was employed for downscaling the data of gcms and predicting the future evolution trend of rainfall and temperature second the macro scale distributed vic hydrological model was established to simulate the response of future runoff to climate change third the optimal operation model of large scale reservoir groups in the upper yangtze river basin was established and based on the simulated runoff data the trends of future hydropower generation in the basin under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios were predicted 2 methodologies 2 1 future rainfall and temperature prediction general circulation models can provide reliable long term future climate data according to atmospheric circulation mechanism the fifth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 collected the results of nearly 60 climate models from 23 climate model groups worldwide klausmeyer and shaw 2009 in this paper the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 developed by canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis was selected and its future climate simulation results under three emission scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were obtained studies show that the canesm2 model can well simulate climate change in china zhang et al 2016 birkinshaw et al 2017 chen and frauenfeld 2014 because the gcms are large scale models it is necessary to be downscaled to characterize the atmospheric motion laws at small and medium scales downscaling methods can be divided into two categories namely statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling wood et al 2004 zorita and von storch 1999 since the dynamical downscaling method is complex the statistical downscaling method was widely used in hydrology because of easier construction less calculation work and more flexible form charles et al 1999 the sdsm model was selected to downscale the canesm2 model in order to transform the large scale atmospheric motion information into climate information of the study area in this paper 2 1 1 the principle of the statistical downscaling model the principle of sdsm model is establishment of the statistical relationship between gcm derived predictor variables such as atmospheric pressure humidity and wind speed and the weather variables of the study area such as daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily rainfall based on multiple regression analysis method then the gcm derived predictor variables were taken as inputs of the sdsm model to generate future temperature and rainfall sequences of the study area the core of sdsm model is to establish the statistical relationship model between the predictor variable s and the weather variable x whose equation is given by 1 x f s where f is the statistical relationship between the large scale predictor variable set s and the local weather variable x the performance of the sdsm model can be evaluated by the determination coefficient which is given by 2 r 2 i 1 t x obs i x obs x sim i x sim 2 i 1 t x obs i x obs 2 i 1 t x sim i x sim 2 where x obs i and x sim i are the observed and predicted values of output variable at time i t is the length of the period and x obs and x sim are the mean observed and predicted values of the output variable 2 1 2 screening of predictor variables of sdsm model the screening of predictor variables is very important for the successful construction of sdsm model selecting the predictor variables with higher correlations with weather variables can help improve the accuracy of simulation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily rainfall were chosen as the weather variables table 1 gives the predictor variables to be screened and their physical meanings historical data of 26 predictor variables from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and historical weather variables data of the study area can be used as inputs to the sdsm model the screen variables module of the sdsm model was employed to screen appropriate predictor variables based on this module the statistical relationship between predictor variables and weather variables can be established then users can select the appropriate predictor variables based on the correlation analysis between each predictor variable and weather variable and the correlation measuring methods mainly include partial correlation analysis seasonal correlation analysis and scatterplots and there are several optimization principles need to be noted in the process of selection first the predictor variables should be able to reflect the physical mechanism of the change of weather variables second the results of correlation analysis between them should be good third the selected predictors should be independent or weakly correlated last the predictor variables should be common to gcms data and ncep data wilby et al 1998 2 1 3 future weather variables prediction during this section the future daily rainfall and daily temperature were simulated according to the established multiple linear regression model between predictor variables and weather variables for the simulation of daily rainfall it can be divided into two parts the simulation of rainfall incidence and the simulation of precipitation the regression equation of rainfall probability is as follows wilby et al 1999 3 o t α 0 i 1 n α i s i α t 1 o t 1 where o t 1 and o t are rainfall probabilities at day t 1 and t α 0 and α i are parameters estimated using linear least squares regression s i is predictor variable i α t 1 is the regression parameter of day t 1 whether rainfall occurs is determined by a random number l t between 0 and 1 that obeys the uniform distribution if o t is greater than l t there will be rainfall in day t for the value of precipitation the equation is given by wilby et al 1999 4 u t f exp ϕ β 0 i 1 n β i s i ε where u t is the precipitation value of day t f exp is the empirical distribution function of precipitation value at day t ϕ is the normal cumulative distribution function β 0 and β i are parameters estimated using linear least squares regression ε is random or modelling error for the temperature simulation it is not necessary to simulate the possibility of occurrence but only to simulate the random change of temperature value whose calculation is similar to precipitation srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 after the calibration of the sdsm model the gcms data under different rcps emission scenarios in the future are used as the inputs to the scenario generator module of the sdsm model the future weather variables data under different rcps emission scenarios can be generated 2 2 rainfall runoff simulation based on the vic hydrological model in this study the vic hydrological model was used to simulate the future runoff this model is a macro scale distributed hydrological model which is generally applied to basins with an area of tens of thousands of square kilometers the vic model can simulate vegetation transpiration soil evaporation canopy evaporation snow accumulation and ablation soil freeze thaw etc thus it comprehensively characterizes the transfer paths and processes of various water bodies the main modules of the vic model include evapotranspiration runoff generation and runoff confluence the model transfers the whole basin into many grids calculates the runoff generation and then converts the output data of each grid into the flow process of the outlet section of the basin through the confluence module the input files of the vic model include soil data vegetation data meteorological forcing data flow direction data basin characteristics data and global parameter files etc parameters of the vic model which need to be calibrated are shown in table 2 after model calibration the future weather data predicted by the sdsm model was used as inputs to the vic hydrological model to simulate the future runoff the univariate search technique was used to calibrate the parameters of vic model and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the relative error eall of the observed and simulated flow data were chosen to assess the performance of the model 5 nse 1 t 1 t q obs

tests respectively the larger the sensitivity index value is the more sensitive the parameter is if the sensitivity index value is more than 1 it means that this parameter is a sensitive parameter 2 3 establishment of the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs the objective of the optimal operation model is to maximize the annual hydropower generation of large scale reservoirs the future runoff data simulated by the vic model under different carbon emission scenarios were used as the inputs to the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs dp is a powerful method in solving operation problem however it is not applicable in this problem because of the curse of dimensionality so the discrete differential dynamic programming dddp combined with the large scale system decomposed coordinating lssdc method proposed by li et al 2014 were employed to solve the optimal models in order to deal with the dimensionality problems the detailed information of the model is

operation model the future runoff sequences predicted by the vic model were used as the inputs of the operation model to calculate the hydropower generation of the large scale reservoirs 3 case study the yangtze river originated from the geladandong peak of the tanggula mountains in the upper basin its main tributaries include yalong river minjiang river wujiang river and jialing river the upper yangtze river basin was selected as a case study which located in the southwest of china it is a big basin of one million square kilometers which accounts for about 10 of china s land area and involves nine provinces municipalities and autonomous regions the topography of the basin is diverse including plateau the qinghai tibet plateau basin the sichuan basin etc affected by the subtropical monsoon and the qinghai tibet plateau high cold climate rainfall and hydropower resources here are abundant and meanwhile the climate here is very sensitive yichang station is the outlet of the upper yangtze river basin and there are another six stations along the yangtze river namely shigu panzhihua xiluodu xiangjiaba zhutuo and cuntan stations considered in this study as shown in fig 1 the historical ncep re analysis data of prediction variables https www esrl noaa gov the historical rainfall and temperature data of the basin derived from the china meteorological data center http data cma cn and the future prediction variables data of canesm2 under three different emission scenarios downloaded from the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis https www canada ca en html were used for the establishment of the sdsm model the historical rainfall data temperature data runoff data of the basin and the dem elevation data of 30 km spatial resolution from geospatial data http www gscloud cn vegetation data from the university of maryland http glcf umd edu data and soil data from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations http www fao org geonetwork were used for the establishment of the vic model and the characteristic curves of 62 reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin were collected to establish the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs the study area and the scheme of the large reservoir system are given in figs 1 and 2 4 results and discussions first the sdsm model was established to predict the rainfall and temperature sequences under different emission scenarios second the vic hydrological model was established to predict the future runoff and third the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs was established to predict the future hydropower generation ability of the study area 4 1 future rainfall and temperature prediction the ncep re analysis data the predictor variables and the historical rainfall and temperature data the weather variables were taken as inputs of sdsm model the statistical relationship between the predictor variables and the weather variables were established based on sdsm model the daily data from 1970 to 1999 were used for model calibration and the daily data from 2000 to 2005 were used for model validation then the statistical relationships between the predictor variables and basin s rainfall and temperature data were determined the determination coefficients r 2 fitted curves slopes a and root mean square errors rmse of the observed and simulated monthly data at each station in both calibration and validation periods were calculated as shown in table 3 and figs 3 to 4 it can be seen from figs 3 and 4 and table 3 that the simulation results of temperature at each station are excellent in both calibration and validation periods most of the determination coefficients are above 0 95 and the slopes of the curves are within the range of 0 901 to 1 013 and the rmse values of daily maximum and minimum temperatures at each station are between 0 878 1 481 and 0 697 1 403 respectively the simulation results of daily minimum temperature show a better performance than those of daily minimum temperature for its determination coefficients are generally higher in both calibration and validation periods meanwhile the rmse values of daily minimum temperature at most stations are also lower than that those of daily maximum temperature in both calibration and validation periods for rainfall simulation the result is not as good as that of temperatures since the rainfall simulation is more complex and discrete zhang et al 2016 hassan et al 2014 the determination coefficients of rainfall at most stations reach 0 75 in both calibration and validation periods except for zhutuo station and the slopes of the curves are within the range of 0 746 to 1 090 rmse values of rainfall simulation at each station are acceptable which are within 10 of the observed precipitation in both calibration and validation periods for zhutuo station the rainfall simulation results are not so good which may be affected by regional factors such as topography for the whole basin the performance of the sdsm model is also good the determination coefficients of rainfall are all above 0 90 and the determination coefficients of maximum and minimum temperatures are generally above 0 95 in both calibration and validation periods the rmse values of the whole basin are also lower than those of most single stations for rainfall simulation the rmse values are within 5 of the observed precipitation and for temperature simulation the rmse values are less than 1 0 the variation range of monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures were within 0 15 and the variation range of monthly rainfall is from 2mm to 11 4 mm in calibration period in general the simulation results of the sdsm model are perfect and it and can be used for the future climate simulation of the study area then the future periods were divided into three stages namely 2020 s 2018 2044 2050 s 2045 2071 and 2080 s 2072 2100 the canesm2 predictor variables data from 2018 to 2100 were taken as inputs of the sdsm model to predict the daily rainfall daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the future period under different emission scenarios the predicted annual weather variables of the whole basin are given in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the predicted weather variables data are fluctuated in different degrees the rainfall data under rcp8 5 scenario shows a significant increasing trend while the rainfall data under rcp2 6 scenario and rcp4 5 scenario shows a slight increasing trend the trends of the temperature are similar to those of rainfall moreover it is demonstrated that the main variation of rainfall during a year is basically concentrated in flood season to the contrary the variations of temperature is opposite which change significantly in dry season these results are similar to those of previous studies zhang et al 2016 taking the weather variables from 1970 to 2005 as baseline period the trends of rainfall and temperature in each future period were analyzed and results of the whole basin are given in table 4 as shown in table 4 the maximum change rate of rainfall is19 90 which occurred in 2080 s and the maximum change rates of maximum and minimum daily temperatures are 8 24 and 18 74 respectively both occurred in 2080 s for rcp2 6 scenario the trends of rainfall and the temperature increase first and then decrease and the decrease of temperature is slightly larger for rcp4 5 scenario the rainfall and the temperature increase all the time for rcp8 5 scenario all the weather variables show an increasing trend and their growth rates are much more rapid than those under rcp4 5 scenario which agrees with the analysis of tao et al 2015 4 2 future runoff prediction the vic model was built to simulate the rainfall runoff relationship the dem data was used to calculate the stream networks and obtain the sub basin boundaries according to shigu panzhihua xiluodu xiangjiaba zhutuo cuntan and yichang stations the basin area was transformed into grids of 0 5 0 5 that can be distinguished by the vic model and the stream directions of each grid were calculated by the d8 algorithm then the vegetation and soil data including the types and parameters of vegetation and soil were extracted to each grid and the meteorological forcing data of weather stations were interpolated to each grid as well some of the input files are given in figs 6 8 and tables 5 and 6 the observed weather variables and runoff data from july 1 2014 to june 30 2017 was used for model calibration and the data from july 1 2017 to june 30 2018 was used for model validation in the calibration process the sensitivity of each parameter was analyzed the daily nash efficiency coefficient nse was selected as the evaluation index and s sen was the sensitivity index results of each station are shown in table 7 it is indicated from table 7 that the depth of the second layer of soil d 2 is the most sensitive parameter for each station and it is the only parameter whose average sensitivity index exceeds 1 this is because the water storage capacity of the second layer of soil has a significant impact on the runoff generation the greater the depth is the stronger the water storage capacity is among the other parameters the variable infiltration curve parameter b that can affect the rate of infiltration of water into the soil is also a key parameter affecting the runoff generation whose sensitivity is also large for the depth of the first layer of soil d 1 it can also affect the soil water storage however due to its small depth its sensitivity is less than d 2 and among the soil depths the depth of the third layer of soil d 3 is the least sensitive because it mainly affects the base flow and the seasonal changes of soil water content for the parameters ds dm and ws they mainly affect the base flow so they are less sensitive these results are similar to the studies by nijssen et al 2001 and su et al 2005 the daily nash efficiency coefficient nse monthly nash efficiency coefficient ns e mon and the relative error e all of each station were chosen as the evaluation indexes of model calibration simulation results in calibration and validation periods are shown in table 8 according to table 8 except for the yichang station the daily nash efficiency coefficients are all above 0 80 in terms of monthly nash efficiency coefficient all of the stations are above 0 90 except for the shigu station and the nash efficiency coefficients of some stations are more than 0 95 for the relative error between the observed and simulated flow except for the shigu station the values of each station are generally below 0 05 moreover for the yichang station the simulated flood peak is slightly delayed compared with the observed value which causes the error of daily runoff simulation however this error decreases and even can be ignored in monthly scale runoff prediction this is maybe because that in daily runoff simulation the errors accumulate in the process of runoff generation and concentration and reach a large value at the basin outlet for the shigu station compared with the observed values the simulated values are slightly smaller in the dry season and larger in the flood season this error is not large in daily scale simulation but the difference is amplified in monthly scale the monthly nash efficiency coefficient values are smaller than other stations in addition the lack of meteorological stations in the upper reaches of shigu station may be the cause of the simulation error generally the vic model has a good performance for the rainfall runoff simulation for the upper yangtze river basin and can be used to predict the future runoff sequences the daily observed and simulated flow processes at the yichang station are shown in fig 9 the future rainfall and temperature data are taken as inputs to the vic hydrological model and the future daily runoff data of each station were predicted by the proposed model then the changes of predicted runoff under different rcps scenarios at each station were analyzed the predicted runoff at the yichang station under different rcps scenarios are shown in fig 10 and table 9 as shown in table 9 all the predicted runoff values lightly reduce in 2020 s compared with the baseline runoff data for the periods of 2050 s and 2080 s the change rates of runoff are bigger than 0 except under rcp2 6 scenario under rcp2 6 scenario it shows that the trend of runoff increases first and then decreases under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the trends of runoff are similar both increase all the time however the change rate of runoff is smaller under rcp4 5 scenario whose maximum change rate is 1 8 while the maximum change rate is 14 0 under rcp8 5 scenario both occurred in 2080 s the trends of runoff under different rcps scenarios are similar to that of rainfall and temperatures 4 3 prediction of future hydropower generation capacity of reservoir system the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin which includes 62 reservoirs was established and the future runoff data simulated by the vic hydrological model were used as inputs of the optimal operation model to calculate the future hydropower generation of the reservoir system fig 11 shows the annual hydropower generation under different rcps scenarios and the average annual hydropower generation of reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin under different rcps scenarios are shown in table 10 it can be seen from fig 11 that there is a good positive correlation between the trend of hydropower generation and runoff under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios the slopes of fitting line of annual hydropower generation are small while the slope of rcp8 5 scenario is obviously large as shown in table 10 the predicted average annual hydropower generation of reservoirs from 2018 to 2100 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are 699 8 billion kw h 715 3 billion kw h and 747 7 billion kw h respectively for rcp2 6 scenario the hydropower generation of the reservoir system will increase by 3 7 from 2020 s to 2050 s and decrease by 1 66 from 2050 s to 2080 s which is relatively stable this trend of hydropower generation is the same as that of runoff evolution processes due to the close relationship between the hydropower generation and runoff under rcp4 5 scenario the hydropower generation of 2050 s and 2080 s increases by 2 1 and 2 3 respectively which shows a slowly increasing trend compared with their previous periods while under rcp8 5 scenario the hydropower generation of the basin shows a rapid growth trend increasing 3 4 in 2050 s compared to 2020 s and 11 7 in 2080 s compared to 2050 s results of the hydropower generation are consistent with the results of runoff simulation the higher the rcp scenario is the faster the runoff and hydropower generation increases the average future hydropower generation of each reservoir under different rcp scenarios are shown in fig 12 5 conclusions and discussions in this paper the gcms data was processed by sdsm downscaling method and the future climate evolution trends of weather variables under different rcps emission scenarios were predicted then the macro scale vic hydrological model of the upper yangtze river basin was established and the response of the runoff to climate change in the upper yangtze river basin were investigated the future runoff data were taken as input the maximum annual hydropower generation were taken as the objective function the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs including 62 reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin was established and the evolution trends of future hydropower generation under climate change were discussed the main results are summarized as follows 1 the general circulation models and statistical downscaling model can be used to predict the future meteorological data the predicted weather data can provide a reference for the study on temporal and spatial distribution of water resources in the upper yangtze river basin under climate change 2 the vic hydrological model also shows a good performance for daily and monthly runoff simulations for the upper yangtze river basin simulation results demonstrate the evolution trends and the uncertainties of future runoff under different scenarios especially the inflow situation and extreme hydrological phenomena such as floods and droughts are important input data for reservoir operation thus the runoff series predicted in this paper can provide data support for flood control water supply and hydropower generation operation of reservoirs under different scenarios 3 in this study the changes of the hydropower generation in the upper yangtze river basin in the future are small under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios while under rcp8 5 scenario there is a significant increasing trend it means that hydropower generation in the upper yangtze river basin is sensitive to climate change located in the west of china the upper yangtze river basin is a region with abundant water resources the increase of hydropower generation can promote the socioeconomic development of the region and the power can also be delivered to the surrounding and eastern regions where the energy is relatively scarce meanwhile the increase of hydropower means that the proportion of hydropower in the power system may increase the proportion of fossil energy such as coal may be reduced which not only protects the environment but also slows down the consumption of non renewable resources it is worth mentioning that at present the calculation of hydropower generation is mainly based on the built and under construction reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin with the further development of hydropower the hydropower generation in the upper yangtze river has a trend of continuous growth but the impact of climate change on hydropower generation is consistent and the current hydropower development in the upper yangtze river is close to the upper limit thus this paper can provide a reference for the hydropower generation prediction under climate change in the upper yangtze river the transferability of models used in this study to other regions was discussed the sdsm model is easy to build and has good transferability sun et al 2013 as for the vic model the transferability of hydrological models to other regions has always been a hot topic generally the underlying surface and hydrometeorology conditions of regions are quite different which lead to the difference of model parameters and makes it difficult to transfer hydrological models to other regions there are recommendations if someone want to embark on a future study using these models in a region similar to the case study for the sdsm model due to its good transferability it is important to pay attention to obtaining the historical meteorological data of the region as much as possible and ensure the reliability of the data to improve the effect of model calibration for the vic model there are the following suggestions if the hydrometeorology situation and underlying surface conditions of the target area are similar to those of the studied basin the vic model can be considered and the model parameters calibrated in the studied basin can be taken as the initial value for further calibration if their spatial location is close the target basin is a sub basin of the studied basin the model parameters can be obtained by averaging the calibrated parameters of immediate upstream and downstream sub basins of the studied basin or by interpolating the parameters values of several other sub basins with interpolation methods such as kriging merz and blöschl 2004 in addition the spatial resolution of dem data and the density of basin grids affect the precision of the model high resolution dem data and appropriate grid density can improve the precision of model and avoid excessive calculation for the operation model of large scale reservoirs scholars need to fully grasp the distribution of reservoirs and their characteristic information in the target basin which is the key factor for building the model there are still some limitations in this study which need to be improved in the further study when using sdsm model to downscale the gcms multiple gcms can be considered to improve the reliability of the prediction of future climate change and avoid the accidental errors caused by single model these errors are mainly because the applicability of the model in the study area is unknown this may lead to the deviation of prediction results such as the poor correlation between the predicted temperature data and the observed data the using of multiple gcms can avoid the potential accidental error of a single model but the regional applicability of various gcms is different improper gcms combination may affect the prediction results and the calculation of multiple gcms data is much larger using multiple gcms for climate prediction is more difficult than a single model at the same time past studies have shown that a single model suitable for the study area can also achieve good results after summarizing the previous researches we found that the canesm2 model has been widely used in china s climate prediction and has better applicability than most other models su et al 2013 chen et al 2011 chen and frauenfeld 2014 using only the canesm2 model was also adopted by many scholars wen et al 2013 lin et al 2018 tahir et al 2018 therefore the canesm2 model was selected to predict the future climate change in this paper results proved that its performance in this paper is also good in addition adding more applicable gcms model may further improve the reliability and stability of prediction besides due to the limitation of hydrometeorology data the data length used for calibration of vic model is relatively short and increasing the data length can help optimize the calibration results of the model in addition the changes in underlying surface conditions over time such as land use were not considered in the calibration of vic model in the future study the changes in underlying surface conditions can be considered properly to better simulate the true conditions of the basin

5301,climate change which impacts the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources has a significant influence on the future hydropower generation studying the future evolution pattern of hydropower generation under climate change is of great significance for the medium and long term hydropower prediction the objective of this paper is to predict the future hydropower generation of large scale reservoir groups under climate change the innovation of this paper is that the macro scale distributed hydrological model combined with the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs was proposed for hydropower generation prediction the established model considers the specific operation processes of large scale reservoir groups including 62 reservoirs in the case study first the statistical downscaling model sdsm was built and the evolution trend of future rainfall and temperature was predicted second the macro scale distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model was built to predict the future runoff finally the optimal operation generation model of large scale reservoir groups was established to predict the trends of hydropower generation under climate change results demonstrate that under rcp2 6 scenario there is no significant increase or decrease trend of hydropower generation in the future but under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the hydropower generation shows a growing trend and the increase trend under rcp8 5 scenario is more obvious than that under rcp4 5 scenario thus the development of hydropower generation is sensitive to climate change this study can provide a reference for the long term prediction of hydropower generation capacity in the upper yangtze river basin keywords hydropower generation prediction climate change large scale reservoirs vic hydrological model the upper yangtze river basin 1 introduction hydropower generation plays an irreplaceable role in modern power system feng et al 2017 chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in 2015 china s hydropower installed capacity exceeded 300 000 mw li et al 2018 active development of hydropower is an important way to ensure china s energy supply and promote low carbon emission reduction chen et al 2013 chang et al 2010 however climate change directly affects the meteorological factors such as temperature rainfall and evaporation and indirectly affects other factors such as soil moisture content and runoff etc which results in the redistribution of water resources in time and space and the increase or decrease of the total water resources chen et al 2010 huntington 2006 shi and wang 2015 further climate change has a profound impact on the hydropower generation capacity of basins fan et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to predict runoff and hydropower generation under climate change the existing methods for predicting the future runoff can be divided into statistical and data driven approaches and physically based approaches solomatine et al 2007 chen et al 2014a nourani et al 2014 the former methods mainly include classical regression analysis back propagation neural network nonlinear time series analysis and fuzzy mathematical mothed etc which forecasts future runoff by establishing the statistical relationship between weather and runoff data chen et al 2018 chu et al 2016 chen et al 2014b the physically based approaches are based on the hydrological model to simulate the relationship between rainfall and runoff and deduce the evolution trend of runoff through the future rainfall those methods have certain physical mechanisms because they take into accounts the characteristics of atmospheric circulation basin runoff generation and confluence which are now praised by the academia nilawar and waikar 2019 liu et al 2015a chen et al 2012 experts and scholars have conducted a series of studies on the prediction of hydropower generation under climate change based on these runoff prediction results some scholars have carried out the prediction of hydropower generation under climate change based on empirical models such as simplified reservoir regulations and regression models van vliet et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2016 kao et al 2015 for example liu et al 2016 predicted the future runoff and estimated developed hydropower potential dhp under climate change based on a kind of reservoir regulation rules kao et al 2015 built a regression model between runoff and hydropower generation to predict the future hydropower generation although these studies have considered the impact of climate change they did not consider the specific process of reservoir operation in fact the hydropower generation capacity is not only related to input factors such as hydrometeorology information but also depends on the basic characteristics of hydropower stations madani et al 2014 considering the reservoir operation process the hydropower generation process may be simulated more precisely qin et al 2020 some scholars have predicted the hydropower generation of single reservoir considering the specific reservoir operation process under climate change qin et al 2020 yang et al 2015 raje and mujumdar 2010 raje and mujumdar 2010 studied the response of reservoir hydropower generation under climate change for india s hirakud reservoir yang et al 2015 predicted the hydropower generation and water supply of danjiangkou reservoir under climate change by an adaptive multi objective operation model however these studies only took into accounts the specific operation process of a single reservoir since the hydropower prediction is a type of dynamic time delay and nonlinear modeling problem especially with the rapid increase of the number of hydropower stations when establishing the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs there is a problem of the cruse of dimensionality zhou et al 2018 moreover since the intelligent algorithm can t solve the local convergence problem it is difficult to establish a mathematical model for predicting the large scale reservoirs hydropower generation considering climate change and the characteristics of reservoirs liu et al 2015b afshar 2013 moreno 2009 li et al 2014a in order to alleviate the influence of cruse of dimensionality and simplify the modeling process the existing hydropower generation capacity prediction methods mainly focus on the improved dp algorithms such as the discrete differential dynamic programming dddp and the progressive optimality algorithm poa cheng et al 2014 howson and sancho 1975 the decomposition coordination dc is also an effective approach for the optimal operation of large scale reservoir groups which can decompose a large system into many subsystems and reduce the difficulty of single system optimal operation cohen 1978 li et al 2014b however the hydropower generation prediction considering climate change and the specific operation processes of large scale reservoirs still needs to be further studied the objective of this paper is to propose a future hydropower generation prediction method for large scale reservoirs considering climate change and specific reservoir operation processes the innovation of this paper is summarized as follows the runoff prediction based on macro scale distributed hydrological model combined with the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs was proposed to predict the future hydropower generation under climate change second the macro scale distributed vic hydrological model of the whole upper yangtze river basin with an area of one million square kilometers was first established third the optimal operation model of large scale reservoir groups including 62 reservoirs was built the proposed method overcomes the limitation that the current generation prediction methods did not consider the specific operation process or only consider the operation processes of single reservoir the main framework of the study is as follows first the data of the general circulation models gcms under different representative concentration pathways rcps emission scenarios was used in this paper and the statistical downscaling model was employed for downscaling the data of gcms and predicting the future evolution trend of rainfall and temperature second the macro scale distributed vic hydrological model was established to simulate the response of future runoff to climate change third the optimal operation model of large scale reservoir groups in the upper yangtze river basin was established and based on the simulated runoff data the trends of future hydropower generation in the basin under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios were predicted 2 methodologies 2 1 future rainfall and temperature prediction general circulation models can provide reliable long term future climate data according to atmospheric circulation mechanism the fifth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 collected the results of nearly 60 climate models from 23 climate model groups worldwide klausmeyer and shaw 2009 in this paper the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 developed by canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis was selected and its future climate simulation results under three emission scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were obtained studies show that the canesm2 model can well simulate climate change in china zhang et al 2016 birkinshaw et al 2017 chen and frauenfeld 2014 because the gcms are large scale models it is necessary to be downscaled to characterize the atmospheric motion laws at small and medium scales downscaling methods can be divided into two categories namely statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling wood et al 2004 zorita and von storch 1999 since the dynamical downscaling method is complex the statistical downscaling method was widely used in hydrology because of easier construction less calculation work and more flexible form charles et al 1999 the sdsm model was selected to downscale the canesm2 model in order to transform the large scale atmospheric motion information into climate information of the study area in this paper 2 1 1 the principle of the statistical downscaling model the principle of sdsm model is establishment of the statistical relationship between gcm derived predictor variables such as atmospheric pressure humidity and wind speed and the weather variables of the study area such as daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily rainfall based on multiple regression analysis method then the gcm derived predictor variables were taken as inputs of the sdsm model to generate future temperature and rainfall sequences of the study area the core of sdsm model is to establish the statistical relationship model between the predictor variable s and the weather variable x whose equation is given by 1 x f s where f is the statistical relationship between the large scale predictor variable set s and the local weather variable x the performance of the sdsm model can be evaluated by the determination coefficient which is given by 2 r 2 i 1 t x obs i x

x sim are the mean observed and predicted values of the output variable 2 1 2 screening of predictor variables of sdsm model the screening of predictor variables is very important for the successful construction of sdsm model selecting the predictor variables with higher correlations with weather variables can help improve the accuracy of simulation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily rainfall were chosen as the weather variables table 1 gives the predictor variables to be screened and their physical meanings historical data of 26 predictor variables from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and historical weather variables data of the study area can be used as inputs to the sdsm model the screen variables module of the sdsm model was employed to screen appropriate predictor variables based on this module the statistical relationship between predictor variables and weather variables can be established then users can select the appropriate predictor variables based on the correlation analysis between each predictor variable and weather variable and the correlation measuring methods mainly include partial correlation analysis seasonal correlation analysis and scatterplots and there are several optimization principles need to be noted in the process of selection first the predictor variables should be able to reflect the physical mechanism of the change of weather variables second the results of correlation analysis between them should be good third the selected predictors should be independent or weakly correlated last the predictor variables should be common to gcms data and ncep data wilby et al 1998 2 1 3 future weather variables prediction during this section the future daily rainfall and daily temperature were simulated according to the established multiple linear regression model between predictor variables and weather variables for the simulation of daily rainfall it can be divided into two parts the simulation of rainfall incidence and the simulation of precipitation the regression equation of rainfall probability is as follows wilby et al 1999 3 o t α 0 i 1 n α i s i α t 1 o t 1 where o t 1 and o t are rainfall probabilities at day t 1 and t α 0 and α i are parameters estimated using linear least squares regression s i is predictor variable i α t 1 is the regression parameter of day t 1 whether rainfall occurs is determined by a random number l t between 0 and 1 that obeys the uniform distribution if o t is greater than l t there will be rainfall in day t for the value of precipitation the equation is given by wilby et al 1999 4 u t f exp ϕ β 0 i 1 n β i s i ε where u t is the precipitation value of day t f exp is the empirical distribution function of precipitation value at day t ϕ is the normal cumulative distribution function β 0 and β i are parameters estimated using linear least squares regression ε is random or modelling error for the temperature simulation it is not necessary to simulate the possibility of occurrence but only to simulate the random change of temperature value whose calculation is similar to precipitation srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 after the calibration of the sdsm model the gcms data under different rcps emission scenarios in the future are used as the inputs to the scenario generator module of the sdsm model the future weather variables data under different rcps emission scenarios can be generated 2 2 rainfall runoff simulation based on the vic hydrological model in this study the vic hydrological model was used to simulate the future runoff this model is a macro scale distributed hydrological model which is generally applied to basins with an area of tens of thousands of square kilometers the vic model can simulate vegetation transpiration soil evaporation canopy evaporation snow accumulation and ablation soil freeze thaw etc thus it comprehensively characterizes the transfer paths and processes of various water bodies the main modules of the vic model include evapotranspiration runoff generation and runoff confluence the model transfers the whole basin into many grids calculates the runoff generation and then converts the output data of each grid into the flow process of the outlet section of the basin through the confluence module the input files of the vic model include soil data vegetation data meteorological forcing data flow direction data basin characteristics data and global parameter files etc parameters of the vic model which need to be calibrated are shown in table 2 after model calibration the future weather data predicted by the sdsm model was used as inputs to the vic hydrological model to simulate the future runoff the univariate search technique was used to calibrate the parameters of vic model and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the relative error eall of the observed and simulated flow data were chosen to assess the performance of the model 5 nse 1 t 1 t q obs

is the mean value of observed streamflow data in the process of parameter calibration the sensitivity analysis method based on perturbation analysis was used to analyze the sensitivity of parameters choi and choi 1992 the formula is given as follows 7 s sen 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 r i r i 1 r i i 1 p i p i 1 p i i 1 where s sen is the sensitivity index n is the number of tests for the selected parameter r i and p i are the evaluation index and the parameter value in the i th test respectively r i i 1 and p i i 1 are the average value of the evaluation index and the parameter value in the i th and i 1th tests respectively the larger the sensitivity index value is the more sensitive the parameter is if the sensitivity index value is more than 1 it means that this parameter is a sensitive parameter 2 3 establishment of the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs the objective of the optimal operation model is to maximize the annual hydropower generation of large scale reservoirs the future runoff data simulated by the vic model under different carbon emission scenarios were used as the inputs to the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs dp is a powerful method in solving operation problem however it is not applicable in this problem because of the curse of dimensionality so the discrete differential dynamic programming dddp combined with the large scale system decomposed coordinating lssdc method proposed by li et al 2014 were employed to solve the optimal models in order to deal with the dimensionality problems the detailed information of the model is given below 1 objective function maximization of the annual hydropower generation 8 max e i 1 s j 1 t n ij δ t n ij a i h ij q ij n where e is the annual hydropower generation of large scale

operation model the future runoff sequences predicted by the vic model were used as the inputs of the operation model to calculate the hydropower generation of the large scale reservoirs 3 case study the yangtze river originated from the geladandong peak of the tanggula mountains in the upper basin its main tributaries include yalong river minjiang river wujiang river and jialing river the upper yangtze river basin was selected as a case study which located in the southwest of china it is a big basin of one million square kilometers which accounts for about 10 of china s land area and involves nine provinces municipalities and autonomous regions the topography of the basin is diverse including plateau the qinghai tibet plateau basin the sichuan basin etc affected by the subtropical monsoon and the qinghai tibet plateau high cold climate rainfall and hydropower resources here are abundant and meanwhile the climate here is very sensitive yichang station is the outlet of the upper yangtze river basin and there are another six stations along the yangtze river namely shigu panzhihua xiluodu xiangjiaba zhutuo and cuntan stations considered in this study as shown in fig 1 the historical ncep re analysis data of prediction variables https www esrl noaa gov the historical rainfall and temperature data of the basin derived from the china meteorological data center http data cma cn and the future prediction variables data of canesm2 under three different emission scenarios downloaded from the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis https www canada ca en html were used for the establishment of the sdsm model the historical rainfall data temperature data runoff data of the basin and the dem elevation data of 30 km spatial resolution from geospatial data http www gscloud cn vegetation data from the university of maryland http glcf umd edu data and soil data from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations http www fao org geonetwork were used for the establishment of the vic model and the characteristic curves of 62 reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin were collected to establish the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs the study area and the scheme of the large reservoir system are given in figs 1 and 2 4 results and discussions first the sdsm model was established to predict the rainfall and temperature sequences under different emission scenarios second the vic hydrological model was established to predict the future runoff and third the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs was established to predict the future hydropower generation ability of the study area 4 1 future rainfall and temperature prediction the ncep re analysis data the predictor variables and the historical rainfall and temperature data the weather variables were taken as inputs of sdsm model the statistical relationship between the predictor variables and the weather variables were established based on sdsm model the daily data from 1970 to 1999 were used for model calibration and the daily data from 2000 to 2005 were used for model validation then the statistical relationships between the predictor variables and basin s rainfall and temperature data were determined the determination coefficients r 2 fitted curves slopes a and root mean square errors rmse of the observed and simulated monthly data at each station in both calibration and validation periods were calculated as shown in table 3 and figs 3 to 4 it can be seen from figs 3 and 4 and table 3 that the simulation results of temperature at each station are excellent in both calibration and validation periods most of the determination coefficients are above 0 95 and the slopes of the curves are within the range of 0 901 to 1 013 and the rmse values of daily maximum and minimum temperatures at each station are between 0 878 1 481 and 0 697 1 403 respectively the simulation results of daily minimum temperature show a better performance than those of daily minimum temperature for its determination coefficients are generally higher in both calibration and validation periods meanwhile the rmse values of daily minimum temperature at most stations are also lower than that those of daily maximum temperature in both calibration and validation periods for rainfall simulation the result is not as good as that of temperatures since the rainfall simulation is more complex and discrete zhang et al 2016 hassan et al 2014 the determination coefficients of rainfall at most stations reach 0 75 in both calibration and validation periods except for zhutuo station and the slopes of the curves are within the range of 0 746 to 1 090 rmse values of rainfall simulation at each station are acceptable which are within 10 of the observed precipitation in both calibration and validation periods for zhutuo station the rainfall simulation results are not so good which may be affected by regional factors such as topography for the whole basin the performance of the sdsm model is also good the determination coefficients of rainfall are all above 0 90 and the determination coefficients of maximum and minimum temperatures are generally above 0 95 in both calibration and validation periods the rmse values of the whole basin are also lower than those of most single stations for rainfall simulation the rmse values are within 5 of the observed precipitation and for temperature simulation the rmse values are less than 1 0 the variation range of monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures were within 0 15 and the variation range of monthly rainfall is from 2mm to 11 4 mm in calibration period in general the simulation results of the sdsm model are perfect and it and can be used for the future climate simulation of the study area then the future periods were divided into three stages namely 2020 s 2018 2044 2050 s 2045 2071 and 2080 s 2072 2100 the canesm2 predictor variables data from 2018 to 2100 were taken as inputs of the sdsm model to predict the daily rainfall daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the future period under different emission scenarios the predicted annual weather variables of the whole basin are given in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the predicted weather variables data are fluctuated in different degrees the rainfall data under rcp8 5 scenario shows a significant increasing trend while the rainfall data under rcp2 6 scenario and rcp4 5 scenario shows a slight increasing trend the trends of the temperature are similar to those of rainfall moreover it is demonstrated that the main variation of rainfall during a year is basically concentrated in flood season to the contrary the variations of temperature is opposite which change significantly in dry season these results are similar to those of previous studies zhang et al 2016 taking the weather variables from 1970 to 2005 as baseline period the trends of rainfall and temperature in each future period were analyzed and results of the whole basin are given in table 4 as shown in table 4 the maximum change rate of rainfall is19 90 which occurred in 2080 s and the maximum change rates of maximum and minimum daily temperatures are 8 24 and 18 74 respectively both occurred in 2080 s for rcp2 6 scenario the trends of rainfall and the temperature increase first and then decrease and the decrease of temperature is slightly larger for rcp4 5 scenario the rainfall and the temperature increase all the time for rcp8 5 scenario all the weather variables show an increasing trend and their growth rates are much more rapid than those under rcp4 5 scenario which agrees with the analysis of tao et al 2015 4 2 future runoff prediction the vic model was built to simulate the rainfall runoff relationship the dem data was used to calculate the stream networks and obtain the sub basin boundaries according to shigu panzhihua xiluodu xiangjiaba zhutuo cuntan and yichang stations the basin area was transformed into grids of 0 5 0 5 that can be distinguished by the vic model and the stream directions of each grid were calculated by the d8 algorithm then the vegetation and soil data including the types and parameters of vegetation and soil were extracted to each grid and the meteorological forcing data of weather stations were interpolated to each grid as well some of the input files are given in figs 6 8 and tables 5 and 6 the observed weather variables and runoff data from july 1 2014 to june 30 2017 was used for model calibration and the data from july 1 2017 to june 30 2018 was used for model validation in the calibration process the sensitivity of each parameter was analyzed the daily nash efficiency coefficient nse was selected as the evaluation index and s sen was the sensitivity index results of each station are shown in table 7 it is indicated from table 7 that the depth of the second layer of soil d 2 is the most sensitive parameter for each station and it is the only parameter whose average sensitivity index exceeds 1 this is because the water storage capacity of the second layer of soil has a significant impact on the runoff generation the greater the depth is the stronger the water storage capacity is among the other parameters the variable infiltration curve parameter b that can affect the rate of infiltration of water into the soil is also a key parameter affecting the runoff generation whose sensitivity is also large for the depth of the first layer of soil d 1 it can also affect the soil water storage however due to its small depth its sensitivity is less than d 2 and among the soil depths the depth of the third layer of soil d 3 is the least sensitive because it mainly affects the base flow and the seasonal changes of soil water content for the parameters ds dm and ws they mainly affect the base flow so they are less sensitive these results are similar to the studies by nijssen et al 2001 and su et al 2005 the daily nash efficiency coefficient nse monthly nash efficiency coefficient ns e mon and the relative error e all of each station were chosen as the evaluation indexes of model calibration simulation results in calibration and validation periods are shown in table 8 according to table 8 except for the yichang station the daily nash efficiency coefficients are all above 0 80 in terms of monthly nash efficiency coefficient all of the stations are above 0 90 except for the shigu station and the nash efficiency coefficients of some stations are more than 0 95 for the relative error between the observed and simulated flow except for the shigu station the values of each station are generally below 0 05 moreover for the yichang station the simulated flood peak is slightly delayed compared with the observed value which causes the error of daily runoff simulation however this error decreases and even can be ignored in monthly scale runoff prediction this is maybe because that in daily runoff simulation the errors accumulate in the process of runoff generation and concentration and reach a large value at the basin outlet for the shigu station compared with the observed values the simulated values are slightly smaller in the dry season and larger in the flood season this error is not large in daily scale simulation but the difference is amplified in monthly scale the monthly nash efficiency coefficient values are smaller than other stations in addition the lack of meteorological stations in the upper reaches of shigu station may be the cause of the simulation error generally the vic model has a good performance for the rainfall runoff simulation for the upper yangtze river basin and can be used to predict the future runoff sequences the daily observed and simulated flow processes at the yichang station are shown in fig 9 the future rainfall and temperature data are taken as inputs to the vic hydrological model and the future daily runoff data of each station were predicted by the proposed model then the changes of predicted runoff under different rcps scenarios at each station were analyzed the predicted runoff at the yichang station under different rcps scenarios are shown in fig 10 and table 9 as shown in table 9 all the predicted runoff values lightly reduce in 2020 s compared with the baseline runoff data for the periods of 2050 s and 2080 s the change rates of runoff are bigger than 0 except under rcp2 6 scenario under rcp2 6 scenario it shows that the trend of runoff increases first and then decreases under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the trends of runoff are similar both increase all the time however the change rate of runoff is smaller under rcp4 5 scenario whose maximum change rate is 1 8 while the maximum change rate is 14 0 under rcp8 5 scenario both occurred in 2080 s the trends of runoff under different rcps scenarios are similar to that of rainfall and temperatures 4 3 prediction of future hydropower generation capacity of reservoir system the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin which includes 62 reservoirs was established and the future runoff data simulated by the vic hydrological model were used as inputs of the optimal operation model to calculate the future hydropower generation of the reservoir system fig 11 shows the annual hydropower generation under different rcps scenarios and the average annual hydropower generation of reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin under different rcps scenarios are shown in table 10 it can be seen from fig 11 that there is a good positive correlation between the trend of hydropower generation and runoff under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios the slopes of fitting line of annual hydropower generation are small while the slope of rcp8 5 scenario is obviously large as shown in table 10 the predicted average annual hydropower generation of reservoirs from 2018 to 2100 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are 699 8 billion kw h 715 3 billion kw h and 747 7 billion kw h respectively for rcp2 6 scenario the hydropower generation of the reservoir system will increase by 3 7 from 2020 s to 2050 s and decrease by 1 66 from 2050 s to 2080 s which is relatively stable this trend of hydropower generation is the same as that of runoff evolution processes due to the close relationship between the hydropower generation and runoff under rcp4 5 scenario the hydropower generation of 2050 s and 2080 s increases by 2 1 and 2 3 respectively which shows a slowly increasing trend compared with their previous periods while under rcp8 5 scenario the hydropower generation of the basin shows a rapid growth trend increasing 3 4 in 2050 s compared to 2020 s and 11 7 in 2080 s compared to 2050 s results of the hydropower generation are consistent with the results of runoff simulation the higher the rcp scenario is the faster the runoff and hydropower generation increases the average future hydropower generation of each reservoir under different rcp scenarios are shown in fig 12 5 conclusions and discussions in this paper the gcms data was processed by sdsm downscaling method and the future climate evolution trends of weather variables under different rcps emission scenarios were predicted then the macro scale vic hydrological model of the upper yangtze river basin was established and the response of the runoff to climate change in the upper yangtze river basin were investigated the future runoff data were taken as input the maximum annual hydropower generation were taken as the objective function the optimal operation model of large scale reservoirs including 62 reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin was established and the evolution trends of future hydropower generation under climate change were discussed the main results are summarized as follows 1 the general circulation models and statistical downscaling model can be used to predict the future meteorological data the predicted weather data can provide a reference for the study on temporal and spatial distribution of water resources in the upper yangtze river basin under climate change 2 the vic hydrological model also shows a good performance for daily and monthly runoff simulations for the upper yangtze river basin simulation results demonstrate the evolution trends and the uncertainties of future runoff under different scenarios especially the inflow situation and extreme hydrological phenomena such as floods and droughts are important input data for reservoir operation thus the runoff series predicted in this paper can provide data support for flood control water supply and hydropower generation operation of reservoirs under different scenarios 3 in this study the changes of the hydropower generation in the upper yangtze river basin in the future are small under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios while under rcp8 5 scenario there is a significant increasing trend it means that hydropower generation in the upper yangtze river basin is sensitive to climate change located in the west of china the upper yangtze river basin is a region with abundant water resources the increase of hydropower generation can promote the socioeconomic development of the region and the power can also be delivered to the surrounding and eastern regions where the energy is relatively scarce meanwhile the increase of hydropower means that the proportion of hydropower in the power system may increase the proportion of fossil energy such as coal may be reduced which not only protects the environment but also slows down the consumption of non renewable resources it is worth mentioning that at present the calculation of hydropower generation is mainly based on the built and under construction reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin with the further development of hydropower the hydropower generation in the upper yangtze river has a trend of continuous growth but the impact of climate change on hydropower generation is consistent and the current hydropower development in the upper yangtze river is close to the upper limit thus this paper can provide a reference for the hydropower generation prediction under climate change in the upper yangtze river the transferability of models used in this study to other regions was discussed the sdsm model is easy to build and has good transferability sun et al 2013 as for the vic model the transferability of hydrological models to other regions has always been a hot topic generally the underlying surface and hydrometeorology conditions of regions are quite different which lead to the difference of model parameters and makes it difficult to transfer hydrological models to other regions there are recommendations if someone want to embark on a future study using these models in a region similar to the case study for the sdsm model due to its good transferability it is important to pay attention to obtaining the historical meteorological data of the region as much as possible and ensure the reliability of the data to improve the effect of model calibration for the vic model there are the following suggestions if the hydrometeorology situation and underlying surface conditions of the target area are similar to those of the studied basin the vic model can be considered and the model parameters calibrated in the studied basin can be taken as the initial value for further calibration if their spatial location is close the target basin is a sub basin of the studied basin the model parameters can be obtained by averaging the calibrated parameters of immediate upstream and downstream sub basins of the studied basin or by interpolating the parameters values of several other sub basins with interpolation methods such as kriging merz and blöschl 2004 in addition the spatial resolution of dem data and the density of basin grids affect the precision of the model high resolution dem data and appropriate grid density can improve the precision of model and avoid excessive calculation for the operation model of large scale reservoirs scholars need to fully grasp the distribution of reservoirs and their characteristic information in the target basin which is the key factor for building the model there are still some limitations in this study which need to be improved in the further study when using sdsm model to downscale the gcms multiple gcms can be considered to improve the reliability of the prediction of future climate change and avoid the accidental errors caused by single model these errors are mainly because the applicability of the model in the study area is unknown this may lead to the deviation of prediction results such as the poor correlation between the predicted temperature data and the observed data the using of multiple gcms can avoid the potential accidental error of a single model but the regional applicability of various gcms is different improper gcms combination may affect the prediction results and the calculation of multiple gcms data is much larger using multiple gcms for climate prediction is more difficult than a single model at the same time past studies have shown that a single model suitable for the study area can also achieve good results after summarizing the previous researches we found that the canesm2 model has been widely used in china s climate prediction and has better applicability than most other models su et al 2013 chen et al 2011 chen and frauenfeld 2014 using only the canesm2 model was also adopted by many scholars wen et al 2013 lin et al 2018 tahir et al 2018 therefore the canesm2 model was selected to predict the future climate change in this paper results proved that its performance in this paper is also good in addition adding more applicable gcms model may further improve the reliability and stability of prediction besides due to the limitation of hydrometeorology data the data length used for calibration of vic model is relatively short and increasing the data length can help optimize the calibration results of the model in addition the changes in underlying surface conditions over time such as land use were not considered in the calibration of vic model in the future study the changes in underlying surface conditions can be considered properly to better simulate the true conditions of the basin

5302,a global challenge for water resource management in rivers worldwide is ensuring water supply reliability satisfies consumptive and environmental demands high variability in water supply water policy and management decisions and uncertainty about the effects of climate change compound this challenge understanding factors driving water allocations and consequences for water users and the environment is essential rainfall and streamflow traditionally drive allocations yet the influence of water management decisions are often overlooked because they are complex rarely codified and dependent on the regional context we compared the relative influences of water management climate and the river system characteristics including demand and water storage infrastructure on regulated and unregulated water allocations in two regulated rivers with large dams for water supply to towns irrigated agriculture and wetlands of international significance gwydir and macquarie rivers of the murray darling basin southeastern australia using hydrological simulation models and regression based sensitivity analyses under an historical and drier climate water management decisions influenced regulated water allocations explaining 23 to 52 of the variance considerably more than unregulated water allocations explaining 2 for regulated water allocations water management decisions and the river system were more important than a plausible change in climate while for unregulated water allocations the river system and climate change were dominant drivers changing management rules alone could vary long term water allocations by between 6 and 0 1 in the gwydir river and between 4 and 22 in the macquarie river management rules which allocated future inflows i e credit model were more likely to fail in a drying environment with projected reductions in runoff compared to rules where only water in storage is allocated i e debit model management rules differed despite both river systems being governed by a single management agency under the same legislative and policy framework more systematic approaches to justify water management rules and greater transparency in their influence on water allocations are critical for maximizing the benefits to water users and river health and for managing risks to water supply in a variable and changing climate keywords water allocation water availability water supply water resource management risk assessment sensitivity analysis environmental flow murray darling basin climate change 1 introduction river systems are under growing pressure with water resource development increasing competition and reducing water security for communities and ecosystems around the world vorosmarty et al 2000 nilsson et al 2005 this problem is usually managed by regulating water use from rivers through allocations for urban and industry supply hydroelectricity irrigation and the environment arthington et al 2006 river regulation in over half of the world s large rivers has modified water availability nilsson et al 2005 with storages dams capturing holding and releasing water through controlled releases to users and the environment while dams have provided important benefits for water users they have also caused considerable global environmental damage poff and zimmerman 2010 carlisle et al 2011 there is potential to partially restore degraded river systems through strategic management of dams pittock and hartmann 2009 poff and schmidt 2016 this requires understanding the availability of water its storage in dams patterns of demand and operational supply for both extractive and environmental purposes spatial and temporal variability in water availability is driven by complex natural factors including hydrology water demand geographical features of the river system including land use topography and land cover and by human factors including population growth water resource development and river management twort et al 2000 vorosmarty et al 2000 ipcc 2013 these drivers can constantly and rapidly change with consequences for water dependent livelihoods industries and freshwater ecosystems in many contexts hydrological responses are not stationary despite global water resource management systems often assuming so milly et al 2008 there are a suite of identifiable drivers affecting water allocations which can be estimated to determine how their changing patterns affect water availability this would allow for clear assessment of risks to water security identification of opportunities for adverse impacts to be mitigated informed trade in water markets and evaluation of trade offs between extractive users and the environment naiman et al 2002 hollinshead 2005 viscito 2009 most of our understanding of drivers of water allocations is based on dam storage levels driven by inflows catchment size land cover and geomorphology which are reflected through rainfall runoff relationships singh 1997 li et al 2012 climate uncertainty the stochastic sequence of meteorologic drivers e g short term fluctuations in precipitation evaporation and solar radiation also drives the streamflow hydrograph singh 1997 soltani et al 2008 changes in precipitation and evaporation are affected in the long term by climate change amplified in runoff chiew and mcmahon 2002 arnell 2004 water allocations are also dependent on spatially variable river system features including land cover geomorphology demand water infrastructure and water management objectives hirji and davis 2009 water allocations may also be influenced by catchment specific physical constraints such as storage capacity outlet size spillway capacity and floodplain infrastructure there are integrated assessments at local regional and global scales which quantify the relative influences of the river system and climate drivers on streamflow or related indices including water availability li et al 2012 williams et al 2012 water stress alcamo et al 2007 and flow regimes arrigoni et al 2010 water availability is not simply a function of physical drivers and releases of water from dams other potential factors include the role of river regulation and management in driving water availability for water users and the environment water management infrastructure and river operation may significantly affect storage volume potentially changing evaporation and unregulated releases spills affecting the volume of water allocated to users and the environment quantifying influences of such management is difficult because of complex interactions feedbacks and dependencies among elements of shared water storage systems some studies examining the influence of management on water availability focus on optimising water yield for extractive use ignoring environmental needs for water dependent ecosystems for example changing from single to multi reservoir river operations in the brazos river basin in texas resulted in increased water yield by 6 wurbs and carriere 1993 in a hypothetical river system policy choices related to economic benefit and risk of system failure varied water allocations wang and huang 2012 given the complex interactions integrated analyses combining climate management demand and water infrastructure drivers across different river systems are critical for understanding the complex and confounding influences of all drivers not just abiotic ones on water availability for multiple users and the environment such assessment is necessary to inform opportunities and trade offs supporting water management objectives for environmental and extractive uses our aims were to 1 examine the interactive influence of the river system characteristics climate change and management rules on water availability and 2 evaluate management scenarios in providing water allocations to users and the environment we used global regression based sensitivity analyses to quantify the relative influence of drivers on water availability based on daily hydrological simulation models run over a 110 year period we compared two semi arid regulated river systems in australia s murray darling basin the gwydir and macquarie rivers where water is provided for irrigated agriculture and wetlands of international importance ramsar 2012 despite local differences in water management these two rivers are managed by the same state agency and governed by the same overarching legislative and policy drivers allowing identification of idiosyncratic influences of management decisions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the gwydir and macquarie rivers in australia s murray darling basin are characteristic dryland rivers differing in catchment area and hydrology they flow northwest from the great dividing range travelling through well defined channels until they reach semi arid floodplains fig 1 where they form a maze of interconnected streams ephemeral lagoons distributary creeks and anabranching channels some of which are ramsar listed gwydir wetlands and macquarie marshes while others are usually grazed by livestock frequent and complex flood pulses and subsequent drying drive biological diversity ecosystem processes and ecosystem services of semi permanent wetlands brock et al 2006 average surface water availability in the gwydir river 782 gl y is lower than the macquarie river 1567 gl y mainly reflecting a smaller catchment area csiro 2007 csiro 2008 flow regimes are highly variable particularly in the gwydir river with headwaters exposed to tropical weather systems blandford et al 1977 flow regimes are almost entirely regulated by major dams with copeton dam 1362 gl capacity capturing 93 of upstream inflow and windamere dam 368 gl and burrendong dam 1188 gl capturing 94 and 91 of upstream inflow respectively fig 1 there are also minor dams e g weirs to provide head and for water supply to towns and irrigated agriculture delivered by channel networks steinfeld and kingsford 2013 tributaries downstream of dams deliver unregulated flows considerably higher in the gwydir river 189 gl y than the macquarie river 67 gl y csiro 2007 2008 the major land cover is dryland pasture for livestock grazing mixed with irrigated and dryland cropping on the floodplains csiro 2007 2008 the state government is largely responsibility for water management in the gwydir and macquarie rivers influenced by the federal government through the commonwealth water act 2007 and the murray darling basin plan water management objectives are defined through state statutory water sharing plans both the gwydir and macquarie plans promote environmental social economic and cultural objectives despite being stated differently the objectives of the gwydir plan are to protect maintain and enhance environmental values provide for equitable water sharing between all uses minimise impacts of extraction improve water quality facilitate water trade preserve basic water rights ensure extractions are within agreed limits and preserve and enhance cultural and heritage values nsw government 2016a the objectives of the macquarie plan are to maintain or enhance the ecological functions and values support a sustainable regional economy protect social values and benefits provided by the river system and recognise and respect aboriginal cultural responsibilities and obligations to the landscape nsw government 2016b most of these objectives are given effect through management rules and shares of water made available for consumptive and environmental use nsw government 2016a b 2 2 modelling climate drivers we modelled three climate drivers rainfall evaporation and flow for their short term variability we randomly generated 100 probable daily time series of rainfall at gauges in each river system we sampled non parametric distributions of observed daily rainfall occurrence and amounts 1900 2010 gap filled and extended using an inverse distance weighted interpolation mehrotra and sharma 2007 we maintained spatial correlation among multiple rainfall stations gwydir 12 macquarie 15 fig 1 preserving high and low frequency rainfall variability 90 365 and 1000 days mehrotra and sharma 2007 we generated 100 daily time series of evaporation using k nearest neighbor interpolation to reflect the variability of the rainfall time series shi et al 2007 and derived daily dam inflow and tributary flows gwydir halls creek myall creek horton river macquarie bell river talbragar river fig 1 using sacramento rainfall runoff sub basin models burnash 1995 linked to a calibrated river system simulation model commonly used in australia called the integrated quality and quantity model iqqm simons et al 1996 we used dam inflow and tributary flow to represent hydrological uncertainty in our sensitivity regression analysis 100 values each averaged annually ensuring they were uncorrelated and independent pearson s correlation coefficient ρ 0 42 mean annual runoff is projected to reduce under climate change in the gwydir by 9 csiro 2007 and in the macquarie by 6 by 2030 current development scenario c csiro 2008 we used three potential levels of inflow reductions in our sensitivity analysis historical 0 moderate 5 and plausible 10 reductions in inflow applied to the 100 dam inflow and tributary flow realisations we ensured the assumption of linearity was met by comparing differences in water allocations among scenarios with all other factors held constant 2 3 modelling river system including demand side drivers river system drivers reflected the biophysical river system characteristics of the gwydir and macquarie rivers and demand side factors which were valley specific biophysical characteristics reflected drainage area land cover and water infrastructure including dam outlet and spillway capacity these were incorporated in rainfall runoff and river system simulation models including surface soil moisture states flow routing transmission losses and storage parameters see burnash 1995 simons et al 1996 steinfeld et al 2015 demand was modelled based on historical patterns at a daily time step for three separate use groups environment which is retained in the river system for desired environmental benefit extraction which is diverted from a water source for consumptive use and river operation to support achievement of water resource management objectives environmental water demand was triggered by natural cues of flows in tributaries downstream of dams the demand time series was based on a tributary activated demand approach where environmental flows were triggered by natural flows in tributaries downstream of major storages provided water allocations were available harman and stewardson 2005 we assumed all flow requirements were met by dam releases and not from the tributaries downstream of dams extractive demand was modelled for three key user groups domestic use livestock water utilities industry high value irrigation e g horticulture and staple crop irrigation e g grains fibre including cotton individual extractive water users were lumped as a single average user for simplicity dudley 1988 parameters for staple crop irrigation were percentages of available water reflecting dependency on water availability and mean monthly distribution of historical use other extractive demands were based on fixed volumes we assumed demand relationships were constant through time additional volumes of water for river operation provided safe reliable and efficient supply of water to users and the environment this included 1 dead storage the inaccessible volume of water below the storage outlet 2 minimum flows at specific points along channels 3 water to mitigate floods through controlled releases of flows from storage 4 transfer of water between storages to replenish a downstream storage and 5 delivery losses to compensate for evaporation evapotranspiration infiltration into groundwater systems water removed from the floodplain and unauthorized extraction 2 4 modelling management drivers we also examined how management rules for allocating water to water licenses affected water availability water allocation frameworks fall into two main categories globally proportional appropriation where water is allocated among licenses entitlements shares reserve as a variable fraction of the license volume and prior appropriation where water is allocated to a variable number of license holders in a first come first serve basis the former is used in australia for allocating highly variable water supply where licenses are tradeable five license types are specified in water plans stock and domestic livestock and landholders local water utility urban high security licenses permanent plantings such as fruit trees general security and supplementary licenses irrigated agriculture usually annual cropping and environment table 1 the first three provide regulated water in all but record drought years general security licenses make up most of the water in storage at moderate reliability while supplementary licenses allow opportunistic access to unregulated water flowing from tributaries downstream of major dams and major dam spills table 1 shi 2006 unlicensed water is managed for system losses e g evaporation groundwater riparian landholders in the form of stock and domestic rights and for some environmental requirements specified by rules in water resource plans to provide for flows in the river system planned environmental water nsw government 2016a b water availability is the variable volume in storage allocated per license calculated by river operators termed resource assessment at the start of each water year july june and when there is significant accumulation of water in dams water is allocated using a balance sheet allowing sufficient supply for future needs e g unused water planning provisions and operational requirements see steinfeld et al 2015 for full description water management rules influence water availability vogel et al 2007 wurbs 2005 we focused on four major rules that differed between the gwydir and macquarie rivers two related to resource assessment revealed following discussions with river operators the first was the source of water available for allocation the resource pool table 2 in the gwydir river the resource pool was only the volume in storage debit contrasting its specification in the macquarie river where it was the volume in storage plus likely inflows also known as anticipated or assumed inflows based on minimum historical inflows into the storage credit the debit rule was more conservative only allocating water already in the dam analogous to a debit card drawing on bank savings the credit rule was more risky allowing water to be borrowed from the future to advance the timing of water availability analogous to a credit card allowing access to likely future income the credit rule advances the timing of water availability to benefit water use planning decisions gong et al 2010 the second rule which differed was the type of balance sheet for water accounting table 2 a static balance sheet in the gwydir river subtracted unused water and future needs e g drought reserve losses from the resource pool to estimate water availability independent of future conditions assumed a constant evaporation and full use of water allocated the contrasting dynamic balance sheet used in the macquarie river optimized availability within the constraints of future projected storage volume it accounted for seasonally varying evaporation and demand allowing operators to more accurately optimise water management by estimating future needs the static balance sheet is analogous to a household budget with fixed estimates for future income and expenditure while a dynamic balance sheet would have variable estimates based on knowledge of future income and expenditure the remaining two rules related to water accounting nsw government 2016a b the first was the limits imposed on water available for general security licenses limits can apply to different parameters the volume allocated to an account the volume held in an account or the volume withdrawn from an account for use in the gwydir river there was no limit on the volume allocated but there were limits on the volumes held and withdrawn from an account account limited table 2 in the macquarie river there was a limit on the volume allocated a percentage of the license but no limits on the volumes of water held and withdrawn availability limited table 2 the second major difference in water accounting relates to penalties associated with water held in storage contributing to evaporation or dam spills carryover penalties general security water held in the macquarie river was subject to evaporation penalties and was partially or completely forfeited if dam capacity was exceeded forfeit carryover table 2 providing an incentive to use water rather than hold it in storage analgous to negative interest rates for money held in a bank account there were no penalties in the gwydir river no forfeit carryover table 2 so the costs of individual decisions to store water were borne by all water users storing high security and supplementary water over consecutive water years was prohibited in both systems 2 5 modelling water availability water allocations were the proportion of years that the full license volumes can be supplied to high security general security and supplementary licenses volumes depended on license volume i e 50 reliability of a 1ml license means an annual average allocation of 0 5ml table 1 we used a hydrological simulation model ewash to determine water availability providing rapid estimates using batch processing with flexible specification of input variables table 2 steinfeld et al 2015 we assumed stationary climate and management drivers over the 110 year daily simulation 1900 2010 excluding 10 year warm up period to allow a relative comparison we generated water availability for all combinations of different variable levels 9600 model runs table 2 water management rules were based on water sharing plans of 2016 nsw government 2016a b 2 6 sensitivity analysis we used regression based sensitivity analysis a common method applied in hydrologic studies christiaens and feyen 2002 sieber and uhlenbrook 2005 song et al 2015 to measure the influence of drivers on availability bahremand and de smedt 2008 saltelli et al 2008 model inputs for the river system and management drivers were dichotomous two categories represented the parameter space climate change was ordinal three categories and climate uncertainty was continuous 100 values table 2 we compared categorical variables using orthogonal contrasts defined differently for dichotomous and ordinal variables crawley 2007 for dichotomous variables the model mean treated the alphabetically highest level as the baseline and the coefficient represented the mean deviation from baseline due to the second level i e for river system gwydir river was baseline and the deviation was macquarie river for ordinal variables we measured the mean deviation from historical compared to other levels for climate change historical climate was the baseline to which moderate and plausible levels were compared continuous input variables were included as covariates while the continuous response variables were annual average availability of water per license we used annual averages for continuous variables aligning with environmental water planning timeframes we fitted separate least squares multiple regression relationships between input variables and each response variable regression coefficients represented average sensitivity of the corresponding input variable table 2 indicative of the value of linear influence of the variable on the model ekstrom 2005 regressions were fitted with all independent variables and second order interaction terms then backward elimination of non significant variables p 0 05 resulting in model parsimony family wise error for three models was corrected using a bonferroni adjustment r development core team 2009 we examined scatterplots to ensure a monotonic relationship between inputs and output i e the order of the output relative to the input was preserved ekstrom 2005 coefficients within 0 001 units of zero were removed variance was reasonably constant checked by plotting residuals against fitted values regression terms including interactions were assumed to be additive to improve normality of residuals and model robustness we refitted models using rank transformed response variables frey and patil 2002 with multiple regression analyses we analysed rank and raw regression coefficients together iman and conover 1979 the former showed the order of importance of variables and nature of correlation i e positive or negative and the latter represented the magnitude of the sensitivity for climate change we assessed the potential for linear extrapolation then selected sampling levels we tested for linearity by fitting a simple least squares regression model with climate change reduction in historical flow as the predictor variable and mean annual availability for each license as the response variable we specified orthogonal contrasts so that regression coefficients represented equivalent climate change deviations 5 the first coefficient β 1 was the mean deviation of a 5 reduction in flow compared to a historical climate and the second coefficient β 2 represented the mean deviation between a 5 and 10 reduction in flow a ratio of climate change coefficients β 1 β 2 approximating one indicated a linear relationship within the tested range 2 7 assessing management scenarios we compared the availability of general security environmental water under different management scenarios table 1 we used box plots to visualize annual average environmental water availability under 16 unique combinations of the four management rules table 2 in the gwydir and macquarie rivers under a historical climate each box represented the distribution of average availability due to climate uncertainty 100 levels to compare management scenarios we ranked them by median availability of environmental water in descending order we tested differences between scenarios for statistical significance using a one way anova followed by a tukey s test for pairwise comparison we used a non parametric kruskal wallis test where assumptions of sample independence normality and equal variance were not met 3 results current management rules yielded a combined long term average of 220 gl y and 392 gl y water for extractive and environmental water licenses in the gwydir and macquarie rivers respectively water allocations were most sensitive to the particular river system followed by management drivers and climate change and not sensitive to climate uncertainty varying management rules changed overall availability by a minimum and maximum of 4 and 22 in the macquarie river and by between 5 and 0 1 in the gwydir river while a 10 reduction in inflow due to climate change reduced the volume of water allocations available by 10 and 8 in the gwydir and macquarie rivers respectively sensitivity of allocations to management rules and climate varied according to licenses general security was more sensitive than high security consequently these differences provided the opportunity to identify the combination of management rules which maximised water available for extractive and environmental use adaptive and planned water results were based on long term averages despite considerable natural flow variability driving annual allocations within their full range 0 to 100 3 1 long term water availability under current management our simulations showed variation in the long term availability of water allocations for extraction and the environment under current water management rules and historical climate a long term average total of 208 3 gl y was available to all license holders in the gwydir river d s a n scenario and 319 6 gl y in the macquarie river c y l f scenario tables 2 and 3 over half of the total volume allocated was to general security licenses in both river systems with smaller volumes allocated to high security and supplementary licenses table 3 in the gwydir river high security licenses were most reliable receiving full allocations nearly every year followed by supplementary water licenses receiving full allocations every three years then general security licenses receiving full allocations every four years in the macquarie river high security licenses also received full allocations nearly every year followed by general security licenses receiving full allocations nearly every two years and supplementary water licenses every four years table 3 total long term average environmental water allocations were 46 9 gl y in the gwydir river and 136 1 gl y in the macquarie river consisting of water allocated under licenses and through planned environmental water rules long term water allocations under the current management scenario declined with reduced inflows the influence varied depending on the license class table 4 with a 10 inflow reduction in the gwydir and macquarie rivers the reliability of high security licenses decreased by 0 1 in both systems general security reliability decreased by 3 5 and 4 5 and supplementary water reliability decreased by 3 4 and 4 3 respectively this equated to an overall reduction in licensed allocations of 23 gl y 10 in the gwydir and 30 8 gl y 8 in the macquarie river respectively there was evidence of a linear relationship between climate change and water allocations for all licenses table 4 as the ratio of coefficients approximated one we were reasonably confident of the effects within the tested range i e 0 10 reduction in historical inflow given the strong linear relationship between climate inflow reduction and water allocations table 4 3 2 sensitivity of allocations to drivers we developed models with high goodness of fit explaining sensitivity of high security general security and supplementary water allocations r2 of 0 75 0 97 and 0 96 respectively for allocations to high security water licenses management drivers and the river system including demand contributed almost all significant output sensitivity 98 fig 2 management drivers resource pool balance sheet general security limit carryover penalties alone explained about half output variation 52 with their interaction with the river system contributing to further variation 29 while the river system made up the final significant contribution 17 there was only a small influence of climate 1 which interacted with the river system 1 and management 1 drivers for general security water allocations management drivers and the river system contributed to sensitivity 95 fig 2 the river system including demand side variables explained most of the variation in allocations 51 then management drivers 23 followed by their interaction 21 climate 1 and its interaction with the river system 3 had little influence the river system affected most 93 of the sensitivity of supplementary water allocations with a small influence of climate alone 3 and through interaction with the river system 2 and management 2 drivers fig 2 3 2 1 high security water allocations mean high security

resource pool fig 3a for the macquarie river the effect reduced mean high security water allocations when general security water allocations were limited 0 11 gl y and increased mean water allocations

historical flow appendix a mean general security water allocations were most sensitive to the river system fig 3b estimated long term average water allocations in the macquarie river were 34 47 gl y higher than in the gwydir appendix a the second most important term the interaction between river system and resource pool decreased general security water allocations 8 53 gl y in the macquarie river with a credit resource pool fig 3b the balance sheet variable was ranked third fig 3b with the dynamic balance sheet reducing mean general security allocations 19 32 gl y compared to debit appendix a the credit resource pool reduced general security allocations 9 40 gl y but its interaction with the dynamic balance sheet positively influenced allocations 25 74 gl y appendix a the next most sensitive drivers were the interaction between river system and balance sheet and river system and carryover penalty fig 3b which reduced general security water allocations in the macquarie river with a dynamic balance sheet 31 17 gl y and with forfeit carryover penalties 35 96 gl y appendix a in the gwydir river there was a small effect on general security allocations ranked 13th although the raw coefficient was not significant appendix a general security allocations were also sensitive to the interaction of river system and climate change fig 3b mean general security water allocations decreased in the macquarie river with a 10 reduction in historical flow but this term was not significant in the raw regression results similarly the influence of climate change 10 reduction was significant in the ranked regression but not in the raw regression the next three drivers associated with the general security limit were significant in the raw regression but not the rank regression fig 3b availability limited general security increased allocations 14 35 gl y and interacted with river system to further increase allocations in the macquarie river 34 49 gl y appendix a when combined with forfeit carryover penalties availability limited general security produced the opposite effect 9 17 gl y there was a negative interaction between the balance sheet and carryover penalties on mean general security allocations fig 3b appendix a although the corresponding term in the raw regression was not significant four terms in the raw regression were not significant in the rank regression and assumed to not affect allocations fig 3b 3 2 3 supplementary water allocations long term average supplementary water allocations were sensitive to six rank regression terms comprising four single or interacting drivers river system climate change 5 and 10 reduction of historical flow resource pool and balance sheet fig 3c appendix a long term average supplementary water allocations were not affected by carryover penalties general security limit or climate uncertainty mean inflow mean tributary flow effect sizes of the significant drivers were small with the exception of the river system fig 3c where average water allocations in the macquarie river were less than the gwydir river 17 99 gl y appendix a supplementary water allocations were slightly sensitive to the interaction between river system and climate change 10 reduction increasing water allocations in the macquarie river 1 12 gl y climate change alone 10 reduction of historical flow reduced mean supplementary water allocations in both river systems 0 51 gl y there was a small increase in long term average supplementary water allocations when a credit resource pool was used and with a small change in climate however the magnitude of these increases were unclear because the coefficients were not significant in the raw regression model fig 3c 3 3 maximising water allocations through management rules of the 16 management scenarios the scenario yielding the highest volume of allocations for all licenses was the debit resource pool with a static balance sheet account limited general security and no forfeit of carryover d s a f for both the gwydir and macquarie rivers this scenario yielded total long term average annual allocations of 208 6 gl y and 391 4 gl y for the two rivers respectively the management scenario yielding the lowest volume of allocations differed between rivers for the gwydir river the credit resource pool availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover c y l n yielded the lowest volume of allocations 196 6 gl y while for the macquarie river the credit resource pool static balance sheet availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover yielded the lowest volume of allocations c s l n 305 5 gl y the current management scenario yielded 208 3 gl y for the gwydir river and 319 6 gl y for the macquarie river for all licenses table 3 changes to management rules varied overall allocations by 11 7 gl y 5 6 and 0 3 gl y 0 1 in the gwydir river and 14 1 gl y 4 4 and 71 8 gl y 22 5 in the macquarie river in the long term based on our model and the available licenses table 1 effects of management rules on water allocations varied among licenses fig 4 for high security water scenarios yielding the highest volume of allocations for the gwydir river were those with the credit resource pool and a dynamic balance sheet c y fig 4 and for the macquarie river were those with the debit resource pool and static balance sheet p 0 05 d s fig 4b in these scenarios high security licenses received full allocations every year scenarios yielding the lowest volume of allocations were those with a credit resource pool and a static balance sheet for the gwydir c s and those with a debit resource pool and a dynamic balance sheet for the macquarie d y p 0 05 of the 16 management scenarios the current scenario was ranked seventh highest in the gwydir and 10th in the macquarie the difference between scenarios with highest and lowest long term average allocations was 6 in the gwydir and 5 in the macquarie for general security water the management scenario yielding the highest volume of allocations for the gwydir and macquarie rivers was the debit resource pool with a static balance sheet account limited general security and forfeit of carryover d s a f fig 4c and 4d the scenario yielding the lowest volume of allocations for the gwydir river was the credit resource pool with a dynamic balance sheet availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover water c y l n fig 4c while in the macquarie river it was the credit resource pool with a static balance sheet availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover water c s l n fig 4d for the gwydir river the current scenario d s a n yielded the second highest volume of water allocations of all the scenarios tested fig 4c however the current scenario for the macquarie river c y l f was relatively less efficient ranking 11th of 16 scenarios fig 4d the difference between the scenarios yielding lowest and the highest allocations were 2 4 in the gwydir river fig 4c and 13 6 in the macquarie river fig 4d differences between scenarios were statistically significant in the macquarie river but not in the gwydir river figs 4c and 4d for supplementary allocations there was no scenario where allocations exceeded others fig 4f the influence of management rules on long term allocations was small with a 0 3 and 1 5 difference between scenarios yielding the lowest and highest allocations in the gwydir and macquarie rivers respectively differences between scenarios were not statistically significant 4 discussion water available for irrigation and the environment varies considerably between river systems globally and is subject to the water rights framework and government decisions on the allocation of water to those rights ringler et al 2006 gandolfi et al 1997 tilmant et al 2010 understanding water allocations and their drivers particularly the influence of government decisions is fundamental for managing water for extractive and environmental use under uncertainty management rules and the particular river system including demand side variables were the most influential drivers of water allocations in two rivers of australia s most developed large river system the murray darling basin our regional analyses showed management drivers influenced regulated water availability high security general security considerably more than a plausible change in climate fig 2 the impacts of these drivers depended on the type of license effects of management decisions were less pronounced for unregulated water allocations for opportunistic water use supplementary which varied with climate and the river system and more pronounced for allocations regulated by large storages general security fig 2 the influences of management drivers and their inherent trade offs are often overlooked and rarely transparent with important ramifications for water managers license holders table 1 water investors and for uses of water specified through management plans i e planned environmental water australia or ecological reserves south africa hughes and mallory 2008 water allocations were influenced by physical characteristics of river systems e g catchment area storage capacity flow regime water demand relief and land cover fig 2 li et al 2012 regulated water allocations were higher in the macquarie river than the gwydir river fig 3a and b reflecting higher regulation of flows by dams unregulated water allocations were contrastingly higher in the gwydir river where unregulated tributaries contributed larger volumes to overall flows fig 3c flow variability also affects water allocations mcmahon and adeloye 2005 probably reflected by relatively low regulated water allocations in the variable gwydir river fig 3a and b idiosyncratic differences in management rules also significantly affected water allocations fig 3a b and c management rules for resource assessment significantly affected regulated water availability resource pool and balance sheet but contrastingly account management rules carryover penalties and general security limit had little influence over availability fig 3b management rules affected water availability in complex ways including additive synergistic and antagonistic interactions changing uncertainties and risks for example a credit resource pool and dynamic balance sheet increased allocations overall but individually they decreased high security fig 3a and general security fig 3b water allocations a feedback loop probably increased demand and lowered storage volume consequently reducing spills and evaporation losses given the important contribution of storage spills to planned environmental water availability the reduction in dam spills and other unregulated flows may reduce flood extents with adverse impacts on downstream floodplain wetlands and communities including graziers who depend on floodwaters for pasture relative differences in river system characteristics between the gwydir and macquarie river systems had implications for water users given their interactions with management rules average annual inflows into burrendong dam on the macquarie river 755 gl y were almost triple the volume of inflows into copeton dam on the gwydir river 268 gl y while total regulated licence volume in the macquarie river was only slightly greater than in the gwydir river 124 these relative differences meant the credit rule affected larger volumes of general security allocations in the macquarie river compared to the gwydir river also storage capacity in the macquarie river represented more than twice the average inflows 222 while storage capacity in the gwydir river represented five times the annual average inflows 508 consequently the forfeit carryover rule was more relevant i e more likely to be triggered in the macquarie river because storages were more likely to exceed full capacity compared to the gwydir river these findings emphasized important contextual considerations in the application of management rules in different river systems management rules have strong cultural and social dimensions in the two rivers they differed despite both river systems being governed by a single management agency under the same legislative and policy framework i e the water management act 2000 table 2 current management rules in the gwydir river yielded the highest volume of general security allocations among 16 scenarios whereas management rules in the macquarie river ranked 11th fig 4 two rules yielded consistently more general security allocations across catchments debit resource pool static balance sheet fig 4 but effects were not consistent across other license classes management rules also interacted with flow regimes fig 3a b and c highlighting the importance of local context in decision making inconsistent management rules across different licenses and river systems make regulation and compliance difficult climate change is projected to reduce water availability with considerable uncertainty chiew et al 2009 but the relative impact on allocations compared to other drivers was small albeit significant for the gwydir and macquarie rivers this underlined the importance of management rules fig 2 as in other rivers arrigoni et al 2010 beck and bernauer 2011 with increasing climate change severity unregulated water allocations were projected to decrease more than regulated allocations appendix a impacts of long term shifts in hydrologic regime may be underestimated given the limitations of rainfall runoff models in estimating drought impacts vaze et al 2010 hughes and hughes 2018 changes of different magnitudes were not examined e g 10 reduction or increases compared to historical nor did we examine changes to the distribution i e variability of future climate drivers which have important implications for individual events e g increased frequency of extreme floods and droughts but this could be done using our models managing water supply for irrigation and environmental outcomes also requires considering attributes besides volume including the security of allocations and the ability to store and release water from dams with the appropriate variability kingsford and auld 2005 general security account limits currently disadvantage environmental water license holders who require large quantities of water to be stored in dams because they must forfeit water if the account reaches capacity hughes and goesch 2009 limits on water allocations are more favourable for some water users e g the environment because water can accumulate over multiple years kingsford and auld 2005 allowing license holders to manage their own water supply risk and manage for longer term outcomes however a complication is inequitable use of storage space when storage volume reaches capacity in the macquarie river this issue is addressed by imposing limits on the volume of water individuals may carry between water years carryover evaporation penalties may also be used to incentivise the drawdown of water in storage to free airspace but this rule may also lead to increased capture of unregulated high flows which would have otherwise reached downstream ecosystems there is also the potential water security risk of losing access to water during dry periods the credit management approach may fail when water availability is below the historical range e g climate change because water is allocated to users in the expectation of inflows which may not eventuate chiew et al 2009 pittock and finlayson 2011 this can lead to abandoning of water management plans to ensure that essential supplies e g town water supply are maintained for example water management plans were suspended during the millennium drought in rivers using the credit resource pool macquarie murrumbidgee lachlan rivers of the murray darling basin but not in rivers operating under a debit resource pool gwydir namoi or border rivers now 2011 the water management plan for the macquarie river was suspended again in july 2019 due to a critical water shortage nsw government 2019 plan suspension enables environmental water to be appropriated for critical human needs and other high priority consumptive uses water management plans using a credit resource pool are more likely to be suspended in a drying environment with projected reductions in runoff sensitivity analyses were a robust approach to evaluating factors driving water allocations at regional scales while recognizing local heterogeneity results were consistent with studies showing the important influence of management drivers on water availability ringler et al 2006

of drought security flood risk carryover flexibility dam spills minimum flow requirements and storage capacity sharing should also be considered rainfall runoff models may have underestimated variability sharma and o neill 2002 and demand was assumed to be stationary throughout the modelled period steinfeld et al 2015 despite these limitations models were fit for purposes of estimating long term average allocations and comparing scenarios management decisions need to be scientifically defensible and justified welsh et al 2013 given the considerable heterogeneity in drivers of water allocations across river systems table 2 fig 2 clear specification of management rules and effects on water availability is critical for assessing risks developing efficient management rules and facilitating water trade between valleys and licenses young and mccoll 2009 despite this management rules and their effects are often not explicit or properly documented dutta et al 2013 water sharing plans and government reports provided an overview of the water allocation process and described some rules e g general security limit carryover rules however some rules were omitted including the resource pool and balance sheet rules despite their effects on water users and environment for the gwydir and macquarie rivers no public records existed which codified the resource assessment process to reveal how each allocation decision was made or justified the management rules the idiosyncratic and heuristic nature of this process was underscored by the fact that both were governed by the same agency and the legislative and policy frameworks were the same management history parochial knowledge and individual preferences primarily determined this difference lack of knowledge of other drivers potentially affecting availability e g unmetered water use plantations evaporation loss may further undermine water management decisions young and mccoll 2009 there is a clear need for transparency particularly given the water current reforms in australia s murray darling basin which require aligning local water management rules across more than 30 surface and groundwater zones under a single overarching framework for river management the basin plan mdba 2012 2013 greater transparency is also needed in river basins worldwide given the lack of knowledge local water allocation practices and the individual and local influences affecting water distribution schlüter et al 2005 failure to recognize the influence of management drivers may result in system inefficiencies and increased risks to water dependent industries and ecosystems fig 4 our paper analysed the effects of management rules on water allocations for the environment and extractive users but the full extent of trade offs of increased allocations remains to be addressed this includes volumetric trade offs i e impacts of increased water allocations on other flow components and water management objectives and non volumetric trade offs affecting water management objectives i e frequency of storage spills period between allocations suspension of water plans changes to the ability to store water over multiple years some studies have attempted to optimise allocations for extractive use while ensuring sufficient water availability for environmental needs water trading rules in the dong nai river basin in southern vietnam varied water allocations by 38 to 53 while ensuring 10 of inflow was available to meet environmental requirements ringler et al 2006 tilmant et al 2010 illustrated the potential to satisfy water demands in the zambezi river while restoring floods to the delta these are important areas for future research given the multiple benefits of supporting consumptive needs while restoring environmental flows for communities and industries including floodplain grazing fisheries and tourism richter 2010 5 conclusions there is generally little published understanding of human factors driving water availability because management rules are complex and rarely codified and effects are dependent on the local context our findings have considerably more application beyond the gwydir and macquarie rivers of the murray darling basin we modelled drivers of water allocations that are germane to rivers around the world our regional assessment of their effects on regulated and unregulated water allocations showed clear trends across rivers while recognizing important contextual differences a quantitative understanding of the interacting and heterogeneous drivers affecting water availability is vital for effective local and regional water management and planning under uncertainty we showed there were clear effects of different management regimes for two rivers with identical legislative and policy frameworks it is particularly important to adequately capture not only the abiotic drivers of water availability but also idiosyncratic management rules which can have a significant impact on water availability outcomes for all water users and the environment 6 credit authorship contribution statement celine m m steinfeld conceptualization investigation data curation

5302,a global challenge for water resource management in rivers worldwide is ensuring water supply reliability satisfies consumptive and environmental demands high variability in water supply water policy and management decisions and uncertainty about the effects of climate change compound this challenge understanding factors driving water allocations and consequences for water users and the environment is essential rainfall and streamflow traditionally drive allocations yet the influence of water management decisions are often overlooked because they are complex rarely codified and dependent on the regional context we compared the relative influences of water management climate and the river system characteristics including demand and water storage infrastructure on regulated and unregulated water allocations in two regulated rivers with large dams for water supply to towns irrigated agriculture and wetlands of international significance gwydir and macquarie rivers of the murray darling basin southeastern australia using hydrological simulation models and regression based sensitivity analyses under an historical and drier climate water management decisions influenced regulated water allocations explaining 23 to 52 of the variance considerably more than unregulated water allocations explaining 2 for regulated water allocations water management decisions and the river system were more important than a plausible change in climate while for unregulated water allocations the river system and climate change were dominant drivers changing management rules alone could vary long term water allocations by between 6 and 0 1 in the gwydir river and between 4 and 22 in the macquarie river management rules which allocated future inflows i e credit model were more likely to fail in a drying environment with projected reductions in runoff compared to rules where only water in storage is allocated i e debit model management rules differed despite both river systems being governed by a single management agency under the same legislative and policy framework more systematic approaches to justify water management rules and greater transparency in their influence on water allocations are critical for maximizing the benefits to water users and river health and for managing risks to water supply in a variable and changing climate keywords water

growing pressure with water resource development increasing competition and reducing water security for communities and ecosystems around the world vorosmarty et al 2000 nilsson et al 2005 this problem is usually managed by regulating water use from rivers through allocations for urban and industry supply hydroelectricity irrigation and the environment arthington et al 2006 river regulation in over half of the world s large rivers has modified water availability nilsson et al 2005 with storages dams capturing holding and releasing water through controlled releases to users and the environment while dams have provided important benefits for water users they have also caused considerable global environmental damage poff and zimmerman 2010 carlisle et al 2011 there is potential to partially restore degraded river systems through strategic management of dams pittock and hartmann 2009 poff and schmidt 2016 this requires understanding the availability of water its storage in dams patterns of demand and operational supply for both extractive and environmental purposes spatial and temporal variability in water availability is driven by complex natural factors including hydrology water demand geographical features of the river system including land use topography and land cover and by human factors including population growth water resource development and river management twort et al 2000 vorosmarty et al 2000 ipcc 2013 these drivers can constantly and rapidly change with consequences for water dependent livelihoods industries and freshwater ecosystems in many contexts hydrological responses are not stationary despite global water resource management systems often assuming so milly et al 2008 there are a suite of identifiable drivers affecting water allocations which can be estimated to determine how their changing patterns affect water availability this would allow for clear assessment of risks to water security identification of opportunities for adverse impacts to be mitigated informed trade in water markets and evaluation of trade offs between extractive users and the environment naiman et al 2002 hollinshead 2005 viscito 2009 most of our understanding of drivers of water allocations is based on dam storage levels driven by inflows catchment size land cover and geomorphology which are reflected through rainfall runoff relationships singh 1997 li et al 2012 climate uncertainty the stochastic sequence of meteorologic drivers e g short term fluctuations in precipitation evaporation and solar radiation also drives the streamflow hydrograph singh 1997 soltani et al 2008 changes in precipitation and evaporation are affected in the long term by climate change amplified in runoff chiew and mcmahon 2002 arnell 2004 water allocations are also dependent on spatially variable river system features including land cover geomorphology demand water infrastructure and water management objectives hirji and davis 2009 water allocations may also be influenced by catchment specific physical constraints such as storage capacity outlet size spillway capacity and floodplain infrastructure there are integrated assessments at local regional and global scales which quantify the relative influences of the river system and climate drivers on streamflow or related indices including water availability li et al 2012 williams et al 2012 water stress alcamo et al 2007 and flow regimes arrigoni et al 2010 water availability is not simply a function of physical drivers and releases of water from dams other potential factors include the role of river regulation and management in driving water availability for water users and the environment water management infrastructure and river operation may significantly affect storage volume potentially changing evaporation and unregulated releases spills affecting the volume of water allocated to users and the environment quantifying influences of such management is difficult because of complex interactions feedbacks and dependencies among elements of shared water storage systems some studies examining the influence of management on water availability focus on optimising water yield for extractive use ignoring environmental needs for water dependent ecosystems for example changing from single to multi reservoir river operations in the brazos river basin in texas resulted in increased water yield by 6 wurbs and carriere 1993 in a hypothetical river system policy choices related to economic benefit and risk of system failure varied water allocations wang and huang 2012 given the complex interactions integrated analyses combining climate management demand and water infrastructure drivers across different river systems are critical for understanding the complex and confounding influences of all drivers not just abiotic ones on water availability for multiple users and the environment such assessment is necessary to inform opportunities and trade offs supporting water management objectives for environmental and extractive uses our aims were to 1 examine the interactive influence of the river system characteristics climate change and management rules on water availability and 2 evaluate management scenarios in providing water allocations to users and the environment we used global regression based sensitivity analyses to quantify the relative influence of drivers on water availability based on daily hydrological simulation models run over a 110 year period we compared two semi arid regulated river systems in australia s murray darling basin the gwydir and macquarie rivers where water is provided for irrigated agriculture and wetlands of international importance ramsar 2012 despite local differences in water management these two rivers are managed by the same state agency and governed by the same overarching legislative and policy drivers allowing identification of idiosyncratic influences of management decisions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the gwydir and macquarie rivers in australia s murray darling basin are characteristic dryland rivers differing in catchment area and hydrology they flow northwest from the great dividing range travelling through well defined channels until they reach semi arid floodplains fig 1 where they form a maze of interconnected streams ephemeral lagoons distributary creeks and anabranching channels some of which are ramsar listed gwydir wetlands and macquarie marshes while others are usually grazed by livestock frequent and complex flood pulses and subsequent drying drive biological diversity ecosystem processes and ecosystem services of semi permanent wetlands brock et al 2006 average surface water availability in the gwydir river 782 gl y is lower than the macquarie river 1567 gl y mainly reflecting a smaller catchment area csiro 2007 csiro 2008 flow regimes are highly variable particularly in the gwydir river with headwaters exposed to tropical weather systems blandford et al 1977 flow regimes are almost entirely regulated by major dams with copeton dam 1362 gl capacity capturing 93 of upstream inflow and windamere dam 368 gl and burrendong dam 1188 gl capturing 94 and 91 of upstream inflow respectively fig 1 there are also minor dams e g weirs to provide head and for water supply to towns and irrigated agriculture delivered by channel networks steinfeld and kingsford 2013 tributaries downstream of dams deliver unregulated flows considerably higher in the gwydir river 189 gl y than the macquarie river 67 gl y csiro 2007 2008 the major land cover is dryland pasture for livestock grazing mixed with irrigated and dryland cropping on the floodplains csiro 2007 2008 the state government is largely responsibility for water management in the gwydir and macquarie rivers influenced by the federal government through the commonwealth water act 2007 and the murray darling basin plan water management objectives are defined through state statutory water sharing plans both the gwydir and macquarie plans promote environmental social economic and cultural objectives despite being stated differently the objectives of the gwydir plan are to protect maintain and enhance environmental values provide for equitable water sharing between all uses minimise impacts of extraction improve water quality facilitate water trade preserve basic water rights ensure extractions are within agreed limits and preserve and enhance cultural and heritage values nsw government 2016a the objectives of the macquarie plan are to maintain or enhance the ecological functions and values support a sustainable regional economy protect social values and benefits provided by the river system and recognise and respect aboriginal cultural responsibilities and obligations to the landscape nsw government 2016b most of these objectives are given effect through management rules and shares of water made available for consumptive and environmental use nsw government 2016a b 2 2 modelling climate drivers we modelled three climate drivers rainfall evaporation and flow for their short term variability we randomly generated 100 probable daily time series of rainfall at gauges in each river system we sampled non parametric distributions of observed daily rainfall occurrence and amounts 1900 2010 gap filled and extended using an inverse distance weighted interpolation mehrotra and sharma 2007 we maintained spatial correlation among multiple rainfall stations gwydir 12 macquarie 15 fig 1 preserving high and low frequency rainfall variability 90 365 and 1000 days mehrotra and sharma 2007 we generated 100 daily time series of evaporation using k nearest neighbor interpolation to reflect the variability of the rainfall time series shi et al 2007 and derived daily dam inflow and tributary flows gwydir halls creek myall creek horton river macquarie bell river talbragar river fig 1 using sacramento rainfall runoff sub basin models burnash 1995 linked to a calibrated river system simulation model commonly used in australia called the integrated quality and quantity model iqqm simons et al 1996 we used dam inflow and tributary flow to represent hydrological uncertainty in our sensitivity regression analysis 100 values each averaged annually ensuring they were uncorrelated and independent pearson s correlation coefficient ρ 0 42 mean annual runoff is projected to reduce under climate change in the gwydir by 9 csiro 2007 and in the macquarie by 6 by 2030 current development scenario c csiro 2008 we used three potential levels of inflow reductions in our sensitivity analysis historical 0 moderate 5 and plausible 10 reductions in inflow applied to the 100 dam inflow and tributary flow realisations we ensured the assumption of linearity was met by comparing differences in water allocations among scenarios with all other factors held constant 2 3 modelling river system including demand side drivers river system drivers reflected the biophysical river system characteristics of the gwydir and macquarie rivers and demand side factors which were valley specific biophysical characteristics reflected drainage area land cover and water infrastructure including dam outlet and spillway capacity these were incorporated in rainfall runoff and river system simulation models including surface soil moisture states flow routing transmission losses and storage parameters see burnash 1995 simons et al 1996 steinfeld et al 2015 demand was modelled based on historical patterns at a daily time step for three separate use groups environment which is retained in the river system for desired environmental benefit extraction which is diverted from a water source for consumptive use and river operation to support achievement of water resource management objectives environmental water demand was triggered by natural cues of flows in tributaries downstream of dams the demand time series was based on a tributary activated demand approach where environmental flows were triggered by natural flows in tributaries downstream of major storages provided water allocations were available harman and stewardson 2005 we assumed all flow requirements were met by dam releases and not from the tributaries downstream of dams extractive demand was modelled for three key user groups domestic use livestock water utilities industry high value irrigation e g horticulture and staple crop irrigation e g grains fibre including cotton individual extractive water users were lumped as a single average user for simplicity dudley 1988 parameters for staple crop irrigation were percentages of available water reflecting dependency on water availability and mean monthly distribution of historical use other extractive demands were based on fixed volumes we assumed demand relationships were constant through time additional volumes of water for river operation provided safe reliable and efficient supply of water to users and the environment this included 1 dead storage the inaccessible volume of water below the storage outlet 2 minimum flows at specific points along channels 3 water to mitigate floods through controlled releases of flows from storage 4 transfer of water between storages to replenish a downstream storage and 5 delivery losses to compensate for evaporation evapotranspiration infiltration into groundwater systems water removed from the floodplain and unauthorized extraction 2 4 modelling management drivers we also examined how management rules for allocating water to water licenses affected water availability water allocation frameworks fall into two main categories globally proportional appropriation where water is allocated among licenses entitlements shares reserve as a variable fraction of the license volume and prior appropriation where water is allocated to a variable number of license holders in a first come first serve basis the former is used in australia for allocating highly variable water supply where licenses are tradeable five license types are specified in water plans stock and domestic livestock and landholders local water utility urban high security licenses permanent plantings such as fruit trees general security and supplementary licenses irrigated agriculture usually annual cropping and environment table 1 the first three provide regulated water in all but record drought years general security licenses make up most of the water in storage at moderate reliability while supplementary licenses allow opportunistic access to unregulated water flowing from tributaries downstream of major dams and major dam spills table 1 shi 2006 unlicensed water is managed for system losses e g evaporation groundwater riparian landholders in the form of stock and domestic rights and for some environmental requirements specified by rules in water resource plans to provide for flows in the river system planned environmental water nsw government 2016a b water availability is the variable volume in storage allocated per license calculated by river operators termed resource assessment at the start of each water year july june and when there is significant accumulation of water in dams water is allocated using a balance sheet allowing sufficient supply for future needs e g unused water planning provisions and operational requirements see steinfeld et al 2015 for full description water management rules influence water availability vogel et al 2007 wurbs 2005 we focused on four major rules that differed between the gwydir and macquarie rivers two related to resource assessment revealed following discussions with river operators the first was the source of water available for allocation the resource pool table 2 in the gwydir river the resource pool was only the volume in storage debit contrasting its specification in the macquarie river where it was the volume in storage plus likely inflows also known as anticipated or assumed inflows based on minimum historical inflows into the storage credit the debit rule was more conservative only allocating water already in the dam analogous to a debit card drawing on bank savings the credit rule was more risky allowing water to be borrowed from the future to advance the timing of water availability analogous to a credit card allowing access to likely future income the credit rule advances the timing of water availability to benefit water use planning decisions gong et al 2010 the second rule which differed was the type of balance sheet for water accounting table 2 a static balance sheet in the gwydir river subtracted unused water and future needs e g drought reserve losses from the resource pool to estimate water availability independent of future conditions assumed a constant evaporation and full use of water allocated the contrasting dynamic balance sheet used in the macquarie river optimized availability within the constraints of future projected storage volume it accounted for seasonally varying evaporation and demand allowing operators to more accurately optimise water management by estimating future needs the static balance sheet is analogous to a household budget with fixed estimates for future income and expenditure while a dynamic balance sheet would have variable estimates based on knowledge of future income and expenditure the remaining two rules related to water accounting nsw government 2016a b the first was the limits imposed on water available for general security licenses limits can apply to different parameters the volume allocated to an account the volume held in an account or the volume withdrawn from an account for use in the gwydir river there was no limit on the volume allocated but there were limits on the volumes held and withdrawn from an account account limited table 2 in the macquarie river there was a limit on the volume allocated a percentage of the license but no limits on the volumes of water held and withdrawn availability limited table 2 the second major difference in water accounting relates to penalties associated with water held in storage contributing to evaporation or dam spills carryover penalties general security water held in the macquarie river was subject to evaporation penalties and was partially or completely forfeited if dam capacity was exceeded forfeit carryover table 2 providing an incentive to use water rather than hold it in storage analgous to negative interest rates for money held in a bank account there were no penalties in the gwydir river no forfeit carryover table 2 so the costs of individual decisions to store water were borne by all water users storing high security and supplementary water over consecutive water years was prohibited in both systems 2 5 modelling water availability water allocations were the proportion of years that the full license volumes can be supplied to high security general security and supplementary licenses volumes depended on license volume i e 50 reliability of a 1ml license means an annual average allocation of 0 5ml table 1 we used a hydrological simulation model ewash to determine water availability providing rapid estimates using batch processing with flexible specification of input variables table 2 steinfeld et al 2015 we assumed stationary climate and management drivers over the 110 year daily simulation 1900 2010 excluding 10 year warm up period to allow a relative comparison we generated water availability for all combinations of different variable levels 9600 model runs table 2 water management rules were based on water sharing plans of 2016 nsw government 2016a b 2 6 sensitivity analysis we used regression based sensitivity analysis a common method applied in hydrologic studies christiaens and feyen 2002 sieber and uhlenbrook 2005 song et al 2015 to measure the influence of drivers on availability bahremand and de smedt 2008 saltelli et al 2008 model inputs for the river system and management drivers were dichotomous two categories represented the parameter space climate change was ordinal three categories and climate uncertainty was continuous 100 values table 2 we compared categorical variables using orthogonal contrasts defined differently for dichotomous and ordinal variables crawley 2007 for dichotomous variables the model mean treated the alphabetically highest level as the baseline and the coefficient represented the mean deviation from baseline due to the second level i e for river system gwydir river was baseline and the deviation was macquarie river for ordinal variables we measured the mean deviation from historical compared to other levels for climate change historical climate was the baseline to which moderate and plausible levels were compared continuous input variables were included as covariates while the continuous response variables were annual average availability of water per license we used annual averages for continuous variables aligning with environmental water planning timeframes we fitted separate least squares multiple regression relationships between input variables and each response variable regression coefficients represented average sensitivity of the corresponding input variable table 2 indicative of the value of linear influence of the variable on the model ekstrom 2005 regressions were fitted with all independent variables and second order interaction terms then backward elimination of non significant variables p 0 05 resulting in model parsimony family wise error for three models was corrected using a bonferroni adjustment r development core team 2009 we examined scatterplots to ensure a monotonic relationship between inputs and output i e the order of the output relative to the input was preserved ekstrom 2005 coefficients within 0 001 units of zero were removed variance was reasonably constant checked by plotting residuals against fitted values regression terms including interactions were assumed to be additive to improve normality of residuals and model robustness we refitted models using rank transformed response variables frey and patil 2002 with multiple regression analyses we analysed rank and raw regression coefficients together iman and conover 1979 the former showed the order of importance of variables and nature of correlation i e positive or negative and the latter represented the magnitude of the sensitivity for climate change we assessed the potential for linear extrapolation then selected sampling levels we tested for linearity by fitting a simple least squares regression model with climate change reduction in historical flow as the predictor variable and mean annual availability for each license as the response variable we specified orthogonal contrasts so that regression coefficients represented equivalent climate change deviations 5 the first coefficient β 1 was the mean deviation of a 5 reduction in flow compared to a historical climate and the second coefficient β 2 represented the mean deviation between a 5 and 10 reduction in flow a ratio of climate change coefficients β 1 β 2 approximating one indicated a linear relationship within the tested range 2 7 assessing management scenarios we compared the availability of general security environmental water under different management scenarios table 1 we used box plots to visualize annual average environmental water availability under 16 unique combinations of the four management rules table 2 in the gwydir and macquarie rivers under a historical climate each box represented the distribution of average availability due to climate uncertainty 100 levels to compare management scenarios we ranked them by median availability of environmental water in descending order we tested differences between scenarios for statistical significance using a one way anova followed by a tukey s test for pairwise comparison we used a non parametric kruskal wallis test where assumptions of sample independence normality and equal variance were not met 3 results current management rules yielded a combined long term average of 220 gl y and 392 gl y water for extractive and environmental water licenses in the gwydir and macquarie rivers respectively water allocations were most sensitive to the particular river system followed by management drivers and climate change and not sensitive to climate uncertainty varying management rules changed overall availability by a minimum and maximum of 4 and 22 in the macquarie river and by between 5 and 0 1 in the gwydir river while a 10 reduction in inflow due to climate change reduced the volume of water allocations available by 10 and 8 in the gwydir and macquarie rivers respectively sensitivity of allocations to management rules and climate varied according to licenses general security was more sensitive than high security consequently these differences provided the opportunity to identify the combination of management rules which maximised water available for extractive and environmental use adaptive and planned water results were based on long term averages despite considerable natural flow variability driving annual allocations within their full range 0 to 100 3 1 long term water availability under current management our simulations showed variation in the long term availability of water allocations for extraction and the environment under current water management rules and historical climate a long term average total of 208 3 gl y was available to all license holders in the gwydir river d s a n scenario and 319 6 gl y in the macquarie river c y l f scenario tables 2 and 3 over half of the total volume allocated was to general security licenses in both river systems with smaller volumes allocated to high security and supplementary licenses table 3 in the gwydir river high security licenses were most reliable receiving full allocations nearly every year followed by supplementary water licenses receiving full allocations every three years then general security licenses receiving full allocations every four years in the macquarie river high security licenses also received full allocations nearly every year followed by general security licenses receiving full allocations nearly every two years and supplementary water licenses every four years table 3 total long term average environmental water allocations were 46 9 gl y in the gwydir river and 136 1 gl y in the macquarie river consisting of water allocated under licenses and through planned environmental water rules long term water allocations under the current management scenario declined with reduced inflows the influence varied depending on the license class table 4 with a 10 inflow reduction in the gwydir and macquarie rivers the reliability of high security licenses decreased by 0 1 in both systems general security reliability decreased by 3 5 and 4 5 and supplementary water reliability decreased by 3 4 and 4 3 respectively this equated to an overall reduction in licensed allocations of 23 gl y 10 in the gwydir and 30 8 gl y 8 in the macquarie river respectively there was evidence of a linear relationship between climate change and water allocations for all licenses table 4 as the ratio of coefficients approximated one we were reasonably confident of the effects within the tested range i e 0 10 reduction in historical inflow given the strong linear relationship between climate inflow reduction and water allocations table 4 3 2 sensitivity of allocations to drivers we developed models with high goodness of fit explaining sensitivity of high security general security and supplementary water allocations r2 of 0 75 0 97 and 0 96 respectively for allocations to high security water licenses management drivers and the river system including demand contributed almost all significant output sensitivity 98 fig 2 management drivers resource pool balance sheet general security limit carryover penalties alone explained about half output variation 52 with their interaction with the river system contributing to further variation 29 while the river system made up the final significant contribution 17 there was only a small influence of climate 1 which interacted with the river system 1 and management 1 drivers for general security water allocations management drivers and the river system contributed to sensitivity 95 fig 2 the river system including demand side variables explained most of the variation in allocations 51 then management drivers 23 followed by their interaction 21 climate 1 and its interaction with the river system 3 had little influence the river system affected most 93 of the sensitivity of supplementary water allocations with a small influence of climate alone 3 and through interaction with the river system 2 and management 2 drivers fig 2 3 2 1 high security water allocations mean high security

the credit resource pool reduced general security allocations 9 40 gl y but its interaction with the dynamic balance sheet positively influenced allocations 25 74 gl y appendix a the next most sensitive drivers were the interaction between river system and balance sheet and river system and carryover penalty fig 3b which reduced general security water allocations in the macquarie river with

coefficient was not significant appendix a general security allocations were also sensitive to the interaction of river system and climate change fig 3b mean general security water allocations decreased in the macquarie river with a 10 reduction in historical flow but this term was not significant in the raw regression results similarly the influence of climate change 10 reduction was significant in the ranked regression but not in the raw regression the next three drivers associated with the general security limit were significant in the raw regression but not the rank regression

combined with forfeit carryover penalties availability limited general security produced the opposite effect 9 17 gl y there was a negative interaction between the balance sheet and carryover

interaction between river system and climate change 10 reduction increasing water allocations in the macquarie river 1 12 gl y climate change alone 10 reduction of historical flow reduced mean supplementary water allocations in both river systems 0 51 gl y there was a small increase in long term average supplementary water allocations when a credit resource pool was used and with a small change in climate however the magnitude of these increases were unclear because the coefficients were not significant in the raw regression model fig 3c 3 3 maximising water allocations through management rules of the 16 management scenarios the scenario yielding the highest volume of allocations for all licenses was the debit resource pool with a static balance sheet account limited general security and no forfeit of carryover d s a f for both the gwydir and macquarie rivers this scenario yielded total long term average annual allocations of 208 6 gl y and 391 4 gl y for the two rivers respectively the management scenario yielding the lowest volume of allocations differed between rivers for the gwydir river the credit resource pool availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover c y l n yielded the lowest volume of allocations 196 6 gl y while for the macquarie river the credit resource pool static balance sheet availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover yielded the lowest volume of allocations c s l n 305 5 gl y the current management scenario yielded 208 3 gl y for the gwydir river and 319 6 gl y for the macquarie river for all licenses table 3 changes to management rules varied overall allocations by 11 7 gl y 5 6 and 0 3 gl y 0 1 in the gwydir river and 14 1 gl y 4 4 and 71 8 gl y 22 5 in the macquarie river in the long term based on our model and the available licenses table 1 effects of management rules on water allocations varied among licenses fig 4 for high security water scenarios yielding the highest volume of allocations for the gwydir river were those with the credit resource pool and a dynamic balance sheet c y fig 4 and for the macquarie river were those with the debit resource pool and static balance sheet p 0 05 d s fig 4b in these scenarios high security licenses received full allocations every year scenarios yielding the lowest volume of allocations were those with a credit resource pool and a static balance sheet for the gwydir c s and those with a debit resource pool and a dynamic balance sheet for the macquarie d y p 0 05 of the 16 management scenarios the current scenario was ranked seventh highest in the gwydir and 10th in the macquarie the difference between scenarios with highest and lowest long term average allocations was 6 in the gwydir and 5 in the macquarie for general security water the management scenario yielding the highest volume of allocations for the gwydir and macquarie rivers was the debit resource pool with a static balance sheet account limited general security and forfeit of carryover d s a f fig 4c and 4d the scenario yielding the lowest volume of allocations for the gwydir river was the credit resource pool with a dynamic balance sheet availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover water c y l n fig 4c while in the macquarie river it was the credit resource pool with a static balance sheet availability limited general security and no forfeit of carryover water c s l n fig 4d for the gwydir river the current scenario d s a n yielded the second highest volume of water allocations of all the scenarios tested fig 4c however the current scenario for the macquarie river c y l f was relatively less efficient ranking 11th of 16 scenarios fig 4d the difference between the scenarios yielding lowest and the highest allocations were 2 4 in the gwydir river fig 4c and 13 6 in the macquarie river fig 4d differences between scenarios were statistically significant in the macquarie river but not in the gwydir river figs 4c and 4d for supplementary allocations there was no scenario where allocations exceeded others fig 4f the influence of management rules on long term allocations was small with a 0 3 and 1 5 difference between scenarios yielding the lowest and highest allocations in the gwydir and macquarie rivers respectively differences between scenarios were not statistically significant 4 discussion water available for irrigation and the environment varies considerably between river systems globally and is subject to the water rights framework and government decisions on the allocation of water to those rights ringler et al 2006 gandolfi et al 1997 tilmant et al 2010 understanding water allocations and their drivers particularly the influence of government decisions is fundamental for managing water for extractive and environmental use under uncertainty management rules and the particular river system including demand side variables were the most influential drivers of water allocations in two rivers of australia s most developed large river system the murray darling basin our regional analyses showed management drivers influenced regulated water availability high security general security considerably more than a plausible change in climate fig 2 the impacts of these drivers depended on the type of license effects of management decisions were less pronounced for unregulated water allocations for opportunistic water use supplementary which varied with climate and the river system and more pronounced for allocations regulated by large storages general security fig 2 the influences of management drivers and their inherent trade offs are often overlooked and rarely transparent with important ramifications for water managers license holders table 1 water investors and for uses of water specified through management plans i e planned environmental water australia or ecological reserves south africa hughes and mallory 2008 water allocations were influenced by physical characteristics of river systems e g catchment area storage capacity flow regime water demand relief and land cover fig 2 li et al 2012 regulated water allocations were higher in the macquarie river than the gwydir river fig 3a and b reflecting higher regulation of flows by dams unregulated water allocations were contrastingly higher in the gwydir river where unregulated tributaries contributed larger volumes to overall flows fig 3c flow variability also affects water allocations mcmahon and adeloye 2005 probably reflected by relatively low regulated water allocations in the variable gwydir river fig 3a and b idiosyncratic differences in management rules also significantly affected water allocations fig 3a b and c management rules for resource assessment significantly affected regulated water availability resource pool and balance sheet but contrastingly account management rules carryover penalties and general security limit had little influence over availability fig 3b management rules affected water availability in complex ways including additive synergistic and antagonistic interactions changing uncertainties and risks for example a credit resource pool and dynamic balance sheet increased allocations overall but individually they decreased high security fig 3a and general security fig 3b water allocations a feedback loop probably increased demand and lowered storage volume consequently reducing spills and evaporation losses given the important contribution of storage spills to planned environmental water availability the reduction in dam spills and other unregulated flows may reduce flood extents with adverse impacts on downstream floodplain wetlands and communities including graziers who depend on floodwaters for pasture relative differences in river system characteristics between the gwydir and macquarie river systems had implications for water users given their interactions with management rules average annual inflows into burrendong dam on the macquarie river 755 gl y were almost triple the volume of inflows into copeton dam on the gwydir river 268 gl y while total regulated licence volume in the macquarie river was only slightly greater than in the gwydir river 124 these relative differences meant the credit rule affected larger volumes of general security allocations in the macquarie river compared to the gwydir river also storage capacity in the macquarie river represented more than twice the average inflows 222 while storage capacity in the gwydir river represented five times the annual average inflows 508 consequently the forfeit carryover rule was more relevant i e more likely to be triggered in the macquarie river because storages were more likely to exceed full capacity compared to the gwydir river these findings emphasized important contextual considerations in the application of management rules in different river systems management rules have strong cultural and social dimensions in the two rivers they differed despite both river systems being governed by a single management agency under the same legislative and policy framework i e the water management act 2000 table 2 current management rules in the gwydir river yielded the highest volume of general security allocations among 16 scenarios whereas management rules in the macquarie river ranked 11th fig 4 two rules yielded consistently more general security allocations across catchments debit resource pool static balance sheet fig 4 but effects were not consistent across other license classes management rules also interacted with flow regimes fig 3a b and c highlighting the importance of local context in decision making inconsistent management rules across different licenses and river systems make regulation and compliance difficult climate change is projected to reduce water availability with considerable uncertainty chiew et al 2009 but the relative impact on allocations compared to other drivers was small albeit significant for the gwydir and macquarie rivers this underlined the importance of management rules fig 2 as in other rivers arrigoni et al 2010 beck and bernauer 2011 with increasing climate change severity unregulated water allocations were projected to decrease more than regulated allocations appendix a impacts of long term shifts in hydrologic regime may be underestimated given the limitations of rainfall runoff models in estimating drought impacts vaze et al 2010 hughes and hughes 2018 changes of different magnitudes were not examined e g 10 reduction or increases compared to historical nor did we examine changes to the distribution i e variability of future climate drivers which have important implications for individual events e g increased frequency of extreme floods and droughts but this could be done using our models managing water supply for irrigation and environmental outcomes also requires considering attributes besides volume including the security of allocations and the ability to store and release water from dams with the appropriate variability kingsford and auld 2005 general security account limits currently disadvantage environmental water license holders who require large quantities of water to be stored in dams because they must forfeit water if the account reaches capacity hughes and goesch 2009 limits on water allocations are more favourable for some water users e g the environment because water can accumulate over multiple years kingsford and auld 2005 allowing license holders to manage their own water supply risk and manage for longer term outcomes however a complication is inequitable use of storage space when storage volume reaches capacity in the macquarie river this issue is addressed by imposing limits on the volume of water individuals may carry between water years carryover evaporation penalties may also be used to incentivise the drawdown of water in storage to free airspace but this rule may also lead to increased capture of unregulated high flows which would have otherwise reached downstream ecosystems there is also the potential water security risk of losing access to water during dry periods the credit management approach may fail when water availability is below the historical range e g climate change because water is allocated to users in the expectation of inflows which may not eventuate chiew et al 2009 pittock and finlayson 2011 this can lead to abandoning of water management plans to ensure that essential supplies e g town water supply are maintained for example water management plans were suspended during the millennium drought in rivers using the credit resource pool macquarie murrumbidgee lachlan rivers of the murray darling basin but not in rivers operating under a debit resource pool gwydir namoi or border rivers now 2011 the water management plan for the macquarie river was suspended again in july 2019 due to a critical water shortage nsw government 2019 plan suspension enables environmental water to be appropriated for critical human needs and other high priority consumptive uses water management plans using a credit resource pool are more likely to be suspended in a drying environment with projected reductions in runoff sensitivity analyses were a robust approach to evaluating factors driving water allocations at regional scales while recognizing local heterogeneity results were consistent with studies showing the important influence of management drivers on water availability ringler et al 2006 wang and huang 2012 wurbs and carriere 1993 with expected variation in the magnitude of influence because of the different rules assessed further opportunities to increase allocations to the environment and irrigators may be identified incorporating other rules and through mathematical optimization grafton et al 2011 land management practices e g land cover earthworks reid et al 2011 steinfeld and kingsford 2013 steinfeld et al 2013 may also influence water availability and require integration with water management we evaluated the sensitivity of allocation volumes but sensitivity of drought security flood risk carryover flexibility dam spills minimum flow requirements and storage capacity sharing should also be considered rainfall runoff models may have underestimated variability sharma and o neill 2002 and demand was assumed to be stationary throughout the modelled period steinfeld et al 2015 despite these limitations models were fit for purposes of estimating long term average allocations and comparing scenarios management decisions need to be scientifically defensible and justified welsh et al 2013 given the considerable heterogeneity in drivers of water allocations across river systems table 2 fig 2 clear specification of management rules and effects on water availability is critical for assessing risks developing efficient management rules and facilitating water trade between valleys and licenses young and mccoll 2009 despite this management rules and their effects are often not explicit or properly documented dutta et al 2013 water sharing plans and government reports provided an overview of the water allocation process and described some rules e g general security limit carryover rules however some rules were omitted including the resource pool and balance sheet rules despite their effects on water users and environment for the gwydir and macquarie rivers no public records existed which codified the resource assessment process to reveal how each allocation decision was made or justified the management rules the idiosyncratic and heuristic nature of this process was underscored by the fact that both were governed by the same agency and the legislative and policy frameworks were the same management history parochial knowledge and individual preferences primarily determined this difference lack of knowledge of other drivers potentially affecting availability e g unmetered water use plantations evaporation loss may further undermine water management decisions young and mccoll 2009 there is a clear need for transparency particularly given the water current reforms in australia s murray darling basin which require aligning local water management rules across more than 30 surface and groundwater zones under a single overarching framework for river management the basin plan mdba 2012 2013 greater transparency is also needed in river basins worldwide given the lack of knowledge local water allocation practices and the individual and local influences affecting water distribution schlüter et al 2005 failure to recognize the influence of management drivers may result in system inefficiencies and increased risks to water dependent industries and ecosystems fig 4 our paper analysed the effects of management rules on water allocations for the environment and extractive users but the full extent of trade offs of increased allocations remains to be addressed this includes volumetric trade offs i e impacts of increased water allocations on other flow components and water management objectives and non volumetric trade offs affecting water management objectives i e frequency of storage spills period between allocations suspension of water plans changes to the ability to store water over multiple years some studies have attempted to optimise allocations for extractive use while ensuring sufficient water availability for environmental needs water trading rules in the dong nai river basin in southern vietnam varied water allocations by 38 to 53 while ensuring 10 of inflow was available to meet environmental requirements ringler et al 2006 tilmant et al 2010 illustrated the potential to satisfy water demands in the zambezi river while restoring floods to the delta these are important areas for future research given the multiple benefits of supporting consumptive needs while restoring environmental flows for communities and industries including floodplain grazing fisheries and tourism richter 2010 5 conclusions there is generally little published understanding of human factors driving water availability because management rules are complex and rarely codified and effects are dependent on the local context our findings have considerably more application beyond the gwydir and macquarie rivers of the murray darling basin we modelled drivers of water allocations that are germane to rivers around the world our regional assessment of their effects on regulated and unregulated water allocations showed clear trends across rivers while recognizing important contextual differences a quantitative understanding of the interacting and heterogeneous drivers affecting water availability is vital for effective local and regional water management and planning under uncertainty we showed there were clear effects of different management regimes for two rivers with identical legislative and policy frameworks it is particularly important to adequately capture not only the abiotic drivers of water availability but also idiosyncratic management rules which can have a significant impact on water availability outcomes for all water users and the environment 6 credit authorship contribution statement celine m m steinfeld conceptualization investigation data curation

5303,tracer tests are useful field methods with a wide range of applications in karst aquifers the measured tracer breakthrough curve at a karst spring allows the estimation of the important transport properties of the karst system the breakthrough curve is typically characterized by a long tailing and a low tracer recovery that is not captured by the classical one dimensional advection dispersion model partitioning models are often used and require a large number of parameters in the present work simplified transport models are proposed to simulate the typical karst breakthrough curve the model setup consists of a karst conduit that is interacting laterally with the surrounding matrix the solute transport in both the conduit and matrix are governed by the one dimensional advection dispersion equation and the resulting mathematical model consists of a coupled system of differential equations the laplace transform method is used to derive the transport models for various flow and boundary conditions the models are in terms of four physically meaningful parameters that represent the advection and dispersion properties of the flow in the conduit and matrix algebraic relationships to estimate the model parameters are also derived in terms of the key features of the breakthrough curves the main advantage of the proposed models are their simple formulation and ability to capture the long tailing of the breakthrough curve in terms of just a few parameters application of the models to two real karst aquifers demonstrate their effectiveness in simulating the observed breakthrough curves and estimating the key transport parameters keywords karst hydrology tracer tests breakthrough curves aquifer characterization analytical models laplace transform method karst conduit conduit matrix interaction mathematical modeling inverse modeling moment matching technique 1 introduction tracer tests are valuable field methods to prove underground connections determine flow paths help delineate catchments and estimate important physical properties of the karst system a typical test consists of releasing a tracer into a surface sinkhole and monitoring the concentrations at a nearby spring the resulting breakthrough curve btc offers broad insights into the karst system functioning including flow velocities mean transit times and potential existence of multiple flow paths a typical karst btc displays a long tailing and often exhibits a low tracer recovery depending on the prevailing conditions the effect of the hydrogeological conditions on the tracer recovery and btc s long tailing is still subject to ongoing investigations e g sivelle and labat 2019 tracer loss in karst systems is normally attributed to unknown underground paths goldscheider and drew 2014 tracer storage in slow flow zones or pools mudarra et al 2019 or simply tracer degradation and measurement errors luhmann et al 2012 on the other hand the long tailing is attributed to the presence of immobile or stagnant water zones morales et al 2010 geometric changes in the karst conduit such as pools field and leij 2012 or the diffusive exchange between conduit and matrix that store the tracer and release it after a certain period of time birk et al 2005 goldscheider 2008 understanding flow and transport processes in karst aquifers is essential for water resources management and various methods for analyzing karst systems were proposed e g hartmann et al 2014 most interpretation techniques of the tracer data are based on a transport model that is generally defined in terms of the main transport processes a tracer breakthrough curve is commonly modeled using the classical one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation ade given that ade s main drawback is its inability to simulate the long tailing of the observed btc partitioning models are often used even though they were originally developed for modeling transport in porous media one example of such models is the two region mobile and immobile non equilibrium analytical model 2rne toride et al 1993 that was conveniently integrated into the user friendly interface cxtfit toride et al 1999 and was first adapted to karst systems by field and pinsky 2000 the mobile and immobile regions are supposed to represent respectively the conduit with high flow velocity and the surrounding matrix with zero velocity although cxtfit has been extensively used to simulate karst btcs e g barberá et al 2018 göppert and goldscheider 2008 the interpretation of its partitioning parameters is often problematic because the model is specific to porous media and its parameters are not physically meaningful in a karst system context moreover the model does not take into consideration the transport processes encountered in karst aquifers notably the role of the solute interaction at the conduit matrix interface in altering the shape of the breakthrough curve conduit matrix solute exchange in karst aquifers has been reported in the literature e g katz et al 1998 martin and dean 2001 binet et al 2017 and studied on a laboratory scale by li et al 2008 and faulkner et al 2009 whose experimental results showed solute interaction at the interface and subsequent effect on the breakthrough curve at the outlet thus simple models that consider the transport processes in both the karst conduit and the surrounding matrix are needed for a better interpretation of the breakthrough curves in karst systems the models presented herein are based on the simplest representation of the karst system while preserving the basic transport components the model setup is analogous to the system comprised of a fracture embedded in a porous aquifer system since a conduit can be considered to be a large fracture a number of analytical solutions are available for the problem of solute transport in the coupled fracture porous media system e g tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 roubinet et al 2012 houseworth et al 2013 however these analytical solutions neglect either the advection in the matrix that is potentially responsible of conservative tracer loss or the longitudinal dispersion effects in the fracture few analytical solutions that were developed specifically for karst systems are also based on the assumption of a constant solute exchange at the interface whereby the matrix is acting either as a source of fresh water dilution or contaminated water flushing e g li 2009 2011 li and field 2016 the aim of the present work is to develop simplified transport models that simulate spring breakthrough curves using a basic conceptualization of the karst system a single conduit is embedded in a two dimensional matrix domain with both elements exchanging solute at their common interface fig 1 the governing equation in both the conduit and the matrix is the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with the matrix transport being in the lateral direction perpendicular to the conduit the two dimensional system is thence simplified to two orthogonal coupled one dimensional systems the coupled system of differential equations is solved analytically under various boundary conditions for constant and uniform velocities in the conduit and matrix the models represent the basic transport processes encountered in a karst conduit that is embedded in a fractured matrix and uses a minimal number of conduit and matrix related transport parameters the models are able to capture the long tailing of the observed breakthrough curves and simulate the tracer loss of the conservative tracer they can simulate the concentration in the conduit as well as in the matrix and quantify the potential exchange of solute at the conduit matrix interface the present models are successfully applied to two actual karst systems dyers spring kentucky usa and freiheit spring minnesota usa to help understand their functioning characterize their transport properties and estimate their physical parameters 2 theory the transport of a conservative solute in a conduit of length l l and mean width b l is described by the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with a sink and source terms 1 c t d x 2 c x 2 u c x 2 q b f where c is the solute concentration in the conduit m l3 x is the longitudinal coordinate downslope along the conduit l t is the time t dx is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the conduit l2 t u is the velocity in the conduit flow direction l t q is the loss term at the matrix conduit interface m l2t and f is the rate of mass injection per unit time per unit volume m l3t the coefficient 2 is added to the loss term in order to account for solute exchange on both sides of the conduit the subscript denotes that the variables are in terms of the physical dimensions of the system a schematic representation of the solute transport in the coupled conduit matrix system is illustrated in fig 1 the transport equation in the surrounding matrix is assumed to be one dimensional in the lateral y direction that is perpendicular to the conduit centerline 2 c t d y 2 c y 2 v c y where c is the solute concentration in the matrix m l3 y is the lateral coordinate l dy is the transverse dispersion coefficient in the matrix l2 t and v is the seepage velocity in the matrix l t the solute exchange flux q at the interface y 0 is given by fick s law 3 q φ d y c y y 0 φ v c y 0 where φ is the matrix effective porosity the first term on the right hand side accounts for the diffusive or dispersive flux and the second term represents the advective flux the mass injection is supposed to occur instantaneously in a sinkhole directly connected to a specific point x 0 0 in a conduit that extends in both the upstream and downstream directions 4 f m a δ x x 0 δ t t 0 where m is the mass injected or released m at a specific point x 0 and time of release t 0 in a conduit with a flow area a l2 it is therefore assumed that dispersion occurs in the region x x 0 as well as in the region x x 0 the function δ t t 0 is the dirac delta function that simulates an instantaneous injection in case the injection is considered to be at the beginning of a conduit a flux boundary condition is prescribed at x 0 to simulate the mass injection 5 d x c x u c u c b c b m q δ t t 0 where q u a is the constant flowrate and c b is the prescribed time dependent concentration at the boundary in case of a complete mixing at the boundary the simpler concentration type boundary condition is applicable 6 c c b the boundary condition at the matrix conduit interface is 7 c c t y 0 it is assumed that the conduit and matrix concentrations are not affected by the presence of the physical boundaries of the karst system so c x 0 as x and c y 0 as y the initial concentrations are set equal to zero in both the conduit and matrix c c 0 at t 0 since a tracer should be ideally absent from the system in order to facilitate the breakthrough curve analysis 3 karst transport models to simplify the notation and generalize the results the variables are expressed in dimensionless form using the following definitions 8 x x y y b b d d l o t t t o c c c c c o f f c o t o and 9 u u v v u o q q d x d x d y d y u o l o u o l o t o where l o and t o are the characteristic length l and time t respectively while u o l o t o is the characteristic velocity l t and c o is the normalizing concentration m l3 the characteristic length l o and velocity u o can be set equal to the conduit length l and mean conduit velocity u the characteristic time is then obtained from t o l o u o the normalizing concentration c o can be set equal to 1 mg l or the mass released per flow area a per length l o i e c o m a l o substituting 3 into 1 the coupled system of equations can be expressed in dimensionless form as 10 c t d x 2 c x 2 u c x 2 φ b d y c y v c y 0 f 11 c t d y 2 c y 2 v c y where the dimensionless forcing function f for an instantaneous injection at x 0 0 and t 0 0 is given by 12 f u c i δ t δ x c i c i c o c i m q t o the laplace transform method is best suited for the solution of the coupled linear system of eqs 10 and 11 the laplace transforms of c is defined by 13 c l c 0 c exp p t d t where p is the laplace parameter and laplace transformed variables are hereafter denoted by an overbar the laplace transforms of 10 and 11 for zero initial conditions are 14 p c d x 2 c x 2 u c x 2 φ b d y c y v c y 0 f 15 d y 2 c y 2 v c y p c 0 the solution of 15 for

terms of the laplace parameter p for an instantaneous injection of concentration c i at an upstream location x x 0 0 the concentration in the matrix is obtained from 16 and is particularly useful if well observation data is available eq 18 is designated herein as the karst transport model kti i for injection for a semi infinite medium whereby the flux boundary condition 5 is prescribed at x 0 the solution of 17 is 21 c 2 c b 1 1 θ μ exp 2 μ ξ 1 1 θ μ eq 21 is labeled as the karst transport model ktf f for flux the simplest transport model can be derived from 17 for a semi infinite conduit whereby a concentration boundary condition 6 is prescribed at x 0 22 c c b exp 2 μ ξ 1 1 θ μ eq 22 is hereafter designated as the transport model ktc c for concentration it is also an extended form of the solution obtained by tang et al 1981 eq 25 who considered only dispersive transport in the porous media the analytical inversion of eq 22 is possible and yields an expression for the breakthrough concentration that is explicit in time cf appendix for an instantaneous injection of magnitude c i at the upstream boundary x 0 0 and time t 0 0 i e c b t c i δ t the breakthrough concentration is expressed by a7 23 c c i ϕ ξ 2 π 0 t μ 1 2 ν 1 2 σ 3 2 t σ exp 2 μ ξ μ ξ 2 t σ σ ν μ ϕ t σ ν ϕ 2 4 t σ 2 σ d σ for negligible dispersion d x 0 or μ 1 0 all three models 18 21 and 22 reduce to the kinematic wave kw model 24 c c b exp θ ξ the laplace inverse of 24 with c b c i is 25 c c i κ ν 4 π τ 3 exp 2 τ ν κ 2 4 ν τ u τ τ t ξ where 26 κ ϕ ξ for zero exchange φ 0 or ϕ 0 eq 22 reduces to the classical advection dispersion ad model 27 c c b exp 2 μ ξ 1 1 p μ the laplace inverse of 27 with c b c i is 28 c c i ξ μ π t 3 exp μ t ξ 2 t the transport models kti and ktf are expressed in terms of the laplace parameter p the evaluation in the real time domain can be carried out using the laplace numerical inversion algorithm based on fourier series expansion as formulated by crump 1976 modified by de hoog et al 1982 and implemented by hollenbeck 1998 within the matlab environment 4 parameters estimation the karst transport models are a function of four dimensionless parameters ξ μ ν and ϕ the parameters ξ and μ are in terms of the advection and dispersion properties of the flow in the conduit while the parameters ν and ϕ are in terms of the advection and dispersion properties of the flow in the matrix these parameters can also appear combined in more familiar forms such as the peclet number as shown below one suitable approach to obtain a preliminary estimate of the model parameters is through the use of the moment equations the temporal moments of the concentration are by definition 29 m k 0 t k c d t where k is the order of the moment the moments can also be obtained from the laplace solutions using the moment generating function 30 m k 1 k d k c d p k p 0 the zero moment m 0 is the recovered mass while the first moment m 1 m 0 is a measure of the mean transit time higher order moments define the spread and the skewness of the concentration distribution however they are not as robust as the lower order moments press et al 2007 sec 14 1 using 30 and 22 the moment equations for the ktc model are 31 m 0 c i exp 2 λ 1 1 2 ψ 32 m 1 m 0 ξ 2 υ 2 1 2 ψ where 33 λ μ ξ υ ϕ ν ψ ϕ μ the parameters λ and υ are respectively defined in terms of the conduit and matrix transport properties the parameter λ p e 4 represents the dimensionless peclet number p e of the flow system while the parameter υ is in effect a function of the dispersivity coefficient of the matrix as defined by α y d y v the moment equations for the kti and ktf models are slightly more complex than 31 32 and provide no additional advantage however the moment equations for the kw model are particularly useful 34 m 0 c i exp 2 κ 35 m 1 m 0 ξ κ ν 2 one notices that the recovered mass m 0 is independent of the matrix diffusion related parameter ν and solely dependent on the advection related parameter κ ϕ ξ the parameter ξ is the travel time of the tracer through the conduit while the two parameters κ and ν represent respectively the advective and diffusive exchange at the conduit matrix interface for zero exchange κ ϕ 0 ad model m 0 c i and m 1 m 0 ξ as expected a preliminary estimate of the parameters can be obtained from the above moment equations and approximate solutions using the zero moment of the kw model 34 the advective exchange parameter κ is 36 κ log m 0 c i 2 for an instantaneous injection the travel time ξ is nearly equal to the time to peak i e 37 ξ t p the parameter ϕ is then 38 ϕ κ ξ using the first moment of the kw model 35 and the calculated centroid of the breakthrough curve m 1 m 0 the parameter ν is 39 ν 2 κ m 1 m 0 ξ the dispersion related parameter μ is obtained from fitting the rising limb of the breakthrough curve using the ad model 28 and any two concentration values c 1 and c 2 at times t 1 and t 2 using the peak concentration c p at t ξ as one of the concentration values the parameter μ can then be estimated from 40 μ t 1 ξ t 1 2 ln c p c 1 ξ 3 2 t 1 3 2 5 breakthrough curve analysis five transport models for simulating the breakthrough curves were derived the three karst transport models kti ktf ktc pertain to different flow and boundary conditions the kinematic wave model kw apply to the case of negligible dispersion in the conduit and the classical advection dispersion model ad is only relevant here for negligible interaction with the matrix the output of the different models is herein generated for different values of the parameters in order to highlight the contribution of each in shaping the karst btc fig 2 compares the breakthrough curves of all five transport models for an instantaneous injection of unit mass at time t 0 0 the curves are generated from 18 21 22 25 and 28 using the following parameter values ξ 1 μ 10 ν 1 5 and ϕ 0 5 the selected parameter values correspond to a peclet value of 40 the ad model represents the outlet concentration for zero exchange so the area under the concentration curve is equal to unity m 0 1 while the other four models portray the breakthrough curves for a mass loss of around 63 the three kt transport models kti ktf ktc have similar output and become indistinguishable at high λ or peclet values λ 100 p e 400 as is often found in karst conduits the kt breakthrough curves are slightly lagging behind each other the kti model produces the leading btc due to the added effect of the concentration gradient at the injection point the latter effect is reduced in the ktf model and it is non existent in the ktc model since complete mixing is assumed at the inlet the kw model produces a sharp rise in the btc due to the application of the sudden mass injection and the neglect of the longitudinal dispersion effect although the shape of the kw btc is completely different than the ones of the kt models the recovered mass at the outlet m 0 for all four models are very close it varies between 0 36 for kti and 0 38 for ktc while it is equal to 0 37 for the kw model this particular result justifies the use of eq 36 in estimating the parameter κ even if the simulated btc is not an acceptable fit fig 3 displays the breakthrough curves of the ktc model for ξ 1 μ 10 and different values of the parameters ν and ϕ as shown both parameters control the solute exchange at the conduit matrix interface the parameter ϕ reflects the advective component while ν represents the diffusive component of the solute exchange flux the parameter ϕ controls mainly the mass loss into the matrix with only a slight effect on the spread the parameter ν has no effect on the mass recovery rate but it has a significant effect on the spread and skewness as shown by the long tailing of the btc that is a characteristic feature of karst 6 models application the transport models are tested on two real karst systems that have been previously investigated dyers spring e g field and leij 2014 and freiheit spring luhmann et al 2012 the selected tests consist of an almost instantaneous tracer release that is best modeled using the impulse forcing function 12 the initial estimates of the model parameters are obtained from the above algebraic relationships 36 40 and they are subsequently refined using the nonlinear least squares matlab routine that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and simulated breakthrough curves the model performance is evaluated using the nash sutcliffe nse measure of goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean squared error rmse meaningful transport parameters are deduced from the lumped model parameters using plausible estimates of the geometric properties of the aquifer 6 1 dyers spring kentucky usa the dyers spring elizabethtown kentucky is the output of a sinkhole conduit system located in the st louis limestone formation the spring has been subject to several tracer tests conducted by usgs that aimed to prove a connection between the spring and a karst window located approximately 1373 m upstream mull et al 1988 rhodamine wt was released in the window and recovered at the spring for all tests thus confirming the presence of an underground conduit system connecting the two the selected btcs are extracted from mull et al 1988 pp 75 77 four of the selected btcs t19 t22 display low recovery rates as well as a long tailing signaling both advective and diffusive exchange at the interface on the other hand t16 t17 and t26 show no mass loss at higher discharge rates thus ruling out the possibility of losing tracer to a side conduit system mull et al 1988 reports all concentrations in milligrams per liter per kilogram injected while normalizing with respect to the recovery rate consequently all extracted btcs were multiplied by the injected mass and recovery rates from mull et al 1988 table 7 in order to convert from normalized to actual concentrations in micrograms per liter high resolution discharge data is not available with only average spring flowrates being reported in mull et al 1988 table 7 fig 4 shows the observed and the simulated breakthrough curve of t20 using the kti model with the following fitted parameters ξ 0 58 μ 191 ν 2 2 and ϕ 0 35 nse 0 991 rmse 0 127 noting that the ktc and ktf models gave very close results the simulated btc was computed for the prescribed instantaneous injection of mass of 3 57 g that corresponds to c i 1 28 μg l for the given mean discharge of 32 28 l s with t o 86400 s cf eq 12 also shown in fig 4 are the computed btc using the preliminary estimates of the parameters kti m as calculated from the moment equations 36 40 ξ 0 61 μ 163 ν 0 89 and ϕ 0 38 nse 0 903 rmse 0 422 as well as the kw prediction with κ 0 23 ξ 0 57 and ν 4 24 obtained from 36 and from fitting the time to peak and the peak concentration using 25 the fit of kti m can be significantly improved if the parameter μ 147 is estimated from 18 using an optimization routine rather than estimated from the ad analytical solution 28 although the kw model fails to simulate the observed rising limb it captures the recession limb of the btc quite well one can therefore conclude that conduit dispersion is an important transport process that cannot be disregarded in tracer analysis even if the peclet number is large p e 444 this is especially true here because of the instantaneous type of tracer injection that creates a sharp rise in the btc the selected t20 btc was previously simulated by field and pinsky 2000 and field and leij 2014 using the basic one dimensional ad model with 4 parameters the partitioning 2rne model with 7 parameters and the physical and chemical non equilibrium transport pcne model with 12 parameters both ad and 2rne models failed to simulate the long tailing of the btc while the pcne was more successful in this endeavor furthermore the mass released per unit area was one of the fitting parameters in order to simulate the tracer loss in the system the proposed kti model was able to reproduce the measured breakthrough curve including its long tailing using the measured injected mass and with just a few parameters in fact three of the four parameters can be quickly estimated from the moment equations and the time to peak whereas only the parameter μ requires the use of an optimization routine for a good fit the excellent fit of the kti model matches or exceeds in accuracy the existing models while requiring a smaller number of parameters the model parameters can be related to the physical properties of the system given the approximate length of the conduit l one can estimate the velocity of the flow in the conduit u from ξ l u using the value of u one can calculate the dispersion parameter d x from μ u 2 4 d x and the flow area a from the measured flow rate q u a the dimension of the conduit can also be estimated from the computed flow area for a circular conduit the radius is r a π while for a square conduit the width or side is b a for a given value of the effective porosity φ the transport parameters of the aquifer v and d y can be estimated from ϕ φ v b and ν 4 d y v 2 respectively table 1 presents a summary of the fitting results for the selected tracer tests t19 t22 in dyers spring showing a high goodness of fit with nse values exceeding 0 99 the physical values of the parameters were calculated assuming that the average effective porosity of the st louis limestone formation is φ 0 8 manger 1963 p e29 and the length of the conduit is 1373 m mull et al 1988 one notices that the average conduit area or side as well as the dispersivity of the conduit α x d x u and aquifer α y d y v are found to be relatively constant at different flowrates which further validate the proposed model typical values for the seepage velocity for all types of aquifers range from 0 0125 mm h to 10 m h gelhar et al 1992 zhou et al 2007 with porous and fractured aquifers representing the lower and upper ranges respectively the physical values of the matrix velocity therefore indicate the presence of a rather fractured limestone matrix around the conduit the matrix dispersivity values α y also fall in the range of 1 to 100 m for fractured and limestone aquifers as reported by gelhar et al 1992 one concludes that the estimated physical parameters for dyers system fall within the acceptable range reported in the literature for fractured limestone aquifers which further corroborate the modeling results 6 2 freiheit spring minnesota usa the freiheit spring is located in southeastern minnesota and originates from a mixed limestone and dolostone formation having a low aquifer porosity and permeability a spring recharge test was conducted on august 30 2010 at time 16 01 01 whereby a pool containing 13 m3 of water 5 131 g of uranine as well as 32 91 kgs of salt was emptied into a sinkhole located 95 m away from the spring it took 3 min and 34 s in order to drain the pool with the water initially ponding in the sinkhole the uranine concentrations were measured at one minute intervals from 16 01 00 to 17 02 00 and at two minute intervals afterwards the average spring discharge during the tracer event is around 28 l s and uranine was initially absent from the system the freiheit data collection methodology is described in luhmann 2011 and the btcs for uranine is extracted from its appendix b fig 5 shows the observed and fitted breakthrough curve using the kti model with ξ 0 45 μ 60 ν 2 6 and ϕ 0 38 nse 0 999 rmse 1 111 the simulated btc was computed for the prescribed instantaneous injection with a concentration of c i 50 9 μg l given the abovementioned mass and discharge values and t o 3600 s both the ktc and ktf models gave very similar results the preliminary estimates using the moment equations 36 40 were close ξ 0 48 μ 59 ν 1 1 and ϕ 0 39 although the fit misses the peak concentration by 15 as shown by the kti m curve the error in the peak value can be reduced to 3 if a least squares fit of the single parameter μ 44 is used while keeping the remaining parameters fixed at their initial estimates also shown in fig 5 is the kw prediction using κ 0 187 ξ 0 44 and ν 8 2 thereby highlighting the importance of accounting for conduit dispersion the physical parameters can be obtained from the dimensionless model parameters given the length of the conduit and the effective porosity of the matrix using l 143 m luhmann et al 2012 the conduit velocity is u l ξ 315 m h given that q 28 l s the flow area is then a q u 0 32 m2 and the diameter of the conduit is d 0 64 m which is also the value calculated by luhmann et al 2012 by taking the total volume discharged at the spring and dividing it by the total distance between the sinkhole and spring the dispersion parameter d x is obtained from d x u 2 4 μ 414 m2 h and the dispersivity is α x d x u 1 3 m assuming an effective porosity φ of 5 for a limestone formation goldscheider and drew 2014 the transport parameters of the aquifer for a conduit width of b a 0 57 m are v b ϕ φ 4 3 m h d y ν v 2 4 12 1 m2 h and α y d y v 2 8 m the latter value falls in the range of 1 to 100 m for fractured and limestone aquifers as reported by gelhar et al 1992 the physical value of the matrix velocity indicates again the presence of a highly fractured matrix around the conduit as it is within the range of groundwater pore velocity that is reported by zhou et al 2007 fig 2b for fractured aquifers one indication of the large advective solute flux is the possible presence of underground paths that diverted part of the tracer given that a simultaneous loss of tracers and water 22 occurred during the test although such a situation is best modeled as localized exchanges at a specific point along the conduit if known the present model assumes that such exchange is continuous along the whole length of the conduit nevertheless the model helps infer the predominant transport process in the karst system 7 conclusions simple transport models for karst systems were developed to simulate the typical shape of the breakthrough curve that is characterized by a long tailing and low tracer recovery the models are based on the one dimensional advection dispersion equation that governs the solute transport in both the conduit and the surrounding matrix with the exchange flux being expressed via fick s law they are stated in a dimensionless form that reduced the number of fitting parameters to four dimensionless parameters that are directly related to the transport properties of the flow in the conduit and in the matrix algebraic relationships in terms of the key attributes of the breakthrough curve were also derived to provide a preliminary estimate of the model parameters and facilitate the estimation of the physical properties of the system although the present study was primarily concerned with the breakthrough concentration of an instantaneous injection of a tracer the models can handle any time varying solute injection whether a tracer or a pollutant through the use of the convolution integral a8 the models can also simulate the concentration in the matrix domain 16 and predict the extent of the solute spread into the aquifer in case well observations are available a simultaneous fit of the karst spring and matrix btcs can achieve a more refined estimate of the transport parameters one can also evaluate the solute exchange flux that is of interest in karst vulnerability and contaminant sequestration studies consequently the models can be useful in the preliminary assessment of accidental pollutant spills it should be noted that the models assume a constant conduit velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient throughout the simulation period therefore they cannot handle large variations of conduit velocities that are observed during flood events the models are best suited for tracer tests that are performed under constant flowrate conditions the constant velocity condition is a common assumption to all transport models as it greatly simplifies the mathematical development the advection flux is also taken to be one directional from the conduit towards the matrix which implies that the prevailing hydraulic conditions in the conduit are great enough to create such a head gradient at the interface a higher hydraulic head in the conduit can be caused by natural conditions e g concentrated recharge event or artificial conditions e g pool dumping of tracers the tracer loss and low recovery rates are also assumed to be the result of advective exchange occurring throughout the whole length of the conduit rather than at specific points or segments that is the exchange is assumed continuous and constant along the conduit length which may not be the case in a matrix domain with preferential flow paths finally the transport models neglect tracer loss that is due to tracer reaction or depletion and do not account for the presence of pools or stagnant conduit areas that can cause lower recovery rates the present models were developed in line with the principle of parsimony whereby the structure of the model was reduced to the basic components that describe the key transport processes in a karst system although karst dynamics are naturally more complex than the ones presented in this work the models allow the assessment of the contribution of the basic advection and dispersion processes in the absence of information that is often encountered in karst systems and the dearth of supporting evidence for particular transport mechanisms a parsimonious model in terms of the key processes of advection and dispersion is suitable the values of the fitted parameters can then help indicate whether the model assumptions are valid for a particular system the proposed models succeeded in simulating the observed breakthrough curves at two real karst springs matching or exceeding in accuracy the partitioning models in current use while employing a reduced number of parameters that are more physically meaningful an over parametrized model is usually faced with issues related to parameter uncertainties and non uniqueness in addition to the consequent misinterpretation of the results given the various hydrological uncertainties the successful application examples demonstrate that the present models are simple and effective tools for the characterization of a karst system and can prove to be valuable for water resources

5303,tracer tests are useful field methods with a wide range of applications in karst aquifers the measured tracer breakthrough curve at a karst spring allows the estimation of the important transport properties of the karst system the breakthrough curve is typically characterized by a long tailing and a low tracer recovery that is not captured by the classical one dimensional advection dispersion model partitioning models are often used and require a large number of parameters in the present work simplified transport models are proposed to simulate the typical karst breakthrough curve the model setup consists of a karst conduit that is interacting laterally with the surrounding matrix the solute transport in both the conduit and matrix are governed by the one dimensional advection dispersion equation and the resulting mathematical model consists of a coupled system of differential equations the laplace transform method is used to derive the transport models for various flow and boundary conditions the models are in terms of four physically meaningful parameters that represent the advection and dispersion properties of the flow in the conduit and matrix algebraic relationships to estimate the model parameters are also derived in terms of the key features of the breakthrough curves the main advantage of the proposed models are their simple formulation and ability to capture the long tailing of the breakthrough curve in terms of just a few parameters application of the models to two real karst aquifers demonstrate their effectiveness in simulating the

karst conduit conduit matrix interaction mathematical modeling inverse modeling moment matching technique 1 introduction tracer tests are valuable field methods to prove underground connections determine flow paths help delineate catchments and estimate important physical properties of the karst system a typical test consists of releasing a tracer into a surface sinkhole and monitoring the concentrations at a nearby spring the resulting breakthrough curve btc offers broad insights into the karst system functioning including flow velocities mean transit times and potential existence of multiple flow paths a typical karst btc displays a long tailing and often exhibits a low tracer recovery depending on the prevailing conditions the effect of the hydrogeological conditions on the tracer recovery and btc s long tailing is still subject to ongoing investigations e g sivelle and labat 2019 tracer loss in karst systems is normally attributed to unknown underground paths goldscheider and drew 2014 tracer storage in slow flow zones or pools mudarra et al 2019 or simply tracer degradation and measurement errors luhmann et al 2012 on the other hand the long tailing is attributed to the presence of immobile or stagnant water zones morales et al 2010 geometric changes in the karst conduit such as pools field and leij 2012 or the diffusive exchange between conduit and matrix that store the tracer and release it after a certain period of time birk et al 2005 goldscheider 2008 understanding flow and transport processes in karst aquifers is essential for water resources management and various methods for analyzing karst systems were proposed e g hartmann et al 2014 most interpretation techniques of the tracer data are based on a transport model that is generally defined in terms of the main transport processes a tracer breakthrough curve is commonly modeled using the classical one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation ade given that ade s main drawback is its inability to simulate the long tailing of the observed btc partitioning models are often used even though they were originally developed for modeling transport in porous media one example of such models is the two region mobile and immobile non equilibrium analytical model 2rne toride et al 1993 that was conveniently integrated into the user friendly interface cxtfit toride et al 1999 and was first adapted to karst systems by field and pinsky 2000 the mobile and immobile regions are supposed to represent respectively the conduit with high flow velocity and the surrounding matrix with zero velocity although cxtfit has been extensively used to simulate karst btcs e g barberá et al 2018 göppert and goldscheider 2008 the interpretation of its partitioning parameters is often problematic because the model is specific to porous media and its parameters are not physically meaningful in a karst system context moreover the model does not take into consideration the transport processes encountered in karst aquifers notably the role of the solute interaction at the conduit matrix interface in altering the shape of the breakthrough curve conduit matrix solute exchange in karst aquifers has been reported in the literature e g katz et al 1998 martin and dean 2001 binet et al 2017 and studied on a laboratory scale by li et al 2008 and faulkner et al 2009 whose experimental results showed solute interaction at the interface and subsequent effect on the breakthrough curve at the outlet thus simple models that consider the transport processes in both the karst conduit and the surrounding matrix are needed for a better interpretation of the breakthrough curves in karst systems the models presented herein are based on the simplest representation of the karst system while preserving the basic transport components the model setup is analogous to the system comprised of a fracture embedded in a porous aquifer system since a conduit can be considered to be a large fracture a number of analytical solutions are available for the problem of solute transport in the coupled fracture porous media system e g tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 roubinet et al 2012 houseworth et al 2013 however these analytical solutions neglect either the advection in the matrix that is potentially responsible of conservative tracer loss or the longitudinal dispersion effects in the fracture few analytical solutions that were developed specifically for karst systems are also based on the assumption of a constant solute exchange at the interface whereby the matrix is acting either as a source of fresh water dilution or contaminated water flushing e g li 2009 2011 li and field 2016 the aim of the present work is to develop simplified transport models that simulate spring breakthrough curves using a basic conceptualization of the karst system a single conduit is embedded in a two dimensional matrix domain with both elements exchanging solute at their common interface fig 1 the governing equation in both the conduit and the matrix is the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with the matrix transport being in the lateral direction perpendicular to the conduit the two dimensional system is thence simplified to two orthogonal coupled one dimensional systems the coupled system of differential equations is solved analytically under various boundary conditions for constant and uniform velocities in the conduit and matrix the models represent the basic transport processes encountered in a karst conduit that is embedded in a fractured matrix and uses a minimal number of conduit and matrix related transport parameters the models are able to capture the long tailing of the observed breakthrough curves and simulate the tracer loss of the conservative tracer they can simulate the concentration in the conduit as well as in the matrix and quantify the potential exchange of solute at the conduit matrix interface the present models are successfully applied to two actual karst systems dyers spring kentucky usa and freiheit spring minnesota usa to help understand their functioning characterize their transport properties and estimate their physical parameters 2 theory the transport of a conservative solute in a conduit of length l l and mean width b l is described by the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with a sink and source terms 1 c t d x 2 c x 2 u c x 2 q b f where c is the solute concentration in the conduit m l3 x is the longitudinal coordinate downslope along the conduit l t is the time t dx is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the conduit l2 t u is the velocity in the conduit flow direction l t q is the loss term at the matrix conduit interface m l2t and f is the rate of mass injection per unit time per unit volume m l3t the coefficient 2 is added to the loss term in order to account for solute exchange on both sides of the conduit the subscript denotes that the variables are in terms of the physical dimensions of the system a schematic representation of the solute transport in the coupled conduit matrix system is illustrated in fig 1 the transport equation in the surrounding matrix is assumed to be one dimensional in the lateral y direction that is perpendicular to the conduit centerline 2 c t d y 2 c y 2 v c y where c is the solute concentration in the matrix m l3 y is the lateral coordinate l dy is the transverse dispersion coefficient in the matrix l2 t and v is the seepage velocity in the matrix l t the solute exchange flux q at the interface y 0 is given by fick s law 3 q φ d y c y y 0 φ v c y 0 where φ is the matrix effective porosity the first term on the right hand side accounts for the diffusive or dispersive flux and the second term represents the advective flux the mass injection is supposed to occur instantaneously in a sinkhole directly connected to a specific point x 0 0 in a conduit that extends in both the upstream and downstream directions 4 f m a δ x x 0 δ t t 0 where m is the mass injected or released m at a specific point x 0 and time of release t 0 in a conduit with a flow area a l2 it is therefore assumed that dispersion occurs in the region x x 0 as well as in the region x x 0 the function δ t t 0 is the dirac delta function that simulates an instantaneous injection in case the injection is considered to be at the beginning of a conduit a flux boundary condition is prescribed at x 0 to simulate the mass injection 5 d x c x u c u c b c b m q δ t t 0 where q u a is the constant flowrate and c b is the prescribed time dependent concentration at the boundary in case of a complete mixing at the boundary the simpler concentration type boundary condition is applicable 6 c c b the boundary condition at the matrix conduit interface is 7 c c t y 0 it is assumed that the conduit and matrix concentrations are not affected by the presence of the physical boundaries of the karst system so c x 0 as x and c y 0 as y the initial concentrations are set equal to zero in both the conduit and matrix c c 0 at t 0 since a tracer should be ideally absent from the system in order to facilitate the breakthrough curve analysis 3 karst transport models to simplify the notation and generalize the results the variables are expressed in dimensionless form using the following definitions 8 x x y y b b d d l o t t t o c c c c c o f f c o t o and 9 u u v v u o q q d x d x d y d y u o l o u o l o t o where l o and t o are the characteristic length l

conduit length l and mean conduit velocity u the characteristic time is then obtained from t o l o u o the normalizing concentration c o can be set equal to 1 mg l or the mass released per flow area a per length l o i e c o m a l o substituting 3 into 1 the coupled system of equations can be expressed in dimensionless form as 10 c t d x 2 c x 2 u c x 2 φ b d y c y v c y 0 f 11 c t d y 2 c y 2 v c y

the laplace parameter p the evaluation in the real time domain can be carried out using the laplace numerical inversion algorithm based on fourier series expansion as formulated by crump 1976 modified by de hoog et al 1982 and implemented by hollenbeck 1998 within the matlab environment 4 parameters estimation the karst transport models are a function of four dimensionless parameters ξ μ ν and ϕ the parameters ξ and μ are in terms of the advection and dispersion properties of the flow in the conduit while the parameters ν and ϕ are in terms of the advection and dispersion properties of the flow in the matrix these parameters can also appear combined in more familiar forms such as the peclet number as shown below one suitable approach to obtain a preliminary estimate of the model parameters is through the use of the moment equations the temporal moments of the concentration are by definition 29 m k 0 t k c d t where k is the order of the moment the moments can also be obtained from the laplace solutions using the moment generating function 30 m k 1 k d k c d p k p 0 the zero moment m 0 is the recovered mass while the first moment m 1 m 0 is a measure of the mean transit time higher order moments define the spread and the skewness of the concentration distribution however they are not as robust as the lower order moments press et al 2007 sec 14 1 using 30 and 22 the moment equations for the ktc model are 31 m 0 c i exp 2 λ 1 1 2 ψ 32 m 1 m 0 ξ 2 υ 2 1 2 ψ where 33 λ μ ξ υ ϕ ν ψ ϕ μ the parameters λ and υ are respectively defined in terms of the conduit and matrix transport properties the parameter λ p e 4 represents the dimensionless peclet number p e of the flow system while the parameter υ is in effect a function of the dispersivity coefficient of the matrix as defined by α y d y v the moment equations for the kti and ktf models are slightly more complex than 31 32 and provide no additional advantage however the moment equations for the kw model are particularly useful 34 m 0 c i exp 2 κ 35 m 1 m 0 ξ κ ν 2 one notices that the recovered mass m 0 is independent of the matrix diffusion related parameter ν and solely dependent on the advection related parameter κ ϕ ξ the parameter ξ is the travel time of the tracer through the conduit while the two parameters κ and ν represent respectively the advective and diffusive exchange at the conduit matrix interface for zero exchange κ ϕ 0 ad model m 0 c i and m 1 m 0 ξ as expected a preliminary estimate of the parameters can be obtained from the above moment equations and approximate solutions using the zero moment of the kw model 34 the advective exchange parameter κ is 36 κ log m 0 c i 2 for an instantaneous injection the travel time ξ is nearly equal to the time to peak i e 37 ξ t p the parameter ϕ is then 38 ϕ κ ξ using the first moment of the kw model 35 and the calculated centroid of the breakthrough curve m 1 m 0 the parameter ν is 39 ν 2 κ m 1 m 0 ξ the dispersion related parameter μ is obtained from fitting the rising limb of the breakthrough curve using the ad model 28 and any two concentration values c 1 and c 2 at times t 1 and t 2 using the peak concentration c p at t ξ as one of the concentration values the parameter μ can then be estimated from 40 μ t 1 ξ t 1 2 ln c p c 1 ξ 3 2 t 1 3 2 5 breakthrough curve analysis five transport models for simulating the breakthrough curves were derived the three karst transport models kti ktf ktc pertain to different flow and boundary conditions the kinematic wave model kw apply to the case of negligible dispersion in the conduit and the classical advection dispersion model ad is only relevant here for negligible interaction with the matrix the output of the different models is herein generated for different values of the parameters in order to highlight the contribution of each in shaping the karst btc fig 2 compares the breakthrough curves of all five transport models for an instantaneous injection of unit mass at time t 0 0 the curves are generated from 18 21 22 25 and 28 using the following parameter values ξ 1 μ 10 ν 1 5 and ϕ 0 5 the selected parameter values correspond to a peclet value of 40 the ad model represents the outlet concentration for zero exchange so the area under the concentration curve is equal to unity m 0 1 while the other four models portray the breakthrough curves for a mass loss of around 63 the three kt transport models kti ktf ktc have similar output and become indistinguishable at high λ or peclet values λ 100 p e 400 as is often found in karst conduits the kt breakthrough curves are slightly lagging behind each other the kti model produces the leading btc due to the added effect of the concentration gradient at the injection point the latter effect is reduced in the ktf model and it is non existent in the ktc model since complete mixing is assumed at the inlet the kw model produces a sharp rise in the btc due to the application of the sudden mass injection and the neglect of the longitudinal dispersion effect although the shape of the kw btc is completely different than the ones of the kt models the recovered mass at the outlet m 0 for all four models are very close it varies between 0 36 for kti and 0 38 for ktc while it is equal to 0 37 for the kw model this particular result justifies the use of eq 36 in estimating the parameter κ even if the simulated btc is not an acceptable fit fig 3 displays the breakthrough curves of the ktc model for ξ 1 μ 10 and different values of the parameters ν and ϕ as shown both parameters control the solute exchange at the conduit matrix interface the parameter ϕ reflects the advective component while ν represents the diffusive component of the solute exchange flux the parameter ϕ controls mainly the mass loss into the matrix with only a slight effect on the spread the parameter ν has no effect on the mass recovery rate but it has a significant effect on the spread and skewness as shown by the long tailing of the btc that is a characteristic feature of karst 6 models application the transport models are tested on two real karst systems that have been previously investigated dyers spring e g field and leij 2014 and freiheit spring luhmann et al 2012 the selected tests consist of an almost instantaneous tracer release that is best modeled using the impulse forcing function 12 the initial estimates of the model parameters are obtained from the above algebraic relationships 36 40 and they are subsequently refined using the nonlinear least squares matlab routine that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and simulated breakthrough curves the model performance is evaluated using the nash sutcliffe nse measure of goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean squared error rmse meaningful transport parameters are deduced from the lumped model parameters using plausible estimates of the geometric properties of the aquifer 6 1 dyers spring kentucky usa the dyers spring elizabethtown kentucky is the output of a sinkhole conduit system located in the st louis limestone formation the spring has been subject to several tracer tests conducted by usgs that aimed to prove a connection between the spring and a karst window located approximately 1373 m upstream mull et al 1988 rhodamine wt was released in the window and recovered at the spring for all tests thus confirming the presence of an underground conduit system connecting the two the selected btcs are extracted from mull et al 1988 pp 75 77 four of the selected btcs t19 t22 display low recovery rates as well as a long tailing signaling both advective and diffusive exchange at the interface on the other hand t16 t17 and t26 show no mass loss at higher discharge rates thus ruling out the possibility of losing tracer to a side conduit system mull et al 1988 reports all concentrations in milligrams per liter per kilogram injected while normalizing with respect to the recovery rate consequently all extracted btcs were multiplied by the injected mass and recovery rates from mull et al 1988 table 7 in order to convert from normalized to actual concentrations in micrograms per liter high resolution discharge data is not available with only average spring flowrates being reported in mull et al 1988 table 7 fig 4 shows the observed and the simulated breakthrough curve of t20 using the kti model with the following fitted parameters ξ 0 58 μ 191 ν 2 2 and ϕ 0 35 nse 0 991 rmse 0 127 noting that the ktc and ktf models gave very close results the simulated btc was computed for the prescribed instantaneous injection of mass of 3 57 g that corresponds to c i 1 28 μg l for the given mean discharge of 32 28 l s with t o 86400 s cf eq 12 also shown in fig 4 are the computed btc using the preliminary estimates of the parameters kti m as calculated from the moment equations 36 40 ξ 0 61 μ 163 ν 0 89 and ϕ 0 38 nse 0 903 rmse 0 422 as well as the kw prediction with κ 0 23 ξ 0 57 and ν 4 24 obtained from 36 and from fitting the time to peak and the peak concentration using 25 the fit of kti m can be significantly improved if the parameter μ 147 is estimated from 18 using an optimization routine rather than estimated from the ad analytical solution 28 although the kw model fails to simulate the observed rising limb it captures the recession limb of the btc quite well one can therefore conclude that conduit dispersion is an important transport process that cannot be disregarded in tracer analysis even if the peclet number is large p e 444 this is especially true here because of the instantaneous type of tracer injection that creates a sharp rise in the btc the selected t20 btc was previously simulated by field and pinsky 2000 and field and leij 2014 using the basic one dimensional ad model with 4 parameters the partitioning 2rne model with 7 parameters and the physical and chemical non equilibrium transport pcne model with 12 parameters both ad and 2rne models failed to simulate the long tailing of the btc while the pcne was more successful in this endeavor furthermore the mass released per unit area was one of the fitting parameters in order to simulate the tracer loss in the system the proposed kti model was able to reproduce the measured breakthrough curve including its long tailing using the measured injected mass and with just a few parameters in fact three of the four parameters can be quickly estimated from the moment equations and the time to peak whereas only the parameter μ requires the use of an optimization routine for a good fit the excellent fit of the kti model matches or exceeds in accuracy the existing models while requiring a smaller number of parameters the model parameters can be related to the physical properties of the system given the approximate length of the conduit l one can estimate the velocity of the flow in the conduit u from ξ l u using the value of u one can calculate the dispersion parameter d x from μ u 2 4 d x and the flow area a from the measured flow rate q u a the dimension of the conduit can also be estimated from the computed flow area for a circular conduit the radius is r a π while for a square conduit the width or side is b a for a given value of the effective porosity φ the transport parameters of the aquifer v and d y can be estimated from ϕ φ v b and ν 4 d y v 2 respectively table 1 presents a summary of the fitting results for the selected tracer tests t19 t22 in dyers spring showing a high goodness of fit with nse values exceeding 0 99 the physical values of the parameters were calculated assuming that the average effective porosity of the st louis limestone formation is φ 0 8 manger 1963 p e29 and the length of the conduit is 1373 m mull et al 1988 one notices that the average conduit area or side as well as the dispersivity of the conduit α x d x u and aquifer α y d y v are found to be relatively constant at different flowrates which further validate the proposed model typical values for the seepage velocity for all types of aquifers range from 0 0125 mm h to 10 m h gelhar et al 1992 zhou et al 2007 with porous and fractured aquifers representing the lower and upper ranges respectively the physical values of the matrix velocity therefore indicate the presence of a rather fractured limestone matrix around the conduit the matrix dispersivity values α y also fall in the range of 1 to 100 m for fractured and limestone aquifers as reported by gelhar et al 1992 one concludes that the estimated physical parameters for dyers system fall within the acceptable range reported in the literature for fractured limestone aquifers which further corroborate the modeling results 6 2 freiheit spring minnesota usa the freiheit spring is located in southeastern minnesota and originates from a mixed limestone and dolostone formation having a low aquifer porosity and permeability a spring recharge test was conducted on august 30 2010 at time 16 01 01 whereby a pool containing 13 m3 of water 5 131 g of uranine as well as 32 91 kgs of salt was emptied into a sinkhole located 95 m away from the spring it took 3 min and 34 s in order to drain the pool with the water initially ponding in the sinkhole the uranine concentrations were measured at one minute intervals from 16 01 00 to 17 02 00 and at two minute intervals afterwards the average spring discharge during the tracer event is around 28 l s and uranine was initially absent from the system the freiheit data collection methodology is described in luhmann 2011 and the btcs for uranine is extracted from its appendix b fig 5 shows the observed and fitted breakthrough curve using the kti model with ξ 0 45 μ 60 ν 2 6 and ϕ 0 38 nse 0 999 rmse 1 111 the simulated btc was computed for the prescribed instantaneous injection with a concentration of c i 50 9 μg l given the abovementioned mass and discharge values and t o 3600 s both the ktc and ktf models gave very similar results the preliminary estimates using the moment equations 36 40 were close ξ 0 48 μ 59 ν 1 1 and ϕ 0 39 although the fit misses the peak concentration by 15 as shown by the kti m curve the error in the peak value can be reduced to 3 if a least squares fit of the single parameter μ 44 is used while keeping the remaining parameters fixed at their initial estimates also shown in fig 5 is the kw prediction using κ 0 187 ξ 0 44 and ν 8 2 thereby highlighting the importance of accounting for conduit dispersion the physical parameters can be obtained from the dimensionless model parameters given the length of the conduit and the effective porosity of the matrix using l 143 m luhmann et al 2012 the conduit velocity is u l ξ 315 m h given that q 28 l s the flow area is then a q u 0 32 m2 and the diameter of the conduit is d 0 64 m which is also the value calculated by luhmann et al 2012 by taking the total volume discharged at the spring and dividing it by the total distance between the sinkhole and spring the dispersion parameter d x is obtained from d x u 2 4 μ 414 m2 h and the dispersivity is α x d x u 1 3 m assuming an effective porosity φ of 5 for a limestone formation goldscheider and drew 2014 the transport parameters of the aquifer for a conduit width of b a 0 57 m are v b ϕ φ 4 3 m h d y ν v 2 4 12 1 m2 h and α y d y v 2 8 m the latter value falls in the range of 1 to 100 m for fractured and limestone aquifers as reported by gelhar et al 1992 the physical value of the matrix velocity indicates again the presence of a highly fractured matrix around the conduit as it is within the range of groundwater pore velocity that is reported by zhou et al 2007 fig 2b for fractured aquifers one indication of the large advective solute flux is the possible presence of underground paths that diverted part of the tracer given that a simultaneous loss of tracers and water 22 occurred during the test although such a situation is best modeled as localized exchanges at a specific point along the conduit if known the present model assumes that such exchange is continuous along the whole length of the conduit nevertheless the model helps infer the predominant transport process in the karst system 7 conclusions simple transport models for karst systems were developed to simulate the typical shape of the breakthrough curve that is characterized by a long tailing and low tracer recovery the models are based on the one dimensional advection dispersion equation that governs the solute transport in both the conduit and the surrounding matrix with the exchange flux being expressed via fick s law they are stated in a dimensionless form that reduced the number of fitting parameters to four dimensionless parameters that are directly related to the transport properties of the flow in the conduit and in the matrix algebraic relationships in terms of the key attributes of the breakthrough curve were also derived to provide a preliminary estimate of the model parameters and facilitate the estimation of the physical properties of the system although the present study was primarily concerned with the breakthrough concentration of an instantaneous injection of a tracer the models can handle any time varying solute injection whether a tracer or a pollutant through the use of the convolution integral a8 the models can also simulate the concentration in the matrix domain 16 and predict the extent of the solute spread into the aquifer in case well observations are available a simultaneous fit of the karst spring and matrix btcs can achieve a more refined estimate of the transport parameters one can also evaluate the solute exchange flux that is of interest in karst vulnerability and contaminant sequestration studies consequently the models can be useful in the preliminary assessment of accidental pollutant spills it should be noted that the models assume a constant conduit velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient throughout the simulation period therefore they cannot handle large variations of conduit velocities that are observed during flood events the models are best suited for tracer tests that are performed under constant flowrate conditions the constant velocity condition is a common assumption to all transport models as it greatly simplifies the mathematical development the advection flux is also taken to be one directional from the conduit towards the matrix which implies that the prevailing hydraulic conditions in the conduit are great enough to create such a head gradient at the interface a higher hydraulic head in the conduit can be caused by natural conditions e g concentrated recharge event or artificial conditions e g pool dumping of tracers the tracer loss and low recovery rates are also assumed to be the result of advective exchange occurring throughout the whole length of the conduit rather than at specific points or segments that is the exchange is assumed continuous and constant along the conduit length which may not be the case in a matrix domain with preferential flow paths finally the transport models neglect tracer loss that is due to tracer reaction or depletion and do not account for the presence of pools or stagnant conduit areas that can cause lower recovery rates the present models were developed in line with the principle of parsimony whereby the structure of the model was reduced to the basic components that describe the key transport processes in a karst system although karst dynamics are naturally more complex than the ones presented in this work the models allow the assessment of the contribution of the basic advection and dispersion processes in the absence of information that is often encountered in karst systems and the dearth of supporting evidence for particular transport mechanisms a parsimonious model in terms of the key processes of advection and dispersion is suitable the values of the fitted parameters can then help indicate whether the model assumptions are valid for a particular system the proposed models succeeded in simulating the observed breakthrough curves at two real karst springs matching or exceeding in accuracy the partitioning models in current use while employing a reduced number of parameters that are more physically meaningful an over parametrized model is usually faced with issues related to parameter uncertainties and non uniqueness in addition to the consequent misinterpretation of the results given the various hydrological uncertainties the successful application examples demonstrate that the present models are simple and effective tools for the characterization of a karst system and can prove to be valuable for water resources

modeling of groundwater distribution is an important undertaking that would aid in subsequent conservation and management of groundwater resources in this study groundwater potential maps were developed using a machine learning algorithm mla and a deep learning algorithm dla specifically the support vector regression svr and convolution neural network cnn functions respectively initially

the auc values of cnn and svr were 0 844 and 0 75 whereas those of cnn and svr during validation with the testing data were 0 843 and 0 75 therefore cnn has better predictive ability than svr the

convolution neural network cnn 1 introduction nearly one fourth of global freshwater reserves are stored as groundwater naghibi et al 2017 groundwater water is highly valued as it is less prone to contamination and more extensively available than surface water resources almost 33 of the global population relies on underground freshwater for everyday use which has led to overexploitation rahmati et al 2018 furthermore certain recent factors including inadequate precipitation surging populations and scarcity of surface water have led to increased demand for groundwater resources worldwide neshat et al 2014 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 increases in populations have also led to more demand for freshwater resources due to expansions of urban areas and increased manufacturing and agricultural activities pham et al 2018 zahedi et al 2017 overall groundwater levels have been falling due to excessive usage and insufficient conservation measures so precise spatial prediction of groundwater potential regions is essential for the development of sustainable groundwater exploitation preservation and management strategies chen et al 2018 nosrati and van den eeckhaut 2012 the accuracy of groundwater investigations predominantly depends on the selection of suitable conditioning factors cfs and the use of precise approaches for spatial modeling arabameri et al 2019 several traditional field based approaches have been used to detect groundwater but these are complicated expensive and time consuming goldman and neubauer 1994 owen et al 2006 more recently integrated rs

2015 sener et al 2005 shahid et al 2000 rs approaches offer inexpensive datasets with wide coverage of all regions over a short period of time whereas gis is regarded as the ultimate tool for mapping of cfs and is therefore very helpful in assessing groundwater resources kharazmi et al 2018 several probabilistic and knowledge based approaches have been integrated with gis techniques to identify

gms were categorized into very high potential vhp high potential hp moderate potential mp low potential lp and very low potential vlp classes based on the quantile method rahmati et al 2015 rahmati et al 2016 the gms indices of cnn ranged from 1 62 to 0 72 with the ranges of 1 62 0 96 0 96 0 74 0 74 0 49 0 49 0 26 and 0 26 0 72 representing the vhp hp mp lp and vlp classes respectively fig 7

respectively figs 8 and 9 the results of both the training and testing data auc values reveal that the cnn has better forecasting accuracy than the svr model table 1 5 discussion recently considerable attention has been paid to the spatial modeling of groundwater occurrence due to changing climatic conditions and rising population in places where reliance on groundwater is exceptionally high scholars have emphasized the need to understand the factors supporting better prediction of groundwater resources in general spatial modeling of natural resources is a complex task and no algorithm has perfect forecasting ability or works flawlessly chen et al 2019c panahi et al 2019 in this study two infrequently applied dla cnn and mla svr methods were examined and compared in terms of predicting groundwater occurrence the outcomes of the validation process revealed that cnn performs better than the svr model this difference may be due to its consideration of the relationships among neighboring spatial data and its ability to examine factors based on the association between spatial and geographic features zhang et al 2019 cnn conserves the association among pixels through identification of the internal elements using various factors zhang et al 2019 dlas reveal the deep elements and discriminate among the variances of spatial factors despite its advantages cnn also has disadvantages including a extensive datasets and extraordinary computational resources are necessary for calibration b gathering and classifying the datasets requires extensive manual labor c additional investigation to improve algorithms is required and d the underlying concept of the cnn has not been recognized to date although numerous effective methods grounded in it are available gu et al 2018 the low predictive ability of the mla in this research may be due to its direct classification of inputs without feature mining which does not allow the labeled features to be extracted from the data to enhance the precision of classification however in contrast to mla dla can detect manifold features of large datasets which is helpful for determining the spatial variations of groundwater potential however mueller et al 2019 concluded that the naive network model mlp multilayer perceptron outperformed cnn for predicting groundwater occurrence ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 compared mlas including ann svm and rf with a dla which was cnn for landslide identification and concluded that the cnn using spectral information outperformed ann svm and rf they also demonstrated the significance of choosing suitable methods and parameters for cnn to enhance its predictive ability brodrick et al 2019 illustrated the various ecological applications of cnn zhang et al 2019 investigated vulnerability to forest fires using cnn rf svm mlp and kernel logistic regression klr algorithms revealing that cnn had better precision than the mlas wang et al 2019 concluded that cnn had better predictive ability than svm zhang et al 2019 demonstrated that mlas only possess a minimal capacity to simplify and learn from novel conditions although cnn has greater forecasting ability it requires more time for calibration than mlas although this time can be reduced in later calibration periods due to its reusable function after preliminary calibration can et al 2019 achieved an accuracy of 94 in validation using landslide photos gathered by civilians sameen et al 2020 found that cnn was more precise in forecasting landslide risk areas in southern yangyang province of south korea compared to svm and ann bayr and puschmann 2019 used cnn for automated identification of woody vegetation and obtained 87 7 precision in distinguishing woody from non woody vegetation the results of the present study demonstrate the superior effectiveness of cnn in forecasting groundwater potential compared to svr supporting the greater capability of dlas compared to mlas for predictive modeling however the performance of cnn would have been further improved by increasing the sizes of the training and testing datasets it should be noted that the forecasting precision of an algorithm is wholly based on the accuracy of the input data as well as the internal processing capability and structure additionally better optimization of the cnn through selection of appropriate parameters would enhance the predictive power of the calibrated model 6 conclusion spatial modeling of the availability of groundwater resources is crucial for sustainable development and management of freshwater resources as it can be utilized to increase the extraction of water from appropriate sites in this study an mla namely svr was compared with a dla i e cnn for spatial prediction of groundwater potential in damyang south korea for this purpose 140 groundwater datasets were prepared using an extensive gim and arbitrarily partitioned into calibration and testing datasets in a proportion of 70 30 equal quantities of non groundwater training and testing data were constructed for calibration and validation of the models additionally 15 gcfs including ca ci co dh fp ls mbi sa sh tpi tri tx vd lc and gg were prepared and employed for model calibration during optimization of the models svr outperformed cnn in the training stage and the opposite pattern was observed during the testing stage when svr underperformed cnn the roc auc accuracy measure was used to validate the calibrated model with testing data the outcomes of model validation and comparison revealed that cnn has greater predictive ability than svr with regard to forecast mapping of groundwater potential the groundwater potential map generated using cnn can be employed to develop appropriate freshwater

5304,freshwater shortages have become much more common globally in recent years water resources that are naturally available beneath the surface are capable of reversing this condition spatial modeling of groundwater distribution is an important undertaking that would aid in subsequent conservation and management of groundwater resources in this study groundwater potential maps were developed using a machine learning algorithm mla and a deep learning algorithm dla specifically the support vector regression svr and convolution neural network cnn functions respectively initially 140 groundwater datasets were created through an extensive survey and then arbitrarily divided into groups of 100 70 and 40 30 datasets for model calibration and testing respectively next 15

calibrated model was validated using both training and testing data and the independent measure of the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve roc auc for validation using training data the auc values of cnn and svr were 0 844 and 0 75 whereas those of cnn and svr during validation with the testing data were 0 843 and 0 75 therefore cnn has better predictive ability than svr the findings of this study will help policymakers develop better strategies for conservation and management of groundwater resources keywords groundwater potential mapping support vector regression svr convolution neural network cnn 1 introduction nearly one fourth of global freshwater reserves are stored as groundwater naghibi et al 2017 groundwater water is highly valued as it is less prone to contamination and more extensively available than surface water resources almost 33 of the global population relies on underground freshwater for everyday use which has led to overexploitation rahmati et al 2018 furthermore certain recent factors including inadequate precipitation surging populations and scarcity of surface water have led to increased demand for groundwater resources worldwide neshat et al 2014 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 increases in populations have also led to more demand for freshwater resources due to expansions of urban areas and increased manufacturing and agricultural activities pham et al 2018 zahedi et al 2017 overall groundwater levels have been falling due to excessive usage and insufficient conservation measures so precise spatial prediction of groundwater potential regions is essential for the development of sustainable groundwater exploitation preservation and management strategies chen et al 2018 nosrati and van den eeckhaut 2012 the accuracy of groundwater investigations predominantly depends on the selection of suitable conditioning factors cfs and the use of precise approaches for spatial modeling arabameri et al 2019 several traditional field based approaches have been used to detect groundwater but these are complicated expensive and time consuming goldman and neubauer 1994 owen et al 2006 more recently integrated rs

2015 sener et al 2005 shahid et al 2000 rs approaches offer inexpensive datasets with wide coverage of all regions over a short period of time whereas gis is regarded as the ultimate tool for mapping of cfs and is therefore very helpful in assessing groundwater resources kharazmi et al 2018 several probabilistic and knowledge based approaches have been integrated with gis techniques to identify

individual mla aghdam et al 2017 chen et al 2019b dodangeh et al 2020 khosravi et al 2019 lee et al 2019 however the predictive outcome of these combined methods relies solely on the precision of the datasets utilized and the internal structure of the model chen et al 2019c studies using the mlas listed above have gained prominence but many similar novel algorithms have also been successfully implemented in other fields with high precision and therefore should be tested for forecasting groundwater potential among such novel algorithms support vector regression svr follows the regression

same trend was also observed in the frequency of errors for the training set figs 5 and 6 d and testing set figs 5 and 6 e 4 2 groundwater spatial modeling in this study the indices of the generated gms were categorized into very high potential vhp high potential hp moderate potential mp low potential lp and very low potential vlp classes based on the quantile method rahmati et al 2015 rahmati et al 2016 the gms indices of cnn ranged from 1 62 to 0 72 with the ranges of 1 62 0 96 0 96 0 74 0 74 0 49 0 49 0 26 and 0 26 0 72 representing the vhp hp mp lp and vlp classes respectively fig 7 likewise the gms indices of svr ranged between 1 45 and 0 25 with ranges for the vhp hp mp lp and vlp classes of 1 45 1 10 1 10 0 83 0 83 0 50 0 50 0 28 and 0 28 0 25 respectively based on the cnn model the proportions of the total area covered by the vhp hp mp lp and vlp categories are 19 96 20 20 20 40 20 12 and 19 32 respectively similarly in the svr model 14 84 22 39 23 09 20 07 and 19 62 of the area fall into the vhp hp mp lp and vlp classes for groundwater respectively 4 3 validation of groundwater potential maps model validation using the roc auc curve was carried out with both training and testing datasets for auc using the training and testing data the cnn model yielded maximum auc values of 0 844 and 0 843 while the svr model yielded auc values of 0 75 and 0 75 respectively figs 8 and 9 the results of both the training and testing data auc values reveal that the cnn has better forecasting accuracy than the svr model table 1 5 discussion recently considerable attention has been paid to the spatial modeling of groundwater occurrence due to changing climatic conditions and rising population in places where reliance on groundwater is exceptionally high scholars have emphasized the need to understand the factors supporting better prediction of groundwater resources in general spatial modeling of natural resources is a complex task and no algorithm has perfect forecasting ability or works flawlessly chen et al 2019c panahi et al 2019 in this study two infrequently applied dla cnn and mla svr methods were examined and compared in terms of predicting groundwater occurrence the outcomes of the validation process revealed that cnn performs better than the svr model this difference may be due to its consideration of the relationships among neighboring spatial data and its ability to examine factors based on the association between spatial and geographic features zhang et al 2019 cnn conserves the association among pixels through identification of the internal elements using various factors zhang et al 2019 dlas reveal the deep elements and discriminate among the variances of spatial factors despite its advantages cnn also has disadvantages including a extensive datasets and extraordinary computational resources are necessary for calibration b gathering and classifying the datasets requires extensive manual labor c additional investigation to improve algorithms is required and d the underlying concept of the cnn has not been recognized to date although numerous effective methods grounded in it are available gu et al 2018 the low predictive ability of the mla in this research may be due to its direct classification of inputs without feature mining which does not allow the labeled features to be extracted from the data to enhance the precision of classification however in contrast to mla dla can detect manifold features of large datasets which is helpful for determining the spatial variations of groundwater potential however mueller et al 2019 concluded that the naive network model mlp multilayer perceptron outperformed cnn for predicting groundwater occurrence ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 compared mlas including ann svm and rf with a dla which was cnn for landslide identification and concluded that the cnn using spectral information outperformed ann svm and rf they also demonstrated the significance of choosing suitable methods and parameters for cnn to enhance its predictive ability brodrick et al 2019 illustrated the various ecological applications of cnn zhang et al 2019 investigated vulnerability to forest fires using cnn rf svm mlp and kernel logistic regression klr algorithms revealing that cnn had better precision than the mlas wang et al 2019 concluded that cnn had better predictive ability than svm zhang et al 2019 demonstrated that mlas only possess a minimal capacity to simplify and learn from novel conditions although cnn has greater forecasting ability it requires more time for calibration than mlas although this time can be reduced in later calibration periods due to its reusable function after preliminary calibration can et al 2019 achieved an accuracy of 94 in validation using landslide photos gathered by civilians sameen et al 2020 found that cnn was more precise in forecasting landslide risk areas in southern yangyang province of south korea compared to svm and ann bayr and puschmann 2019 used cnn for automated identification of woody vegetation and obtained 87 7 precision in distinguishing woody from non woody vegetation the results of the present study demonstrate the superior effectiveness of cnn in forecasting groundwater potential compared to svr supporting the greater capability of dlas compared to mlas for predictive modeling however the performance of cnn would have been further improved by increasing the sizes of the training and testing datasets it should be noted that the forecasting precision of an algorithm is wholly based on the accuracy of the input data as well as the internal processing capability and structure additionally better optimization of the cnn through selection of appropriate parameters would enhance the predictive power of the calibrated model 6 conclusion spatial modeling of the availability of groundwater resources is crucial for sustainable development and management of freshwater resources as it can be utilized to increase the extraction of water from appropriate sites in this study an mla namely svr was compared with a dla i e cnn for spatial prediction of groundwater potential in damyang south korea for this purpose 140 groundwater datasets were prepared using an extensive gim and arbitrarily partitioned into calibration and testing datasets in a proportion of 70 30 equal quantities of non groundwater training and testing data were constructed for calibration and validation of the models additionally 15 gcfs including ca ci co dh fp ls mbi sa sh tpi tri tx vd lc and gg were prepared and employed for model calibration during optimization of the models svr outperformed cnn in the training stage and the opposite pattern was observed during the testing stage when svr underperformed cnn the roc auc accuracy measure was used to validate the calibrated model with testing data the outcomes of model validation and comparison revealed that cnn has greater predictive ability than svr with regard to forecast mapping of groundwater potential the groundwater potential map generated using cnn can be employed to develop appropriate freshwater
