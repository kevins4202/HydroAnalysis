applications where gaps in data may alter the statistics or spikes have to be eliminated without removing extreme values for the application to ocean waves it is estimated that gaps as long as half of the peak period may be reconstructed well it is possible to reconstruct data of longer gaps however in total the amount of missing points should be less than 50 of all points and the missing data

section 5 the conclusion follows in section 6 2 method 2 1 formulation of missing data as convolution given the fully known observation η we define the observation function λ to indicate the position and length of the gaps the observation function is set to one for all trustworthy measurements and zero when the measurement is missing or erroneous then we multiply the measured data by this observation function which is equivalent to multiplying the correct data with the observation function by this step we can relate the measured data to the correct data in the fourier domain the multiplication with the observation function becomes a convolution hence the data may be recovered by deconvolution that is essentially solving a system of equations if the overall number of valid data points is sufficient to anticipate the wave field for the entire domain the wave elevation across gaps can be estimated although data points are missing the information content is enough to determine the fourier coefficients and thereby the wave field is known over its entire domain although the deconvolution is a known operation it is commonly used for the opposite task if the original problem involves a convolution of two signals they may be deconvolved by division after the fourier transform has been applied strang 1986 ch 5 5 in our case we cannot recover the masked data by division since it would require to divide by zero by passing to the spectral domain the problem is transformed in such a way that it may be reversed under given conditions let η t n be a discrete measurement of a given magnitude η t e g wave elevation the measurement is sampled at n equispaced points in time t n n d t for n 0 n 1 where d t is the sampling time the discrete points in time form the set of observations of interest t obs t n n 0 n 1 a subset of the sampling points t λ t obs is associated with measurement gaps or locations of spikes we define the observation function λ to mark all points with t n t λ corresponding to gaps or spike locations 1 λ t n 0 if t n t λ 1 otherwise the observation function λ t n is assumed to be known and used to mask the measurements η t n 2 η λ t

η f λ in the following we will use the hat notation for the fourier transform i e η ˆ λ f η λ η ˆ f η and λ ˆ f λ further we simplify the notation by writing the functions as vectors η n η t n λ n λ t n and η λ n η λ t n so that eq 2 becomes 4 η λ n λ n η n for n 0 1 n 1 by employing the discrete fourier transform dft and the convolution theorem eq 2 may be written as discrete cyclic convolution brigham 1988 e g 5 η ˆ λ n m 0 n 1 λ ˆ n m mod n η ˆ m the expression from eq 5 can be written in matrix notation 6 η ˆ λ λ ˆ η ˆ where λ ˆ λ ˆ n m denotes the cyclic convolution matrix with the coefficients defined as λ ˆ n m λ ˆ n m mod n the fourier coefficients of η λ and η λ are given as vectors 7 η ˆ η ˆ 0 η ˆ 1 η ˆ n 1 t c n 8 λ ˆ λ ˆ 0 λ ˆ 1 λ ˆ n 1 t c n 9 η ˆ λ η ˆ λ 0 η ˆ λ 1 η ˆ λ

frequency component in the center i e in the case of the matrix on the diagonal being based on sinc functions the sidebands of the convolution matrix are non zero as a full matrix the numerical properties of the convolution matrix are unfavorable and likely to lead to errors when solving the system of equations the numerical properties of the convolution matrix may be improved by removing sidebands and hence limiting the bandwidth of λ ˆ for given λ and η the correctness of the altered convolution can be determined by an error measure 10 ε rel i 0 n 1 f η λ ω i f η λ ω i 2 i 0 n 1 f η λ ω i 2 where f η λ denotes the band limited convolution the numerical stability may be measured in terms of the condition number of the convolution matrix cond λ ˆ the closer the condition number is to one the likelier that the numerical solution of the system of equations is well behaved for the full cyclic convolution matrix the convolution is correct but the condition number is very high compare fig 3 when reducing the bandwidth of the convolution matrix up to 50 the increase in the error is negligible while the reduction of the condition number is of the order 10 15 additional reduction of the bandwidth does not pay off due to minor changes in the condition number with a noticeable increase of the error in the remainder of this work the convolution matrix with half the bandwidth is employed the resulting convolution matrix corresponds to the non cyclic convolution matrix see fig 2b 2 3 solving the deconvolution directly as a first example we attempt to remove a single gap from a time series η the system of equations is solved directly and the result is compared to the original signal fig 4 shows two images focusing on very short gaps left and large gaps right in both cases the deconvolution was performed twice with two different observation functions to illustrate the influence of minor changes in the gap width the observation functions are denoted λ 1 and λ 2 and their corresponding reconstructions η 1 and η 2 while short gaps are handled well see fig 4a the reconstructions for long gaps are poor fig 4a a range of other numerical approaches singular value decomposition minimum residual quasi minimal residual have been tested and found to give the same solution the deconvolution technique falls under the category of ill posed problems associated with an ill conditioned matrix better performance may only be attained if additional information can be injected into the formulation 3 analysis 3 1 success for wider gaps by bandwidth limited solution by making use of the fact that the bandwidth of the observed waves is limited additional information is introduced to the ill posed problem and may improve the solvability hence we define a set of frequencies ω red ω 2 ω 1 ω 1 ω 2 for which we want to determine the fourier coefficients while the remaining coefficients are set to zero a reduced matrix λ ˆ r e d is synthesized based on ω red by selecting the columns corresponding to the frequencies in ω red from λ ˆ similarly η ˆ is reduced to the rows corresponding to the frequencies in ω red forming η ˆ red the resulting convolution formulated as reduced system 11 λ ˆ red η ˆ red η ˆ λ is depicted in fig 5 in the given form the system is overdetermined and a solution may be found by a minimization technique such as the least square method alternatively the system of equations may be turned into a symmetric system by multiplication with λ ˆ red h on both sides the resulting system 12 λ ˆ red h λ ˆ red η ˆ red λ ˆ red h η ˆ λ is no longer overdetermined in contrast to the original system the amount of unknowns is clearly reduced and the condition number is improved when applying the algorithm of the reduced system to the same examples as in section 2 3 the results are clearly improved see fig 6 compared to the original solution fig 4 the solution of the deconvolution always depends on the values of ω 1 and ω 2 for the current example the reduction of the system was based on ω 1 0 2 ω p and ω 2 2 6 ω p which still includes 98 of the energy in the spectrum a thorough analysis of how the choice of ω 1 and ω 2 affects the error follows in the next section ideas for choosing the two parameters for a given problem are included in the discussion in section 5 the maximum error for all deconvolutions was found to be reduced for the presented case while the direct method was not able to successfully recover the data in the wide gaps the method with reduced convolution matrix resulted in maximum errors of 0 627 η rms for the gap of length δ 1 0 48 t p and 0 264 η rms for the gap of length δ 2 0 43 t p for the latter case the power spectrum is shown in fig 7 the coefficients of the original waves are well approximated by the recovered part the coefficients of the data with gap η λ have a reduced peak and additional components at higher frequencies the new system does not only have better properties for finding the correct solution but the efficiency may be increased by a factor of four as roughly half of the columns may be removed 3 2 error estimates for the deconvolution of a single gap depending on ω 1 and ω 2 in this section the focus lies on the deconvolution of a single gap in an ensemble of synthesized wave records each record η was created based on jonswap spectra as shown for three different shape factors γ in fig 8 for each realization of synthesized wave data the amplitude was based on the spectrum and the phases were random the position and length of the gaps were not correlated to the waves for further analysis of the method two errors were computed as averages over the ensemble the mean error 13 ε e λ n 0 η n η dec n 2 and the maximum error 14 ε max e max n η n η dec n the dependence of the error was assessed for the following parameters the non zero frequency bandwidth defined by ω 1 and ω 2 the width of the single gap δ and the shape parameter of the jonswap spectrum γ an effect of the temporal resolution on the error could not be found and is therefore not considered the results for the maximum error are shown in fig 9 each error was based on the ensemble average over 100 deconvolutions the mean error is not included here as it produces very similar images in the left column the figure is dedicated to the parameter ω 1 while ω 2 ω p 1 5 is kept constant while the right column deals with ω 2 for ω 1 ω p 0 43 the images reveal that the error is smallest when the shape parameter γ is largest corresponding to the most narrow banded spectrum the wider the gap width the more it is important to adapt ω 1 and ω 2 to limit the error the values of ω 1 and ω 2 have to be chosen as a trade off between reducing the bandwidth and containing the dominant frequency components depending on the excepted tolerance for the error the gap width has to be limited 3 3 multiple gaps and the amount and distribution of the missing information it may be expected that the success rate of the deconvolution decreases for an increase of missing data points to get an idea on how the amount and distribution of single points influence the average error synthetic data analogous to section 3 2 was combined with gaps of variable length distributed with variable distances between them the results were then analyzed for the distribution of gap sizes distances between gaps and total percentage of missing data gaps were classified as large when they fulfilled the criterion δ j t p 0 5 and the percentage of large gaps was then calculated as 15 n gaps δ j t p 0 5 n all gaps 100 similarly the distance between two gaps gap distance χ was identified as small if it fulfills the criterion χ t p 0 4 and the percentage of short gap distances was calculated as 16 n gaps χ t p 0 4 n all gaps 100 the percentage of missing points was calculated by 17 n 0 n 1 1 λ n n 100 the results are presented in fig 10 the main observation is that all parameters defined above are roughly proportional to the value of the error for all classifiers the error increases faster for lower values in particular the length of the gap seems to play an important role the smallest errors were found for cases where all or most gaps are shorter than half the peak period t p 3 4 influence of noise in this section it is analyzed how noise influences the filling of gaps gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 5 and 10 of the standard deviation of η t n was added to the signal and reconstruction by deconvolution and interpolation is compared from fig 11 we see how the average and mean errors grow as more noise is added the effect is stronger for wider gaps and increased number of gaps noise adds energy to the high frequency part of the spectrum that is assumed to be zero in the solution of the deconvolution it may be possible to mitigate this mismatch by pre filtering but this is not addressed here to summarize the method is robust to noise depending on the accuracy needed and the amount and width of the gaps up to 10 of gaussian noise may be tolerable 4 application to data 4 1 application to buoy data the performance of the method was verified by real data artificial gaps were added and the missing data points were recovered by deconvolution and spline interpolation and compared to the original the measurements were taken in february 1995 by a waverider buoy with the sampling rate of 1 hz the buoy was located in the bay of biscay with a waterdepth of 600 m starting from a uniform grid the positions of the gaps are altered randomly by a uniform distribution over the interval 0 05 n d t 0 05 n d t the lengths of the gaps were set according to a normal distribution with an average of 0 4 t p and a standard deviation of 0 1 t p to gain insight for a larger variety of cases the definition of gaps and their filling was repeated 10 times for each dataset since the timeseries were long they were chopped up into 16 intervals of 128 points from fig 12 it is apparent that the deconvolution outperforms the interpolation clearly the maximum error depends heavily on the amount of gaps in each deconvolution especially when the length of each gap increases therefore the reconstructed timeseries were compared by visual inspection the recovered data points based on the deconvolution differ most from interpolation when the gap masks a peak or a trough some examples have been added for illustration in fig 13 4 2 application to draupner time series as a second example the deconvolution is applied to the time series of the draupner wave in contrast to the previous sections the gaps are added symmetrically around randomly selected peaks and not distributed randomly over the time series the data series of 20 min was measured by a laser at the draupner platform in the north sea and contains the so called draupner or new year wave haver 2004 first the mask for the entire time series was defined by randomly selecting 20 to 35 peaks and to define gaps of a specified value around them the data was then chopped into shorter sections and all of those were deconvolved and interpolated separately the same process was repeated 100 times for collecting average values for the root mean square error and the maximum error in addition the kurtosis κ the skewness γ and the significant wave height h s were calculated fig 14 shows similar results as previously for larger peaks the deconvolution is associated with smaller errors than the interpolation the reconstruction has also implications for the higher order statistics as summarized in table 1 while h s drops when removing peaks κ and γ increase the kurtosis of the deconvolution is lower that of the original and so is the skewness skewness and kurtosis are captured more accurately by the interpolation finally we show how the peak of the draupner wave can be recovered by the deconvolution first 9 data points are removed from the series the algorithm was applied with different combinations of ω 1 and ω 2 as can be seen from fig 15 the algorithm gives the same result for any ω 2 ω inner for ω 2 ω outer outside ω inner the peak is estimated slightly lower the latter intervals are indicated by rectangles where for ω 2 the inner red rectangle corresponds to ω inner and the orange rectangle as ω outer 5 summary of results and discussion the previous sections have shown examples where the deconvolution is successful in approximating missing data points in a measured timeseries the key results of the applications are summarized in table 2 the main advantage of the deconvolution is that gaps of multiple points missing in a row may be recovered when the gap width remains below 0 5 peak periods of the measured timeseries the reconstructions had an average error below 0 4 standard deviations in comparison for interpolation the average error was 0 61 standard deviations the deconvolution performs even better when only peaks are reconstructed a marginal difference in the average error for reconstructed peaks was as low as 0 08 standard deviations while for interpolation the average error was 0 49 standard deviations this major difference between the two methods was achieved for gaps of length δ 0 31 t p generally spline interpolation of gaps depends highly on the local properties for larger gaps and in low resolution data the local properties around the gap are not necessarily representative for the gap 13 chap 1 6 in the presented interpolation of buoy data the time series is of low resolution the cubic spline interpolation is based on continuity of the interpolant and its two first derivatives burden et al 1985 due to the involvement of the derivatives low resolution data which is not smooth is not ideal for spline interpolation in contrast to that the deconvolution is independent of the smoothness of data and performs better in the second example of the draupner wave the time series had a higher resolution but when focusing on the reconstruction of peaks the spline interpolation has the tendency to underestimate the maximum resulting in larger errors examples of other methods for filling gaps often involve machine learning 16 12 e g in these examples data from other measurement devices is used in order to fill the gaps in contrast to that the information needed for the deconvolution is self contained in the data as a consequence the deconvolution is easier to apply as no additional measurements are needed the downside of the deconvolution is its limitation with respect to the gap length and the amount of gaps that the machine learning approaches can handle due to the information from other sources as was demonstrated above the error of the deconvolution depends on the choice of the frequency band defined by the limits ω 1 and ω 2 on the one hand it should be a small interval around the peak frequency ω p so that the condition number of the reduced convolution matrix is low and the system of equations is well behaved on the other hand choosing the interval too small would result in neglecting spectral components with a considerable amount of energy if the spectrum can be estimated well from the erroneous timeseries the initial choice for ω 1 and ω 2 should ensure that the desired amount of energy is contained in the solution when defining the spectrum of the measured data it should be kept in mind that the product η λ yields a convolution in the frequency domain resulting in a wider bandwidth in particular energy is shifted to higher frequencies to estimate the mean error for the deconvolution it is recommended to conduct simulations based on the measured wave spectrum and to synthesize an observation function based on the properties of the gaps in the measurements the selection of ω 1 and ω 2 should be reviewed by analysing the error as proposed in section 3 2 further it is advised to verify that noise has limited influence on the solutions compare section 3 4 all examples were performed on an old low end pc processor intel r core tm i7 4600u cpu 2 10 ghz ram 11 4 gib for short time windows the result was presented without noticeable delay the computational effort for producing ensemble averages required some processing time in the range of few minutes this paper focuses primarily on introducing the method comparisons with additional methods and applications of the method to multiple problems are outside the scope of this paper the first application of the deconvolution is already in preparation as part of a collaboration with the norwegian meteorological institute in that study the deconvolution is compared to other methods for despiking laser measurements of ocean waves so far the method is not optimized for knowledge of the position of holes for time space wave recordings knowledge of the theoretical dispersion relation may provide useful information in the recovery at least for linear wave fields furthermore the method may be improved by further analyzing the bandwidth limitation and its effect to the condition number a deeper understanding of the method might be achieved by investigating possible relations of the deconvolution and the non uniform fourier transform fessler and sutton 2003 6 conclusion the deconvolution has been introduced as a promising method for filling gaps in timeseries of oscillatory measurements that may be represented by a band limited spectrum for our test cases the deconvolution outperforms traditional interpolation to reconstruct missing data correctly the method is independent of the position of the gaps peaks troughs steep parts however the gain by using the method is clearer if it is applied to peaks and troughs also the effect on the statistics is more apparent if the holes occur systematically future applications in different scenarios are needed for a more holistic evaluation of the deconvolution an improved method for a priori error estimation would be beneficial for the applicability to cases where no ground truth is available furthermore it is planned to extend the method to two and three dimensions where the dispersion relation could be used to incorporate additional information in the recovery the method could have potential in remote sensing applications such as removing shadows from radar images credit authorship

based on ω red by selecting the columns corresponding to the frequencies in ω red from λ ˆ similarly η ˆ is reduced to the rows corresponding to the frequencies in ω red forming η ˆ red the resulting convolution formulated as reduced system 11 λ ˆ red η ˆ red η ˆ λ is depicted in fig 5 in the given form the system is overdetermined and a solution may be found by a minimization technique such as the least square method alternatively the system of equations may be turned into a symmetric system by multiplication with λ ˆ red h on both sides the resulting system 12 λ ˆ red h λ ˆ red η ˆ red λ ˆ red h η ˆ λ is no longer overdetermined in contrast to the original system the amount of unknowns is clearly reduced and the condition number is improved when applying the algorithm of the reduced system to the same examples as in section 2 3 the results are clearly improved see fig 6 compared to the original solution fig 4 the solution of the deconvolution always depends on the values of ω 1 and ω 2 for the current example the reduction of the system was based on ω 1 0 2 ω p and ω 2 2 6 ω p which still includes 98 of the energy in the spectrum a thorough analysis of how the choice of ω 1 and ω 2 affects the error follows in the next section ideas for choosing the two parameters for a given problem are included in the discussion in section 5 the maximum error for all deconvolutions was found to be reduced for the presented case while the direct method was not able to successfully recover the data in the wide gaps the method with reduced convolution matrix resulted in maximum errors of 0 627 η rms for the gap of length δ 1 0 48 t p and 0 264 η rms for the gap of length δ 2 0 43 t p for the latter case the power spectrum is shown in fig 7 the coefficients of the original waves are well approximated by the recovered part the coefficients of the data with gap η λ have a reduced peak and additional components at higher frequencies the new system does not only have better properties for finding the correct solution but the efficiency may be increased by a factor of four as roughly half of the columns may be removed 3 2 error estimates for the deconvolution of a single gap depending on ω 1 and ω 2 in this section the focus lies on the deconvolution of a single gap in an ensemble of synthesized wave records each record η was created based on jonswap spectra as shown for three different shape factors γ in fig 8 for each realization of synthesized wave data the amplitude was based on the spectrum and the phases were random the position and length of the gaps were not correlated to the waves for further analysis of the method two errors were computed as averages over the ensemble the mean error 13 ε e λ n 0 η n η dec n 2 and the maximum error 14 ε max e max n η n η dec n the dependence of the error was assessed for the following parameters the non zero frequency bandwidth defined by ω 1 and ω 2 the width of the single gap δ and the shape parameter of the jonswap spectrum γ an effect of the temporal resolution on the error could not be found and is therefore not considered the results for the maximum error are shown in fig 9 each error was based on the ensemble average over 100 deconvolutions the mean error is not included here as it produces very similar images in the left column the figure is dedicated to the parameter ω 1 while ω 2 ω p 1 5 is kept constant while the right column deals with ω 2 for ω 1 ω p 0 43 the images reveal that the error is smallest when the shape parameter γ is largest corresponding to the most narrow banded spectrum the wider the gap width the more it is important to adapt ω 1 and ω 2 to limit the error the values of ω 1 and ω 2 have to be chosen as a trade off between reducing the bandwidth and containing the dominant frequency components depending on the excepted tolerance for the error the gap width has to be limited 3 3 multiple gaps and the amount and distribution of the missing information it may be expected that the success rate of the deconvolution decreases for an increase of missing data points to get an idea on how the amount and distribution of single points influence the average error synthetic data analogous to section 3 2 was combined with gaps of variable length distributed with variable distances between them the results were then analyzed for the distribution of gap sizes distances between gaps and total percentage of missing data gaps were classified as large when they fulfilled the criterion δ j t p 0 5 and the percentage of large gaps was then calculated as 15 n gaps δ j t p 0 5 n all gaps 100 similarly the distance between two gaps gap distance χ was identified as small if it fulfills the criterion χ t p 0 4 and the percentage of short gap distances was calculated as 16 n gaps χ t p 0 4 n all gaps 100 the percentage of missing points was calculated by 17 n 0 n 1 1 λ n n 100 the results are presented in fig 10 the main observation is that all parameters defined above are roughly proportional to the value of the error for all classifiers the error increases faster for lower values in particular the length of the gap seems to play an important role the smallest errors were found for cases where all or most gaps are shorter than half the peak period t p 3 4 influence of noise in this section it is analyzed how noise influences the filling of gaps gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 5 and 10 of the standard deviation of η t n was added to the signal and reconstruction by deconvolution and interpolation is compared from fig 11 we see how the average and mean errors grow as more noise is added the effect is stronger for wider gaps and increased number of gaps noise adds energy to the high frequency part of the spectrum that is assumed to be zero in the solution of the deconvolution it may be possible to mitigate this mismatch by pre filtering but this is not addressed here to summarize the method is robust to noise depending on the accuracy needed and the amount and width of the gaps up to 10 of gaussian noise may be tolerable 4 application to data 4 1 application to buoy data the performance of the method was verified by real data artificial gaps were added and the missing data points were recovered by deconvolution and spline interpolation and compared to the original the measurements were taken in february 1995 by a waverider buoy with the sampling rate of 1 hz the buoy was located in the bay of biscay with a waterdepth of 600 m starting from a uniform grid the positions of the gaps are altered randomly by a uniform distribution over the interval 0 05 n d t 0 05 n d t the lengths of the gaps were set according to a normal distribution with an average of 0 4 t p and a standard deviation of 0 1 t p to gain insight for a larger variety of cases the definition of gaps and their filling was repeated 10 times for each dataset since the timeseries were long they were chopped up into 16 intervals of 128 points from fig 12 it is apparent that the deconvolution outperforms the interpolation clearly the maximum error depends heavily on the amount of gaps in each deconvolution especially when the length of each gap increases therefore the reconstructed timeseries were compared by visual inspection the recovered data points based on the deconvolution differ most from interpolation when the gap masks a peak or a trough some examples have been added for illustration in fig 13 4 2 application to draupner time series as a second example the deconvolution is applied to the time series of the draupner wave in contrast to the previous sections the gaps are added symmetrically around randomly selected peaks and not distributed randomly over the time series the data series of 20 min was measured by a laser at the draupner platform in the north sea and contains the so called draupner or new year wave haver 2004 first the mask for the entire time series was defined by randomly selecting 20 to 35 peaks and to define gaps of a specified value around them the data was then chopped into shorter sections and all of those were deconvolved and interpolated separately the same process was repeated 100 times for collecting average values for the root mean square error and the maximum error in addition the kurtosis κ the skewness γ and the significant wave height h s were calculated fig 14 shows similar results as previously for larger peaks the deconvolution is associated with smaller errors than the interpolation the reconstruction has also implications for the higher order statistics as summarized in table 1 while h s drops when removing peaks κ and γ increase the kurtosis of the deconvolution is lower that of the original and so is the skewness skewness and kurtosis are captured more accurately by the interpolation finally we show how the peak of the draupner wave can be recovered by the deconvolution first 9 data points are removed from the series the algorithm was applied with different combinations of ω 1 and ω 2 as can be seen from fig 15 the algorithm gives the same result for any ω 2 ω inner for ω 2 ω outer outside ω inner the peak is estimated slightly lower the latter intervals are indicated by rectangles where for ω 2 the inner red rectangle corresponds to ω inner and the orange rectangle as ω outer 5 summary of results and discussion the previous sections have shown examples where the deconvolution is successful in approximating missing data points in a measured timeseries the key results of the applications are summarized in table 2 the main advantage of the deconvolution is that gaps of multiple points missing in a row may be recovered when the gap width remains below 0 5 peak periods of the measured timeseries the reconstructions had an average error below 0 4 standard deviations in comparison for interpolation the average error was 0 61 standard deviations the deconvolution performs even better when only peaks are reconstructed a marginal difference in the average error for reconstructed peaks was as low as 0 08 standard deviations while for interpolation the average error was 0 49 standard deviations this major difference between the two methods was achieved for gaps of length δ 0 31 t p generally spline interpolation of gaps depends highly on the local properties for larger gaps and in low resolution data the local properties around the gap are not necessarily representative for the gap 13 chap 1 6 in the presented interpolation of buoy data the time series is of low resolution the cubic spline interpolation is based on continuity of the interpolant and its two first derivatives burden et al 1985 due to the involvement of the derivatives low resolution data which is not smooth is not ideal for spline interpolation in contrast to that the deconvolution is independent of the smoothness of data and performs better in the second example of the draupner wave the time series had a higher resolution but when focusing on the reconstruction of peaks the spline interpolation has the tendency to underestimate the maximum resulting in larger errors examples of other methods for filling gaps often involve machine learning 16 12 e g in these examples data from other measurement devices is used in order to fill the gaps in contrast to that the information needed for the deconvolution is self contained in the data as a consequence the deconvolution is easier to apply as no additional measurements are needed the downside of the deconvolution is its limitation with respect to the gap length and the amount of gaps that the machine learning approaches can handle due to the information from other sources as was demonstrated above the error of the deconvolution depends on the choice of the frequency band defined by the limits ω 1 and ω 2 on the one hand it should be a small interval around the peak frequency ω p so that the condition number of the reduced convolution matrix is low and the system of equations is well behaved on the other hand choosing the interval too small would result in neglecting spectral components with a considerable amount of energy if the spectrum can be estimated well from the erroneous timeseries the initial choice for ω 1 and ω 2 should ensure that the desired amount of energy is contained in the solution when defining the spectrum of the measured data it should be kept in mind that the product η λ yields a convolution in the frequency domain resulting in a wider bandwidth in particular energy is shifted to higher frequencies to estimate the mean error for the deconvolution it is recommended to conduct simulations based on the measured wave spectrum and to synthesize an observation function based on the properties of the gaps in the measurements the selection of ω 1 and ω 2 should be reviewed by analysing the error as proposed in section 3 2 further it is advised to verify that noise has limited influence on the solutions compare section 3 4 all examples were performed on an old low end pc processor intel r core tm i7 4600u cpu 2 10 ghz ram 11 4 gib for short time windows the result was presented without noticeable delay the computational effort for producing ensemble averages required some processing time in the range of few minutes this paper focuses primarily on introducing the method comparisons with additional methods and applications of the method to multiple problems are outside the scope of this paper the first application of the deconvolution is already in preparation as part of a collaboration with the norwegian meteorological institute in that study the deconvolution is compared to other methods for despiking laser measurements of ocean waves so far the method is not optimized for knowledge of the position of holes for time space wave recordings knowledge of the theoretical dispersion relation may provide useful information in the recovery at least for linear wave fields furthermore the method may be improved by further analyzing the bandwidth limitation and its effect to the condition number a deeper understanding of the method might be achieved by investigating possible relations of the deconvolution and the non uniform fourier transform fessler and sutton 2003 6 conclusion the deconvolution has been introduced as a promising method for filling gaps in timeseries of oscillatory measurements that may be represented by a band limited spectrum for our test cases the deconvolution outperforms traditional interpolation to reconstruct missing data correctly the method is independent of the position of the gaps peaks troughs steep parts however the gain by using the method is clearer if it is applied to peaks and troughs also the effect on the statistics is more apparent if the holes occur systematically future applications in different scenarios are needed for a more holistic evaluation of the deconvolution an improved method for a priori error estimation would be beneficial for the applicability to cases where no ground truth is available furthermore it is planned to extend the method to two and three dimensions where the dispersion relation could be used to incorporate additional information in the recovery the method could have potential in remote sensing applications such as removing shadows from radar images credit authorship

21286,maritime transport industry is facing more and more strict rules regarding the ship emissions optimization of maintenance schedule represents an important operational measure but lack of information related to the potential benefits of the application of this measure represents an important barrier in its application consequently the assessment of the impact of biofouling on ship performance is very valuable within the analysis of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance the effect of the propeller surface condition is frequently neglected in this paper the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in open water condition is analysed using cfd approach as well as propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces on the example of three propellers the applicability of propeller performance prediction method which enables rapid and accurate assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is demonstrated thus a practical approach that can be used in the optimization of maintenance schedule is presented also this study has indicated the importance of propeller surface condition on the propeller performance in open water condition finally a detail analysis of the flow around fouled propeller in open water condition is provided keywords biofouling marine propeller performance prediction open water test 1 introduction there is a vast variety of species that can foul immersed surfaces and fouling occurs after a short immersion period if biofouling is not prevented in a certain way maritime transport industry is strongly affected by the biofouling as biofouling causes significant deterioration of ship performance farkas et al 2020d in the world s seas there is more than 4000 species which can foul the immersed surface of ship and fouling severity depends on many parameters almeida et al 2007 the attachment of biofouling on the immersed surface occurs in three stages formation of a conditioning film microfouling slime and macrofouling according to naval ship technical manual 2002 nstm biofouling is classified into soft hard and composite fouling the presence of biofouling on immersed surface will result in increased surface roughness causing primarily increase in frictional resistance farkas et al 2018 the costs related to biofouling in shipping industry are quite substantial and therefore any expense related to the development procurement and application of antifouling af coatings as well as potentially expensive technical or management strategies for decision making regarding the frequency of hull and propeller cleaning is economically justified even if they only slightly improve the fouling condition schultz et al 2011 beside economic aspects related to biofouling there is an environmental concern as well since the deterioration of ship performance will cause higher fuel consumption and consequently increase in greenhouse gas ghg emission usually commercial ships are dry docked every 3 5 years but for some ships this period can be extended up to 7 5 years during this period substantial biofouling can attach immersed surfaces lindholdt et al 2015 especially during longer immobile periods thus all af coatings experience the presence of slime even in newly applied condition and fouling release coatings are particularly affected by slime occurrence because they are non biocidal and require shear stress to keep surface clean ittc 2011 shear stress can be produced during the navigation however this wall shear stress is rarely high enough to allow detachment of all fouling organisms therefore regardless of applied af coating it is still necessary to clean hull and propeller surfaces in order to keep immersed surfaces free of fouling oliveira and granhag 2016 in order to minimize costs related to biofouling as well as to maximize energy savings ship maintenance schedule should be optimized the most essential barriers in this optimization are information related to the economic impact of this measure and potential impact of cleaning on the ship performance tillig et al 2017 these barriers are related to more accurate assessment of the impact of cleaning on the ship performance which would allow more accurate economic impact of cleaning farkas et al 2020a consequently the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance is very important and this is recognized by international towing tank conference ittc namely ittc ittc 2011 has advised scientists to establish new formulae or methods based on the experimental data for the analysis of this impact the impact of biofouling on the ship performance can be assessed through performance monitoring recently international standard organisation iso has issued a standard which presents an approach related to performance monitoring iso 2016 it represents the current best practice for performance monitoring despite having several drawbacks bertram 2017 another approach related to the assessment of biofouling impact on the ship performance is investigation of the fouling effects on the flow around the immersed surface this approach considers that roughness effects are limited to the inner layer of turbulent boundary layer tbl i e that velocity defect profiles are the same in the outer layer of tbl for smooth and rough surface and this hypothesis is referred as wall similarity hypothesis flack et al 2007 a downward shift of the mean velocity profile in the log law region of tbl is defined as roughness function δ u drag characterization of a rough surface refers to determination of δ u as a function of roughness reynolds number k the relation δ u f k is specific for a certain roughness type meaning that there is no universal roughness function model speranza et al 2019 thus once δ u f k for a specific roughness type is assessed it can be utilized in prediction of the frictional resistance of any arbitrary body yeginbayeva et al 2019 the impact of roughness on the ship resistance characteristics can be assessed using δ u f k and granville similarity law scaling method or through the implementation of δ u model in the wall function of the cfd solver farkas et al 2020d recently cfd models which can account for surface roughness of different roughness types are extensively used for the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance demirel et al 2017b andersson et al 2020 song et al 2020a owen et al 2018 seok and park 2020 speranza et al 2019 khor and xiao 2011 farkas et al 2020b song et al 2019b ohashi 2020 cfd models which can account for surface roughness effects have several advantages over the granville similarity law scaling method thus cfd models use fully non linear method in the assessment of roughness effects consequently cfd can predict non uniform distribution of friction velocity u τ across the immersed surface which results in non uniform distribution of k while granville similarity method uses only one k value across the whole immersed surface beside this even more important advantage of cfd approach is that it enables the assessment of the roughness effect on resistance characteristics farkas et al 2020b song et al 2019b farkas et al 2020a on propeller open water characteristics owen et al 2018 song et al 2019a song et al 2020b and propulsion characteristics song et al 2020a farkas et al 2020d also the impact of surface roughness i e biofouling on the delivered power can be determined using cfd approach and the obtained increase in the delivered power p d can be related to an increase in fuel consumption thus currently the most comprehensive assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance can be made using cfd approach since with granville similarity law scaling method only increases in effective power p e can be determined cfd wall function approach for the determination of the impact of hull roughness on the ship total resistance has been experimentally validated song et al 2020c where the authors have shown that cfd approach can correctly determine both total and frictional resistance of a 3d hull during the analysis of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance the effect of the propeller surface condition is frequently neglected ittc 2011 the impact of the propeller fouling condition is minor in comparison to hull fouling conditions but if analysed per unit area the impact of propeller fouling condition on the ship performance is significantly more important than the impact of hull fouling condition on the ship performance mosaad 1986 as shown in icct 2011 greater reduction in co2 emission can be achieved using propeller polishing than weather routing or optimization of water flow the co2 reduction potential of propeller polishing is only slightly lower than co2 reduction potential of hull cleaning which is significantly more expensive thus propeller polishing represents cheap and effective method for reduction of fuel consumption and ghg emission a study presented in hydrex 2017 estimated 5 savings in fuel due to propeller cleaning for relatively inexpensive investment in propeller cleaning high return related to the increased ship performance is enabled and this is recognized by many ship operators even though propeller cleaning is a good practice as for hull cleaning it is important to find adequate timing for cleaning which depends on the propeller performance the effect of surface roughness on the propeller performance may be subdivided into the effect of surface deterioration and fouling while the effect of surface deterioration can be adequately represented with surface roughness the fouling cannot be easily represented and the assessment of fouling effects on the propeller performance is more difficult as theoretical and experimental work done on this topic are rather scarce ittc 2011 the impact of fouling on the propeller performance is not described with formulation presented in ittc 2017b ittc 2011 has recommended researchers to investigate the effect of biofouling on the propeller performance i e to extend propeller performance prediction method with effects of biofouling ittc 2011 highlighted the importance of including at least the effect of slime on the propeller performance as it is usually present on the propeller surfaces and affects propeller performance kresic and haskell 1983 estimated the roughness effects on the open water characteristics according to ittc 1978 performance prediction method ppm and based on the work of lindgren and bjarne 1975 aucher 1973 and lerbs 1951 the authors accounted for a change in both drag c d and lift coefficient c l of propeller blade section which depend on the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s however the determination of k s requires hydrodynamic tests which cannot be performed for propellers in service recently the cfd models which can account for fouling effects on open water characteristics are proposed owen et al 2018 have implemented previously proposed δ u model demirel et al 2017b within wall function of cfd software package thereafter numerical simulations of open water test for potsdam propeller are performed and the negative effects of biofouling are determined and discussed song et al 2019a have implemented δ u model for barnacle fouling within wall function of cfd software package and performed numerical simulations of open water test for kp505 it is found that barnacle fouling causes severe effects on the open water characteristics causing the decrease in thrust coefficient k t and increase in torque coefficient k q leading to significant reduction of open water efficiency η o farkas et al 2020d have implemented δ u model for biofilm within wall function of cfd software package and performed numerical simulations of open water test for kp505 the authors have shown that due to the presence of biofilm k t can decrease up to 3 6 k q can increase up to 3 4 causing decrease in η o up to 6 8 for j around self propulsion point and for propeller with the highest tested roughness length scale even though using cfd approach the most comprehensive impact of biofouling on the ship performance as well as on the propeller performance is enabled it may be challenging for less experienced users to perform such an investigation demirel et al 2019 what is more even for experienced users cfd simulations require significant computational effort as well as certain time for pre processing and post processing during the optimization of maintenance schedule it is important to rapidly determine the impact of biofouling on the ship performance as already highlighted the impact of propeller fouling condition on the ship performance is significantly more important than the impact of hull fouling condition on the ship performance if analysed per unit area thus propeller cleaning presents cheap and effective practice for achieving significant energy savings however it is important to find adequate timing for cleaning which depends on the propeller performance in this paper the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics is investigated for three different propellers furthermore two types of biofouling are investigated i e biofilm and hard fouling for that purpose previously proposed δ u models for biofilm farkas et al 2018 and hard fouling farkas et al 2020b are implemented within wall function of cfd model in order to simulate the effect of biofilm and hard fouling on the open water characteristics the verification study is performed and numerical uncertainty is estimated the obtained open water characteristics for three propellers with smooth surface conditions are validated by comparison with the experimental results thereafter cfd simulations are carried out under various fouling conditions and the impact of biofouling on open water characteristics and the flow around propeller in open water condition is detailly analysed the applicability of the performance prediction method for fouled surface farkas et al 2020c in the prediction of propeller performance due to the presence of fouling is investigated in this paper propeller performance prediction method as an input uses the numerically obtained open water characteristics for smooth propeller in full scale therefore the performance prediction method proposed in farkas et al 2020c is modified thereafter the open water characteristics for various fouling conditions are determined and the obtained results are compared with cfd results for various fouling conditions the comparison has proven the applicability of propeller performance prediction method for fouled surface thus allowing rapid and satisfactory accurate assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in that way ittc 2011 recommendation regarding the modification of semi empirical expressions used for c d of uncoated propeller blade sections is fulfilled and the effects of biofilm and hard fouling on the propeller performance are adequately accounted 2 methodology 2 1 the impact of biofouling on the flow as already noted the presence of biofouling on immersed surface will result in increased surface roughness and the impact of surface roughness on the flow around the rough surface is accounted with the roughness function δ u thus in log law region of tbl the non dimensional velocity for rough surface is defined using following equation 1 u 1 κ ln y b δ u where κ is the von karman constant y is the non dimensional normal distance from the wall and b is the smooth log wall intercept δ u model represents δ u values expressed as a function of k which is defined as follows 2 k k u τ ν where k is the roughness length scale and ν is the kinematic viscosity within this paper two types of biofouling are studied biofilm and hard fouling the presence of biofilm i e slime on the propeller surface is very often regardless of applied af coating ittc 2011 while the presence of hard fouling on the propeller surfaces is possible during long immobile periods for the definition of k appropriate hydrodynamic tests are required one of the aims of drag characterization study is to find a relation between k and some easily measured surface properties monty et al 2016 schultz et al 2015 have proposed a new effective roughness length scale for biofilm as follows 3 k e f f 0 055 k s c where k is the average biofilm height and s c is the percentage of surface covered with biofilm the impact of biofilm on the open water characteristics is determined using three δ u models proposed in farkas et al 2018 depending on s c 4 f o r s c 25 δ u 1 κ ln 0 27767 k for k 3 61 0 for k 3 61 5 f o r 10 s c 25 δ u 1 κ ln 1 14492 0 0988 k for k 4 5 0 for k 4 5 6 f o r s c 10 δ u 1 κ ln 1 06492 0 05332 k for k 4 0 for k 4 where κ is equal to 0 42 more details regarding the proposed δ u models can be found within farkas et al 2018 where the validation of developed cfd model which can account for the effects of biofilm is presented it should be noted that δ u models proposed within farkas et al 2018 were used in the assessment of the impact of biofilm on the resistance characteristics and nominal wake of kriso container ship kcs and handymax bulk carrier farkas et al 2020a propulsion characteristics farkas et al 2020d of kcs as well as propulsion characteristics of handymax bulk carrier farkas et al 2020c schultz 2004 has proposed a scaling parameter for surfaces fouled with hard fouling as follows 7 k 0 059 r t s c where r t is the height of the largest barnacles and s c is the percentage of surface covered with barnacles equation 7 was developed using the assumption that height of the largest barnacles has the most important influence on the flow around fouled surfaces as well as that the effect of increased s c on drag is largest for small s c and smaller for large s c using equation 7 schultz has demonstrated excellent collapse of the obtained experimental results with grigson δ u model 8 δ u 1 κ ln 1 k more details regarding the drag characterization of the surfaces fouled with hard fouling can be found within schultz 2004 while more details regarding the development of cfd model which can account for the effects of hard fouling can be found within farkas et al 2020b thus a detail validation of developed cfd model along with the investigation of the effect of hard fouling on the resistance characteristics of kcs and korean very large crude carrier 2 kvlcc2 is presented in farkas et al 2020b it should be noted that in demirel et al 2017a farkas et al 2020b song et al 2019a song et al 2020a grigson δ u model is used for barnacle fouling however different scaling parameter is used as claimed by demirel et al 2017a this distinction in roughness length scales can be attributed to the fact that during the drag characterization of plates by schultz 2004 slime and hydroid accumulations were present along with barnacle fouling while demirel et al 2017a have performed the drag characterization of plates fouled with artificial barnacles only in this paper the impact of fouling with biofilm and hard fouling on the propeller performance is investigated separately thus the impact of biofilm is investigated for eight different surface conditions while the impact of hard fouling is investigated for six different surface conditions table 1 2 2 open water characteristics open water characteristics of propeller are related to the characterization of the forces and moments acting on the propeller during operation in uniform fluid stream propeller thrust t and torque q are given in non dimensional form 9 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 10 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where k t and k q are the propeller thrust and torque coefficients respectively ρ is the density of the fluid n is the propeller rate of revolution and d is the propeller diameter k t and k q are usually plotted against a range of advance coefficient defined as follows 11 j v a n d where v a is the speed of the advance propeller open water efficiency is defined as follows 12 η o j 2 π k t k q 2 3 propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces within farkas et al 2020c a new performance prediction method ppm for fouled surfaces is presented and used along with the towing tank experiments of resistance open water and self propulsion tests to assess the impact of biofilm on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics as well as on the open water characteristics the study farkas et al 2020c is performed for a handymax bulk carrier and the obtained results are compared with the ones obtained using cfd model which can account for the effects of biofilm the comparison has shown that satisfactory relative deviations are obtained and pros and cons of each approach related to the assessment of the impact of biofilm on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics are highlighted and discussed farkas et al 2020c in this study the applicability of propeller ppm for fouled surfaces is shown on the example of three propellers as well as two different fouling types while towing tank results are used as an input for newly proposed ppm in farkas et al 2020c cfd results obtained for smooth surface condition s are used as an input for propeller ppm within this paper there are two important reasons for doing so namely cfd has developed significantly as a tool for the assessment of ship performance ittc 2017a furthermore cfd baselines are most appropriate for fulfilment of the high requirements of iso performance monitoring standard iso 2016 and therefore cfd is explicitly allowed for obtaining power speed draught trim database for specific ship within procedure for performance monitoring described in iso 19030 kauffeldt and hansen 2018 additional reason is that in this way the best comparison between the obtained results using propeller ppm and cfd model is allowed as the same input data will be used for the prediction of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance since ppm for fouled surfaces proposed in farkas et al 2020c is actually an extrapolation method which could account for fouling effects as well this method is modified to account only fouling effects ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c accounts for fouling effects on the propeller performance as follows 13 k t r k t s δ k t d δ k t l 14 k q r k q s δ k q d δ k q l changes in k t and k q as a result of increased drag coefficient c d are estimated as follows 15 δ k t d δ c d x 0 3 x p d c x z d 16 δ k q d δ c d 0 25 c z d changes in k t and k q as a result of reduced value of lift coefficient are accounted as follows 17 δ k t l δ c l c z d 0 733 0 132 j 2 1 0 18 p d 2 18 δ k q l δ c l c z d 0 117 0 021 j 2 1 0 18 p d 2 where k t s and k q s are thrust and torque coefficients for smooth propeller p is the propeller pitch z is the number of blades c is the chord length at radius 0 75 r t is the maximum thickness at radius 0 75 r δ c d is the change in drag coefficient calculated as a difference between c d for smooth c d s and rough surface c d r δ c l is the change in lift coefficient calculated as δ c l 1 1 δ c d the propeller ppm in this paper for k t s and k q s values uses results obtained from cfd simulations of open water test for smooth propeller equations 13 18 estimate roughness effects on the propeller performance based on the equations proposed in kresic and haskell 1983 where the authors accounted for roughness effects on the propeller performance according to ittc 1978 ppm ittc 2017b and work of lindgren and bjarne 1975 aucher 1973 and lerbs 1951 however there is an important difference between method proposed by kresic and haskell 1983 and method used in this paper and this difference lies in different estimation of c d r namely c d can be separated into the contribution of the friction c f and the section form drag c d 2 d helma 2016 19 c d 2 c d 2 d c f the contribution of c d 2 d is taken into account with the term 1 2 t c and it is assumed that c d 2 d is independent of roughness ittc 2017b kresic and haskell 1983 and this assumption is used in propeller ppm as well however the contribution of c f within method proposed in kresic and haskell 1983 and in propeller ppm is not accounted in a same way thus kresic and haskell have assessed c f using the equation proposed by lindgren and bjarne 1975 20 c f 1 89 1 62 log c k p 2 5 and this equation is also suggested within ittc 1978 ppm ittc 2017b equation 20 represents equation for frictional resistance coefficient of rough plate schlichting 1968 in order to determine k p for fouled propellers hydrodynamic tests are required which are very difficult or even impossible to perform for propellers in service on the other hand propeller ppm assesses c f as a frictional resistance coefficient of rough plate c f r having a length equal to c at r 0 75 r and calculates for the resultant velocity of the flow approaching the propeller blade section v r at r 0 75 r in full scale c f r is determined using granville similarity law scaling method and δ u model for certain fouling type more details regarding granville similarity law scaling method can be found in schultz 2007 thus propeller ppm does not require hydrodynamic tests if drag characterization of certain fouling type is already performed and scaling parameter is proposed in this paper equations 3 and 7 are used for the assessment of roughness length scale for biofilm and hard fouling c d for smooth propeller is determined as follows 21 c d s 2 1 t c c f s where c f s is the frictional coefficient of a smooth plate having the same length as c at r 0 75 r and it is obtained using schoenherr friction line 22 0 242 c f s log r n c f s where r n is the reynolds number determined as follows 23 r n v r c ν as can be seen propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces consists of several numerical operations which may produce numerical errors if performed manually for each fouling condition and propeller therefore an in house numerical code is developed to allow robust and fast solution the developed code requires open water characteristics of full scale smooth propeller data regarding propeller geometry c d p t z propeller rate of revolution in open water test n as well as data regarding the fouling condition as an input open water characteristics of full scale smooth propeller k t s and k q s are taken from cfd simulations for smooth propeller for a range of j for which cfd simulations are performed data regarding fouling condition represent the selection of δ u model and the values of k and s c for biofilm or r t and s c for hard fouling after all input data is imported the code rapidly calculates the propeller open water characteristics for required fouling condition using above mentioned equations and granville similarity law scaling method the flow chart of the proposed propeller ppm is shown in fig 1 2 4 assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance using cfd model 2 4 1 numerical modelling cfd models which can account for the effect of biofilm and hard fouling are based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and averaged continuity equation 24 x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j 25 ρ u i x i 0 where u i is the averaged velocity vector ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor p is the mean pressure and τ i j is the mean viscous stress tensor equations 24 and 25 are closed using k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model cfd simulations of open water test are performed using steady moving reference frame mrf method as shown by owen et al 2018 the application of steady mrf method only slightly reduces the accuracy of the results in comparison with unsteady mrf method while the obtained results using mrf method showed insignificant differences in comparison with unsteady sliding mesh approach therefore owen et al 2018 concluded that the application of steady mrf in cfd simulations of open water test is recommended since it requires less computational effort the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is taken into account through the implementation of δ u models within the wall function of commercial software package star ccm the discretization of convective terms in the momentum equations and equations of the turbulence model is carried out utilizing the second order upwind convection scheme the continuity and momentum equations are linked with a predictor corrector approach 2 4 2 computational domain the computational domain is made as a cylinder and for its discretization the unstructured hexahedral mesh is used the prism layer mesh is used for near wall refinement and the thickness of the first cell near the wall is chosen in a way that y values are higher than 30 and higher than k values demirel et al 2017b the mesh is refined along the leading and trailing edge of the propeller in order to make an appropriate demarcation between the suction and pressure side of the propeller also isotropic mesh refinements are applied around the propeller the volume mesh for cfd simulations of open water test in full scale is shown in fig 2 volume mesh for smooth wb propeller has around 5m cells for smooth kp505 around 7m cells and for smooth kp458 around 5 25 m cells since the first cell height must be higher than 2 k e f f or 2 k the special near wall mesh resolution is used for surface conditions with higher k thus lowering the total number of cells the same volume mesh for propellers fouled with biofilm is used as for smooth propellers since k e f f values are relatively small the number of cells used in cfd simulations of open water test for propellers fouled with hard fouling is around 3 5m cells for wb propeller around 5 5 m cells for kp505 and around 4 25 m cells for kp458 in order to avoid influence of domain boundaries on the obtained results boundaries are placed sufficiently far from the propeller as can be seen from fig 3 the applied boundary conditions are velocity inlet for inlet boundary pressure outlet for outlet boundary no slip wall for propeller and shaft surfaces and slip wall for lateral surface of computational domain cfd simulations are performed for full scale propellers at 11 j values for wb propeller 8 j values for kp505 propeller and 7 j values for kp458 propeller in a way that n 1 5 rps is kept constant while v a is changed through iterations 2 4 3 verification study the verification study is carried out utilizing grid convergence index gci method to determine sufficient grid spacing and estimate grid uncertainty iterative uncertainty is considered to be negligible and therefore numerical uncertainty is consisted only of grid uncertainty grid sensitivity study is performed using three meshes for smooth propellers as well as for propellers fouled with surface conditions r2 b and r1 h for j around expected self propulsion point as key variables k t and k q are used and the obtained solutions using coarse mesh is noted as φ 3 medium mesh as φ 2 and fine mesh as φ 1 differences among the obtained solutions are calculated as ε 21 φ 2

100 2 4 4 validation study and comparison the obtained open water characteristics for smooth propellers using cfd are compared with the experimentally obtained ones nmri 2015 brodarski institute 2014 simman 2008 it should be noted that using cfd open water tests are performed in full scale while experimental open water tests are performed in model scale towing tank tests for all three investigated propellers are performed at r n which are above r n 2 10 5 as prescribed by ittc 2017b in order to show the applicability of propeller ppm for fouled surfaces the obtained results using this method φ ppm and cfd model φ cfd are compared and relative deviations are calculated as follows 33 r d φ ppm φ cfd φ cfd 100 the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics is calculated as follows 34 δ φ φ r φ s φ s 100 where φ r is the certain open water characteristic for rough propeller and φ s is the certain open water characteristic for smooth propeller 2 5 case study in this study three full scale propellers are investigated wb kp505 and kp458 and their main particulars are shown in table 2 wb propeller is propeller from wageningen series which was used as a stock propeller in self propulsion tests of handymax bulk carrier brodarski institute 2014 kp505 and kp458 were designed by korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso for propulsion of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively geometries of the investigated propellers can be seen in fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification study the obtained results of verification study are presented in tables 3 and 4 as can be seen from tables 3 and 4 relatively low numerical uncertainties are obtained and in line with numerical uncertainties of other cfd studies regarding open water test song et al 2019a owen et al 2018 numerical uncertainties obtained for smooth and fouled propellers are relatively close i e numerical uncertainty has not raised due to the roughness effects it should be noted that remaining cfd simulations regarding the assessment of the effect of biofouling on the propeller performance are carried out using fine mesh 3 2 validation study and comparison the obtained open water characteristics for smooth propellers are validated by comparison with the experimentally obtained open water characteristics fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental open water characteristics is achieved for all investigated propellers slightly higher relative deviations between numerically and experimentally obtained open water characteristics are obtained for wb propeller at lower j values however at higher j values where self propulsion point is expected for handymax bulk carrier these r d are lower it should be noted that similar agreement between numerical and experimental open water characteristics for kp505 is achieved by castro et al 2011 where the authors also obtained slightly higher η o cfd finally the lowest r d are obtained for kp458 where the highest r d is obtained at the highest investigated j which is higher than j for which the curve η o has its maximum and therefore it is unlikely that propeller will operate at this j the obtained open water characteristics for smooth propellers are used as one of the inputs for the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance with propeller ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c thereafter the obtained results using this method are compared with the ones obtained using cfd approach tables 5 10 it should be noted that the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is assessed for wide range of j same as for smooth propellers while in table 5 10 this impact is shown only for one j value around advance coefficient for self propulsion point j s p p j value around self propulsion point for kcs with kp505 fouled with biofilm is estimated from results published in farkas et al 2020d for handymax bulk carrier with wb fouled with biofilm is estimated from results published in farkas et al 2020c while for kvlcc2 with kp458 fouled with biofilm is estimated from extrapolated towing tank results of self propulsion tests for smooth kvlcc2 with kp458 kim et al 2001 j s p p for investigated ships and propellers fouled with hard fouling is expected to be lower than j s p p for investigated ships and propellers fouled with biofilm since it is shown that increase in fouling severity causes the reduction of j s p p farkas et al 2020d as can be seen from tables 5 7 the impact of biofilm on the propeller performance is well predicted using the propeller ppm farkas et al 2020c in comparison with the obtained open water characteristics using cfd model thus for wb propeller at j 0 56 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 0 552 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r4 b and is equal to 0 405 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 0 257 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum propeller operating region are lower than 1 for wb propeller for 10 k q are lower than 0 6 while for η o are lower than 0 4 for kp505 propeller at j 0 7 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 1 001 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r3 b and is equal to 0 332 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 0 774 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 1 4 for kp505 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 0 6 while for η o are lower than 0 8 for kp458 propeller at j 0 5 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 1 673 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 1 299 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r4 b and is equal to 0 389 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 2 for kp458 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 1 6 while for η o are lower than 1 as it can be seen from tables 8 10 even though the obtained r d for hard fouling are slightly higher than for biofilm it can be concluded that the impact of hard fouling on the propeller performance is well predicted using the propeller ppm farkas et al 2020c in comparison with the obtained open water characteristics using cfd model thus for wb propeller at j 0 48 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r6 h and is equal to 2 604 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r6 h and is equal to 1 092 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r4 h and is equal to 1 745 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum propeller operating region are lower than 3 6 for wb propeller for 10 k q are lower than 2 7 while for η o are lower than 3 3 for kp505 propeller at j 0 6 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 2 408 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 0 803 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r2 h and is equal to 1 628 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 4 6 for kp505 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 2 4 while for η o are lower than 2 3 for kp458 propeller at j 0 4 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 5 319 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r2 h and is equal to 2 986 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 2 383 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 5 6 for kp458 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 4 3 while for η o are lower than 3 6 3 3 the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics within this section the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics assessed using cfd approach and propeller ppm is presented the impact of biofilm and hard fouling on the open water characteristics for three propellers at various j is analysed the presence of biofouling has caused reduction of k t an increase in 10 k q which has caused significant reduction of η o the impact of biofilm on k t 10 k q and η o is presented for three propellers in figs 6 8 for surface condition r2 b as can be seen from figs 6 8 the predicted impact of biofilm on k t 10 k q and η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for wb and kp505 is almost the same on the other hand the impact of biofilm on k t using propeller ppm is underpredicted in comparison with cfd approach for propeller kp458 while the impact of biofilm on 10 k q is overpredicted at lower j values it should be noted that kp458 probably will not operate at lower j values where η o is rather low the impact of biofilm on η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for kp458 is almost the same except for the highest investigated j where the impact of biofilm on η o is slightly underpredicted however since this j value is higher than j value for which the curve η o has its maximum kp458 propeller will not operate at this j therefore it can be concluded that the impact of biofilm on the propeller performance can be accurately predicted using propeller ppm in comparison with cfd approach even though the presence of biofilm is often ignored farkas et al 2020d due to the presence of biofilm r2 b at j around self propulsion point η o is significantly reduced thus for wb propeller the obtained δ η o is equal to 5 5 cfd and 5 7 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 8 cfd and 7 4 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 5 cfd and 6 2 propeller ppm it should be noted that surface condition r2 b has the highest k e f f amongst the investigated surface conditions for biofilm the minimum δ η o r7b obtained at j around self propulsion point for wb propeller is 0 45 cfd and 0 35 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller is 0 55 cfd and 0 5 propeller ppm and for kp458 propeller is 0 57 cfd and 0 48 propeller ppm the obtained δ η o show the importance of propeller cleaning even if only slime is present as noted in ittc 2011 slime can be relatively easily wiped off propeller without significant damage of the propeller coating and therefore underwater cleaning of slime from propeller should be considered as relatively easy efficient and cheap method for reduction of fuel costs and ghg emission while the impact of biofilm on open water characteristics is moderate the impact of hard fouling on open water characteristics is substantial figs 9 11 as can be seen from figs 9 and 10 the predicted impact of hard fouling on k t 10 k q and η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for wb and kp505 is almost the same on the other hand the impact of hard fouling on k t using propeller ppm is underpredicted in comparison with cfd approach for propeller kp458 while the impact of hard fouling on 10 k q is overpredicted at lower j values j 0 4 the impact of hard fouling on η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for kp458 is quite similar except for j 0 6 and j 0 7 where the impact of biofilm on η o is underpredicted however since j 0 6 and j 0 7 are higher than j value for which the curve η o has its maximum kp458 propeller will not operate at these j the obtained δ η o at j 0 5 using cfd approach is equal to 25 5 while using propeller ppm is equal to 22 8 and for lower j values these differences are even lower therefore it can be concluded that the impact of hard fouling on the propeller performance can be accurately predicted using propeller ppm in comparison with cfd approach as can be seen from figs 9 11 the presence of hard fouling r1 h at j value around self propulsion point causes significant reduction in η o thus for wb propeller the obtained δ η o is equal to 19 1 cfd and 17 8 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 21 0 cfd and 22 3 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 20 4 cfd and 18 5 propeller ppm it should be noted that surface condition r1 h has the highest k amongst the investigated surface conditions for hard fouling the minimum δ η o r6 h obtained at j value around self propulsion point for wb propeller is 11 2 cfd and 9 9 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller is 10 4 cfd and 11 3 propeller ppm and for kp458 propeller is 9 8 cfd and 9 4 propeller ppm from the obtained results it is clear that the presence of hard fouling will cause significant detrimental effects on the propeller performance and that significant savings in the fuel consumption and ghg emission can be achieved if the propeller is cleaned the cleaning of hard fouling from the propeller surfaces can cause damage of the propeller coating and therefore the potential savings will be reduced as the damaged propeller coating will have rougher surface furthermore antifouling performance of damaged coating is reduced and therefore the fouling will occur faster in addition to underwater cleaning of propeller fouled with hard fouling is more difficult than underwater cleaning of propeller fouled with biofilm as hard fouling has higher adhesion strength and for some cases dry docking is required which increases the costs of propeller cleaning regardless of this the potential savings in fuel consumption and ghg emission are very high and therefore propeller cleaning is recommended as can be seen from figs 8 11 due to the presence of fouling j value for which maximum η o is obtained is reduced in comparison with smooth propeller thus for smooth wb propeller j value for which maximum η o is obtained is around 0 77 while for wb propeller fouled with hard fouling r1 h is around 0 64 it should be noted that the reduction in j value for which maximum η o is obtained is well predicted with propeller ppm in comparison with cfd approach within this paper the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is investigated for two types of biofouling biofilm and hard fouling it should be highlighted that both cfd model and propeller ppm are not limited to these two specific types of fouling i e other type of fouling can be investigated by applying different δ u model based on the obtained results for the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics using cfd approach and propeller ppm it can be concluded that propeller ppm allows robust reliable and fast prediction of this impact 3 4 the impact of biofouling on the flow around propeller in open water test the great benefit of cfd over experimental fluid dynamics efd is that cfd enables detail analysis of the flow phenomena thus the impact of biofouling on the flow around propeller in open water test is investigated within this section since hard fouling represents a biofouling with significantly higher fouling severity than biofilm its effects on the flow around propeller are more pronounced and can be more easily noticed than the effects of the biofilm thus the impact of hard fouling on the flow around kp505 propeller in open water test is shown within this section as the effects of hard fouling on the flow around other two investigated propellers are similar it should be noted that the obtained impact of biofilm on the flow around propeller shows similar trends as hard fouling however these effects are less significant the impact of hard fouling on the pressure distribution on y 0 plane is shown in fig 12 it should be noted that the obtained pressure within fig 12 is shown as pressure coefficient c p i e pressure is nondimensionalised with 1 2 ρ v a 2 from fig 12 it is clear that the pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of kp505 is significantly reduced due to the presence of hard fouling r1h thus the values of c p in front of face side are lower for smooth than for fouled kp505 while the values of c p behind the back side are higher for smooth than for fouled kp505 which leads to decrease in pressure components in the propeller thrust and torque for fouled propeller song et al 2019a the reduction in pressure difference between propeller face and back sides can be seen in fig 13 as well within fig 13 the values of c p around one blade section at r 0 75 r are shown it should be noted that the values of pressure in fig 13 are nondimensionalised with 1 2 ρ v r 2 the reduction in pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of the propeller due to the presence of hard fouling causes decrease in lift coefficient of the blade section and consequently decrease in k t it should be noted that figs 12 and 13 are shown for s and r1 h fouling condition at j 0 7 nondimensionalised axial velocity distribution v x v a on y 0 plane for smooth and r1 h surface condition at j 0 7 is shown in fig 14 it should be noted that this distribution is related to the pressure distribution as can be seen from fig 14 the values of v x v a are lower for fouled propeller and distribution of v x v a is more scattered the skin friction of propeller blades is increased due to the presence of hard fouling r1 h and consequently c d of the blades increases leading to an increase in k q the increase in skin friction is related to the increased wall shear stress on the propeller blades fig 15 due to the decrease in k t and increase in k q η o is significantly reduced due to the presence of biofouling as can be seen from equation 12 the distribution of vorticity magnitudes on y 0 plane for smooth and fouled kp505 are shown in fig 16 the distribution of vorticity magnitudes for fouled r1 h kp505 is more scattered in comparison with smooth kp505 from fig 16 it is clear that the strength of vortices is reduced due to the presence of hard fouling on the propeller surfaces and therefore they dissipate earlier in comparison with vortices around smooth propeller surfaces however the vorticity magnitude around fouled propeller is higher than around smooth propeller the impact of hard fouling on the vorticity magnitudes can be seen more clearly in fig 17 where the iso surface of q criterion q 10 s 2 is shown as can be seen from fig 17 the tip and hub vortices dissipate earlier for fouled kp505 in comparison with smooth kp505 also from fig 17 it can be seen that vortices in the vicinity of the fouled kp505 are stronger than vortices in the vicinity of the smooth kp505 4 conclusions the impact of the propeller surface condition is frequently neglected during the analysis of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance however if analysed per unit area the impact of propeller fouling condition on the ship performance is significantly more important than the impact of hull fouling condition on the ship performance one of the important barriers for the optimization of maintenance schedule is lack of information related to the potential benefits of the application of this measure also the rapid determination of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance i e potential benefits is very important during the optimization of maintenance schedule therefore the goal of this study was twofold the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in open water condition as well as investigation of the applicability of the propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces while cfd approach currently represents the most comprehensive approach for the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship and propeller performance the proposed performance prediction method enables rapid and satisfactory accurate assessment of this impact propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces is consisted of several numerical operations which may produce numerical errors if performed manually for each fouling condition and propeller therefore an in house numerical code is developed to allow robust and fast solution in order to show the applicability of the proposed method the obtained results are compared with the ones obtained using cfd model the impact of two types of biofouling i e biofilm and hard fouling on open water characteristics is studied within this paper for three different propellers firstly a cfd model has been prepared and numerical simulations of open water test for three full scale propellers are carried out verification study is performed in order to assess the numerical uncertainty as well as to determine sufficient cell number thereafter the obtained open water characteristics are validated by comparison with the experimental data nmri 2015 brodarski institute 2014 simman 2008 and satisfactory agreement is achieved the obtained open water characteristics are utilized as an input for the performance prediction method however it should be highlighted that the proposed method is not constrained on using cfd results of open water test for smooth propeller as an input i e experimentally obtained open water characteristics can be used as well as shown in farkas et al 2020c after the validation study a cfd model which can account for the effects of fouling is prepared and numerical simulations of open water test for eight surface conditions for biofilm and six surface conditions for hard fouling are carried out in addition to the verification study is performed to assess numerical uncertainties in the prediction of open water characteristics of fouled propellers where relatively low numerical uncertainties are achieved the obtained open water characteristics using performance prediction method and cfd model are compared and satisfactory agreement is achieved it should be noted that wb propeller is tested at 11 j values kp505 at 8 j values while kp468 at 7 j values for biofilm fouling the highest r d between open water characteristics obtained using performance prediction method and cfd at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum is lower than 1 for wb propeller 1 4 for kp505 and 2 for kp468 respectively for hard fouling the highest r d between open water characteristics obtained using performance prediction method and cfd at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum is lower than 3 6 for wb propeller 4 6 for kp505 and 5 6 for kp468 respectively what is more it is shown that the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics at all investigated j values is adequately predicted with performance prediction method in comparison with cfd approach due to the presence of biofouling k t decreases and k q increases leading to significant reduction in η o the obtained δ η o due to the presence of biofilm r2 b at j value around self propulsion point for wb propeller is equal to 5 5 cfd and 5 7 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 8 cfd and 7 4 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 5 cfd and 6 2 propeller ppm the obtained δ η o due to the presence of hard fouling r1 h at j values around self propulsion point for wb propeller is equal to 19 1 cfd and 17 8 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 21 0 cfd and 22 3 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 20 4 cfd and 18 5 propeller ppm from the obtained results it is evident that significant savings in the fuel consumption and reduction of ghg emission can be achieved if the propeller is cleaned or polished it can be concluded that performance prediction method for fouled surface can be applied for reliable and rapid assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in that way ittc 2011 recommendation regarding the modification of semi empirical expressions used for c d of uncoated propeller blade sections is fulfilled and the effects of biofilm and hard fouling on the propeller performance are adequately accounted even though cfd model requires significantly more computational time than propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces it enables a detail investigation of the flow around propeller in open water condition thus it is shown that the presence of biofouling on the propeller surface causes the reduction in pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of the propeller which leads to reduction in c l i e reduction in k t on the other hand the presence of biofouling on the propeller surfaces causes significant increase in wall shear stress leading to an increase in c d i e increase in k q it is shown that the presence of biofouling on the propeller surface leads to reduction of axial velocity downstream as well as to reduction in the strength of tip and hub vortices downstream therefore vortices behind the fouled propeller dissipate earlier in comparison with smooth propeller on the other hand the vortices in the vicinity of the fouled propeller are stronger than vortices in the vicinity of the smooth propeller this research has shown the applicability of the propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces also it pointed out the importance of propeller condition i e the importance of propeller cleaning or polishing this research is performed for open water condition only in order to assess more accurately the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance operating in the wake of a ship hull further studies are needed also the presence of biofouling on the ship hull also causes detrimental effects on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics therefore as a part of a future work the applicability of performance prediction method for fouled surfaces in the prediction of the effect of biofouling on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics will be investigated credit authorship contribution statement andrea

21286,maritime transport industry is facing more and more strict rules regarding the ship emissions optimization of maintenance schedule represents an important operational measure but lack of information related to the potential benefits of the application of this measure represents an important barrier in its application consequently the assessment of the impact of biofouling on ship performance is very valuable within the analysis of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance the effect of the propeller surface condition is frequently neglected in this paper the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in open water condition is analysed using cfd approach as well as propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces on the example of three propellers the applicability of propeller performance prediction method which enables rapid and accurate assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is demonstrated thus a practical approach that can be used in the optimization of maintenance schedule is presented also this study has indicated the importance of propeller surface condition on the propeller performance in open water condition finally a detail analysis of the flow around fouled propeller in open water condition is provided keywords biofouling marine propeller performance prediction open water test 1 introduction there is a vast variety of species that can foul immersed surfaces and fouling occurs after a short immersion period if biofouling is not prevented in a certain way maritime transport industry is strongly affected by the biofouling as biofouling causes significant deterioration of ship performance farkas et al 2020d in the world s seas there is more than 4000 species which can foul the immersed surface of ship and fouling severity depends on many parameters almeida et al 2007 the attachment of biofouling on the immersed surface occurs in three stages formation of a conditioning film microfouling slime and macrofouling according to naval ship technical manual 2002 nstm biofouling is classified into soft hard and composite fouling the presence of biofouling on immersed surface will result in increased surface roughness causing primarily increase in frictional resistance farkas et al 2018 the costs related to biofouling in shipping industry are quite substantial and therefore any expense related to the development procurement and application of antifouling af coatings as well as potentially expensive technical or management strategies for decision making regarding the frequency of hull and propeller cleaning is economically justified even if they only slightly improve the fouling condition schultz et al 2011 beside economic aspects related to biofouling there is an environmental concern as well since the deterioration of ship performance will cause higher fuel consumption and consequently increase in greenhouse gas ghg emission usually commercial ships are dry docked every 3 5 years but for some ships this period can be extended up to 7 5 years during this period substantial biofouling can attach immersed surfaces lindholdt et al 2015 especially during longer immobile periods thus all af coatings experience the presence of slime even in newly applied condition and fouling release coatings are particularly affected by slime occurrence because they are non biocidal and require shear stress to keep surface clean ittc 2011 shear stress can be produced during the navigation however this wall shear stress is rarely high enough to allow detachment of all fouling organisms therefore regardless of applied af coating it is still necessary to clean hull and propeller surfaces in order to keep immersed surfaces free of fouling oliveira and granhag 2016 in order to minimize costs related to biofouling as well as to maximize energy savings ship maintenance schedule should be optimized the most essential barriers in this optimization are information related to the economic impact of this measure and potential impact of cleaning on the ship performance tillig et al 2017 these barriers are related to more accurate assessment of the impact of cleaning on the ship performance which would allow more accurate economic impact of cleaning farkas et al 2020a consequently the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance is very important and this is recognized by international towing tank conference ittc namely ittc ittc 2011 has advised scientists to establish new formulae or methods based on the experimental data for the analysis of this impact the impact of biofouling on the ship performance can be assessed through performance monitoring recently international standard organisation iso has issued a standard which presents an approach related to performance monitoring iso 2016 it represents the current best practice for performance monitoring despite having several drawbacks bertram 2017 another approach related to the assessment of biofouling impact on the ship performance is investigation of the fouling effects on the flow around the immersed surface this approach considers that roughness effects are limited to the inner layer of turbulent boundary layer tbl i e that velocity defect profiles are the same in the outer layer of tbl for smooth and rough surface and this hypothesis is referred as wall similarity hypothesis flack et al 2007 a downward shift of the mean velocity profile in the log law region of tbl is defined as roughness function δ u drag characterization of a rough surface refers to determination of δ u as a function of roughness reynolds number k the relation δ u f k is specific for a certain roughness type meaning that there is no universal roughness function model speranza et al 2019 thus once δ u f k for a specific roughness type is assessed it can be utilized in prediction of the frictional resistance of any arbitrary body yeginbayeva et al 2019 the impact of roughness on the ship resistance characteristics can be assessed using δ u f k and granville similarity law scaling method or through the implementation of δ u model in the wall function of the cfd solver farkas et al 2020d recently cfd models which can account for surface roughness of different roughness types are extensively used for the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance demirel et al 2017b andersson et al 2020 song et al 2020a owen et al 2018 seok and park 2020 speranza et al 2019 khor and xiao 2011 farkas et al 2020b song et al 2019b ohashi 2020 cfd models which can account for surface roughness effects have several advantages over the granville similarity law scaling method thus cfd models use fully non linear method in the assessment of roughness effects consequently cfd can predict non uniform distribution of friction velocity u τ across the immersed surface which results in non uniform distribution of k while granville similarity method uses only one k value across the whole immersed surface beside this even more important advantage of cfd approach is that it enables the assessment of the roughness effect on resistance characteristics farkas et al 2020b song et al 2019b farkas et al 2020a on propeller open water characteristics owen et al 2018 song et al 2019a song et al 2020b and propulsion characteristics song et al 2020a farkas et al 2020d also the impact of surface roughness i e biofouling on the delivered power can be determined using cfd approach and the obtained increase in the delivered power p d can be related to an increase in fuel consumption thus currently the most comprehensive assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance can be made using cfd approach since with granville similarity law scaling method only increases in effective power p e can be determined cfd wall function approach for the determination of the impact of hull roughness on the ship total resistance has been experimentally validated song et al 2020c where the authors have shown that cfd approach can correctly determine both total and frictional resistance of a 3d hull during the analysis of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance the effect of the propeller surface condition is frequently neglected ittc 2011 the impact of the propeller fouling condition is minor in comparison to hull fouling conditions but if analysed per unit area the impact of propeller fouling condition on the ship performance is significantly more important than the impact of hull fouling condition on the ship performance mosaad 1986 as shown in icct 2011 greater reduction in co2 emission can be achieved using propeller polishing than weather routing or optimization of water flow the co2 reduction potential of propeller polishing is only slightly lower than co2 reduction potential of hull cleaning which is significantly more expensive thus propeller polishing represents cheap and effective method for reduction of fuel consumption and ghg emission a study presented in hydrex 2017 estimated 5 savings in fuel due to propeller cleaning for relatively inexpensive investment in propeller cleaning high return related to the increased ship performance is enabled and this is recognized by many ship operators even though propeller cleaning is a good practice as for hull cleaning it is important to find adequate timing for cleaning which depends on the propeller performance the effect of surface roughness on the propeller performance may be subdivided into the effect of surface deterioration and fouling while the effect of surface deterioration can be adequately represented with surface roughness the fouling cannot be easily represented and the assessment of fouling effects on the propeller performance is more difficult as theoretical and experimental work done on this topic are rather scarce ittc 2011 the impact of fouling on the propeller performance is not described with formulation presented in ittc 2017b ittc 2011 has recommended researchers to investigate the effect of biofouling on the propeller performance i e to extend propeller performance prediction method with effects of biofouling ittc 2011 highlighted the importance of including at least the effect of slime on the propeller performance as it is usually present on the propeller surfaces and affects propeller performance kresic and haskell 1983 estimated the roughness effects on the open water characteristics according to ittc 1978 performance prediction method ppm and based on the work of lindgren and bjarne 1975 aucher 1973 and lerbs 1951 the authors accounted for a change in both drag c d and lift coefficient c l of propeller blade section which depend on the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s however the determination of k s requires hydrodynamic tests which cannot be performed for propellers in service recently the cfd models which can account for fouling effects on open water characteristics are proposed owen et al 2018 have implemented previously proposed δ u model demirel et al 2017b within wall function of cfd software package thereafter numerical simulations of open water test for potsdam propeller are performed and the negative effects of biofouling are determined and discussed song et al 2019a have implemented δ u model for barnacle fouling within wall function of cfd software package and performed numerical simulations of open water test for kp505 it is found that barnacle fouling causes severe effects on the open water characteristics causing the decrease in thrust coefficient k t and increase in torque coefficient k q leading to significant reduction of open water efficiency η o farkas et al 2020d have implemented δ u model for biofilm within wall function of cfd software package and performed numerical simulations of open water test for kp505 the authors have shown that due to the presence of biofilm k t can decrease up to 3 6 k q can increase up to 3 4 causing decrease in η o up to 6 8 for j around self propulsion point and for propeller with the highest tested roughness length scale even though using cfd approach the most comprehensive impact of biofouling on the ship performance as well as on the propeller performance is enabled it may be challenging for less experienced users to perform such an investigation demirel et al 2019 what is more even for experienced users cfd simulations require significant computational effort as well as certain time for pre processing and post processing during the optimization of maintenance schedule it is important to rapidly determine the impact of biofouling on the ship performance as already highlighted the impact of propeller fouling condition on the ship performance is significantly more important than the impact of hull fouling condition on the ship performance if analysed per unit area thus propeller cleaning presents cheap and effective practice for achieving significant energy savings however it is important to find adequate timing for cleaning which depends on the propeller performance in this paper the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics is investigated for three different propellers furthermore two types of biofouling are investigated i e biofilm and hard fouling for that purpose previously proposed δ u models for biofilm farkas et al 2018 and hard fouling farkas et al 2020b are implemented within wall function of cfd model in order to simulate the effect of biofilm and hard fouling on the open water characteristics the verification study is performed and numerical uncertainty is estimated the obtained open water characteristics for three propellers with smooth surface conditions are validated by comparison with the experimental results thereafter cfd simulations are carried out under various fouling conditions and the impact of biofouling on open water characteristics and the flow around propeller in open water condition is detailly analysed the applicability of the performance prediction method for fouled surface farkas et al 2020c in the prediction of propeller performance due to the presence of fouling is investigated in this paper propeller performance prediction method as an input uses the numerically obtained open water characteristics for smooth propeller in full scale therefore the performance prediction method proposed in farkas et al 2020c is modified thereafter the open water characteristics for various fouling conditions are determined and the obtained results are compared with cfd results for various fouling conditions the comparison has proven the applicability of propeller performance prediction method for fouled surface thus allowing rapid and satisfactory accurate assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in that way ittc 2011 recommendation regarding the modification of semi empirical expressions used for c d of uncoated propeller blade sections is fulfilled and the effects of biofilm and hard fouling on the propeller performance are adequately accounted 2 methodology 2 1 the impact of biofouling on the flow as already noted the presence of biofouling on immersed surface will result in increased surface roughness and the impact of surface roughness on the flow around the rough surface is accounted with the roughness function δ u thus in log law region of tbl the non dimensional velocity for rough surface is defined using following equation 1 u 1 κ ln y b δ u where κ is the von karman constant y is the non dimensional normal distance from the wall and b is the smooth log wall intercept δ u model represents δ u values expressed as a function of k which is defined as follows 2 k k u τ ν where k is the roughness length scale and ν is the kinematic viscosity within this paper two types of biofouling are studied biofilm and hard fouling the presence of biofilm i e slime on the propeller surface is very often regardless of applied af coating ittc 2011 while the presence of hard fouling on the propeller surfaces is possible during long immobile periods for the definition of k appropriate hydrodynamic tests are required one of the aims of drag characterization study is to find a relation between k and some easily measured surface properties monty et al 2016 schultz et al 2015 have proposed a new effective roughness length scale for biofilm as follows 3 k e f f 0 055 k s c where k is the average biofilm height and s c is the percentage of surface covered with biofilm the impact of biofilm on the open water characteristics is determined using three δ u models proposed in farkas et al 2018 depending on s c 4 f o r s c 25 δ u 1 κ ln 0 27767 k for k 3 61 0 for k 3 61 5 f o r 10 s c 25 δ u 1 κ ln 1 14492 0 0988 k for k 4 5 0 for k 4 5 6 f o r s c 10 δ u 1 κ ln 1 06492 0 05332 k for k 4 0 for k 4 where κ is equal to 0 42 more details regarding the proposed δ u models can be found within farkas et al 2018 where the validation of developed cfd model which can account for the effects of biofilm is presented it should be noted that δ u models proposed within farkas et al 2018 were used in the assessment of the impact of biofilm on the resistance characteristics and nominal wake of kriso container ship kcs and handymax bulk carrier farkas et al 2020a propulsion characteristics farkas et al 2020d of kcs as well as propulsion characteristics of handymax bulk carrier farkas et al 2020c schultz 2004 has proposed a scaling parameter for surfaces fouled with hard fouling as follows 7 k 0 059 r t s c where r t is the height of the largest barnacles and s c is the percentage of surface covered with barnacles equation 7 was developed using the assumption that height of the largest barnacles has the most important influence on the flow around fouled surfaces as well as that the effect of increased s c on drag is largest for small s c and smaller for large s c using equation 7 schultz has demonstrated excellent collapse of the obtained experimental results with grigson δ u model 8 δ u 1 κ ln 1 k more details regarding the drag characterization of the surfaces fouled with hard fouling can be found within schultz 2004 while more details regarding the development of cfd model which can account for the effects of hard fouling can be found within farkas et al 2020b thus a detail validation of developed cfd model along with the investigation of the effect of hard fouling on the resistance characteristics of kcs and korean very large crude carrier 2 kvlcc2 is presented in farkas et al 2020b it should be noted that in demirel et al 2017a farkas et al 2020b song et al 2019a song et al 2020a grigson δ u model is used for barnacle fouling however different scaling parameter is used as claimed by demirel et al 2017a this distinction in roughness length scales can be attributed to the fact that during the drag characterization of plates by schultz 2004 slime and hydroid accumulations were present along with barnacle fouling while demirel et al 2017a have performed the drag characterization of plates fouled with artificial barnacles only in this paper the impact of fouling with biofilm and hard fouling on the propeller performance is investigated separately thus the impact of biofilm is investigated for eight different surface conditions while the impact of hard fouling is investigated for six different surface conditions table 1 2 2 open water characteristics open water characteristics of propeller are related to the characterization of the forces and moments acting on the propeller during operation in uniform fluid stream propeller thrust t and torque q are given in non dimensional form 9 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 10 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where k t and k q are the propeller thrust and torque coefficients respectively ρ is the density of the fluid n is the propeller rate of revolution and d is the propeller diameter k t and k q are usually plotted against a range of advance coefficient defined as follows 11 j v a n d where v a is the speed of the advance propeller open water efficiency is defined as follows 12 η o j 2 π k t k q 2 3 propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces within farkas et al 2020c a new performance prediction method ppm for fouled surfaces is presented and used along with the towing tank experiments of resistance open water and self propulsion tests to assess the impact of biofilm on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics as well as on the open water characteristics the study farkas et al 2020c is performed for a handymax bulk carrier and the obtained results are compared with the ones obtained using cfd model which can account for the effects of biofilm the comparison has shown that satisfactory relative deviations are obtained and pros and cons of each approach related to the assessment of the impact of biofilm on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics are highlighted and discussed farkas et al 2020c in this study the applicability of propeller ppm for fouled surfaces is shown on the example of three propellers as well as two different fouling types while towing tank results are used as an input for newly proposed ppm in farkas et al 2020c cfd results obtained for smooth surface condition s are used as an input for propeller ppm within this paper there are two important reasons for doing so namely cfd has developed significantly as a tool for the assessment of ship performance ittc 2017a furthermore cfd baselines are most appropriate for fulfilment of the high requirements of iso performance monitoring standard iso 2016 and therefore cfd is explicitly allowed for obtaining power speed draught trim database for specific ship within procedure for performance monitoring described in iso 19030 kauffeldt and hansen 2018 additional reason is that in this way the best comparison between the obtained results using propeller ppm and cfd model is allowed as the same input data will be used for the prediction of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance since ppm for fouled surfaces proposed in farkas et al 2020c is actually an extrapolation method which could account for fouling effects as well this method is modified to account only fouling effects ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c accounts for fouling effects on the propeller performance as follows 13 k t r k t s δ k t d δ k t l 14 k q r k q s δ k q d δ k q l changes in k t and k q as a result of increased drag coefficient c d are estimated as follows 15 δ k t d δ c d x 0 3 x p d c x z d 16 δ k q d δ c d 0 25 c z d changes in k t and k q as a result of reduced value of lift coefficient are accounted as follows 17 δ k t l δ c l c z d 0 733 0 132 j 2 1 0 18 p d 2 18 δ k q l δ c l c z d 0 117 0 021 j 2 1 0 18 p d 2 where k t s and k q s are thrust and torque coefficients for smooth propeller p is the propeller pitch z is the number of blades c is the chord length at radius 0 75 r t is the maximum thickness at radius 0 75 r δ c d is the change in drag coefficient calculated as a difference between c d for smooth c d s and rough surface c d r δ c l is the change in lift coefficient calculated as δ c l 1 1 δ c d the propeller ppm in this paper for k t s and k q s values uses results obtained from cfd simulations of open water test for smooth propeller equations 13 18 estimate roughness effects on the propeller performance based on the equations proposed in kresic and haskell 1983 where the authors accounted for roughness effects on the propeller performance according to ittc 1978 ppm ittc 2017b and work of lindgren and bjarne 1975 aucher 1973 and lerbs 1951 however there is an important difference between method proposed by kresic and haskell 1983 and method used in this paper and this difference lies in different estimation of c d r namely c d can be separated into the contribution of the friction c f and the section form drag c d 2 d helma 2016 19 c d 2 c d 2 d c f the contribution of c d 2 d is taken into account with the term 1 2 t c and it is assumed that c d 2 d is independent of roughness ittc 2017b kresic and haskell 1983 and this assumption is used in propeller ppm as well however the contribution of c f within method proposed in kresic and haskell 1983 and in propeller ppm is not accounted in a same way thus kresic and haskell have assessed c f using the equation proposed by lindgren and bjarne 1975 20 c f 1 89 1 62 log c k p 2 5 and this equation is also suggested within ittc 1978 ppm ittc 2017b equation 20 represents equation for frictional resistance coefficient of rough plate schlichting 1968 in order to determine k p for fouled propellers hydrodynamic tests are required which are very difficult or even impossible to perform for propellers in service on the other hand propeller ppm assesses c f as a frictional resistance coefficient of rough plate c f r having a length equal to c at r 0 75 r and calculates for the resultant velocity of the flow approaching the propeller blade section v r at r 0 75 r in full scale c f r is determined using granville similarity law scaling method and δ u model for certain fouling type more details regarding granville similarity law scaling method can be found in schultz 2007 thus propeller ppm does not require hydrodynamic tests if drag characterization of certain fouling type is already performed and scaling parameter is proposed in this paper equations 3 and 7 are used for the assessment of roughness length scale for biofilm and hard fouling c d for smooth propeller is determined as follows 21 c d s 2 1 t c c f s where c f s is the frictional coefficient of a smooth plate having the same length as c at r 0 75 r and it is obtained using schoenherr friction line 22 0 242 c f s log r n c f s where r n is the reynolds number determined as follows 23 r n v r c ν as can be seen propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces consists of several numerical operations which may produce numerical errors if performed manually for each fouling condition and propeller therefore an in house numerical code is developed to allow robust and fast solution the developed code requires open water characteristics of full scale smooth propeller data regarding propeller geometry c d p t z propeller rate of revolution in open water test n as well as data regarding the fouling condition as an input open water characteristics of full scale smooth propeller k t s and k q s are taken from cfd simulations for smooth propeller for a range of j for which cfd simulations are performed data regarding fouling condition represent the selection of δ u model and the values of k and s c for biofilm or r t and s c for hard fouling after all input data is imported the code rapidly calculates the propeller open water characteristics for required fouling condition using above mentioned equations and granville similarity law scaling method the flow chart of the proposed propeller ppm is shown in fig 1 2 4 assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance using cfd model 2 4 1 numerical modelling cfd models which can account for the effect of biofilm and hard fouling are based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and averaged continuity equation 24 x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j 25 ρ u i x i 0 where u i is the averaged velocity vector ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor p is the mean pressure and τ i j is the mean viscous stress tensor equations 24 and 25 are closed using k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model cfd simulations of open water test are performed using steady moving reference frame mrf method as shown by owen et al 2018 the application of steady mrf method only slightly reduces the accuracy of the results in comparison with unsteady mrf method while the obtained results using mrf method showed insignificant differences in comparison with unsteady sliding mesh approach therefore owen et al 2018 concluded that the application of steady mrf in cfd simulations of open water test is recommended since it requires less computational effort the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is taken into account through the implementation of δ u models within the wall function of commercial software package star ccm the discretization of convective terms in the momentum equations and equations of the turbulence model is carried out utilizing the second order upwind convection scheme the continuity and momentum equations are linked with a predictor corrector approach 2 4 2 computational domain the computational domain is made as a cylinder and for its discretization the unstructured hexahedral mesh is used the prism layer mesh is used for near wall refinement and the thickness of the first cell near the wall is chosen in a way that y values are higher than 30 and higher than k values demirel et al 2017b the mesh is refined along the leading and trailing edge of the propeller in order to make an appropriate demarcation between the suction and pressure side of the propeller also isotropic mesh refinements are applied around the propeller the volume mesh for cfd simulations of open water test in full scale is shown in fig 2 volume mesh for smooth wb propeller has around 5m cells for smooth kp505 around 7m cells and for smooth kp458 around 5 25 m cells since the first cell height must be higher than 2 k e f f or 2 k the special near wall mesh resolution is used for surface conditions with higher k thus lowering the total number of cells the same volume mesh for propellers fouled with biofilm is used as for smooth propellers since k e f f values are relatively small the number of cells used in cfd simulations of open water test for propellers fouled with hard fouling is around 3 5m cells for wb propeller around 5 5 m cells for kp505 and around 4 25 m cells for kp458 in order to avoid influence of domain boundaries on the obtained results boundaries are placed sufficiently far from the propeller as can be seen from fig 3 the applied boundary conditions are velocity inlet for inlet boundary pressure outlet for outlet boundary no slip wall for propeller and shaft surfaces and slip wall for lateral surface of computational domain cfd simulations are performed for full scale propellers at 11 j values for wb propeller 8 j values for kp505 propeller and 7 j values for kp458 propeller in a way that n 1 5 rps is kept constant while v a is changed through iterations 2 4 3 verification study the verification study is carried out utilizing grid convergence index gci method to determine sufficient grid spacing and estimate grid uncertainty iterative uncertainty is considered to be negligible and therefore numerical uncertainty is consisted only of grid uncertainty grid sensitivity study is performed using three meshes for smooth propellers as well as for propellers fouled with surface conditions r2 b and r1 h for j around expected self propulsion point as key variables k t and k q are used and the obtained solutions using coarse mesh is noted as φ 3 medium mesh as φ 2 and fine mesh as φ 1 differences among the obtained solutions are calculated as ε 21 φ 2 φ 1 and ε 32 φ 3 φ 2 the apparent order of method p a is calculated as follows 26 p a 1 ln r 21 ln ε 32 ε 21 q p a 27 q p a ln r 21 p a s r 32 p a s 28 s sign ε 32 ε 21 where r 21 and r 32 are refinement factors the extrapolated solution is calculated using 29 while the approximate relative error e a 21 and extrapolated relative error e e x t 21 are determined with 30 and 31 respectively 29

100 2 4 4 validation study and comparison the obtained open water characteristics for smooth propellers using cfd are compared with the experimentally obtained ones nmri 2015 brodarski institute 2014 simman 2008 it should be noted that using cfd open water tests are performed in full scale while experimental open water tests are performed in model scale towing tank tests for all three investigated propellers are performed at r n which are above r n 2 10 5 as prescribed by ittc 2017b in order to show the applicability of propeller ppm for fouled surfaces the obtained results using this method φ ppm and cfd model φ cfd are compared and relative deviations are calculated as follows 33 r d φ ppm φ cfd φ cfd 100 the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics is calculated as follows 34 δ φ φ r φ s φ s 100 where φ r is the certain open water characteristic for rough propeller and φ s is the certain open water characteristic for smooth propeller 2 5 case study in this study three full scale propellers are investigated wb kp505 and kp458 and their main particulars are shown in table 2 wb propeller is propeller from wageningen series which was used as a stock propeller in self propulsion tests of handymax bulk carrier brodarski institute 2014 kp505 and kp458 were designed by korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso for propulsion of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively geometries of the investigated propellers can be seen in fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification study the obtained results of verification study are presented in tables 3 and 4 as can be seen from tables 3 and 4 relatively low numerical uncertainties are obtained and in line with numerical uncertainties of other cfd studies regarding open water test song et al 2019a owen et al 2018 numerical uncertainties obtained for smooth and fouled propellers are relatively close i e numerical uncertainty has not raised due to the roughness effects it should be noted that remaining cfd simulations regarding the assessment of the effect of biofouling on the propeller performance are carried out using fine mesh 3 2 validation study and comparison the obtained open water characteristics for smooth propellers are validated by comparison with the experimentally obtained open water characteristics fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental open water characteristics is achieved for all investigated propellers slightly higher relative deviations between numerically and experimentally obtained open water characteristics are obtained for wb propeller at lower j values however at higher j values where self propulsion point is expected for handymax bulk carrier these r d are lower it should be noted that similar agreement between numerical and experimental open water characteristics for kp505 is achieved by castro et al 2011 where the authors also obtained slightly higher η o cfd finally the lowest r d are obtained for kp458 where the highest r d is obtained at the highest investigated j which is higher than j for which the curve η o has its maximum and therefore it is unlikely that propeller will operate at this j the obtained open water characteristics for smooth propellers are used as one of the inputs for the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance with propeller ppm for fouled surfaces farkas et al 2020c thereafter the obtained results using this method are compared with the ones obtained using cfd approach tables 5 10 it should be noted that the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is assessed for wide range of j same as for smooth propellers while in table 5 10 this impact is shown only for one j value around advance coefficient for self propulsion point j s p p j value around self propulsion point for kcs with kp505 fouled with biofilm is estimated from results published in farkas et al 2020d for handymax bulk carrier with wb fouled with biofilm is estimated from results published in farkas et al 2020c while for kvlcc2 with kp458 fouled with biofilm is estimated from extrapolated towing tank results of self propulsion tests for smooth kvlcc2 with kp458 kim et al 2001 j s p p for investigated ships and propellers fouled with hard fouling is expected to be lower than j s p p for investigated ships and propellers fouled with biofilm since it is shown that increase in fouling severity causes the reduction of j s p p farkas et al 2020d as can be seen from tables 5 7 the impact of biofilm on the propeller performance is well predicted using the propeller ppm farkas et al 2020c in comparison with the obtained open water characteristics using cfd model thus for wb propeller at j 0 56 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 0 552 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r4 b and is equal to 0 405 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 0 257 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum propeller operating region are lower than 1 for wb propeller for 10 k q are lower than 0 6 while for η o are lower than 0 4 for kp505 propeller at j 0 7 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 1 001 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r3 b and is equal to 0 332 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 0 774 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 1 4 for kp505 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 0 6 while for η o are lower than 0 8 for kp458 propeller at j 0 5 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 1 673 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r2 b and is equal to 1 299 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r4 b and is equal to 0 389 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 2 for kp458 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 1 6 while for η o are lower than 1 as it can be seen from tables 8 10 even though the obtained r d for hard fouling are slightly higher than for biofilm it can be concluded that the impact of hard fouling on the propeller performance is well predicted using the propeller ppm farkas et al 2020c in comparison with the obtained open water characteristics using cfd model thus for wb propeller at j 0 48 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r6 h and is equal to 2 604 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r6 h and is equal to 1 092 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r4 h and is equal to 1 745 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum propeller operating region are lower than 3 6 for wb propeller for 10 k q are lower than 2 7 while for η o are lower than 3 3 for kp505 propeller at j 0 6 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 2 408 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 0 803 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r2 h and is equal to 1 628 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 4 6 for kp505 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 2 4 while for η o are lower than 2 3 for kp458 propeller at j 0 4 the highest r d between k t ppm and k t cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 5 319 the highest r d between 10 k q ppm and 10 k q cfd is obtained for r2 h and is equal to 2 986 and the highest r d between η o ppm and η o cfd is obtained for r1 h and is equal to 2 383 the obtained r d for k t at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum are lower than 5 6 for kp458 propeller for 10 k q are lower than 4 3 while for η o are lower than 3 6 3 3 the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics within this section the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics assessed using cfd approach and propeller ppm is presented the impact of biofilm and hard fouling on the open water characteristics for three propellers at various j is analysed the presence of biofouling has caused reduction of k t an increase in 10 k q which has caused significant reduction of η o the impact of biofilm on k t 10 k q and η o is presented for three propellers in figs 6 8 for surface condition r2 b as can be seen from figs 6 8 the predicted impact of biofilm on k t 10 k q and η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for wb and kp505 is almost the same on the other hand the impact of biofilm on k t using propeller ppm is underpredicted in comparison with cfd approach for propeller kp458 while the impact of biofilm on 10 k q is overpredicted at lower j values it should be noted that kp458 probably will not operate at lower j values where η o is rather low the impact of biofilm on η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for kp458 is almost the same except for the highest investigated j where the impact of biofilm on η o is slightly underpredicted however since this j value is higher than j value for which the curve η o has its maximum kp458 propeller will not operate at this j therefore it can be concluded that the impact of biofilm on the propeller performance can be accurately predicted using propeller ppm in comparison with cfd approach even though the presence of biofilm is often ignored farkas et al 2020d due to the presence of biofilm r2 b at j around self propulsion point η o is significantly reduced thus for wb propeller the obtained δ η o is equal to 5 5 cfd and 5 7 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 8 cfd and 7 4 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 5 cfd and 6 2 propeller ppm it should be noted that surface condition r2 b has the highest k e f f amongst the investigated surface conditions for biofilm the minimum δ η o r7b obtained at j around self propulsion point for wb propeller is 0 45 cfd and 0 35 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller is 0 55 cfd and 0 5 propeller ppm and for kp458 propeller is 0 57 cfd and 0 48 propeller ppm the obtained δ η o show the importance of propeller cleaning even if only slime is present as noted in ittc 2011 slime can be relatively easily wiped off propeller without significant damage of the propeller coating and therefore underwater cleaning of slime from propeller should be considered as relatively easy efficient and cheap method for reduction of fuel costs and ghg emission while the impact of biofilm on open water characteristics is moderate the impact of hard fouling on open water characteristics is substantial figs 9 11 as can be seen from figs 9 and 10 the predicted impact of hard fouling on k t 10 k q and η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for wb and kp505 is almost the same on the other hand the impact of hard fouling on k t using propeller ppm is underpredicted in comparison with cfd approach for propeller kp458 while the impact of hard fouling on 10 k q is overpredicted at lower j values j 0 4 the impact of hard fouling on η o using cfd approach and propeller ppm for kp458 is quite similar except for j 0 6 and j 0 7 where the impact of biofilm on η o is underpredicted however since j 0 6 and j 0 7 are higher than j value for which the curve η o has its maximum kp458 propeller will not operate at these j the obtained δ η o at j 0 5 using cfd approach is equal to 25 5 while using propeller ppm is equal to 22 8 and for lower j values these differences are even lower therefore it can be concluded that the impact of hard fouling on the propeller performance can be accurately predicted using propeller ppm in comparison with cfd approach as can be seen from figs 9 11 the presence of hard fouling r1 h at j value around self propulsion point causes significant reduction in η o thus for wb propeller the obtained δ η o is equal to 19 1 cfd and 17 8 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 21 0 cfd and 22 3 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 20 4 cfd and 18 5 propeller ppm it should be noted that surface condition r1 h has the highest k amongst the investigated surface conditions for hard fouling the minimum δ η o r6 h obtained at j value around self propulsion point for wb propeller is 11 2 cfd and 9 9 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller is 10 4 cfd and 11 3 propeller ppm and for kp458 propeller is 9 8 cfd and 9 4 propeller ppm from the obtained results it is clear that the presence of hard fouling will cause significant detrimental effects on the propeller performance and that significant savings in the fuel consumption and ghg emission can be achieved if the propeller is cleaned the cleaning of hard fouling from the propeller surfaces can cause damage of the propeller coating and therefore the potential savings will be reduced as the damaged propeller coating will have rougher surface furthermore antifouling performance of damaged coating is reduced and therefore the fouling will occur faster in addition to underwater cleaning of propeller fouled with hard fouling is more difficult than underwater cleaning of propeller fouled with biofilm as hard fouling has higher adhesion strength and for some cases dry docking is required which increases the costs of propeller cleaning regardless of this the potential savings in fuel consumption and ghg emission are very high and therefore propeller cleaning is recommended as can be seen from figs 8 11 due to the presence of fouling j value for which maximum η o is obtained is reduced in comparison with smooth propeller thus for smooth wb propeller j value for which maximum η o is obtained is around 0 77 while for wb propeller fouled with hard fouling r1 h is around 0 64 it should be noted that the reduction in j value for which maximum η o is obtained is well predicted with propeller ppm in comparison with cfd approach within this paper the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance is investigated for two types of biofouling biofilm and hard fouling it should be highlighted that both cfd model and propeller ppm are not limited to these two specific types of fouling i e other type of fouling can be investigated by applying different δ u model based on the obtained results for the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics using cfd approach and propeller ppm it can be concluded that propeller ppm allows robust reliable and fast prediction of this impact 3 4 the impact of biofouling on the flow around propeller in open water test the great benefit of cfd over experimental fluid dynamics efd is that cfd enables detail analysis of the flow phenomena thus the impact of biofouling on the flow around propeller in open water test is investigated within this section since hard fouling represents a biofouling with significantly higher fouling severity than biofilm its effects on the flow around propeller are more pronounced and can be more easily noticed than the effects of the biofilm thus the impact of hard fouling on the flow around kp505 propeller in open water test is shown within this section as the effects of hard fouling on the flow around other two investigated propellers are similar it should be noted that the obtained impact of biofilm on the flow around propeller shows similar trends as hard fouling however these effects are less significant the impact of hard fouling on the pressure distribution on y 0 plane is shown in fig 12 it should be noted that the obtained pressure within fig 12 is shown as pressure coefficient c p i e pressure is nondimensionalised with 1 2 ρ v a 2 from fig 12 it is clear that the pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of kp505 is significantly reduced due to the presence of hard fouling r1h thus the values of c p in front of face side are lower for smooth than for fouled kp505 while the values of c p behind the back side are higher for smooth than for fouled kp505 which leads to decrease in pressure components in the propeller thrust and torque for fouled propeller song et al 2019a the reduction in pressure difference between propeller face and back sides can be seen in fig 13 as well within fig 13 the values of c p around one blade section at r 0 75 r are shown it should be noted that the values of pressure in fig 13 are nondimensionalised with 1 2 ρ v r 2 the reduction in pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of the propeller due to the presence of hard fouling causes decrease in lift coefficient of the blade section and consequently decrease in k t it should be noted that figs 12 and 13 are shown for s and r1 h fouling condition at j 0 7 nondimensionalised axial velocity distribution v x v a on y 0 plane for smooth and r1 h surface condition at j 0 7 is shown in fig 14 it should be noted that this distribution is related to the pressure distribution as can be seen from fig 14 the values of v x v a are lower for fouled propeller and distribution of v x v a is more scattered the skin friction of propeller blades is increased due to the presence of hard fouling r1 h and consequently c d of the blades increases leading to an increase in k q the increase in skin friction is related to the increased wall shear stress on the propeller blades fig 15 due to the decrease in k t and increase in k q η o is significantly reduced due to the presence of biofouling as can be seen from equation 12 the distribution of vorticity magnitudes on y 0 plane for smooth and fouled kp505 are shown in fig 16 the distribution of vorticity magnitudes for fouled r1 h kp505 is more scattered in comparison with smooth kp505 from fig 16 it is clear that the strength of vortices is reduced due to the presence of hard fouling on the propeller surfaces and therefore they dissipate earlier in comparison with vortices around smooth propeller surfaces however the vorticity magnitude around fouled propeller is higher than around smooth propeller the impact of hard fouling on the vorticity magnitudes can be seen more clearly in fig 17 where the iso surface of q criterion q 10 s 2 is shown as can be seen from fig 17 the tip and hub vortices dissipate earlier for fouled kp505 in comparison with smooth kp505 also from fig 17 it can be seen that vortices in the vicinity of the fouled kp505 are stronger than vortices in the vicinity of the smooth kp505 4 conclusions the impact of the propeller surface condition is frequently neglected during the analysis of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance however if analysed per unit area the impact of propeller fouling condition on the ship performance is significantly more important than the impact of hull fouling condition on the ship performance one of the important barriers for the optimization of maintenance schedule is lack of information related to the potential benefits of the application of this measure also the rapid determination of the impact of biofouling on the ship performance i e potential benefits is very important during the optimization of maintenance schedule therefore the goal of this study was twofold the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in open water condition as well as investigation of the applicability of the propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces while cfd approach currently represents the most comprehensive approach for the assessment of the impact of biofouling on the ship and propeller performance the proposed performance prediction method enables rapid and satisfactory accurate assessment of this impact propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces is consisted of several numerical operations which may produce numerical errors if performed manually for each fouling condition and propeller therefore an in house numerical code is developed to allow robust and fast solution in order to show the applicability of the proposed method the obtained results are compared with the ones obtained using cfd model the impact of two types of biofouling i e biofilm and hard fouling on open water characteristics is studied within this paper for three different propellers firstly a cfd model has been prepared and numerical simulations of open water test for three full scale propellers are carried out verification study is performed in order to assess the numerical uncertainty as well as to determine sufficient cell number thereafter the obtained open water characteristics are validated by comparison with the experimental data nmri 2015 brodarski institute 2014 simman 2008 and satisfactory agreement is achieved the obtained open water characteristics are utilized as an input for the performance prediction method however it should be highlighted that the proposed method is not constrained on using cfd results of open water test for smooth propeller as an input i e experimentally obtained open water characteristics can be used as well as shown in farkas et al 2020c after the validation study a cfd model which can account for the effects of fouling is prepared and numerical simulations of open water test for eight surface conditions for biofilm and six surface conditions for hard fouling are carried out in addition to the verification study is performed to assess numerical uncertainties in the prediction of open water characteristics of fouled propellers where relatively low numerical uncertainties are achieved the obtained open water characteristics using performance prediction method and cfd model are compared and satisfactory agreement is achieved it should be noted that wb propeller is tested at 11 j values kp505 at 8 j values while kp468 at 7 j values for biofilm fouling the highest r d between open water characteristics obtained using performance prediction method and cfd at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum is lower than 1 for wb propeller 1 4 for kp505 and 2 for kp468 respectively for hard fouling the highest r d between open water characteristics obtained using performance prediction method and cfd at all investigated j values below j value for which the curve η o has its maximum is lower than 3 6 for wb propeller 4 6 for kp505 and 5 6 for kp468 respectively what is more it is shown that the impact of biofouling on the open water characteristics at all investigated j values is adequately predicted with performance prediction method in comparison with cfd approach due to the presence of biofouling k t decreases and k q increases leading to significant reduction in η o the obtained δ η o due to the presence of biofilm r2 b at j value around self propulsion point for wb propeller is equal to 5 5 cfd and 5 7 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 8 cfd and 7 4 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 6 5 cfd and 6 2 propeller ppm the obtained δ η o due to the presence of hard fouling r1 h at j values around self propulsion point for wb propeller is equal to 19 1 cfd and 17 8 propeller ppm for kp505 propeller δ η o is equal to 21 0 cfd and 22 3 propeller ppm while for kp458 propeller δ η o is equal to 20 4 cfd and 18 5 propeller ppm from the obtained results it is evident that significant savings in the fuel consumption and reduction of ghg emission can be achieved if the propeller is cleaned or polished it can be concluded that performance prediction method for fouled surface can be applied for reliable and rapid assessment of the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance in that way ittc 2011 recommendation regarding the modification of semi empirical expressions used for c d of uncoated propeller blade sections is fulfilled and the effects of biofilm and hard fouling on the propeller performance are adequately accounted even though cfd model requires significantly more computational time than propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces it enables a detail investigation of the flow around propeller in open water condition thus it is shown that the presence of biofouling on the propeller surface causes the reduction in pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of the propeller which leads to reduction in c l i e reduction in k t on the other hand the presence of biofouling on the propeller surfaces causes significant increase in wall shear stress leading to an increase in c d i e increase in k q it is shown that the presence of biofouling on the propeller surface leads to reduction of axial velocity downstream as well as to reduction in the strength of tip and hub vortices downstream therefore vortices behind the fouled propeller dissipate earlier in comparison with smooth propeller on the other hand the vortices in the vicinity of the fouled propeller are stronger than vortices in the vicinity of the smooth propeller this research has shown the applicability of the propeller performance prediction method for fouled surfaces also it pointed out the importance of propeller condition i e the importance of propeller cleaning or polishing this research is performed for open water condition only in order to assess more accurately the impact of biofouling on the propeller performance operating in the wake of a ship hull further studies are needed also the presence of biofouling on the ship hull also causes detrimental effects on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics therefore as a part of a future work the applicability of performance prediction method for fouled surfaces in the prediction of the effect of biofouling on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics will be investigated credit authorship contribution statement andrea

21287,floating wind turbines represent a cost efficient energy solution in deep water where bottom fixed wind turbine becomes excessively expensive however mooring design is quite challenging for all shallow water depths including the transition water depth between bottom fixed and floating wind turbines in the order of 50 80 m for which floating concepts might become more cost effective than bottom fixed ones in this paper mooring system design for floating wind turbine in shallow water are studied considering both catenary and taut mooring systems seven mooring concepts designed for a 5 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine at 50 m water depth are compared with the purpose to identify solutions that are structurally reliable and economically attractive the concepts are made of different mooring line materials chain and synthetic fibre rope mooring components clump weight and buoy and anchors drag embedment anchor and suction anchor based on the latest experimental data the nonlinear tension dependent stiffness of synthetic fibre rope are described with an improved numerical model performance of the seven mooring concepts are compared with respect to mooring line characteristics motion response amplitude operator utilization factor considering the ultimate limit state design and cost etc six mooring design concepts are finally recommended for future assessment regarding the application of floating wind turbines in shallow water say 50 m and deeper keywords floating wind turbine shallow water hybrid mooring design synthetic fibre rope syrope model 1 introduction wind energy is characterized as clean and reliable power and it has experienced a rapid development in recent years in both onshore and offshore sectors global wind energy council 2019 compared with onshore wind several attributes for offshore wind make its future quite promising such as immense stable resource great area availability easy transportation little visual disturbance and noise etc offshore wind resources in many countries is found at a water depth above 50 m where bottom fixed wind turbine becomes less cost attractive and floating wind turbine is considered as a better alternative myhr et al 2014 as the world s first floating wind farm in operation hywind scotland which consists of five 6 mw hywind spars was commissioned in october 2017 in august 2019 hywind tampen project equinor 2020 was launched with the purpose of supplying power to the snorre and gullfaks oil fields from 2022 meanwhile semi submersible floating wind turbine started to make a figure recently taking advantage of its smaller draft and wider range of applicable water depth it has been successfully implemented in the world s second floating wind farm windfloat atlantic in portugal which consists of three 8 4 mw windfloat semi submersibles edp renewable 2020 the windfloat concept was also implemented in the 50 mw kincardine offshore wind farm in uk which features a total of five 9 525 mw turbines and one 2 mw turbine the 2 mw turbine was connected to british grid in october 2018 ns energy 2020 the manufacturing work of the remaining five windfloat foundations began in march 2019 at the navantia fene yard in spain and three foundations have been assembled by march 2020 while all five foundations are expected to be ready and delivered by summer 2020 4coffshore 2020 despite all the progress there are still some challenges that remain to be solved before floating wind turbine can be further promoted with bigger market one of them is the design of mooring system for a water depth of about 50 m 80 m which is normally considered as the transition water depth between floating and bottom fixed wind turbines when water depth becomes shallow the effective water depth from fairlead to seabed for the mooring system to function becomes quite limited which makes the mooring design more challenging than that in deep water despite rich experience of mooring design in offshore oil gas industry the design requirement and consideration between large oil gas platform and floating wind turbine are quite different the size of a typical floating oil and gas platform normally is much larger than floating wind platform considering the dimensions mass displacement etc as an example the general properties of the seventh generation semi submersible drilling platform bluewhale i and the oc4 semi submersible wind turbine is compared in table 1 for a 5 mw floating wind turbine the displacement typically is in the range between 5000 t and 7000 t as for the oc4 semi submersible in this study the displacement is close to 14 000 t while the mass of ballasting water takes significant part 9621 t therefore a steel floater of 14 000 t displacement could also support a 15 mw turbine with proper ballast by referring to the properties of iea 15 mw reference wind turbine gaertner et al 2020 floating wind farm normally consists of several floating units space clearance and wake effect have to be considered when designing mooring system wise and bachynski 2020 these issues are not relevant for oil platform the mean offset of floating wind turbine is greatly influenced by the thrust force at different wind speeds whose influence is quite different for oil and gas platform failure of mooring lines of manned oil and gas platforms may cause severe consequences in terms of fatalities or severe pollution while the mooring line failure consequences of floating wind turbines essentially are economical hence mooring line criteria for oil and gas platforms are more restrictive and typically including damage assessment the design issues of mooring system for floating wind turbine in shallow water has been investigated by several researchers brommundt et al 2012 developed a numerical tool for the optimization of catenary mooring systems a case study was performed for a semi submersible floating wind turbine with two water depths 75 m and 330 m the optimal line length angle and horizontal distance between anchor and fairlead are studied benassai et al 2014a compared the motion control performance of catenary and tensioned line mooring systems for the dutch tri floater wind turbine at water depth between 50 m and 200 m both operational and extreme load cases are considered the weight of chain cable and steel wire rope are compared at different water depths benassai et al 2014b extended the study to the influence of line number platform maximum admissible offset and mooring line pattern mooring configurations consisting of nine or twelve lines were recommended the results indicated that the mooring line weight is independent of water depth between 100 m and 200 m while the weight will increase outside this range benassai et al 2015 further investigated the mooring optimization technique from allowable platform offset line number and mooring pattern the results indicated that mooring weight reduction for traditional mooring configuration can be achieved by designing mooring patterns with non uniform angular distribution campanile et al 2018 proposed several catenary mooring designs for the dutch tri floater wind turbine at water depth from 50 m to 80 m and from 200 m to 350 m respectively recommendations were provided with respect to line number platform admissible offset and minimum spacing between adjacent wind turbines etc a preliminary cost analysis was performed regarding the installation and maintenance cost xu et al 2018 proposed mooring system designs at three water depths 50 m 100 m and 200 m and concluded that the nonlinear mooring line tension increment becomes more significant as water depth decreases use of clump weight and buoy can improve the mooring performance by balancing compliance and strength the application of clump weight in mooring system can be traced back to the guyed tower proposed by finn 1976 in extreme conditions when the platform experiences large motions the clump weight will be lifted from the seabed to establish an extended catenary shape to minimize the floater motion morrison and asce 1983 further proved the significant resistance to horizontal loading for the guyed tower due to the attachment of clump weight the benefit of attaching buoy to mooring line was studied by mavrakos et al 1996 and confirmed that the reduction of mooring line dynamics can be achieved when the size number and location of buoy are properly selected the study was further continued by mavrakos and chatjigeorgiou 1997 with frequency domain and time domain analysis the buoy attached mooring was applied for wave energy converter at a water depth of 50 m by fitzgerald and bergdahl 2007 and proved that buoy can reduce the cable weight induced mooring loads and the influence on the floater motion hybrid mooring concepts consisting of both clump weight and buoy have also been developed for offshore applications mooring configurations consisting of catenary chain with or without additional clump weight or buoy were compared by vicente et al 2011 for a floating point absorber the results showed that the maximum horizontal motion and absorbed power are less sensitive to different configurations of the buoys and clump weights than average and maximum mooring line tension yuan et al 2014 developed a hybrid mooring concept for semi submersible platform in deep water which consists of clump weights and buoys attached to the lower and upper end of the line respectively the performance of platform motion and line tension were improved the challenges of mooring system design for floating wind turbine in shallow water were considered in several industrial projects normally the location of fairlead which is used to connect mooring line and floater is beneath water level the technique of moving fairlead from underwater to above water level have been adopted by innwind eu 2017 and lifes50 2018 for designing floating wind turbines the change of fairlead location artificially increases the effective water depth from fairlead to seabed which is beneficial to improve the mooring line tension characteristics however one potential disadvantage is the corrosion and fatigue issues in particular for chain links and steel wires synthetic fibre ropes rather than chain links and steel wire rope are considered by more and more offshore renewable projects because of the lower weight and cost synthetic fibre rope mooring system was first used in offshore oil gas industry petrobras pioneered the application to the p 27 platform in 1997 rossi et al 2010 ever since then it has experienced a booming development as deep or ultra deep water mooring solutions all over the world including brazil gulf of mexico north sea bugg et al 2004 meanwhile the application of synthetic fibre ropes for offshore renewable project is still at an early stage there are only a few projects that consider synthetic fibre rope as mooring solutions including ceto wave energy converter carnegie clean energy 2020 and floatgen wind turbine ideol 2020 weller et al 2015 provided an overview of the application of synthetic ropes for marine renewable projects from different perspectives including classification model testing installation degradation and maintenance etc the state of the art of mooring system design for floating wind turbine in shallow water can be summarized as follows 1 the previous mooring design studies for shallow water were mainly made of pure chain links with no clump weight or buoy included the influence of water depth on design parameters was focused rather than sophisticated structural design at a specific water depth the proposed hybrid mooring concepts combined with clump weights and buoys were mainly designed for deep water application and the application in shallow water mooring was not considered 2 the experience with synthetic fibre ropes in the oil gas sector is mainly for deep and ultra deep water however there is also great potential of synthetic fibre rope mooring in shallow water due to its lower elastic stiffness and capital cost 3 the material property and the structural behavior of synthetic fibre rope is more complex than chain cable and steel wire rope the change in length response of synthetic fibre rope is non linear and load path dependent current industrial practice is to use the upper bound and lower bound method api 2014 which is not only conservative but also inconsistent because the offset is obtained based on a lower bound stiffness model while the dynamic tension is estimated through another upper bound stiffness model there is still a lack of a well defined understanding of the structural characteristics and mooring analysis programs with the capability to simulate the non linear change in length response of the synthetic fibre ropes 4 regarding the mooring system of floating wind turbines there is a lack of comparison between alternative materials and configurations for industrial guidance with the purpose of further expanding the applicability of floating wind turbine in shallow water the focus of this paper is to identify the challenges and possible solutions of mooring system design for floating wind turbine when water depth approaches its marginal range 50 m compared with previous studies the highlights of this paper are summarized as follows 1 the reasons why mooring system design becomes challenging when the water depth goes from deep to shallow is systematically studied for both catenary and taut mooring systems 2 hybrid mooring designs with or without clump weights and buoys are compared with pure cable system in order to assess the benefit of including additional mooring components in shallow water mooring 3 the use of synthetic fibre rope for shallow water mooring was investigated considering the limitation of traditional upper bound and lower bound method for synthetic fibre rope analysis a refined numerical model denoted syrope defining the static and dynamic stiffness in a single model is applied in this paper to avoid over conservative mooring design 4 despite limited publicly available data a preliminary cost analysis for different mooring concepts was performed using information from different sources 5 recommendation for preferable mooring designs for floating wind turbine in shallow water depth are made for industrial guidance through comparative studies of different mooring designs this paper is organized as follows the mooring design challenges in shallow water for both catenary and taut mooring systems are introduced in section 2 design criteria are described in section 3 1 and the refined numerical syrope model for synthetic fibre ropes is introduced in section 3 2 the seven comparative mooring design concepts are described into detail in section 3 3 the oc4 semi submersible wind turbine robertson et al 2014 is selected for the case study as introduced in section 4 the performance of the designs is compared in section 5 considering static and dynamic behavior and cost assessment in section 6 the preferable mooring designs are recommended for future industrial application in this paper the numerical simulations are carried out in sima sintef ocean 2018a b considering both wind and wave loads and the main design rules followed are dnvgl os e301 dnvgl 2018a and dnvgl st 0119 dnvgl 2018b the focus of this paper is to compare different mooring design concepts therefore a number of representative load cases covering serviceability limit state sls and ultimate limit state uls are prioritized in this paper meanwhile the structural behavior of all mooring designs in fatigue limit state fls and accidental limit state als will be studied in the future in addition wind and wave induced load effects are focused in this paper while the current load effect is briefly studied through one comparative extreme load case lc9 in table 6 2 mooring design challenges for shallow water conditions precise positioning and motion control is critical for safe operation of the floating wind turbine considering the integrity of electric power cable for floating structures rigid body motions and mooring line tension are coupled so that mooring system provides restoring effects as well as inertial and damping effects on floater motions meanwhile both static offset and dynamic motions of the floater will influence the mooring line tension when the floater is displaced away from the equilibrium position due to environmental forces mooring system will operate to keep the floater in position by providing restoring force as shown in fig 1 the total mooring restoring force t with respect to the fairlead motion r in quasi static condition is related to geometric stiffness k g and elastic stiffness k e geometric stiffness mainly comes from the weight and pre tension of the mooring line which is the main source of restoring force in catenary mooring system elastic stiffness is mainly due to line elongation which is the main source of restoring force in taut mooring system with synthetic fibre rope in dynamic conditions mooring line motion will lead to a drag force b d v x v x and an inertial force m l a x which contribute to the damping and inertial effect of the mooring line respectively the damping effect is particularly important for floater s low frequency motions which are associated with a small potential damping here in the figure b d is drag resistance m l is line mass in water v x is line relative velocity a x is line acceleration e a is axial stiffness and ω is submerged weight of the line mooring system design is a complicated iterative procedure which should take into account both floater motion and mooring line tension on one hand the mooring system should be stiff enough to limit the floater offset under the mean wind and wave loads as well as the floater slowly varying motions due to the second order wave loads and the wind loads on the other hand it should be compliant enough to allow wave frequency floater motions and avoid large mooring line tension induced by the first order wave loads on the floater these features are relatively easy to achieve in deep water while it is more challenging in shallow water for both catenary and taut mooring systems the effect due to drag resistance and inertial effect of mooring line is quite limited in shallow water as studied in this paper therefore the main design challenge is related to smart combination of the elastic and geometric stiffness 2 1 catenary mooring system some aspects of geometric stiffness the vertical span from fairlead to seabed in shallow water is much shorter than deep water as shown in fig 2 which directly affects the length of suspended mooring line that provides pre tension taking the oc4 semi submersible floating wind turbine robertson et al 2014 in this paper as an example the fairlead is located at 14 m below mean water level the effective vertical distances for suspended mooring line are 36 m and 186 m when water depths are 50 m and 200 m respectively in order to achieve reasonable pre tension as deep water the size of mooring line has to be increased in shallow water with the same x offset increment at fairlead longer line in shallow water will be lifted up than that in deep water given the same pre tension and stiffness at zero x offset the mooring line tension characteristics at different water depths are provided in fig 3 the comparison illustrates that the mooring line stiffness increases faster with increasing x offset for shallow water mooring than deep water mooring meaning that if the same wave frequency motions are triggered larger tension will be induced in shallow water mooring line the dramatic increase in line stiffness and associated sudden increase of line tension may lead to potential line breaking in addition if all the mooring line parts that were originally laying on the seabed are lifted up the stretching of the line becomes important and leads to a significant increase in stiffness and tension according to faltinsen 1993 the horizontal geometric in elastic stiffness k g of a catenary mooring line can be expressed as 1 k g t h x ω 2 1 2 t h ω h c o s h 1 1 ω h t h 1 where ω is the unit weight of mooring line x is the horizontal offset h is water depth and t h is the horizontal tension given the same horizontal tension t h the horizontal stiffness increases as water depth decreases as shown in fig 4 the horizontal wave frequency motions of the floating wind turbine are dominated by inertial effect a stiffer mooring system will lead to higher natural frequencies of the horizontal motions which are more easily excited by difference frequency wave loads the top angles between mooring line and axes α and β indicate the level of catenary shape of mooring line as shown in fig 5 a the bigger α is and the smaller β is the less catenary shape is left while the tighter and the more stretched the line is the initial values for α and β at static position are determined by mooring line tightness which is influenced by the horizontal span s distance between fairlead and touch down point effective water depth h distance between fairlead and seabed and length of suspended mooring line l s as given in equation 2 2 t a n β s i n h 2 s h l s 2 h 2 normally deep water mooring is designed with small tightness and reasonable horizontal pre tension can be achieved even with small angle α this keeps a high level of catenary shape which means it is quite rare that the mooring line will be totally stretched even for large horizontal x offset on the other hand shallow water mooring is usually quite tight because the effective water depth is much smaller compared with horizontal span in order to obtain reasonable horizontal pre tension as deep water the angle α has to be increased even with heavier mooring line which as a result will eliminate certain level of catenary shape from dynamic perspective the increase of x offset at fairlead will enlarge α and decrease β but the change rate varies at different water depths as an example given in fig 5 b when the fairlead moves from position 1 to position 2 with a horizontal offset d x the angle α and β will change to α and β similar as deriving the mooring line horizontal stiffness in equation 1 the average change rate of the angle β can be represented by the derivative of t a n β with respect to horizontal offset x 3 β x d t a n β d x d t v t h d x t v d t h t h d t v t h 2 d x 1 t h 2 t v d t h d x t h d t v d x 1 t h 2 t v k g t h ω d l s d x 1 t h 2 t v k g t h k g 1 1 2 a h k g t h 2 ω h 2 2 a h t h 1 1 2 a h where k g is horizontal stiffness as described in equation 1 ω is the unit weight of mooring line x is the x offset h is water depth a is a coefficient expressed as a t h ω as a result the average change rate for angle α expressed with unit degree can be written as 4 α x 90 a r c t a n d t a n β d x based on equations 3 and 4 given the same horizontal tension t h the change rate of top angle α x at different water depths are given in fig 6 the angle change rate tends to increase as water depth decreases which means shallow water mooring is more vulnerable to lose catenary shape and be stretched to straight line than deep water mooring it will lead to potential vertical force on the anchor which is quite dangerous as a result large footprint of the mooring system is normally required for shallow water with long chains laying on the seabed 2 2 taut mooring system the effect of elastic stiffness in taut mooring system the restoring force mainly comes from the stretch of the line so that the horizontal elastic stiffness k e assuming a linearized elasticity can be expressed as 5 k e e a 1 l s i n α where e is the young s modulus a is the cross sectional area l is the total line length and α is the angle between mooring line and vertical plane normally when water depth goes from deep to shallow the total length of mooring line l will become shorter which will lead to a larger stiffness k e therefore when experiencing same amplitude of wave frequency motion the induced tension will be larger in shallow water mooring line synthetic fibre rope as the most popular material used in taut mooring system is more complicated than chain and steel wire rope regarding the structural property the nonlinear response of synthetic fibre rope is loading path and loading duration dependent as shown in fig 7 the current industrial design practice is to use a lower bound stiffness to calculate extreme offset and an upper bound stiffness to calculate extreme tension this conservative and inconsistent approach has been mentioned in several offshore standards including dnvgl rp e305 dnvgl 2015 and api rp 2sm api 2014 there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the synthetic fibre rope performance and well established numerical program that can include the nonlinear behavior of synthetic fibre rope 3 mooring design solutions taking into account the design challenges mentioned in section 2 for both catenary and taut mooring systems in shallow water alternative mooring design concepts for floating wind turbine in shallow water e g about 50 80 m are investigated the targeting water depth for the design study in this paper is chosen to be 50 m 3 1 design criteria in view of the functionality of the wind turbine and the power cable the motion characteristics of the floater and the structural safety of the mooring lines a complete mooring design check according to dnvgl 2018a involves ultimate limit state uls fatigue limit state fls and accidental limit state als in this paper uls design check is focused while fls and als analysis will be investigated in the future the main design criteria for shallow water mooring in this paper are 1 considering the safety of power cable and the power production efficiency of wind turbine the offsets of the floater have to be limited to a reasonable range 2 all mooring lines have to be able to withstand the load effects in all the environmental conditions considered which means that the maximum mooring line tension can not exceed the maximum breaking strength taking into account the safety factor fatigue damage is normally also required for a complete mooring design but the ultimate load case is focused in this paper 3 the catenary mooring line lying on the seabed should be long enough to avoid being totally lifted up during the lifetime and prevent drag anchor to take vertical load even in the most extreme condition 4 the leeward mooring line should not experience slack which may lead to large snap tension 5 the properties of a mooring system in 200 m water depth is considered as the reference for shallow water moorings relevant parameters are pre tension horizontal stiffness line length etc 3 2 design basis 3 2 1 mooring component clump weight is a concentrated weight which can be used to improve the geometric stiffness properties of the line it can be incorporated with a lighter mooring line to achieve beneficial stiffness properties for the relevant top end offset a buoy is normally included to reduce the weight of the line improve the geometric stiffness and provide sufficient clearance to any subsea equipment the use of buoys in shallow water moorings could also reduce the non linearity of the geometric stiffness and hence reduce extreme tension at large x offsets 3 2 2 synthetic fibre ropes the syrope model many research projects have been recently launched with the objective to improve the modelling of synthetic fibre rope mooring lines among them syrope jip falkenberg et al 2017 led by dnv gl provided specific and practical guidelines based on extensive laboratory testing in order to better describe the complex behavior of the synthetic fibre rope a spring dashpot model is proposed for illustration as shown in fig 8 the elastic stretch consists of instant elastic and visco elastic stretch which can be considered as a spring without and with a damper separately the permanent stretch on the other hand includes visco plastic stretch which is irreversible when exposed to tension and construction stretch where the ratchet allows the spring to extend above previous highest tension without retraction in order to avoid permanent stretch a relevant installation procedure of a synthetic fibre rope is to pre tension cross tension the rope to the predicted maximum tension level it will experience during its service life the length of the mooring line has then already reached the longest possible length and there will be no further permanent bedding in extension rowley and leite 2011 the syrope model as shown in fig 9 was proposed in the jip falkenberg et al 2017 to better describe the tension stretch and axial stiffness characteristics for synthetic fibre rope used in mooring analysis based on the results from sub rope testing the syrope model can be interpreted as a combination of four curves original curve represents the tension stretch relationship during the first rapid loading of the new rope which can be considered as the upper limit of the tension stretch curve original working curve represents the stationary curve when the rope is at the mean tension with permanent stretch taken out working curve represents the curve when the rope is at a lower mean tension than the previous historical maximum mean tension in a stationary sea state the working curve is determined by the historically highest mean tension level while the exact working point on the curve is determined by the mean tension level dynamic stiffness represents the slope of the linearized stiffness curve for a given mean tension it increases with mean tension and is used to calculate the tension dynamics due to low frequency lf and wave frequency wf top end motions more details about the model can be found in falkenberg et al 2017 while the determination of static and dynamic stiffness is focused in this paper the static stiffness is represented by the nonlinear working curve depending on previous highest mean tension it describes a nonlinear relation between mean tension and mean stretch which is used to estimate the offset due to mean environmental loads the dynamic stiffness applied for both lf and wf load effects is linear and increases with mean tension the proposed models are linearly dependent on mean tension only the analytical expression of the linearized static stiffness e a s can be expressed as 6 e a s d t m e a n d ε a t m e a n b m b s where ε is stretch m b s is minimum breaking strength of the rope t m e a n is the mean tension a and b are constants estimated from sub rope testing it is a linear differential equation and the solution is a nonlinear exponential relation between the mean tension and the stretch by assuming zero mean tension for zero stretch it can be further described as 7 t m e a n m b s b a e x p a ε 1 the analytical expression of the linearized dynamic stiffness e a d is expressed as 8 e a d d t d y n d ε f t m e a n g m b s where t m e a n is the mean tension determined from previous static analysis using linearized static stiffness f and g are constants estimated from sub rope testing examples of linearized static and dynamic stiffness curves are given in fig 10 static stiffness is nonlinear with stretch equation 7 while both static and dynamic stiffness vary with mean tension level and the mean tension is also influenced by the stiffness drawing lessons from qiao and ou 2011 the mooring analysis procedure in this paper is summarized in fig 11 and explained in details as follows step 1 determine the parameters of the static and dynamic stiffness models according to sub rope testing i e a b f and g initialize the mooring configuration in simo with prescribed mooring line properties e g pre tension mass and length etc define the static stiffness based on equation 6 with pre tension and mbs as inputs thereafter anchor positions can be determined step 2 for a given sea state perform the static analysis with mean environmental loads acting on the floater and mooring system calculate equilibrium position of the floater and mean tension in the lines update the static stiffness model equation 6 with obtained mean tension until the mean tension is equal to previous iteration which indicates that convergence is achieved step 3 based on the mean tension achieved from previous static analysis calculate the dynamic stiffness based on equation 8 and apply them in the final dynamic analysis of the mooring lines to document dynamic tension step 4 calculate total tension by adding the results from step 2 and 3 3 3 alternative concept proposals in view of the design criteria in section 3 1 and the design basis in section 3 2 seven initial mooring design concepts are proposed as shown in fig 12 the concepts are designed for a water depth of 50 m shallow water while a mooring model at 200 m deep water is selected as reference with respect to line length pre tension offset tension characteristics etc the features of the mooring models are introduced in table 2 while the detailed properties of the mooring line are summarized in table 3 regarding the positions of clump weight and buoy the mooring line which is aligned with both incoming wind wave direction and x z plane is taken as an example while their coordinates are given in table 4 among the seven designs the first four concepts are catenary moorings using chain cable while the last three are taut moorings using synthetic fibre rope in addition clump weight and buoy are included in the comparative designs to check their influence on the overall performance the parameters of the chain is determined according to vryhof 2015 and the parameters for the synthetic fibre rope is according to bridon 2013 the diameter of chain refers to the size of the steel bar while the diameter of synthetic fibre rope refers to the size of the rope the weight of mooring line is given as the unit weight in water the anchor radius refers to the distance between anchor and the center of the platform the property of buoy is given as the net buoyancy e a s and e a d stands for axial stiffness used in static analysis and dynamic analysis respectively as described in equations 6 and 8 drag embedment anchor dea is used for the four catenary mooring designs to be more specific 17 ton stevshark mk5 anchor designed by vryhof anchor vryhof 2015 is selected this anchor can be adjusted for varying soil conditions through modifying the shank angle this selection is based on two reference projects hywind ii project equinor 2019 and windfloat project principlepower 2019 where the same anchor were used in order to better take the vertical load from the synthetic fibre rope mooring line and achieve accurate anchor location suction anchor is chosen for the three taut mooring designs similar to the conceptual tlwt project copple et al 2012 a 50 ton suction anchor is chosen 4 case study 4 1 floating wind turbine in this study the 5 mw oc4 semi submersible wind turbine robertson et al 2014 is used to compare the mooring design concepts at 50 m water depth the semi submersible is composed of three offset columns three pontoons a central column and braces as shown in fig 13 the origin of the coordinate system is located at still water level while the x axis is the nominal wind direction the y axis is lateral to the left when looking downwind and z axis is upward along the center line of the undisplaced platform the mass of the floater including ballast is 1 3473e 7 kg and the dimensions of main components are listed in table 5 the reference wind turbine mounted on top of oc4 floater is the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 whose thrust curve at different wind speeds is given in fig 14 the mooring system is designed with three mooring lines which spread symmetrically about a vertical axis through the platform center with an angle of 120 between each line the fairlead is located at the top of the base columns which is 14 m below the still water level a bird view of the mooring system is given in fig 13 b among all three mooring lines the upwind mooring line 2 was selected as an example for the analysis later since it is aligned with the incoming wind and wave direction and subjected to the largest tension 4 2 load case with the purpose of comparing the performance of different mooring design concepts a series of representative load cases lcs are considered in this paper covering both operational and extreme conditions as listed in table 6 the turbulent wind and irregular wave are correlated and directionally aligned the lcs are selected with increasing wind speed from cut in to cut out wind speed with a bin size of 4 m s while the turbulent wind field is generated according to the norwegian petroleum directorate npd wind spectrum the mean wind speed u is expressed as a function of height z above mean water level 9 u z u r e f z z r e f α where u r e f is the reference wind speed z r e f is the height of the reference wind speed and α is the power law coefficient the reference height is set to 90 m above mean water level as the center of rotor and α was chosen to be 0 14 for floating wind turbine according to iec 61400 3 iec 2005 the irregular wave series are generated using jonswap wave model the significant wave heights and peak periods are defined based on the correlation with wind speed for the northern north sea johannessen et al 2001 considering a water depth of 50 m in this paper lc8 is about same level as 50 year extreme condition at north sea which is sufficient for an intact uls check for mooring system of a floating wind turbine dnvgl 2018b in addition current load effect is accounted for in lc9 whose wind and wave condition is same as lc8 according to dnvgl os e301 dnvgl 2018a the current can be categorized as tidal circulation wind generated soliton and loop currents depending on the site location a surface current speed u c with 10 year return period is recommended for mooring analysis based on the typical surface current speeds as given in dnvgl 2018a 1 0 m s is chosen as a representative surface current velocity in this paper the variation is considered as a linear profile from still water level to z 50 m as shown in equation 10 the current is assumed to vanish at water depth deeper than 50 m and same current profile is used for both 50 m and 200 m water depth 10 u c z 1 0 50 z 50 for 50 z 0 since the focus of this paper is to demonstrate the pros and cons of different mooring design concepts rather than a sophisticated mooring system design load cases prioritized in this paper are relevant for uls criteria 4 3 fully coupled dynamic analysis the aero hydro servo elastic behaviors of the floating wind turbine systems requires sophisticated coupled dynamic analysis method the dynamic motion equation of the floater in time domain can be written as 11 m a r t 0 t κ t τ r τ d τ k s r t t t r r r q t r r where m is the mass matrix a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequencies κ t τ is the retardation function faltinsen 1993 which is calculated from frequency dependent added mass or potential damping k s is the hydrostatic restoring matrix r r r are the displacement velocity and acceleration t is force from mooring system q is the external force which includes first second order wave excitation force and wind force in this paper the frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping and first order wave forces are calculated in hydrod dnv gl 2016 which is a potential flow solver the linear damping as well as quadratic damping are included based on decay test results the second order difference frequency wave excitation force is calculated using full quadratic transfer function qtf with additional meshing of the free surface compared with newman s approximation method whose computation time is about several minutes the computational effort for full qtf method is much more intensive which takes approximately 22 h however full qtf method is necessary for limiting the uncertainty of heave roll and pitch motion prediction in which newman s approximation has limitation viscous effect on the floater is modeled by the drag term in morison s equation and the hydrodynamic force acting on mooring line is computed using morison s equation based on finite element method fem the mooring line is defined in terms of sequence of segments with homogeneous cross sectional properties the drag coefficients for catenary chain cable and synthetic fibre rope are determined according to dnvgl os e301 dnvgl 2018a as shown in table 7 both the clump weight and buoy are modeled with separated bodies whose mass and volume are carefully calculated to achieve desired net gravity and net buoyancy the aerodynamic load is calculated based on bem theory with 3d wind velocity model the time domain simulations are perform in sima sintef ocean 2018a b the motion equation is solved using newmark beta integration with time step of 0 02s 5 results and discussions 5 1 static analysis 5 1 1 pre tension sufficient pre tension prevents large floater x offset due to mean and lf environmental load it is influenced by the submerged weight of the suspended mooring line for catenary mooring system and initial line stretching for taut mooring system the horizontal pre tension for the seven designs are listed in table 8 where the value for 200 m is set as a reference as expected the horizontal pre tension for model iii is smaller compared with other models because of the buoy attached to the suspended line 5 1 2 offset characteristics mooring line tension properties with increasing in line x offsets at fairlead are studied in fig 15 according to campanile et al 2018 the recommended admissible floater offset to water depth ratio is 0 3 at 50 m depth therefore the static mooring line tension characteristics is compared up to 15 m x offset the amplitude of typical low frequency and wave frequency motions is in the range between 2 m and 4 m for operational conditions while the extreme motion is just below 15 m as shown in fig 21 the tension for the three taut moorings increases linearly with increasing x offset while the effect due to the implementation of clump weight and buoy is not significant which is quite different from catenary type as for the four catenary moorings the tension increases linearly at small x offsets while the increment becomes nonlinear at large x offsets this is a typical characteristics for catenary mooring system and it is more significant for shallow water 50 m than deep water 200 m xu et al 2018 among the four catenary moorings the nonlinear increment of model i is the most noticeable due to large unit weight while model iv is the least noticeable thanks to the buoy attached at the resting line the performance of model iv v vi vii are quite close to the reference model 200 m as a reference the total horizontal mooring system restoring forces with respect to increasing horizontal x offsets are given in fig 16 it will provide a general idea of mean horizontal motion when exposed to mean environmental loads as well as the range of total restoring force due to wf and lf motion 5 1 3 vertical angle the issue regarding the angle between mooring line and vertical axis has been introduced in section 2 the change of the angle α as shown in fig 5 with increasing x offset at fairlead is shown in fig 17 since the water depth is quite small 50 m compared with mooring line footprint about 900 m the stretched synthetic fire rope mooring line is almost parallel to the seabed with angle close to 90 while the influence of adding clump weight and buoy is quite limited as for the four catenary moorings in 50 m the initial angles are around 60 indicating a significant catenary shape as x offset increases the angles starts to approach 90 indicating the loss of catenary shape and the likely stretching of the line better performance is achieved by model iv because of the application of buoys meanwhile the angle problem is not significant for the catenary mooring in 200 m 5 2 decay analysis prior to the dynamic analysis it is important to check the natural periods of the semi submersible which is greatly influenced by the mooring system characteristics in horizontal plane surge sway and yaw free decay test in calm water were performed to compare the natural periods for the different concepts and the final results are summarized in fig 18 the natural periods in heave roll and pitch degrees of freedom are barely influenced by mooring system which is as expected the reference natural period surge sway and yaw for water depth 200 m is larger than all the designs in 50m additionally larger periods are found for model iii which indicates that buoy will reduce the restriction of the system the natural period for model v is smaller than model vi and vii because the application of clump weight and buoy will include more geometric stiffness 5 3 dynamic analysis 5 3 1 regular wave the hydrodynamic characteristics of the mooring concepts are further compared by response amplitude operator rao which are determined through a number of regular wave simulations since wave nonlinearity characterized by the ratio between wave amplitude and wave period will affect the rao analysis the amplitude of the regular wave in this paper is chosen to be 1 m and wave period ranges from 1 s to 35 s in order to cover most probable excitation wave components the motion reference point is taken as the origin of the coordinate system which is located at the mean water level floater motions such as surge heave pitch and mooring line tension are studied in fig 19 the theoretical asymptomatic behavior of surge motions for freely floating structures in long waves tends to follow the elliptical trajectory of water particles at finite water depth the amplitude of the horizontal motion of the water particles in shallow water can be written as a t a n h k h a k h where a is wave amplitude k is wave number and h is water depth accordingly given the same wave amplitude the motion amplitude will increase as water depth decreases therefore in this study the surge raos for all the moorings in 50 m are larger than the reference model in 200 m the coupling between surge and pitch results in the large surge rao peak at pitch natural frequency which is more significant for catenary moorings than taut moorings in addition the raos are not greatly influenced by mooring systems for the range of wave periods from 5 s to 15 s as a result the wave frequency motions are not influenced by the mooring system when exposed to irregular waves which is as expected however as for low frequency motions in particular the resonant pitch motions around 25 s and the associated surge motions are strongly influenced by the mooring system the heave rao is almost the same for all the moorings in 50 m which proves again that floater heave motion is almost not affected by mooring system pitch resonance leads to the largest pitch rao peak and apparent difference are found for different mooring concepts because of different stiffness the mooring line tension rao is directly influenced by floater horizontal motion therefore the surge rao peak due to pitch resonance also result in a peak of mooring line tension rao there is a significant difference in the mooring line tension rao in the range of wave periods from 5 s to 15 s which will influence the dimension of the mooring lines in realistic sea state where nonlinear mooring line tension behavior becomes more significant the tension rao curve presented here may lead to underestimation compared with dynamic analysis result in high sea state 5 3 2 irregular wave and turbulent wind the environmental parameters are given in section 4 2 six operational conditions where turbine is rotating and three extreme conditions where turbine is parked are defined in order to compare the mooring performance the results are achieved for 3 h response by running each simulation for 12 000 s while the first 1200 s is excluded because of transient effect 10 different realisations of turbulent wind and irregular wave are generated for each load case to account for the stochastic variability the expected maximum of the response is determined as the average of the 10 individual sample maxima floater motions and windward line are selected as representative responses in this section the mean horizontal environmental forces including mean wind force and second order wave force for all the load cases are given in table 9 the mean environmental force in lc9 is significantly larger than that in lc8 due to the current load effect the mean standard deviation and maximum of the floater motion in surge heave and pitch directions are provided for each load case in fig 21 in addition the total response is also decomposed into wf and lf components for comparison an example of time series for surge motion in lc3 is given in fig 20 consisting of total motion wf motion and lf motion as the mean value of wf response is around zero therefore only the standard deviation and maximum are compared in fig 22 with lf value shown above x axis and wf value shown below x axis the power spectrum of the mooring line 2 fig 13 as the most loaded line is studied in fig 23 with respect to the power spectra two representative load cases are focused one for operational condition lc3 and one for extreme condition lc8 in lc3 where wind effect is strong and wave condition is not severe low frequency responses contributes more to the total tension response compared with wave frequency response component meanwhile in the parked condition lc8 the wind load effect is limited and the wave condition is quite severe wave frequency tension is governing the total response the statistics of mooring line tension is compared in fig 24 a the mean tensions for model i ii and iv are quite close while smaller value for model iii and larger value for model v vi vii are observed for all the load cases noticeable standard deviation and maximum is found for model i compared with others in lc9 similar surge motion leads to quite different maximum mooring line tension in extreme condition is the best prove of different mooring line behaviors when exposed to same environmental condition among the four catenary designs smaller extreme tension is obtained for model iv thanks to the implementation of buoy as for the three taut moorings the extreme tensions are slightly higher than the catenary moorings this is valid for the level of elastic stiffness that is used in this paper there is a need for synthetic fibre ropes with lower elastic stiffness properties for effective mooring of floating wind turbines especially in shallow water the tension responses for lc9 is larger than that for lc8 due to the current load effect from fig 24 b lf component is dominating in operational condition while wf component is governing in extreme condition considering different capacity associated with different mooring materials utilization factor recommended by dnvgl st 0119 dnvgl 2018b can provide another perspective of tension responses to their material limit apart from the direct comparison of the statistics the utilization factor u is defined as 12 u t p r e t γ p r e t t c e n v γ e n v s c where t p r e t is the mooring line pre tension t c e n v is the characteristic environmental tension due to mean low frequency and wave frequency load which is calculated as t m p m t p r e t where t m p m is the most probable maximum tension s c is the characteristic mooring line strength defined as 95 of the minimum breaking strength s m b s γ p r e t and γ e n v are safety factors which are set as 1 3 1 75 respectively in this paper based on the assumption of level 1 consequence class the resulting utilization factors for all the models in all load cases are shown in fig 24 c first of all all the utilization factors are below 1 which means the line capacities are not exceeded for all the models and they are close to 1 in the most extreme condition meaning that line redundancy is within acceptable range in operational conditions where the tension level is small the utilization factors for taut moorings are slightly larger than catenary moorings however in extreme conditions when the tension level is high the utilization factors for catenary moorings increase dramatically compared with taut moorings speaking of individual mooring performance almost no difference is found among model v vi vii and clearly better performance is found for model iv 5 4 cost analysis economic consideration plays an important role in the mooring decision the expense of an offshore wind project can be evaluated by capital expenditures capex or operating expenditures opex myhr et al 2014 when a complete time span is considered for different phases of the project life cycle cost analysis lcca is preferred for evaluation since the focus of this paper is to compare different mooring design concepts for the same floating wind turbine the lcca analysis will focus on the mooring system rather than the whole wind turbine in addition the comparison is performed mainly for manufacture and installation in lcca it is worth noticing that the cost related to maintenance and repair could be different it is well known that estimation of the mooring expense is not a simple task due to the lack of publicly available data the costs of mooring line anchor and installation etc have been investigated by several researchers campanile et al 2018 myhr et al 2014 andreas and john 2012 bjerkseter and ågotnes 2013 klingan 2016 audibert et al 2003 benassai et al 2015 fylling and berthelsen 2011 which are mainly preliminary studies in this paper an elementary cost analysis is also performed based on some of the references mentioned and the main purpose is to provide a general cost wise ranking of the seven mooring designs the total cost also takes into account the utilization factor of mooring line the detailed anchor capacity design is not the focus of this paper therefore anchors from well proven industrial projects are referred according to bjerkseter and ågotnes 2013 the price of a 17 ton stevshark mk5 anchor from vryhof anchors is approximately 114000 while a 50 ton suction anchor costs around 512500 the price for mooring line is estimated according to the objective function in klingan 2016 which is based on data provided by equinor the prices for chain synthetic fibre rope and steel wire basically can be described by a common expression with different coefficients 13 c o s t l e n g t h w e i g h t p r i c e where length is given in m weight in the air is given in n m and the price is given in n for different materials as shown in table 10 the price for two clump weights are estimated as heavy chain using equation 13 while the price for two buoys are estimated using data from defender 2019 with a linear interpolation the installation procedure for all the models in this paper is assumed to be performed by one large anchor handling tug supply vessel with sufficient holding capacity according to audibert et al 2003 the installation time for a dea anchor is about 8 h including deck rigging launching lowering seabed penetrating and tensioning while it takes about 12 h to install a suction anchor including seabed penetrating and deck handling combining other assumptions as shown in bjerkseter and ågotnes 2013 the baseline mooring system installation costs for all concepts are obtained the total cost for all the mooring models are calculated in table 11 by summing up the manufacture and installation costs the price is listed in euro k stands for 10 3 and m stands for 10 6 u indicates the maximum utilization factor of the mooring line in lc9 as shown in fig 24 generally the catenary mooring is competitive regarding the cost of anchor and installation but the capital cost for the mooring line is quite high the taut mooring on the other hand is favorable with respect to the cost of synthetic fibre rope however the cost for the suction anchor and installation is quite high clearly the cost of the reference model in 200 m is quite low compared with the models in 50 m since the cost of the mooring line is low model i is the most expensive model because of the high price for the heavy chain model iv and v are more cost competitive designs of their types while the difference with other models is not significant meanwhile current cost estimates are based on uls design criteria and certain number can be different if fls and als design check are respected too in addition the cost estimation in this paper can be subject to variations given particular project location timing and supplier therefore model ii vii are all recommended for further assessment 6 conclusions in order to further promote the industrial development of offshore floating wind turbine the challenges and solutions regarding mooring system design in shallow water is systematically studied in this paper seven mooring design concepts for oc4 semi submersible floating wind turbine are proposed at 50 m water depth different mooring line materials and mooring components are used the comparative designs are proposed by taking full advantage of both geometric and elastic mooring stiffness the stiffness characteristics for synthetic fibre rope is described with an improved numerical model based on latest experimental data the concepts are evaluated through static decay dynamic and cost analysis finally two mooring concepts with better performance and competitive cost are recommended for future application the geometric effect is the most important parameter for catenary mooring at shallow water clever inclusion of heavy chain or clump weight have to be used in order to achieve a reasonable pre tension and stiffness characteristics the nonlinearity in the line characteristics is pronounced for traditional catenary systems which can be improved by smart use of buoys and or clump weights the use of synthetic fibre ropes instead of chain cable will also reduce the nonlinear characteristics but the benefit of including clump weight and buoy is not significant from dynamic analysis the extreme tension for pure chain mooring is extraordinarily large compared with other concepts judging from the mooring utilization factor hybrid catenary mooring model iv clearly stands out from the cost analysis the capital cost of mooring chain is high while the cost of its dea anchor and installation is relatively low on the contrary the cost of synthetic fibre rope mooring line is quite low however the cost for the suction anchor and installation is quite high when combining with the utilization factor model iv and v are cost competitive concepts the advantages and disadvantages of the seven mooring designs are further summarized in table 12 in conclusion taking the structural performance and capital cost of different models into account model ii vii are all recommended for further assessment related to floating wind mooring design in shallow water in the future as for the future work the proposed mooring concepts need to be further verified with fatigue analysis and accidental analysis more load cases including the

21287,floating wind turbines represent a cost efficient energy solution in deep water where bottom fixed wind turbine becomes excessively expensive however mooring design is quite challenging for all shallow water depths including the transition water depth between bottom fixed and floating wind turbines in the order of 50 80 m for which floating concepts might become more cost effective than bottom fixed ones in this paper mooring system design for floating wind turbine in shallow water are studied considering both catenary and taut mooring systems seven mooring concepts designed for a 5 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine at 50 m water depth are compared with the purpose to identify solutions that are structurally reliable and economically attractive the concepts are made of different mooring line materials chain and synthetic fibre rope mooring components clump weight and buoy and anchors drag embedment anchor and suction anchor based on the latest experimental data the nonlinear tension dependent stiffness of synthetic fibre rope are described with an improved numerical model performance of the seven mooring concepts are compared with respect to mooring line characteristics motion response amplitude operator utilization factor considering the ultimate limit state design and cost etc six mooring design concepts are finally recommended for future assessment regarding the application of floating wind turbines in shallow water say 50 m and deeper keywords floating wind turbine shallow water hybrid mooring design synthetic fibre rope syrope model 1 introduction wind energy is characterized as clean and reliable power and it has experienced a rapid development in recent years in both onshore and offshore sectors global wind energy council 2019 compared with onshore wind several attributes for offshore wind make its future quite promising such as immense stable resource great area availability easy transportation little visual disturbance and noise etc offshore wind resources in many countries is found at a water depth above 50 m where bottom fixed wind turbine becomes less cost attractive and floating wind turbine is considered as a better alternative myhr et al 2014 as the world s first floating wind farm in operation hywind scotland which consists of five 6 mw hywind spars was commissioned in october 2017 in august 2019 hywind tampen project equinor 2020 was launched with the purpose of supplying power to the snorre and gullfaks oil fields from 2022 meanwhile semi submersible floating wind turbine started to make a figure recently taking advantage of its smaller draft and wider range of applicable water depth it has been successfully implemented in the world s second floating wind farm windfloat atlantic in portugal which consists of three 8 4 mw windfloat semi submersibles edp renewable 2020 the windfloat concept was also implemented in the 50 mw kincardine offshore wind farm in uk which features a total of five 9 525 mw turbines and one 2 mw turbine the 2 mw turbine was connected to british grid in october 2018 ns energy 2020 the manufacturing work of the remaining five windfloat foundations began in march 2019 at the navantia fene yard in spain and three foundations have been assembled by march 2020 while all five foundations are expected to be ready and delivered by summer 2020 4coffshore 2020 despite all the progress there are still some challenges that remain to be solved before floating wind turbine can be further promoted with bigger market one of them is the design of mooring system for a water depth of about 50 m 80 m which is normally considered as the transition water depth between floating and bottom fixed wind turbines when water depth becomes shallow the effective water depth from fairlead to seabed for the mooring system to function becomes quite limited which makes the mooring design more challenging than that in deep water despite rich experience of mooring design in offshore oil gas industry the design requirement and consideration between large oil gas platform and floating wind turbine are quite different the size of a typical floating oil and gas platform normally is much larger than floating wind platform considering the dimensions mass displacement etc as an example the general properties of the seventh generation semi submersible drilling platform bluewhale i and the oc4 semi submersible wind turbine is compared in table 1 for a 5 mw floating wind turbine the displacement typically is in the range between 5000 t and 7000 t as for the oc4 semi submersible in this study the displacement is close to 14 000 t while the mass of ballasting water takes significant part 9621 t therefore a steel floater of 14 000 t displacement could also support a 15 mw turbine with proper ballast by referring to the properties of iea 15 mw reference wind turbine gaertner et al 2020 floating wind farm normally consists of several floating units space clearance and wake effect have to be considered when designing mooring system wise and bachynski 2020 these issues are not relevant for oil platform the mean offset of floating wind turbine is greatly influenced by the thrust force at different wind speeds whose influence is quite different for oil and gas platform failure of mooring lines of manned oil and gas platforms may cause severe consequences in terms of fatalities or severe pollution while the mooring line failure consequences of floating wind turbines essentially are economical hence mooring line criteria for oil and gas platforms are more restrictive and typically including damage assessment the design issues of mooring system for floating wind turbine in shallow water has been investigated by several researchers brommundt et al 2012 developed a numerical tool for the optimization of catenary mooring systems a case study was performed for a semi submersible floating wind turbine with two water depths 75 m and 330 m the optimal line length angle and horizontal distance between anchor and fairlead are studied benassai et al 2014a compared the motion control performance of catenary and tensioned line mooring systems for the dutch tri floater wind turbine at water depth between 50 m and 200 m both operational and extreme load cases are considered the weight of chain cable and steel wire rope are compared at different water depths benassai et al 2014b extended the study to the influence of line number platform maximum admissible offset and mooring line pattern mooring configurations consisting of nine or twelve lines were recommended the results indicated that the mooring line weight is independent of water depth between 100 m and 200 m while the weight will increase outside this range benassai et al 2015 further investigated the mooring optimization technique from allowable platform offset line number and mooring pattern the results indicated that mooring weight reduction for traditional mooring configuration can be achieved by designing mooring patterns with non uniform angular distribution campanile et al 2018 proposed several catenary mooring designs for the dutch tri floater wind turbine at water depth from 50 m to 80 m and from 200 m to 350 m respectively recommendations were provided with respect to line number platform admissible offset and minimum spacing between adjacent wind turbines etc a preliminary cost analysis was performed regarding the installation and maintenance cost xu et al 2018 proposed mooring system designs at three water depths 50 m 100 m and 200 m and concluded that the nonlinear mooring line tension increment becomes more significant as water depth decreases use of clump weight and buoy can improve the mooring performance by balancing compliance and strength the application of clump weight in mooring system can be traced back to the guyed tower proposed by finn 1976 in extreme conditions when the platform experiences large motions the clump weight will be lifted from the seabed to establish an extended catenary shape to minimize the floater motion morrison and asce 1983 further proved the significant resistance to horizontal loading for the guyed tower due to the attachment of clump weight the benefit of attaching buoy to mooring line was studied by mavrakos et al 1996 and confirmed that the reduction of mooring line dynamics can be achieved when the size number and location of buoy are properly selected the study was further continued by mavrakos and chatjigeorgiou 1997 with frequency domain and time domain analysis the buoy attached mooring was applied for wave energy converter at a water depth of 50 m by fitzgerald and bergdahl 2007 and proved that buoy can reduce the cable weight induced mooring loads and the influence on the floater motion hybrid mooring concepts consisting of both clump weight and buoy have also been developed for offshore applications mooring configurations consisting of catenary chain with or without additional clump weight or buoy were compared by vicente et al 2011 for a floating point absorber the results showed that the maximum horizontal motion and absorbed power are less sensitive to different configurations of the buoys and clump weights than average and maximum mooring line tension yuan et al 2014 developed a hybrid mooring concept for semi submersible platform in deep water which consists of clump weights and buoys attached to the lower and upper end of the line respectively the performance of platform motion and line tension were improved the challenges of mooring system design for floating wind turbine in shallow water were considered in several industrial projects normally the location of fairlead which is used to connect mooring line and floater is beneath water level the technique of moving fairlead from underwater to above water level have been adopted by innwind eu 2017 and lifes50 2018 for designing floating wind turbines the change of fairlead location artificially increases the effective water depth from fairlead to seabed which is beneficial to improve the mooring line tension characteristics however one potential disadvantage is the corrosion and fatigue issues in particular for chain links and steel wires synthetic fibre ropes rather than chain links and steel wire rope are considered by more and more offshore renewable projects because of the lower weight and cost synthetic fibre rope mooring system was first used in offshore oil gas industry petrobras pioneered the application to the p 27 platform in 1997 rossi et al 2010 ever since then it has experienced a booming development as deep or ultra deep water mooring solutions all over the world including brazil gulf of mexico north sea bugg et al 2004 meanwhile the application of synthetic fibre ropes for offshore renewable project is still at an early stage there are only a few projects that consider synthetic fibre rope as mooring solutions including ceto wave energy converter carnegie clean energy 2020 and floatgen wind turbine ideol 2020 weller et al 2015 provided an overview of the application of synthetic ropes for marine renewable projects from different perspectives including classification model testing installation degradation and maintenance etc the state of the art of mooring system design for floating wind turbine in shallow water can be summarized as follows 1 the previous mooring design studies for shallow water were mainly made of pure chain links with no clump weight or buoy included the influence of water depth on design parameters was focused rather than sophisticated structural design at a specific water depth the proposed hybrid mooring concepts combined with clump weights and buoys were mainly designed for deep water application and the application in shallow water mooring was not considered 2 the experience with synthetic fibre ropes in the oil gas sector is mainly for deep and ultra deep water however there is also great potential of synthetic fibre rope mooring in shallow water due to its lower elastic stiffness and capital cost 3 the material property and the structural behavior of synthetic fibre rope is more complex than chain cable and steel wire rope the change in length response of synthetic fibre rope is non linear and load path dependent current industrial practice is to use the upper bound and lower bound method api 2014 which is not only conservative but also inconsistent because the offset is obtained based on a lower bound stiffness model while the dynamic tension is estimated through another upper bound stiffness model there is still a lack of a well defined understanding of the structural characteristics and mooring analysis programs with the capability to simulate the non linear change in length response of the synthetic fibre ropes 4 regarding the mooring system of floating wind turbines there is a lack of comparison between alternative materials and configurations for industrial guidance with the purpose of further expanding the applicability of floating wind turbine in shallow water the focus of this paper is to identify the challenges and possible solutions of mooring system design for floating wind turbine when water depth approaches its marginal range 50 m compared with previous studies the highlights of this paper are summarized as follows 1 the reasons why mooring system design becomes challenging when the water depth goes from deep to shallow is systematically studied for both catenary and taut mooring systems 2 hybrid mooring designs with or without clump weights and buoys are compared with pure cable system in order to assess the benefit of including additional mooring components in shallow water mooring 3 the use of synthetic fibre rope for shallow water mooring was investigated considering the limitation of traditional upper bound and lower bound method for synthetic fibre rope analysis a refined numerical model denoted syrope defining the static and dynamic stiffness in a single model is applied in this paper to avoid over conservative mooring design 4 despite limited publicly available data a preliminary cost analysis for different mooring concepts was performed using information from different sources 5 recommendation for preferable mooring designs for floating wind turbine in shallow water depth are made for industrial guidance through comparative studies of different mooring designs this paper is organized as follows the mooring design challenges in shallow water for both catenary and taut mooring systems are introduced in section 2 design criteria are described in section 3 1 and the refined numerical syrope model for synthetic fibre ropes is introduced in section 3 2 the seven comparative mooring design concepts are described into detail in section 3 3 the oc4 semi submersible wind turbine robertson et al 2014 is selected for the case study as introduced in section 4 the performance of the designs is compared in section 5 considering static and dynamic behavior and cost assessment in section 6 the preferable mooring designs are recommended for future industrial application in this paper the numerical simulations are carried out in sima sintef ocean 2018a b considering both wind and wave loads and the main design rules followed are dnvgl os e301 dnvgl 2018a and dnvgl st 0119 dnvgl 2018b the focus of this paper is to compare different mooring design concepts therefore a number of representative load cases covering serviceability limit state sls and ultimate limit state uls are prioritized in this paper meanwhile the structural behavior of all mooring designs in fatigue limit state fls and accidental limit state als will be studied in the future in addition wind and wave induced load effects are focused in this paper while the current load effect is briefly studied through one comparative extreme load case lc9 in table 6 2 mooring design challenges for shallow water conditions precise positioning and motion control is critical for safe operation of the floating wind turbine considering the integrity of electric power cable for floating structures rigid body motions and mooring line tension are coupled so that mooring system provides restoring effects as well as inertial and damping effects on floater motions meanwhile both static offset and dynamic motions of the floater will influence the mooring line tension when the floater is displaced away from the equilibrium position due to environmental forces mooring system will operate to keep the floater in position by providing restoring force as shown in fig 1 the total mooring restoring force t with respect to the fairlead motion r in quasi static condition is related to geometric stiffness k g and elastic stiffness k e geometric stiffness mainly comes from the weight and pre tension of the mooring line which is the main source of restoring force in catenary mooring system elastic stiffness is mainly due to line elongation which is the main source of restoring force in taut mooring system with synthetic fibre rope in dynamic conditions mooring line motion will lead to a drag force b d v x v x and an inertial force m l a x which contribute to the damping and inertial effect of the mooring line respectively the damping effect is particularly important for floater s low frequency motions which are associated with a small potential damping here in the figure b d is drag resistance m l is line mass in water v x is line relative velocity a x is line acceleration e a is axial stiffness and ω is submerged weight of the line mooring system design is a complicated iterative procedure which should take into account both floater motion and mooring line tension on one hand the mooring system should be stiff enough to limit the floater offset under the mean wind and wave loads as well as the floater slowly varying motions due to the second order wave loads and the wind loads on the other hand it should be compliant enough to allow wave frequency floater motions and avoid large mooring line tension induced by the first order wave loads on the floater these features are relatively easy to achieve in deep water while it is more challenging in shallow water for both catenary and taut mooring systems the effect due to drag resistance and inertial effect of mooring line is quite limited in shallow water as studied in this paper therefore the main design challenge is related to smart combination of the elastic and geometric stiffness 2 1 catenary mooring system some aspects of geometric stiffness the vertical span from fairlead to seabed in shallow water is much shorter than deep water as shown in fig 2 which directly affects the length of suspended mooring line that provides pre tension taking the oc4 semi submersible floating wind turbine robertson et al 2014 in this paper as an example the fairlead is located at 14 m below mean water level the effective vertical distances for suspended mooring line are 36 m and 186 m when water depths are 50 m and 200 m respectively in order to achieve reasonable pre tension as deep water the size of mooring line has to be increased in shallow water with the same x offset increment at fairlead longer line in shallow water will be lifted up than that in deep water given the same pre tension and stiffness at zero x offset the mooring line tension characteristics at different water depths are provided in fig 3 the comparison illustrates that the mooring line stiffness increases faster with increasing x offset for shallow water mooring than deep water mooring meaning that if the same wave frequency motions are triggered larger tension will be induced in shallow water mooring line the dramatic increase in line stiffness and associated sudden increase of line tension may lead to potential line breaking in addition if all the mooring line parts that were originally laying on the seabed are lifted up the stretching of the line becomes important and leads to a significant increase in stiffness and tension according to faltinsen 1993 the horizontal geometric in elastic stiffness k g of a catenary mooring line can be expressed as 1 k g t h x ω 2 1 2 t h ω h c o s h 1 1 ω h t h 1 where ω is the unit weight of mooring line x is the horizontal offset h is water depth and t h is the horizontal tension given the same horizontal tension t h the horizontal stiffness increases as water depth decreases as shown in fig 4 the horizontal wave frequency motions of the floating wind turbine are dominated by inertial effect a stiffer mooring system will lead to higher natural frequencies of the horizontal motions which are more easily excited by difference frequency wave loads the top angles between mooring line and axes α and β indicate the level of catenary shape of mooring line as shown in fig 5 a the bigger α is and the smaller β is the less catenary shape is left while the tighter and the more stretched the line is the initial values for α and β at static position are determined by mooring line tightness which is influenced by the horizontal span s distance between fairlead and touch down point effective water depth h distance between fairlead and seabed and length of suspended mooring line l s as given in equation 2 2 t a n β s i n h 2 s h l s 2 h 2 normally deep water mooring is designed with small tightness and reasonable horizontal pre tension can be achieved even with small angle α this keeps a high level of catenary shape which means it is quite rare that the mooring line will be totally stretched even for large horizontal x offset on the other hand shallow water mooring is usually quite tight because the effective water depth is much smaller compared with horizontal span in order to obtain reasonable horizontal pre tension as deep water the angle α has to be increased even with heavier mooring line which as a result will eliminate certain level of catenary shape from dynamic perspective the increase of x offset at fairlead will enlarge α and decrease β but the change rate varies at different water depths as an example given in fig 5 b when the fairlead moves from position 1 to position 2 with a horizontal offset d x the angle α and β will change to α and β similar as deriving the mooring line horizontal stiffness in equation 1 the average change rate of the angle β can be represented by the derivative of t a n β with respect to horizontal offset x 3 β x d t a n β d x d t v t h d x t v d t h t h d t v t h 2 d x 1 t h 2 t v d t h d x t h d t v d x 1 t h 2 t v k g t h ω d l s d x 1 t h 2 t v k g t h k g 1 1 2 a h k g t h 2 ω h 2 2 a h t h 1 1 2 a h where k g is horizontal stiffness as described in equation 1 ω is the unit weight of mooring line x is the x offset h is water depth a is a coefficient expressed as a t h ω as a result the average change rate for angle α expressed with unit degree can be written as 4 α x 90 a r c t a n d t a n β d x based on equations 3 and 4 given the same horizontal tension t h the change rate of top angle α x at different water depths are given in fig 6 the angle change rate tends to increase as water depth decreases which means shallow water mooring is more vulnerable to lose catenary shape and be stretched to straight line than deep water mooring it will lead to potential vertical force on the anchor which is quite dangerous as a result large footprint of the mooring system is normally required for shallow water with long chains laying on the seabed 2 2 taut mooring system the effect of elastic stiffness in taut mooring system the restoring force mainly comes from the stretch of the line so that the horizontal elastic stiffness k e assuming a linearized elasticity can be expressed as 5 k e e a 1 l s i n α where e is the young s modulus a is the cross sectional area l is the total line length and α is the angle between mooring line and vertical plane normally when water depth goes from deep to shallow the total length of mooring line l will become shorter which will lead to a larger stiffness k e therefore when experiencing same amplitude of wave frequency motion the induced tension will be larger in shallow water mooring line synthetic fibre rope as the most popular material used in taut mooring system is more complicated than chain and steel wire rope regarding the structural property the nonlinear response of synthetic fibre rope is loading path and loading duration dependent as shown in fig 7 the current industrial design practice is to use a lower bound stiffness to calculate extreme offset and an upper bound stiffness to calculate extreme tension this conservative and inconsistent approach has been mentioned in several offshore standards including dnvgl rp e305 dnvgl 2015 and api rp 2sm api 2014 there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the synthetic fibre rope performance and well established numerical program that can include the nonlinear behavior of synthetic fibre rope 3 mooring design solutions taking into account the design challenges mentioned in section 2 for both catenary and taut mooring systems in shallow water alternative mooring design concepts for floating wind turbine in shallow water e g about 50 80 m are investigated the targeting water depth for the design study in this paper is chosen to be 50 m 3 1 design criteria in view of the functionality of the wind turbine and the power cable the motion characteristics of the floater and the structural safety of the mooring lines a complete mooring design check according to dnvgl 2018a involves ultimate limit state uls fatigue limit state fls and accidental limit state als in this paper uls design check is focused while fls and als analysis will be investigated in the future the main design criteria for shallow water mooring in this paper are 1 considering the safety of power cable and the power production efficiency of wind turbine the offsets of the floater have to be limited to a reasonable range 2 all mooring lines have to be able to withstand the load effects in all the environmental conditions considered which means that the maximum mooring line tension can not exceed the maximum breaking strength taking into account the safety factor fatigue damage is normally also required for a complete mooring design but the ultimate load case is focused in this paper 3 the catenary mooring line lying on the seabed should be long enough to avoid being totally lifted up during the lifetime and prevent drag anchor to take vertical load even in the most extreme condition 4 the leeward mooring line should not experience slack which may lead to large snap tension 5 the properties of a mooring system in 200 m water depth is considered as the reference for shallow water moorings relevant parameters are pre tension horizontal stiffness line length etc 3 2 design basis 3 2 1 mooring component clump weight is a concentrated weight which can be used to improve the geometric stiffness properties of the line it can be incorporated with a lighter mooring line to achieve beneficial stiffness properties for the relevant top end offset a buoy is normally included to reduce the weight of the line improve the geometric stiffness and provide sufficient clearance to any subsea equipment the use of buoys in shallow water moorings could also reduce the non linearity of the geometric stiffness and hence reduce extreme tension at large x offsets 3 2 2 synthetic fibre ropes the syrope model many research projects have been recently launched with the objective to improve the modelling of synthetic fibre rope mooring lines among them syrope jip falkenberg et al 2017 led by dnv gl provided specific and practical guidelines based on extensive laboratory testing in order to better describe the complex behavior of the synthetic fibre rope a spring dashpot model is proposed for illustration as shown in fig 8 the elastic stretch consists of instant elastic and visco elastic stretch which can be considered as a spring without and with a damper separately the permanent stretch on the other hand includes visco plastic stretch which is irreversible when exposed to tension and construction stretch where the ratchet allows the spring to extend above previous highest tension without retraction in order to avoid permanent stretch a relevant installation procedure of a synthetic fibre rope is to pre tension cross tension the rope to the predicted maximum tension level it will experience during its service life the length of the mooring line has then already reached the longest possible length and there will be no further permanent bedding in extension rowley and leite 2011 the syrope model as shown in fig 9 was proposed in the jip falkenberg et al 2017 to better describe the tension stretch and axial stiffness characteristics for synthetic fibre rope used in mooring analysis based on the results from sub rope testing the syrope model can be interpreted as a combination of four curves original curve represents the tension stretch relationship during the first rapid loading of the new rope which can be considered as the upper limit of the tension stretch curve original working curve represents the stationary curve when the rope is at the mean tension with permanent stretch taken out working curve represents the curve when the rope is at a lower mean tension than the previous historical maximum mean tension in a stationary sea state the working curve is determined by the historically highest mean tension level while the exact working point on the curve is determined by the mean tension level dynamic stiffness represents the slope of the linearized stiffness curve for a given mean tension it increases with mean tension and is used to calculate the tension dynamics due to low frequency lf and wave frequency wf top end motions more details about the model can be found in falkenberg et al 2017 while the determination of static and dynamic stiffness is focused in this paper the static stiffness is represented by the nonlinear working curve depending on previous highest mean tension it describes a nonlinear relation between mean tension and mean stretch which is used to estimate the offset due to mean environmental loads the dynamic stiffness applied for both lf and wf load effects is linear and increases with mean tension the proposed models are linearly dependent on mean tension only the analytical expression of the linearized static stiffness e a s can be expressed as 6 e a s d t m e a n d ε a t m e a n b m b s where ε is stretch m b s is minimum breaking strength of the rope t m e a n is the mean tension a and b are constants estimated from sub rope testing it is a linear differential equation and the solution is a nonlinear exponential relation between the mean tension and the stretch by assuming zero mean tension for zero stretch it can be further described as 7 t m e a n m b s b a e x p a ε 1 the analytical expression of the linearized dynamic stiffness e a d is expressed as 8 e a d d t d y n d ε f t m e a n g m b s where t m e a n is the mean tension determined from previous static analysis using linearized static stiffness f and g are constants estimated from sub rope testing examples of linearized static and dynamic stiffness curves are given in fig 10 static stiffness is nonlinear with stretch equation 7 while both static and dynamic stiffness vary with mean tension level and the mean tension is also influenced by the stiffness drawing lessons from qiao and ou 2011 the mooring analysis procedure in this paper is summarized in fig 11 and explained in details as follows step 1 determine the parameters of the static and dynamic stiffness models according to sub rope testing i e a b f and g initialize the mooring configuration in simo with prescribed mooring line properties e g pre tension mass and length etc define the static stiffness based on equation 6 with pre tension and mbs as inputs thereafter anchor positions can be determined step 2 for a given sea state perform the static analysis with mean environmental loads acting on the floater and mooring system calculate equilibrium position of the floater and mean tension in the lines update the static stiffness model equation 6 with obtained mean tension until the mean tension is equal to previous iteration which indicates that convergence is achieved step 3 based on the mean tension achieved from previous static analysis calculate the dynamic stiffness based on equation 8 and apply them in the final dynamic analysis of the mooring lines to document dynamic tension step 4 calculate total tension by adding the results from step 2 and 3 3 3 alternative concept proposals in view of the design criteria in section 3 1 and the design basis in section 3 2 seven initial mooring design concepts are proposed as shown in fig 12 the concepts are designed for a water depth of 50 m shallow water while a mooring model at 200 m deep water is selected as reference with respect to line length pre tension offset tension characteristics etc the features of the mooring models are introduced in table 2 while the detailed properties of the mooring line are summarized in table 3 regarding the positions of clump weight and buoy the mooring line which is aligned with both incoming wind wave direction and x z plane is taken as an example while their coordinates are given in table 4 among the seven designs the first four concepts are catenary moorings using chain cable while the last three are taut moorings using synthetic fibre rope in addition clump weight and buoy are included in the comparative designs to check their influence on the overall performance the parameters of the chain is determined according to vryhof 2015 and the parameters for the synthetic fibre rope is according to bridon 2013 the diameter of chain refers to the size of the steel bar while the diameter of synthetic fibre rope refers to the size of the rope the weight of mooring line is given as the unit weight in water the anchor radius refers to the distance between anchor and the center of the platform the property of buoy is given as the net buoyancy e a s and e a d stands for axial stiffness used in static analysis and dynamic analysis respectively as described in equations 6 and 8 drag embedment anchor dea is used for the four catenary mooring designs to be more specific 17 ton stevshark mk5 anchor designed by vryhof anchor vryhof 2015 is selected this anchor can be adjusted for varying soil conditions through modifying the shank angle this selection is based on two reference projects hywind ii project equinor 2019 and windfloat project principlepower 2019 where the same anchor were used in order to better take the vertical load from the synthetic fibre rope mooring line and achieve accurate anchor location suction anchor is chosen for the three taut mooring designs similar to the conceptual tlwt project copple et al 2012 a 50 ton suction anchor is chosen 4 case study 4 1 floating wind turbine in this study the 5 mw oc4 semi submersible wind turbine robertson et al 2014 is used to compare the mooring design concepts at 50 m water depth the semi submersible is composed of three offset columns three pontoons a central column and braces as shown in fig 13 the origin of the coordinate system is located at still water level while the x axis is the nominal wind direction the y axis is lateral to the left when looking downwind and z axis is upward along the center line of the undisplaced platform the mass of the floater including ballast is 1 3473e 7 kg and the dimensions of main components are listed in table 5 the reference wind turbine mounted on top of oc4 floater is the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 whose thrust curve at different wind speeds is given in fig 14 the mooring system is designed with three mooring lines which spread symmetrically about a vertical axis through the platform center with an angle of 120 between each line the fairlead is located at the top of the base columns which is 14 m below the still water level a bird view of the mooring system is given in fig 13 b among all three mooring lines the upwind mooring line 2 was selected as an example for the analysis later since it is aligned with the incoming wind and wave direction and subjected to the largest tension 4 2 load case with the purpose of comparing the performance of different mooring design concepts a series of representative load cases lcs are considered in this paper covering both operational and extreme conditions as listed in table 6 the turbulent wind and irregular wave are correlated and directionally aligned the lcs are selected with increasing wind speed from cut in to cut out wind speed with a bin size of 4 m s while the turbulent wind field is generated according to the norwegian petroleum directorate npd wind spectrum the mean wind speed u is expressed as a function of height z above mean water level 9 u z u r e f z z r e f α where u r e f is the reference wind speed z r e f is the height of the reference wind speed and α is the power law coefficient the reference height is set to 90 m above mean water level as the center of rotor and α was chosen to be 0 14 for floating wind turbine according to iec 61400 3 iec 2005 the irregular wave series are generated using jonswap wave model the significant wave heights and peak periods are defined based on the correlation with wind speed for the northern north sea johannessen et al 2001 considering a water depth of 50 m in this paper lc8 is about same level as 50 year extreme condition at north sea which is sufficient for an intact uls check for mooring system of a floating wind turbine dnvgl 2018b in addition current load effect is accounted for in lc9 whose wind and wave condition is same as lc8 according to dnvgl os e301 dnvgl 2018a the current can be categorized as tidal circulation wind generated soliton and loop currents depending on the site location a surface current speed u c with 10 year return period is recommended for mooring analysis based on the typical surface current speeds as given in dnvgl 2018a 1 0 m s is chosen as a representative surface current velocity in this paper the variation is considered as a linear profile from still water level to z 50 m as shown in equation 10 the current is assumed to vanish at water depth deeper than 50 m and same current profile is used for both 50 m and 200 m water depth 10 u c z 1 0 50 z 50 for 50 z 0 since the focus of this paper is to demonstrate the pros and cons of different mooring design concepts rather than a sophisticated mooring system design load cases prioritized in this paper are relevant for uls criteria 4 3 fully coupled dynamic analysis the aero hydro servo elastic behaviors of the floating wind turbine systems requires sophisticated coupled dynamic analysis method the dynamic motion equation of the floater in time domain can be written as 11 m a r t 0 t κ t τ r τ d τ k s r t t t r r r q t r r where m is the mass matrix a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequencies κ t τ is the retardation function faltinsen 1993 which is calculated from frequency dependent added mass or potential damping k s is the hydrostatic restoring matrix r r r are the displacement velocity and acceleration t is force from mooring system q is the external force which includes first second order wave excitation force and wind force in this paper the frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping and first order wave forces are calculated in hydrod dnv gl 2016 which is a potential flow solver the linear damping as well as quadratic damping are included based on decay test results the second order difference frequency wave excitation force is calculated using full quadratic transfer function qtf with additional meshing of the free surface compared with newman s approximation method whose computation time is about several minutes the computational effort for full qtf method is much more intensive which takes approximately 22 h however full qtf method is necessary for limiting the uncertainty of heave roll and pitch motion prediction in which newman s approximation has limitation viscous effect on the floater is modeled by the drag term in morison s equation and the hydrodynamic force acting on mooring line is computed using morison s equation based on finite element method fem the mooring line is defined in terms of sequence of segments with homogeneous cross sectional properties the drag coefficients for catenary chain cable and synthetic fibre rope are determined according to dnvgl os e301 dnvgl 2018a as shown in table 7 both the clump weight and buoy are modeled with separated bodies whose mass and volume are carefully calculated to achieve desired net gravity and net buoyancy the aerodynamic load is calculated based on bem theory with 3d wind velocity model the time domain simulations are perform in sima sintef ocean 2018a b the motion equation is solved using newmark beta integration with time step of 0 02s 5 results and discussions 5 1 static analysis 5 1 1 pre tension sufficient pre tension prevents large floater x offset due to mean and lf environmental load it is influenced by the submerged weight of the suspended mooring line for catenary mooring system and initial line stretching for taut mooring system the horizontal pre tension for the seven designs are listed in table 8 where the value for 200 m is set as a reference as expected the horizontal pre tension for model iii is smaller compared with other models because of the buoy attached to the suspended line 5 1 2 offset characteristics mooring line tension properties with increasing in line x offsets at fairlead are studied in fig 15 according to campanile et al 2018 the recommended admissible floater offset to water depth ratio is 0 3 at 50 m depth therefore the static mooring line tension characteristics is compared up to 15 m x offset the amplitude of typical low frequency and wave frequency motions is in the range between 2 m and 4 m for operational conditions while the extreme motion is just below 15 m as shown in fig 21 the tension for the three taut moorings increases linearly with increasing x offset while the effect due to the implementation of clump weight and buoy is not significant which is quite different from catenary type as for the four catenary moorings the tension increases linearly at small x offsets while the increment becomes nonlinear at large x offsets this is a typical characteristics for catenary mooring system and it is more significant for shallow water 50 m than deep water 200 m xu et al 2018 among the four catenary moorings the nonlinear increment of model i is the most noticeable due to large unit weight while model iv is the least noticeable thanks to the buoy attached at the resting line the performance of model iv v vi vii are quite close to the reference model 200 m as a reference the total horizontal mooring system restoring forces with respect to increasing horizontal x offsets are given in fig 16 it will provide a general idea of mean horizontal motion when exposed to mean environmental loads as well as the range of total restoring force due to wf and lf motion 5 1 3 vertical angle the issue regarding the angle between mooring line and vertical axis has been introduced in section 2 the change of the angle α as shown in fig 5 with increasing x offset at fairlead is shown in fig 17 since the water depth is quite small 50 m compared with mooring line footprint about 900 m the stretched synthetic fire rope mooring line is almost parallel to the seabed with angle close to 90 while the influence of adding clump weight and buoy is quite limited as for the four catenary moorings in 50 m the initial angles are around 60 indicating a significant catenary shape as x offset increases the angles starts to approach 90 indicating the loss of catenary shape and the likely stretching of the line better performance is achieved by model iv because of the application of buoys meanwhile the angle problem is not significant for the catenary mooring in 200 m 5 2 decay analysis prior to the dynamic analysis it is important to check the natural periods of the semi submersible which is greatly influenced by the mooring system characteristics in horizontal plane surge sway and yaw free decay test in calm water were performed to compare the natural periods for the different concepts and the final results are summarized in fig 18 the natural periods in heave roll and pitch degrees of freedom are barely influenced by mooring system which is as expected the reference natural period surge sway and yaw for water depth 200 m is larger than all the designs in 50m additionally larger periods are found for model iii which indicates that buoy will reduce the restriction of the system the natural period for model v is smaller than model vi and vii because the application of clump weight and buoy will include more geometric stiffness 5 3 dynamic analysis 5 3 1 regular wave the hydrodynamic characteristics of the mooring concepts are further compared by response amplitude operator rao which are determined through a number of regular wave simulations since wave nonlinearity characterized by the ratio between wave amplitude and wave period will affect the rao analysis the amplitude of the regular wave in this paper is chosen to be 1 m and wave period ranges from 1 s to 35 s in order to cover most probable excitation wave components the motion reference point is taken as the origin of the coordinate system which is located at the mean water level floater motions such as surge heave pitch and mooring line tension are studied in fig 19 the theoretical asymptomatic behavior of surge motions for freely floating structures in long waves tends to follow the elliptical trajectory of water particles at finite water depth the amplitude of the horizontal motion of the water particles in shallow water can be written as a t a n h k h a k h where a is wave amplitude k is wave number and h is water depth accordingly given the same wave amplitude the motion amplitude will increase as water depth decreases therefore in this study the surge raos for all the moorings in 50 m are larger than the reference model in 200 m the coupling between surge and pitch results in the large surge rao peak at pitch natural frequency which is more significant for catenary moorings than taut moorings in addition the raos are not greatly influenced by mooring systems for the range of wave periods from 5 s to 15 s as a result the wave frequency motions are not influenced by the mooring system when exposed to irregular waves which is as expected however as for low frequency motions in particular the resonant pitch motions around 25 s and the associated surge motions are strongly influenced by the mooring system the heave rao is almost the same for all the moorings in 50 m which proves again that floater heave motion is almost not affected by mooring system pitch resonance leads to the largest pitch rao peak and apparent difference are found for different mooring concepts because of different stiffness the mooring line tension rao is directly influenced by floater horizontal motion therefore the surge rao peak due to pitch resonance also result in a peak of mooring line tension rao there is a significant difference in the mooring line tension rao in the range of wave periods from 5 s to 15 s which will influence the dimension of the mooring lines in realistic sea state where nonlinear mooring line tension behavior becomes more significant the tension rao curve presented here may lead to underestimation compared with dynamic analysis result in high sea state 5 3 2 irregular wave and turbulent wind the environmental parameters are given in section 4 2 six operational conditions where turbine is rotating and three extreme conditions where turbine is parked are defined in order to compare the mooring performance the results are achieved for 3 h response by running each simulation for 12 000 s while the first 1200 s is excluded because of transient effect 10 different realisations of turbulent wind and irregular wave are generated for each load case to account for the stochastic variability the expected maximum of the response is determined as the average of the 10 individual sample maxima floater motions and windward line are selected as representative responses in this section the mean horizontal environmental forces including mean wind force and second order wave force for all the load cases are given in table 9 the mean environmental force in lc9 is significantly larger than that in lc8 due to the current load effect the mean standard deviation and maximum of the floater motion in surge heave and pitch directions are provided for each load case in fig 21 in addition the total response is also decomposed into wf and lf components for comparison an example of time series for surge motion in lc3 is given in fig 20 consisting of total motion wf motion and lf motion as the mean value of wf response is around zero therefore only the standard deviation and maximum are compared in fig 22 with lf value shown above x axis and wf value shown below x axis the power spectrum of the mooring line 2 fig 13 as the most loaded line is studied in fig 23 with respect to the power spectra two representative load cases are focused one for operational condition lc3 and one for extreme condition lc8 in lc3 where wind effect is strong and wave condition is not severe low frequency responses contributes more to the total tension response compared with wave frequency response component meanwhile in the parked condition lc8 the wind load effect is limited and the wave condition is quite severe wave frequency tension is governing the total response the statistics of mooring line tension is compared in fig 24 a the mean tensions for model i ii and iv are quite close while smaller value for model iii and larger value for model v vi vii are observed for all the load cases noticeable standard deviation and maximum is found for model i compared with others in lc9 similar surge motion leads to quite different maximum mooring line tension in extreme condition is the best prove of different mooring line behaviors when exposed to same environmental condition among the four catenary designs smaller extreme tension is obtained for model iv thanks to the implementation of buoy as for the three taut moorings the extreme tensions are slightly higher than the catenary moorings this is valid for the level of elastic stiffness that is used in this paper there is a need for synthetic fibre ropes with lower elastic stiffness properties for effective mooring of floating wind turbines especially in shallow water the tension responses for lc9 is larger than that for lc8 due to the current load effect from fig 24 b lf component is dominating in operational condition while wf component is governing in extreme condition considering different capacity associated with different mooring materials utilization factor recommended by dnvgl st 0119 dnvgl 2018b can provide another perspective of tension responses to their material limit apart from the direct comparison of the statistics the utilization factor u is defined as 12 u t p r e t γ p r e t t c e n v γ e n v s c where t p r e t is the mooring line pre tension t c e n v is the characteristic environmental tension due to mean low frequency and wave frequency load which is calculated as t m p m t p r e t where t m p m is the most probable maximum tension s c is the characteristic mooring line strength defined as 95 of the minimum breaking strength s m b s γ p r e t and γ e n v are safety factors which are set as 1 3 1 75 respectively in this paper based on the assumption of level 1 consequence class the resulting utilization factors for all the models in all load cases are shown in fig 24 c first of all all the utilization factors are below 1 which means the line capacities are not exceeded for all the models and they are close to 1 in the most extreme condition meaning that line redundancy is within acceptable range in operational conditions where the tension level is small the utilization factors for taut moorings are slightly larger than catenary moorings however in extreme conditions when the tension level is high the utilization factors for catenary moorings increase dramatically compared with taut moorings speaking of individual mooring performance almost no difference is found among model v vi vii and clearly better performance is found for model iv 5 4 cost analysis economic consideration plays an important role in the mooring decision the expense of an offshore wind project can be evaluated by capital expenditures capex or operating expenditures opex myhr et al 2014 when a complete time span is considered for different phases of the project life cycle cost analysis lcca is preferred for evaluation since the focus of this paper is to compare different mooring design concepts for the same floating wind turbine the lcca analysis will focus on the mooring system rather than the whole wind turbine in addition the comparison is performed mainly for manufacture and installation in lcca it is worth noticing that the cost related to maintenance and repair could be different it is well known that estimation of the mooring expense is not a simple task due to the lack of publicly available data the costs of mooring line anchor and installation etc have been investigated by several researchers campanile et al 2018 myhr et al 2014 andreas and john 2012 bjerkseter and ågotnes 2013 klingan 2016 audibert et al 2003 benassai et al 2015 fylling and berthelsen 2011 which are mainly preliminary studies in this paper an elementary cost analysis is also performed based on some of the references mentioned and the main purpose is to provide a general cost wise ranking of the seven mooring designs the total cost also takes into account the utilization factor of mooring line the detailed anchor capacity design is not the focus of this paper therefore anchors from well proven industrial projects are referred according to bjerkseter and ågotnes 2013 the price of a 17 ton stevshark mk5 anchor from vryhof anchors is approximately 114000 while a 50 ton suction anchor costs around 512500 the price for mooring line is estimated according to the objective function in klingan 2016 which is based on data provided by equinor the prices for chain synthetic fibre rope and steel wire basically can be described by a common expression with different coefficients 13 c o s t l e n g t h w e i g h t p r i c e where length is given in m weight in the air is given in n m and the price is given in n for different materials as shown in table 10 the price for two clump weights are estimated as heavy chain using equation 13 while the price for two buoys are estimated using data from defender 2019 with a linear interpolation the installation procedure for all the models in this paper is assumed to be performed by one large anchor handling tug supply vessel with sufficient holding capacity according to audibert et al 2003 the installation time for a dea anchor is about 8 h including deck rigging launching lowering seabed penetrating and tensioning while it takes about 12 h to install a suction anchor including seabed penetrating and deck handling combining other assumptions as shown in bjerkseter and ågotnes 2013 the baseline mooring system installation costs for all concepts are obtained the total cost for all the mooring models are calculated in table 11 by summing up the manufacture and installation costs the price is listed in euro k stands for 10 3 and m stands for 10 6 u indicates the maximum utilization factor of the mooring line in lc9 as shown in fig 24 generally the catenary mooring is competitive regarding the cost of anchor and installation but the capital cost for the mooring line is quite high the taut mooring on the other hand is favorable with respect to the cost of synthetic fibre rope however the cost for the suction anchor and installation is quite high clearly the cost of the reference model in 200 m is quite low compared with the models in 50 m since the cost of the mooring line is low model i is the most expensive model because of the high price for the heavy chain model iv and v are more cost competitive designs of their types while the difference with other models is not significant meanwhile current cost estimates are based on uls design criteria and certain number can be different if fls and als design check are respected too in addition the cost estimation in this paper can be subject to variations given particular project location timing and supplier therefore model ii vii are all recommended for further assessment 6 conclusions in order to further promote the industrial development of offshore floating wind turbine the challenges and solutions regarding mooring system design in shallow water is systematically studied in this paper seven mooring design concepts for oc4 semi submersible floating wind turbine are proposed at 50 m water depth different mooring line materials and mooring components are used the comparative designs are proposed by taking full advantage of both geometric and elastic mooring stiffness the stiffness characteristics for synthetic fibre rope is described with an improved numerical model based on latest experimental data the concepts are evaluated through static decay dynamic and cost analysis finally two mooring concepts with better performance and competitive cost are recommended for future application the geometric effect is the most important parameter for catenary mooring at shallow water clever inclusion of heavy chain or clump weight have to be used in order to achieve a reasonable pre tension and stiffness characteristics the nonlinearity in the line characteristics is pronounced for traditional catenary systems which can be improved by smart use of buoys and or clump weights the use of synthetic fibre ropes instead of chain cable will also reduce the nonlinear characteristics but the benefit of including clump weight and buoy is not significant from dynamic analysis the extreme tension for pure chain mooring is extraordinarily large compared with other concepts judging from the mooring utilization factor hybrid catenary mooring model iv clearly stands out from the cost analysis the capital cost of mooring chain is high while the cost of its dea anchor and installation is relatively low on the contrary the cost of synthetic fibre rope mooring line is quite low however the cost for the suction anchor and installation is quite high when combining with the utilization factor model iv and v are cost competitive concepts the advantages and disadvantages of the seven mooring designs are further summarized in table 12 in conclusion taking the structural performance and capital cost of different models into account model ii vii are all recommended for further assessment related to floating wind mooring design in shallow water in the future as for the future work the proposed mooring concepts need to be further verified with fatigue analysis and accidental analysis more load cases including the

21288,oscillating wave surge converters owscs have been extensively used to exploit wave energy to maximize the energy output from an owsc array layout optimizations must be conducted therefore an analytical wake model of owsc is needed for fast optimization iterations however no wake model of owsc and no wake model based array optimization approach have been developed to this end this study proposed a novel analytical wake model of owsc based on the proposed wake model and differential evolution algorithm layout optimizations of owscs in wave energy farms were performed to establish a database for deriving the analytical wake model owscs were numerically simulated using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method where the incoming wave height damping of the power take off system and flap width were varied the attained analytical wake model could predict the wave height changes in wake regions of owscs with an accuracy of 90 0 compared with the numerical sph results the optimized owsc layouts demonstrated that staggered layouts with narrow and wide owscs placed in the front and back of wave energy farms respectively were economical and appropriate furthermore a simplified guideline was proposed to determine owsc layouts finally all the codes implemented in this study were open sourced keywords oscillating wave surge converter array optimization wake model

the global increase in energy consumption and the severe pollution resulting from the use of conventional energy sources e g oil and coal the search for novel clean and renewable energy sources e g wind wave and solar energies has become more urgent wave energy is abundant and exhibits high energy density furthermore wave energy converters wecs have been developed to exploit energy from sea waves he et al 2013 2019 veigas et al 2014 rusu and onea 2015 fan et al 2016 abbasnia and soares 2018 elhanafi et al 2018 ding et al 2019 ruehl et al 2020 schubert et al 2020 senol and raessi 2019 wang 2019 zhang et al 2020 oscillating wave surge converter owsc renzi et al 2014a b aw energy oy 2019 is one of the most popular wecs and has been extensively investigated both experimentally and numerically in recent decades owing to its simple geometry and direct energy capturing mechanism fig 1 depicts a typical example of an owsc as shown an owsc primarily comprises a flap hinge base and power take off pto system i e hydraulic pump high pressure flow pipe and rotor in fig 1 when incoming waves propagate in the surge direction the flap rotates around the hinge in the pitch direction subsequently the fluid in the high pressure flow pipe is pressed which in turn drives the rotor to generate electricity in recent years several researchers have investigated the hydrodynamics of owscs henry et al 2014 2018 wei et al 2015 2016 mottahedi et al 2018 conducted detailed parametric studies of owscs for optimization schmitt et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 liu et al 2020a predicted capture factors of owscs using the radial basis function neural network and optimized owscs using the genetic algorithm ga liu et al 2020b tom et al 2016 2017 designed a nearshore owsc that could change its own geometry according to the wave conditions therefore yielding satisfactory performances under varying wave conditions meanwhile by tuning the geometry the wave loads acting on the flap could be decreased these studies have provided valuable experimental and numerical data for the design of owscs wherein the height width thickness density damping of pto hinge height location and other parameters of single owsc were optimized however in real sea state applications more than one converter needs to be placed in a wave energy farm and their layouts and configurations significantly affect their overall performance consequently the array optimizations of owscs should be conducted to ensure superior efficiency and to reduce cost in early 2014 renzi et al 2014a b investigated the hydrodynamics and wave power absorptions of a finite array of owscs by developing an inviscid potential flow theory they analyzed several typical fixed layouts and discovered that asymmetrical layouts were less efficient than symmetrical ones subsequently noad and porter 2015 developed a mathematical approach to study several fixed layouts of three or five converters sarkar et al 2016 developed a systematic approach for the prediction and optimization of arrays of owscs which used a statistical emulator to predict the performances of owscs in an array an active learning strategy to investigate regions of interest and a ga to obtain the optimal layouts of owscs next potential flow theory was used to model an array of converters with fixed layouts under random sea states tay and venugopal 2017 and an array of curved owscs in open sea michele and renzi 2019 more recently sharp and dupont 2018 optimized arrays of converters using a ga model involving an analytical hydrodynamic model and a cost model thereby providing an understanding of device layout and spacing as well as valuable experience for subsequent research furthermore lópez ruiz et al 2018 developed an integrated optimization approach to improve the life cycle performance and operational capacity of arrays of wecs with several typical fixed layouts in previous studies most optimizations of owsc arrays pertained to several typical fixed layouts however the optimized results may not be the best because those studied layouts were empirically proposed and were fixed during the investigations in some studies wecs were simplified to cylinders regardless of the wec type to obtain optimized layouts optimization algorithms require numerous cases as the database resulting in extremely high computational time if all cases need to be simulated using potential flow mesh based and mesh free computational fluid dynamics cfd methods thus accurate and fast meta models capable of predicting wave heights in wake regions as well as performances of owscs should be developed the wake effects of the wave dragon wecs beels et al 2010a 2010b cycloidal wecs siegel 2019 and owscs tomey bozo et al 2019 have been previously analyzed however to the best knowledge of the authors no wake models have yet been presented consequently a fully analytical wake model of owscs is first proposed herein for predicting wave height changes in wake regions as well as an energy output model for predicting the performances of owsc arrays subsequently these models are used in differential evolution de algorithms to optimize the converters with random layouts in wave energy farms the geometrical parameters of owscs are difficult to be experimentally tuned additionally multiple wave gauges should be installed in the wave basin to obtain a complete wave height distribution therefore experimentally obtaining a wake model is almost impossible it thus becomes essential to accurately simulate the wave interactions of owscs using numerical techniques in the above mentioned studies the potential flow theory and mesh based cfd methods were primarily adopted however the potential flow theory could solely deal with irrotational fluids for which viscosity was not considered the owscs must be fixed or have small motions which greatly limits the utilization of potential flow theory in investigations of the owscs with violent motions in this study liu and wang 2020 for cfd codes compared with the mesh based methods mesh free methods or particle based methods e g smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph can easily treat violent free surface flows large hydrodynamic loads and complex boundary conditions especially fluid floating boundary conditions liu and wang 2020 khayyer et al 2018a focused on fluid structure interaction simulations that employed mesh free methods specifically sph has been extensively developed and employed to solve ocean and coastal engineering problems such as dam breakings crespo et al 2008 liu et al 2013 wave breakings he et al 2020 and fluid floating interactions khayyer et al 2018b recently researchers schmitt and elsäßer 2017 zhang et al 2018 wei et al 2019 brito et al 2020 have further developed sph for modeling owscs and it has been successfully used to conduct parametric studies and systematic optimizations of owscs liu et al 2020a 2020b in this study the weakly compressible sph approach was utilized additionally dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 which is a hardware accelerated sph solver that can be downloaded from https dual sphysics org was adopted after careful validations in dualsphysics except for the standard sph approach other techniques such as the diffusive term for the continuity equation molteni and colagrossi 2009 and the particle shifting algorithm xu et al 2009 vacondio et al 2013 have also been implemented to enhance the numerical accuracy and stability of sph besides there are also some advanced techniques for sph that are not implemented by dualsphysics antuono et al 2010 developed a novel equation system by applying diffusive terms in both continuity and energy equations wherein a proper state equation was also derived this novel model was named as δ sph which was proved to be more accurate when applied to the problems characterized by energetic and short time dynamics antuono et al 2012 however it required a solution of a renormalization problem for the density gradient costing considerable computational time regarding the boundary conditions ferrand et al 2013 2017 proposed a semi analytical wall boundary condition for solid and open boundaries respectively it performed better than dynamic boundary condition dbc used in dualsphysics however it involved a renormalization problem with higher computational cost optimization algorithms should ideally be applied after the wake model is obtained from the sph results in recent years ga eiben and smith 2003 haupt and ellen 2004 has been extensively utilized to optimize owscs and has exhibited good performance sarkar et al 2016 giassi and göteman 2018 sharp and dupont 2018 lyu et al 2019 liu et al 2020b in this study the differential evolution de algorithm price et al 2005 which is regarded as the improved version of ga was adopted to optimize the owsc arrays the de algorithm and ga are both global search and optimization techniques used to solve problems with multi local extrema points and can process continuous and discrete variables however compared with the conventional ga the de algorithm can converge to global optimal solutions more accurately and quickly in previous studies e g sharp and dupont 2018 when optimizing owsc layouts the farm was meshed up and converters were placed only at the centers of the grids hence random layouts of the owscs could not be optimized this study aims to obtain an alternative solution to solve the aforementioned problem a novel optimization approach for owsc arrays is proposed herein which aims to maximize the total energy output of the wave energy farm firstly the sph model was validated against a three dimensional 3d 1 25 scale owsc model next several cases were simulated using the validated sph model by varying the incoming wave height pto damping and flap width the wave heights in the wake regions of the owscs were analyzed using fast fourier transform fft and the effects of the varying parameters on the wakes were investigated subsequently a fully analytical wake model with respect to wave height pto damping and flap width was established based on the sph results using the least squares method which was used to predict wave height changes in wake regions several additional sph cases were simulated to validate the proposed wake model before conducting the array optimization a model to predict the energy output of a single converter was developed based on wave height pto damping and flap width which was subsequently validated finally the obtained wake and energy output models were utilized in the de algorithm and several optimization scenarios involving different numbers of converters sizes of regions of interest wave heights minimum separation distances or simply called spacing and the number of sample points on the converters in the de algorithm were analyzed the wake model energy output model and optimized layouts and configurations of owsc arrays are shown in the numerical results furthermore a cpu central processing unit based parallel de code was developed using python programming language and is made available for other researchers 2 numerical methods in this section the primary numerical methods used herein are introduced first the wave interactions of owscs are simulated using a sph model specifically the coupled codes of dualsphysics and project chrono an open source engine designed for solving multi physics simulations project chrono 2018 brito et al 2020 subsequently an evaluation method for assessing the performances of the owscs followed by brief descriptions of the wake and energy output models are introduced finally the mathematical theory and processing flowchart of the de code are presented 2 1 sph theory sph is a particle based and fully lagarangian method which discretizes the continuous fluids into a set of independent particles the motions of these particles are governed by the momentum and continuity equations crespo et al 2015 which are respectively expressed as 1 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a π a b a w a b g 2 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b d a b in which v represents the velocity of the fluid particles t is time m and ρ indicate mass and density of the particles respectively p means pressure and g denote the gravitational acceleration the subscripts a and b indicate the target particle and neighboring particles respectively artificial viscosity π is utilized to counter viscosity of the fluids that can meanwhile ensure numerical stability d denotes the diffusive term of the continuity equation proposed by molteni and colagrossi 2009 w is the kernel function and the quantic kernel is adopted in this study crespo et al 2015 π w and d can be respectively written as 3 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b w h e n v a b r a b 0 0 w h e n v a b r a b 0 4 w r r α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 w h e n 0 q 2 5 d a b 2 δ φ r c 0 b ρ b ρ a r a b a w a b r a b 2 m b ρ b where c a b 0 5 c a c b is the mean speed of sound at the locations of particles a and b μ a b r v a b r a b r i j 2 η 2 with η 2 0 01r 2 v a b v a v b and r a b r a r b are the relative velocity and position respectively α 0 01 is adopted following the recommendation of dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 r in eq 4 denotes the smoothing length and q r r indicates the non dimensional distance between the target and neighboring particles with r as the real distance α d 21 16πr 3 when in 3d simulations δ φ is a constant coefficient equaling 0 1 c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 is the relative speed of sound when the density of the fluid is ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 meanwhile a state equation is used in the sph model to enforce the water flows to be weakly compressible which describes the relationship between pressure and density of the particles at this time a small change in density can result in a large change in pressure and the state equation crespo et al 2015 is written as 6 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ and γ 7 the c 0 here should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity to keep the density variations theoretically less than 1 simultaneously dynamic boundary condition dbc crespo et al 2007 is utilized to model the solid particles in sph which computes the quantities of the solid particles using the same governing equations as those of the fluid particles however the solid particles will not move according to the computed velocities instead they will remain in their fixed positions fixed boundaries used to model wave basins including basin sidewalls and bed or move according to predefined motions moving boundaries used to model wave makers on one side of the wave basin a piston type wave maker is set up using one layer of moving boundary particles see fig 2 a and second order wave generation theory madsen 1971 is utilized to calculate the time series of motion for the wave maker when the wave maker moves the fluid particles in front of the wave maker will be pushed to generate waves see fig 2 b specifically the wave maker stroke s 0 can be determined by 7 h s 0 2 s i n h 2 k w d s i n h k w d c o s h k w d k w d in which h is the wave height d denotes the water depth k w 2π l is the wave number with l as the wave length next the time series e 0 t of the wave maker movements is given by 8 e 0 t s 0 2 s i n ω t δ h 2 32 d 3 c o s h k w d s i n h 3 k w d 2 m 1 s i n 2 ω t 2 δ where ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the waves and t denotes the wave period δ is the initial phase and m 1 h s 0 on the other side of the wave basin a damping zone is implemented to eliminate the effects of reflected waves in which the velocities of particles reduce according to their positions in each time step for the flaps of the owscs they are modeled as floating boundaries and are assumed to be rigid the hydrodynamic forces by the fluid and constraint forces by the hinge are respectively calculated in sph and project chrono which are then summed up to calculate the total forces acting on the flaps then the motions of the flaps can be solved using the newton s second law of motion advanced particle shifting algorithm xu et al 2009 vacondio et al 2013 is also applied in the sph model and the details of those aforementioned methods can be found in the paper of crespo et al 2015 in addition the time step in sph is dynamically determined depending on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition forcing terms and viscous diffusion terms the variable time step size δt is calculated by 9 δ t c f l m i n δ t f δ t c v δ t f m i n i r f i δ t c v m i n i r c s m a x j r v i j r i j r i j 2 η 2 2 2 energy output of owscs the wave capturing performance of single one owsc is evaluated using the time averaged energy extracted by the pto system or simply called energy output p w henry et al 2018 for owsc arrays they are optimized aiming to maximize their total energy output p tw p w and p tw can be respectively expressed as 10 p w 1 2 ω 2 k w θ w 2 11 p t w i n d p w i in which θ w indicates the flap rotation amplitude in pitch direction n d represents the number of devices in the wave energy farm p w i is the energy output of ith device p w is the time averaged energy output thus its unit is j s 1 or w 2 3 wake and energy output models owscs under different wave heights h and with different pto damping k and flap width w are simulated subsequently the wave heights in the wake regions are analyzed using fft then an analytical wake model in terms of wave height pto damping and flap width is set up based on those simulation results the wake model can predict the wave height changes in the wake regions which is presented in section 4 after validating the sph model and obtaining the simulation results meanwhile for array optimizations a prediction model for the energy output of the owscs is needed to predict the p tw when the wave height pto damping and flap width change therefore an energy output model is built based on the simulation results and is described in section 4 2 4 de algorithm to solve multi real parameter optimization problems de price et al 2005 an evolutionary algorithm was developed by mimicking the natural evolutionary law firstly some candidate solutions or called individuals for the problem were randomly generated constituting the first generation population subsequently mutation crossover and selection occurred on these individuals depending on their adaptabilities resulting in a new generation population after sufficient generations the most adaptable individual in the population could be regarded as the global optimal solution for the optimization problem in this study the de best 1 scheme introduced by tanabe and fukunaga 2014 was adopted for the array optimization of owscs and the corresponding theory and equations are presented as follows the de problem aims to maximize the total energy output p tw of number of n d devices in a wave energy farm by optimizing their layouts x y and configurations k and w specifically different layouts and configurations can result in different wave height distributions in the wave energy farm therefore affecting the total energy output of the owscs wave height changes can be first predicted using the wake model subsequently the total energy output of the owscs can be computed using the energy output model assuming that a wave energy farm has a length of l x width of l y and has n d devices installed in it the layouts of the devices can be randomly determined between 0 l x and 0 l y however to ensure no collisions between the devices and navigation in the farm the devices must be installed away from one another therefore a minimum separation distance is required between the devices labeled as s x and s y along x and y direction respectively the spacing between the devices limits the maximum number of devices in the wave energy farm in de the output dimension of this problem is one i e the total energy output p tw the individuals of de represent the layouts and configurations of owsc arrays which comprise the positions x and y coordinates pto damping k and flap width w of the devices as a result the individual needs four values i e x y k and w to represent one owsc and needs n i 4th values to represent all owscs in the wave energy farm with n i means the structure of the individual the data structure of the individual on computer is presented in fig 3 as shown one individual is indicated by an array that can be categorized into four parts x coordinate y coordinate k and w of the owscs in the wave energy farm the waves propagate along the x direction from left to right at the beginning of de number of n i individuals are randomly generated to be the first generation population wherein n i is commonly within the range 5n i 10n i in this study n i 10n i was used to ensure the population diversity as opposed to the treatment of sharp and dupont 2018 wherein the farm was meshed up and the devices could only be installed at the centers of the grids the devices in this study can be randomly installed anywhere hence the constraints for the individuals were reduced such that the optimization results of this study would be closer to the global optimal solutions after initializing the first generation population the population is categorized into several groups which are processed by different cpu cores the total energy output p tw of the individuals is evaluated using the wake and energy output models meanwhile the constraint values c v are utilized to determine whether and the degree at which the layouts in the individuals satisfy the requirements of the spacing this is accomplished for every individual thereby eliminating the failed individuals the details of p tw and c v calculations are presented in section 5 after the introduction of the wake and energy output models subsequently mutation crossover and selection occur on the individuals to evolve a new generation population the mutation occurs depending on the following equation 12 m u t a c m b c wherein mut denotes the mutated individual a is the corresponding original individual b and c represent two randomly selected individuals from the original population c m denotes the mutation factor which ranges between 0 and 2 and is generally equal to 0 5 next crossover occurs between the original and mutated populations which can be expressed as follows 13 c o r m u t i f r a n d 0 1 c r a o t h e r w i s e in which cor represents the newly generated individual after crossover c r denotes the crossover factor which ranges between 0 and 1 and is often equal to 0 3 mut indicates the corresponding mutated individual of a calculated using eq 12 finally a new generation population can be generated by selecting the better individuals from the original and crossed populations the total energy output of the individuals in the new generation population is assessed next this population undergoes mutation crossover and selection promoting to the next generation population if de reaches the maximum generation of evolution n g which generally is 1000n i the best individual in the pasted generation populations is picked out as the final optimization result table 1 lists the key parameters in de algorithm the overall flowchart of de is depicted in fig 4 a python code package was developed based on geatpy https geatpy com the de code can be divided into four main steps i defining the problem and randomly initializing the first generation population ii dividing the population into several groups for cpu based parallel calculation iii calculating the total energy output using the wake and energy output models as well as the constraint values of each individual iv generating a new generation population by means of mutation crossover and selection of the original population depending on the total energy output calculated in step iii steps ii iv are repeated until the maximum number of generation is reached as a result of this optimization the best individual determined by the largest p tw is selected 3 convergence test and validation of sph in this section the convergence test and validation of the sph model are presented the experimental results for the wave interactions of a 3d 1 25 scale owsc model obtained by wei et al 2015 were used the recorded wave elevations and flap motions were then compared fig 5 shows the experimental setup wherein a 3d wave basin of length 18 m width 4 58 m and height 1 091 m was used initially the water depth d was at 0 691 m on the left side of the basin a piston type wave maker was installed and waves with a period of t 1 2 s and wave height of h 1 0 12 m and t 2 2 s and h 2 0 20 m corresponding to t 1 10 s and h 1 3 m and t 2 10 s and h 2 5 m in full scale model respectively were generated on the right side of the basin a 2 5 m long sloped overtopping porous mesh with an additional 1 2 m long mesh absorber with vertical saw tooth profiled entries was utilized as the wave absorber a 1 25 scale owsc model was placed in the middle of the basin at a distance of 7 92 m from the wave maker the floor of the wave basin stepped up and the actual water depth at the location of the owsc was 0 541 m the flap had the following dimensions 1 04 m width 0 48 m height 0 12 m thickness with a hinge height of 0 16 m from the floor the mass and moment of inertia of the flap were 33 kg and 1 84 kg m2 respectively the center of mass of the flap was 0 16 m above the hinge meanwhile 14 wave gauges were placed in the basin see fig 5 b the locations of the wave gauges are listed in table 2 with the origin at the middle of the wake maker x positive rightward and y positive upward in fig 5 among them the wave elevations at gauges 4 5 and 12 are compared several sph simulations were performed by mimicking the geometrical setup of the experiments the particle size d p in the simulations was varied to conduct a convergence test for wave conditions of t 1 2 s and h 1 0 12 m the particle size d p was varied to 0 04 0 03 0 02 and 0 01 m for wave conditions of t 2 2 s and h 2 0 20 m d p was varied to 0 05 0 04 0 03 and 0 02 m the wave elevations at gauges 4 5 and 12 and the motions of the flaps were compared to analyze the convergence and accuracy of the sph model fig 6 presents the convergence tests and comparisons of wave elevations for gauges 4 5 and 12 between the numerical sph results and the experimental results the coordinates in the experiment and sph were defined as follows the x axis was along the direction of wave propagation and rightward the y axis was along the width of the tank and inward the z axis was along the height of the tank and upward and the rotation angle was positive when the flap pitched toward the land all results presented in fig 5 are converted to full scale as shown in fig 6 a and d the sph and experimental results are in good agreement with each other in particular for cases with d p 0 01 m when wave height h 3 m and d p 0 02 m when wave height h 5 m however the wave elevations at the initial moment for different d p are inconsistent indicating different modeled initial water depths for different d p this is resulted by the round off error when generating particles for example when d p 0 02 m the desired initial water depth is 0 691 m however the actual water depth in the sph is 0 70 m because the precision for generating the particles is 0 02 m furthermore when d p 0 04 m the actual water depth is 0 68 m this phenomenon is also observed in other recorded wave elevations when the differences caused by water depths are ignored the profiles and amplitudes of wave elevations for gauge 4 show a slight sensitivity to d p and nearly converge when d p 0 01 m h 0 12 m and d p 0 02 m h 0 20 m resulting in h d p of 12 and 10 respectively for time histories of wave elevations at gauges 5 and 12 which were installed near the owsc at the seaside and leeside respectively strong nonlinear water surface profiles with higher order harmonic waves are observed those higher order harmonic waves couple with the incoming waves and transmitted waves however small discrepancies in the experimental and numerical layouts can result in significant changes in the positions where the superposition occurred therefore causing that the wave amplitudes of experimental results are higher than those of sph results at gauges 5 and 12 thus the sph and experimental results presented in fig 6 b c e and f are not in good agreement in addition wave gauge 12 was placed at the leeside of the flap and the wave amplitudes therein should ideally be lower than those of gauge 4 due to the energy capture by the flap however the waves therein are higher due to variations in the basin floor fig 7 shows the convergence tests and comparisons of flap rotations between numerical sph and experimental results as shown the flap rotations in the sph simulations agree well with those from the experimental results the changes in d p result in slight changes in the flap rotations as the wave height increases the flap rotations become more vigorous owing to larger wave forces in total the sph and experimental results of wave elevations at gauge 4 and the flap rotations agree well and the wave elevations at gauges 5 and 12 agree satisfactorily with those from the experimental results additionally the sph results converge when h d p approaches the value of 10 consistent with the findings of altomare et al 2017 therefore dualsphysics can be utilized to model 3d owscs and the particle size d p in the sph model is set to h 10 meanwhile the other parameters in the sph model were empirically determined specifically the smoothing length r was estimated to 1 5d p a symplectic algorithm was utilized as the integration scheme and the time step size in the sph was calculated according to the courant friedrich levy condition cfl number was 0 2 forcing terms and viscous diffusion terms crespo et al 2015 the coefficient of artificial viscosity was α 0 01 the simulations were performed on an nvidia geforce rtx 2080ti gpu when d p 0 02 m a total of approximately 4 5 billion particles were simulated and the time required to complete a simulation of 12 s was approximately 40 h 4 wake and energy output models this section presents the wake and energy output models obtained from the numerical results of several sph simulations with varying incoming wave heights pto damping and flap widths both models were validated against additional sph cases all the sph results were converted to full scale and the analytical models were established for full scale owscs 4 1 proposal and validation of the wake model ten sph cases were simulated with varying incoming wave heights pto damping and flap widths for ocean engineering modeling the wave excitation force is the dominant force and is usually converted to prototype scale by using the froude scaling law wei et al 2015 in this study the scaling factor of length was 25 when the scaling factor of density was 1 the scaling factor of time can be calculated as 5 subsequently the scaling factors of wave height pto damping flap width and power can be calculated as 25 1 953 125 25 and 78 125 respectively in the full scale sph simulations the wave basins were measured to be 500 m length 500 m width 17 5 m depth and the floor of the wave basins were flat the owsc was placed in the middle of the basin 100 m away from the wave maker initially the water depth was 13 35 m and the incoming wave heights were between 3 75 and 7 5 m the wave period was 10 s the last 25 m in the numerical wave basin was modeled as a wave absorber the damping of the pto system was between 1 95 107 and 5 86 107 n s rad 1 the flap widths varied from 20 to 35 m the configurations of the simulated sph cases are listed in table 3 subsequently fft was utilized to analyze the wave heights in the wake regions h r as shown in fig 8 and then normalized by dividing them by the incoming wave heights h as wave height changes primarily occurred within 275 m at the leeside of the flap only parts of the flow fields are presented in fig 8 the shapes of the wake regions are mainly caused by wave diffractions as shown when the waves pass by the flaps the wave heights at the leeside of the flaps decrease significantly owing to the energy capturing by the flaps which is known as wave deficit hereafter the reduced waves gradually recover as the waves propagate caused by the wave height gradients between the reduced or affected waves and the unaffected waves meanwhile the deficit regions resemble triangles that widens with the distance to the flap in addition on both sides of the deficit region the wave heights are greater than those of the incoming waves possibly caused by the wave run up that occurs during the interactions between waves and flaps and these are known as wave surplus hereafter the width of the surplus regions does not widen significantly with the propagation however the wave heights in the surplus regions decrease owing to the gradients between the affected and unaffected waves the shapes of the wake regions exhibit slight sensitivities to the wave height pto damping and flap width however the recovery speeds of the wake regions significantly depend on those parameters in particular the larger the wave height and pto damping as well as the smaller the width the faster the affected regions recover among them the wave height affects the recovery speed the most this is because for large waves the energy carried by the waves is sufficiently large to quickly smooth out the uneven wave height distributions in the wake regions in fig 8 the wave deficit gaussian centers represent that there have the smallest wave heights in the slice with the same value of x and the wave surplus gaussian centers mean that there have the largest wave heights to attain larger energy output the owscs should be placed near the wave surplus gaussian centers as much as possible as previously mentioned wave diffraction and run up during the wave interactions of owsc lead to wave deficit and wave surplus in the wake regions by using h r to denote the wave heights in the wake regions the wave height changes can be calculated as δh h h r subsequently the δh comprises δh d and δh s which are the wave deficit and wave surplus respectively in fig 8 the black lines indicate the wave height change percentage δh h in the wake region in terms of y at different x values the black lines show that as y increases from negative to positive the wave height change percentage exhibits an upward downward upward and downward in that order as x increases those black lines flatten gradually showing trends of straight lines the wave height change percentage lines resemble a combination of four gaussian functions among which two are utilized to present the wave deficit δh d and the remaining to present the wave surplus δh s subsequently a simplified wave height change percentage model is shown in fig 9 wherein h r δh δh d and δh s are depicted assuming that the wave deficit δh d is positive and the wave surplus δh s is negative δh can be computed as δh d δh s herein δh d and δh s are described using two gaussian functions the wave height change percentage δh h can be written as 14 δ h h 1 a 0 a 1 x a 6 e y a 2 a 3 x 2 2 a 4 a 5 x 2 e y a 2 a 3 x 2 2 a 4 a 5 x 2 a 7 a 8 x e y a 9 a 10 x 2 2 a 11 a 12 x 2 e y a 9 a 10 x 2 2 a 11 a 12 x 2 wherein the former two gaussian functions are used to model the wave deficit and the latter two to model the wave surplus coefficients a 0 a 12 are assumed to be polynomial functions of the wave height pto damping and flap width e denotes the natural logarithm as shown in figs 8 and 9 and eq 14 the gaussian centers and variations are assumed to be linearly related to x coefficients a 0 a 12 are assumed to be of the following form 15 a i b 7 h b 4 b 1 b 8 k 25 b 5 b 2 b 0 w b 6 b 3 b 9 i 0 1 12 where b 0 b 9 are constant coefficients the multivariate least squares method was utilized to determine the constant coefficients in eq 14 and then the coefficients in eq 15 finally the obtained wake model of wave height change percentage is shown in table a1 next the configurations of the tested 10 sph cases were input into the wake model to predict the wave height change percentage that were then compared with the numerical results of sph as presented in fig 10 for those 10 cases the obtained wake model agrees well with the sph numerical results for the wave height change percentage near the flaps the wake model slightly under predicts the wave deficit however this does not greatly affect the optimization results because the devices are placed with a spacing from each other as the distances to the flaps in the x direction increase the wave height change percentage decreases and the wake model agrees well with the sph numerical results with the continuous increase in the distances the wake model slightly over predicts the wave deficit indicating higher wave energy loss predicted by the wake model and that the optimization results would be conservative as shown in fig 10 the wave height changes near the front and back boundaries of the wave basin increase possibly caused by the boundary particles in the sph these variations were not considered in the wake model moreover hit rate q is adopted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the obtained wake model expressed as 16 q 1 n p 1 n l p 100 w i t h l p 1 δ h p δ h p δ h p d q o r δ h p δ h p w q 0 o t h e r w i s e where d q and w q are the two thresholds set as 0 25 and 0 085 max δ h h min δ h h respectively δ h and δ h denote the real and predicted wave height changes respectively n denotes the total number of comparison points which is 200 for each sph case in this study after determining d q and w q an accurate boundary can be computed as shown in fig 11 most points locate within the accurate boundary and the hit rate q is 91 4 indicating good agreement between the wake model and sph for relatively large values of δ h h see fig 11 corresponding to the wake regions near the flaps in fig 10 the predicted wave deficit is smaller than the true ones for relatively small values of δ h h the predicted wave deficit agrees well with the true ones however some of them are larger than the true ones resulting in higher wave energy loss in the wake region corresponding to wake regions distant from the flaps in fig 10 simultaneously when the predicted values are zero the true values range between 0 05 and 0 12 which can be explained by the boundary particles in sph in general the obtained wake model can accurately predict the wave height change percentage in the wake regions of those 10 cases to further evaluate the generalization ability of the obtained wake model three additional sph cases were simulated and compared with the predicted values the configurations of those three sph cases are listed in table 4 subsequently the sph numerical results and the predicted values by the wake model are presented in fig 12 furthermore the comparisons between the sph results and the wake model predicted values are shown in fig 13 for new cases the wake model provides accurate predictions of wave height change percentage in the wake regions and the hit rate q is 90 0 4 2 proposal and validation of the energy output model the energy output p w of the owscs in cases cw1 cw10 and cg1 cg3 were computed using eq 10 and are listed in table 5 subsequently an energy output model is established based on the results of cw1 cw10 by assuming that p w is a polynomial function in terms of wave height pto damping and flap width eq 15 the obtained model can then be written as 17 p w 1986 h 14 90 2 87 17 56 k 25 1 87 10 6 0 819 9 34 10 7 w 44 71 4 82 4 44 10 6 the predicted p w of the owscs using eq 17 are also listed in table 5 and compared with the true values from the sph cases the error in table 5 is defined as p w predicted p w true p w true 100 as shown the average prediction error of cases cw1 cw10 is 5 6 and that of cases cg1 cg3 is 4 0 moreover the hit rate or accuracy eq 16 of the energy output model can be calculated as 85 indicating the acceptable prediction ability of the energy output model and the feasibility of the model in predicting the p w of the owscs 4 3 discussions regarding wake and energy output models as shown in eq 17 for the wave height investigated herein 3 75 7 5 m the energy output of the owscs increases with the wave height until the wave height reaches 14 90 m consequently it can be concluded that the larger the wave height the higher the energy output of the owscs will be therefore in the layouts of owsc arrays the latter converters should be placed near the wave surplus gaussian centers of the former ones meanwhile as the increase of flap width within the predefined range 20 35 m p w always increases when k 4 68 107 n s rad 1 p w increases as the increase of k after that p w decreases as shown in figs 8 10 and 12 the positions of the gaussian centers for the wave surplus and wave deficit are linearly related to x and the slopes of those lines exhibit slight sensitivities to the wave height pto damping and flap width assuming that α d and α s are the angles between wave deficit gaussian center line and the x axis as well as the wave surplus gaussian center line and the x axis see fig 9 respectively α d and α s can then be calculated using arctan a 3 and arctan a 10 respectively with a 3 and a 10 as the coefficients of the proposed wake model table 6 lists the values of a 2 w α d a 7 w and α s of the wake models and corresponding mean and standard errors std for cases cw1 cw10 and cg1 cg3 as shown these parameters change slightly depending on the wave height pto damping and flap width especially for a 7 w and α s their std mean values are 0 17 and 0 02 implying that they can be specified as their own mean values when roughly determining the wave surplus gaussian center lines subsequently the latter owscs should be placed near the wave surplus gaussian centers as much as possible thereby simply optimizing the owsc array layouts 5 optimization of owsc arrays the obtained wake and energy output models were utilized in the de algorithm to optimize the owsc arrays several scenarios were considered and analyzed to ascertain the feasibility of the proposed approach by varying numbers of devices in the wave energy farm n d s1 s s2 lengths of farm in x l x s3 s s4 lengths of farm in y l y s5 s s6 incoming wave heights h s7 s s8 spacing in x s x s9 s s10 spacing in y s y s11 s s12 and number of sample points selected on the converters in de n s s13 s s14 the configurations of the tested scenarios are listed in table 7 wherein s was regarded as the basic configuration and the others were derived from s the spacing in the basic configuration was attributed as approximately twice the flap width ensuring a net spacing of flap width when the spacing was varied to maintain the maximum devices that can be installed in the farm l x and l y were also simultaneously varied to ensure that the ratios l x s x and l y s y remain unchanged see s9 s12 in table 7 5 1 calculating energy output and constraint value prior to optimizing the owsc arrays issues regarding the calculation of the total energy output of the owscs p tw and the method to determine the constraint value c v of each individual in de needed to be confirmed first when calculating the p tw of the owscs x y k and w are first separated from the individual array on computer and the devices are saved in the ascending order of x for the former devices their wake regions will cover the latter ones therefore the wake models of the former devices should be solved and the resulted wave height changes on the other devices behind them should be computed owsc is a long structure whose width is greatly larger than thickness resulting in that the wave heights at different locations on the surface at the leeside would differ with each other therefore a total of n s sample points are picked out on the surface see fig 14 the enlarged owsc is evenly divided into n s 1 segments where the local wave height changes are predicted i e δh i 1 δh i 2 and δh i ns and averaged to represent the nominal wave height of the whole owsc 18 δ h i 1 n s δ h i 1 δ h i 2 δ h i n s subsequently because the wave height changes are caused by the energy capture of the former owscs and according to the linear wave theory and the relation between wave energy and wave height e h 2 with e as the wave energy jts 145 2 2013 the total wave height change caused by all former owscs can be computed as follows next the final wave heights of the owscs can be computed the wave heights pto damping and flap width are then input into the energy output model to determine p tw as for the constraint value of the individual c v it will be negative if the individual satisfies the requirements of the spacing and the value is computed as the summation of the separation distances between the devices that are greater than the spacing if the individual does not satisfy the requirements c v becomes positive and the value is computed as the summation of the separation distances smaller than the spacing 5 2 results and discussions the optimized layouts of the owsc arrays of the scenarios are presented in fig 15 wherein their widths can be measured according to the scale shown at bottom right corner of fig 15 it is observed that staggered layouts occur frequently ensuring that the latter owscs are less affected by the wave deficits of the former ones the wake and energy output models indicate that pto damping and flap width of the owscs both directly and indirectly affect p tw simultaneously thus the effects of pto damping and flap width on array configurations are complicated and implicit however regarding pto damping the optimized damping is approximately 4 68 107 n s rad 1 precisely corresponding to the maximum energy output shown in eq 17 thereby implying that k 4 68 107 n s rad 1 can be directly adopted for the owscs as a constant value regarding flap width fig 15 shows that the widths of the former owscs in the wave energy farm are 20 m whereas those of the last column of the owscs are 35 m this is because the former owscs affect the incoming wave heights of the latter ones and the flap width significantly affects the recovery speed of the wake region therefore small width of the former owscs is utilized to reduce the wake effects on the latter owscs as for the last column of the owscs no owscs are installed behind them hence a large width of 35 m can be utilized to capture more wave power additionally the total energy outputs per unit width of the owsc arrays of the scenarios are presented in fig 16 from fig 16 s1 s and s2 wherein the number of devices is varied it is observed that as n d increases the total energy output per unit width of the owscs slightly decreases caused by the latter owscs placed in the wake regions of the former ones however the total energy output of the wave energy farm increases during this process as the farm size increases in both x and y direction fig 16 s and s3 s6 the total energy output per unit width also increases this might be explained as that for larger farms the separation distances between the devices can be larger thereby resulting in smaller wake effects between the devices and thereby a higher energy output furthermore the energy output model demonstrates that p w is positively related to the wave height therefore when wave height increases the total energy output per unit width of the owscs significantly increases as shown in fig 16 s7 s and s8 meanwhile similar to s3 s6 the energy output per unit width in s9 s12 also increases as the increases of s x and s y caused by the smaller wake effects between the owscs therefore it can be safely said that the larger the wave energy farm and the farther the owscs the higher the energy output will be fig 16 s13 s and s14 vary the number of sample points selected from the flaps in de n s as shown the performances of owsc arrays can hardly be enhanced by increasing n s however larger n s can lead to considerably higher computational time therefore n s 5 is utilized and recommended in this study regarding the computational time of those scenarios both the number of devices n d and number of sample points n s can affect the computational time when n s 5 it costs 0 25 0 67 and 2 68 h for cases with n d 10 15 and 20 respectively when n d 15 it costs 0 25 0 83 and 3 19 h for cases with n s 5 10 and 15 respectively it can be seen that the computational time rapidly increases as the increases of n d and n s however these computational times are acceptable and optimizing owsc array layouts is now feasible through the wake model and de based approach in total the optimized energy output per unit width of the owsc arrays positively correlates to the wave energy farm size incoming wave height and device spacing as well as negatively correlates to the number of devices staggered layouts with narrow and wide owscs respectively placed in the front and back of the wave energy farm are efficient meanwhile a constant pto damping of 4 68 107 n s rad 1 is recommended for the owscs 6 conclusions in this study a novel optimization approach for owsc arrays was proposed to maximize their total energy output specifically numerical simulations of owscs with variable wave heights pto damping and flap width were performed using sph based on the simulation data an analytical wake model and an energy output model of owsc were proposed using the proposed models and de algorithm layouts pto damping and flap width of owscs in a wave energy farm were optimized the self compiled de code has been made available for other researchers the following conclusions are drawn 1 a gaussian function based analytical wake model is proposed and has accuracies of over 90 compared with sph results a polynomial function based analytical energy output model is proposed and performs well with accuracies of over 85 2 generally the recovery speed of wave height in the wake region is positively related to the incoming wave height and pto damping but it is negatively related to flap width the shape of the wake region exhibits a slight sensitivity to incoming wave height pto damping and flap width 3 the gaussian center lines of wave surplus in the wake region of an owsc can be simply determined which start from 2 8 w away from the flap center and at 22 78 to the wave propagation direction the downstream owscs are recommended to be placed near these two lines 4 within the investigated ranges of the parameters the larger the incoming wave height and flap width are the higher will be the energy output of the owsc the energy output increases first and then decreases as the pto damping increases 5 staggered layouts of the owscs should be employed whereas narrow and wide owscs should be placed in the front and back of the wave energy farm respectively a constant value of k 4 68 107 n s rad 1 is recommended for the owscs 6 typically the total energy output per unit width of the optimized owsc arrays is positively related to the wave energy farm size incoming wave height and device spacing and is negatively related to the number of devices in this study the wave period was set as a constant and was regarded as the average wave period interacting with the studied owscs furthermore wave reflections were ignored in the current wake model to reduce the wave basin size in sph thereby the computational time despite these limitations the numerical results of this study provide new approaches and reference data for the array optimization of owscs in future studies the wave period will be included in the analytical wake model moreover a sensitivity analysis of the parameters e g wave period wave height pto damping flap size and hinge height will be conducted and the most influential parameters could be determined to simplify the analytical wake model the owsc array will also be optimized countering the construction cost besides dualsphysics was utilized in this study to simulate the wave interactions of owscs which was also used by brito et al 2020 and showed good agreements with experimental results however only first order or second order waves could be generated in present dualsphysics which were weakly nonlinear waves resulting in relatively low fidelity of the sph model consequently dualsphysics can be developed to generate higher order waves e g

21288,oscillating wave surge converters owscs have been extensively used to exploit wave energy to maximize the energy output from an owsc array layout optimizations must be conducted therefore an analytical wake model of owsc is needed for fast optimization iterations however no wake model of owsc and no wake model based array optimization approach have been developed to this end this study proposed a novel analytical wake model of owsc based on the proposed wake model and differential evolution algorithm layout optimizations of owscs in wave energy farms were performed to establish a database for deriving the analytical wake model owscs were numerically simulated using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method where the incoming wave height damping of the power take off

the global increase in energy consumption and the severe pollution resulting from the use of conventional energy sources e g oil and coal the search for novel clean and renewable energy sources e g wind wave and solar energies has become more urgent wave energy is abundant and exhibits high energy density furthermore wave energy converters wecs have been developed to exploit energy from sea waves he et al 2013 2019 veigas et al 2014 rusu and onea 2015 fan et al 2016 abbasnia and soares 2018 elhanafi et al 2018 ding et al 2019 ruehl et al 2020 schubert et al 2020 senol and raessi 2019 wang 2019 zhang et al 2020 oscillating wave surge converter owsc renzi et al 2014a b aw energy oy 2019 is one of the most popular wecs and has been extensively investigated both experimentally and numerically in recent decades owing to its simple geometry and direct energy capturing mechanism fig 1 depicts a typical example of an owsc as shown an owsc primarily comprises a flap hinge base and power take off pto system i e hydraulic pump high pressure flow pipe and rotor in fig 1 when incoming waves propagate in the surge direction the flap rotates around the hinge in the pitch direction subsequently the fluid in the high pressure flow pipe is pressed which in turn drives the rotor to generate electricity in recent years several researchers have investigated the hydrodynamics of owscs henry et al 2014 2018 wei et al 2015 2016 mottahedi et al 2018 conducted detailed parametric studies of owscs for optimization schmitt et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 liu et al 2020a predicted capture factors of owscs using the radial basis function neural network and optimized owscs using the genetic algorithm ga liu et al 2020b tom et al 2016 2017 designed a nearshore owsc that could change its own geometry according to the wave conditions therefore yielding satisfactory performances under varying wave conditions meanwhile by tuning the geometry the wave loads acting on the flap could be decreased these studies have provided valuable experimental and numerical data for the design of owscs wherein the height width thickness density damping of pto hinge height location and other parameters of single owsc were optimized however in real sea state applications more than one converter needs to be placed in a wave energy farm and their layouts and configurations significantly affect their overall performance consequently the array optimizations of owscs should be conducted to ensure superior efficiency and to reduce cost in early 2014 renzi et al 2014a b investigated the hydrodynamics and wave power absorptions of a finite array of owscs by developing an inviscid potential flow theory they analyzed several typical fixed layouts and discovered that asymmetrical layouts were less efficient than symmetrical ones subsequently noad and porter 2015 developed a mathematical approach to study several fixed layouts of three or five converters sarkar et al 2016 developed a systematic approach for the prediction and optimization of arrays of owscs which used a statistical emulator to predict the performances of owscs in an array an active learning strategy to investigate regions of interest and a ga to obtain the optimal layouts of owscs next potential flow theory was used to model an array of converters with fixed layouts under random sea states tay and venugopal 2017 and an array of curved owscs in open sea michele and renzi 2019 more recently sharp and dupont 2018 optimized arrays of converters using a ga model involving an analytical hydrodynamic model and a cost model thereby providing an understanding of device layout and spacing as well as valuable experience for subsequent research furthermore lópez ruiz et al 2018 developed an integrated optimization approach to improve the life cycle performance and operational capacity of arrays of wecs with several typical fixed layouts in previous studies most optimizations of owsc arrays pertained to several typical fixed layouts however the optimized results may not be the best because those studied layouts were empirically proposed and were fixed during the investigations in some studies wecs were simplified to cylinders regardless of the wec type to obtain optimized layouts optimization algorithms require numerous cases as the database resulting in extremely high computational time if all cases need to be simulated using potential flow mesh based and mesh free computational fluid dynamics cfd methods thus accurate and fast meta models capable of predicting wave heights in wake regions as well as performances of owscs should be developed the wake effects of the wave dragon wecs beels et al 2010a 2010b cycloidal wecs siegel 2019 and owscs tomey bozo et al 2019 have been previously analyzed however to the best knowledge of the authors no wake models have yet been presented consequently a fully analytical wake model of owscs is first proposed herein for predicting wave height changes in wake regions as well as an energy output model for predicting the performances of owsc arrays subsequently these models are used in differential evolution de algorithms to optimize the converters with random layouts in wave energy farms the geometrical parameters of owscs are difficult to be experimentally tuned additionally multiple wave gauges should be installed in the wave basin to obtain a complete wave height distribution therefore experimentally obtaining a wake model is almost impossible it thus becomes essential to accurately simulate the wave interactions of owscs using numerical techniques in the above mentioned studies the potential flow theory and mesh based cfd methods were primarily adopted however the potential flow theory could solely deal with irrotational fluids for which viscosity was not considered the owscs must be fixed or have small motions which greatly limits the utilization of potential flow theory in investigations of the owscs with violent motions in this study liu and wang 2020 for cfd codes compared with the mesh based methods mesh free methods or particle based methods e g smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph can easily treat violent free surface flows large hydrodynamic loads and complex boundary conditions especially fluid floating boundary conditions liu and wang 2020 khayyer et al 2018a focused on fluid structure interaction simulations that employed mesh free methods specifically sph has been extensively developed and employed to solve ocean and coastal engineering problems such as dam breakings crespo et al 2008 liu et al 2013 wave breakings he et al 2020 and fluid floating interactions khayyer et al 2018b recently researchers schmitt and elsäßer 2017 zhang et al 2018 wei et al 2019 brito et al 2020 have further developed sph for modeling owscs and it has been successfully used to conduct parametric studies and systematic optimizations of owscs liu et al 2020a 2020b in this study the weakly compressible sph approach was utilized additionally dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 which is a hardware accelerated sph solver that can be downloaded from https dual sphysics org was adopted after careful validations in dualsphysics except for the standard sph approach other techniques such as the diffusive term for the continuity equation molteni and colagrossi 2009 and the particle shifting algorithm xu et al 2009 vacondio et al 2013 have also been implemented to enhance the numerical accuracy and stability of sph besides there are also some advanced techniques for sph that are not implemented by dualsphysics antuono et al 2010 developed a novel equation system by applying diffusive terms in both continuity and energy equations wherein a proper state equation was also derived this novel model was named as δ sph which was proved to be more accurate when applied to the problems characterized by energetic and short time dynamics antuono et al 2012 however it required a solution of a renormalization problem for the density gradient costing considerable computational time regarding the boundary conditions ferrand et al 2013 2017 proposed a semi analytical wall boundary condition for solid and open boundaries respectively it performed better than dynamic boundary condition dbc used in dualsphysics however it involved a renormalization problem with higher computational cost optimization algorithms should ideally be applied after the wake model is obtained from the sph results in recent years ga eiben and smith 2003 haupt and ellen 2004 has been extensively utilized to optimize owscs and has exhibited good performance sarkar et al 2016 giassi and göteman 2018 sharp and dupont 2018 lyu et al 2019 liu et al 2020b in this study the differential evolution de algorithm price et al 2005 which is regarded as the improved version of ga was adopted to optimize the owsc arrays the de algorithm and ga are both global search and optimization techniques used to solve problems with multi local extrema points and can process continuous and discrete variables however compared with the conventional ga the de algorithm can converge to global optimal solutions more accurately and quickly in previous studies e g sharp and dupont 2018 when optimizing owsc layouts the farm was meshed up and converters were placed only at the centers of the grids hence random layouts of the owscs could not be optimized this study aims to obtain an alternative solution to solve the aforementioned problem a novel optimization approach for owsc arrays is proposed herein which aims to maximize the total energy output of the wave energy farm firstly the sph model was validated against a three dimensional 3d 1 25 scale owsc model next several cases were simulated using the validated sph model by varying the incoming wave height pto damping and flap width the wave heights in the wake regions of the owscs were analyzed using fast fourier transform fft and the effects of the varying parameters on the wakes were investigated subsequently a fully analytical wake model with respect to wave height pto damping and flap width was established based on the sph results using the least squares method which was used to predict wave height changes in wake regions several additional sph cases were simulated to validate the proposed wake model before conducting the array optimization a model to predict the energy output of a single converter was developed based on wave height pto damping and flap width which was subsequently validated finally the obtained wake and energy output models were utilized in the de algorithm and several optimization scenarios involving different numbers of converters sizes of regions of interest wave heights minimum separation distances or simply called spacing and the number of sample points on the converters in the de algorithm were analyzed the wake model energy output model and optimized layouts and configurations of owsc arrays are shown in the numerical results furthermore a cpu central processing unit based parallel de code was developed using python programming language and is made available for other researchers 2 numerical methods in this section the primary numerical methods used herein are introduced first the wave interactions of owscs are simulated using a sph model specifically the coupled codes of dualsphysics and project chrono an open source engine designed for solving multi physics simulations project chrono 2018 brito et al 2020 subsequently an evaluation method for assessing the performances of the owscs followed by brief descriptions of the wake and energy output models are introduced finally the mathematical theory and processing flowchart of the de code are presented 2 1 sph theory sph is a particle based and fully lagarangian method which discretizes the continuous fluids into a set of independent particles the motions of these particles are governed by the momentum and continuity equations crespo et al 2015 which are respectively expressed as 1 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a π a b a w a b g 2 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b d a b in which v represents the velocity of the fluid particles t is time m and ρ indicate mass and density of the particles respectively p means pressure and g denote the gravitational acceleration the subscripts a and b indicate the target particle and neighboring particles respectively artificial viscosity π is utilized to counter viscosity of the fluids that can meanwhile ensure numerical stability d denotes the diffusive term of the continuity equation proposed by molteni and colagrossi 2009 w is the kernel function and the quantic kernel is adopted in this study crespo et al 2015 π w and d can be respectively written as 3 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b w h e n v a b r a b 0 0 w h e n v a b r a b 0 4 w r r α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 w h e n 0 q 2 5 d a b 2 δ φ r c 0 b ρ b ρ a r a b a w a b r a b 2 m b ρ b where c a b 0 5 c a c b is the mean speed of sound at the locations of particles a and b μ a b r v a b r a b r i j 2 η 2 with η 2 0 01r 2 v a b v a v b and r a b r a r b are the relative velocity and

the target and neighboring particles with r as the real distance α d 21 16πr 3 when in 3d simulations δ φ is a constant coefficient equaling 0 1 c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 is the relative speed of sound when the density of the fluid is ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 meanwhile a state equation is used in the sph model to enforce the water flows to be weakly compressible which describes the relationship between pressure and density of the particles at this time a small change in density can result in a large change in pressure and the state equation crespo et al 2015 is written as 6 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ and γ 7 the c 0 here should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity to keep the density variations theoretically less than 1 simultaneously dynamic boundary condition dbc crespo et al 2007 is utilized to model the solid particles in sph which computes the quantities of the solid particles using the same governing equations as those of the fluid particles however the solid particles will not move according to the computed velocities instead they will remain in their fixed positions fixed boundaries used to model wave basins including basin sidewalls and bed or move according to predefined motions moving boundaries used to model wave makers on one side of the wave basin a piston type wave maker is set up using one layer of moving boundary particles see fig 2 a and second order wave generation theory madsen 1971 is utilized to calculate the time series of motion for the wave maker when the wave maker moves the fluid particles in front of the wave maker will be pushed to generate waves see fig 2 b specifically the wave maker stroke s 0 can be determined by 7 h s 0 2 s i n h 2 k w d s i n h k w d c o s h k w d k w d in which h is the wave height d denotes the water depth k w 2π l is the wave number with l as the wave length next the time series e 0 t of the wave maker movements is given by 8 e 0 t s 0 2 s i n ω t δ h 2 32 d 3 c o s h k w d s i n h 3 k w d 2 m 1 s i n 2 ω t 2 δ where ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the waves and t denotes the wave period δ is the initial phase and m 1 h s 0 on the other side of the wave basin a damping zone is implemented to eliminate the effects of reflected waves in which the velocities of particles reduce according to their positions in each time step for the flaps of the owscs they are modeled as floating boundaries and are assumed to be rigid the hydrodynamic forces by the fluid and constraint forces by the hinge are respectively calculated in sph and project chrono which are then summed up to calculate the total forces acting on the flaps then the motions of the flaps can be solved using the newton s second law of motion advanced particle shifting algorithm xu et al 2009 vacondio et al 2013 is also applied in the sph model and the details of those aforementioned methods can be found in the paper of crespo et al 2015 in addition the time step in sph is dynamically determined depending on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition forcing terms and viscous diffusion terms the variable time step size δt is calculated by 9 δ t c f l m i n δ t f δ t c v δ t f m i n i r f i δ t

or simply called energy output p w henry et al 2018 for owsc arrays they are optimized aiming to maximize their total energy output p tw p w and p tw can be respectively expressed as 10 p w 1 2 ω 2 k w θ w 2 11 p t w i n d p w i in which θ w indicates the flap rotation amplitude in pitch direction n d represents the number of devices in the wave energy farm p w i is the energy output of ith device p w is the time averaged energy output thus its unit is j s 1 or w 2 3 wake and energy output models owscs under different wave heights h and with different pto damping k and flap width w are simulated subsequently the wave heights in the wake regions are analyzed using fft then an analytical wake model in terms of wave height pto damping and flap width is set up based on those simulation results the wake model can predict the wave height changes in the wake regions which is presented in section 4 after validating the sph model and obtaining the simulation results meanwhile for array optimizations a prediction model for the energy output of the owscs is needed to predict the p tw when the wave height pto damping and flap width change therefore an energy output model is built based on the simulation results and is described in section 4 2 4 de algorithm to solve multi real parameter optimization problems de price et al 2005 an evolutionary algorithm was developed by mimicking the natural evolutionary law firstly some candidate solutions or called individuals for the problem were randomly generated constituting the first generation population subsequently mutation crossover and selection occurred on these individuals depending on their adaptabilities resulting in a new generation population after sufficient generations the most adaptable individual in the population could be regarded as the global optimal solution for the optimization problem in this study the de best 1 scheme introduced by tanabe and fukunaga 2014 was adopted for the array optimization of owscs and the corresponding theory and equations are presented as follows the de problem aims to maximize the total energy output p tw of number of n d devices in a wave energy farm by optimizing their layouts x y and configurations k and w specifically different layouts and configurations can result in different wave height distributions in the wave energy farm therefore affecting the total energy output of the owscs wave height changes can be first predicted using the wake model subsequently the total energy output of the owscs can be computed using the energy output model assuming that a wave energy farm has a length of l x width of l y and has n d devices installed in it the layouts of the devices can be randomly determined between 0 l x and 0 l y however to ensure no collisions between the devices and navigation in the farm the devices must be installed away from one another therefore a minimum separation distance is required between the devices labeled as s x and s y along x and y direction respectively the spacing between the devices limits the maximum number of devices in the wave energy farm in de the output dimension of this problem is one i e the total energy output p tw the individuals of de represent the layouts and configurations of owsc arrays which comprise the positions x and y coordinates pto damping k and flap width w of the devices as a result the individual needs four values i e x y k and w to represent one owsc and needs n i 4th values to represent all owscs in the wave energy farm with n i means the structure of the individual the data structure of the individual on computer is presented in fig 3 as shown one individual is indicated by an array that can be categorized into four parts x coordinate y coordinate k and w of the owscs in the wave energy farm the waves propagate along the x direction from left to right at the beginning of de number of n i individuals are randomly generated to be the first generation population wherein n i is commonly within the range 5n i 10n i in this study n i 10n i was used to ensure the population diversity as opposed to the treatment of sharp and dupont 2018 wherein the farm was meshed up and the devices could only be installed at the centers of the grids the devices in this study can be randomly installed anywhere hence the constraints for the individuals were reduced such that the optimization results of this study would be closer to the global optimal solutions after initializing the first generation population the population is categorized into several groups which are processed by different cpu cores the total energy output p tw of the individuals is evaluated using the wake and energy output models meanwhile the constraint values c v are utilized to determine whether and the degree at which the layouts in the individuals satisfy the requirements of the spacing this is accomplished for every individual thereby eliminating the failed individuals the details of p tw and c v calculations are presented in section 5 after the introduction of the wake and energy output models subsequently mutation crossover and selection occur on the individuals to evolve a new generation population the mutation occurs depending on the following equation 12 m u t a c m b c wherein mut denotes the mutated individual a is the corresponding original individual b and c represent two randomly selected individuals from the original population c m denotes the mutation factor which ranges between 0 and 2 and is generally equal to 0 5 next crossover occurs between the original and mutated populations which can be expressed as follows 13 c o r m u t i f r a n d 0 1 c r a o t h e r w i s e in which cor represents the newly generated individual after crossover c r denotes the crossover factor which ranges between 0 and 1 and is often equal to 0 3 mut indicates the corresponding mutated individual of a calculated using eq 12 finally a new generation population can be generated by selecting the better individuals from the original and crossed populations the total energy output of the individuals in the new generation population is assessed next this population undergoes mutation crossover and selection promoting to the next generation population if de reaches the maximum generation of evolution n g which generally is 1000n i the best individual in the pasted generation populations is picked out as the final optimization result table 1 lists the key parameters in de algorithm the overall flowchart of de is depicted in fig 4 a python code package was developed based on geatpy https geatpy com the de code can be divided into four main steps i defining the problem and randomly initializing the first generation population ii dividing the population into several groups for cpu based parallel calculation iii calculating the total energy output using the wake and energy output models as well as the constraint values of each individual iv generating a new generation population by means of mutation crossover and selection of the original population depending on the total energy output calculated in step iii steps ii iv are repeated until the maximum number of generation is reached as a result of this optimization the best individual determined by the largest p tw is selected 3 convergence test and validation of sph in this section the convergence test and validation of the sph model are presented the experimental results for the wave interactions of a 3d 1 25 scale owsc model obtained by wei et al 2015 were used the recorded wave elevations and flap motions were then compared fig 5 shows the experimental setup wherein a 3d wave basin of length 18 m width 4 58 m and height 1 091 m was used initially the water depth d was at 0 691 m on the left side of the basin a piston type wave maker was installed and waves with a period of t 1 2 s and wave height of h 1 0 12 m and t 2 2 s and h 2 0 20 m corresponding to t 1 10 s and h 1 3 m and t 2 10 s and h 2 5 m in full scale model respectively were generated on the right side of the basin a 2 5 m long sloped overtopping porous mesh with an additional 1 2 m long mesh absorber with vertical saw tooth profiled entries was utilized as the wave absorber a 1 25 scale owsc model was placed in the middle of the basin at a distance of 7 92 m from the wave maker the floor of the wave basin stepped up and the actual water depth at the location of the owsc was 0 541 m the flap had the following dimensions 1 04 m width 0 48 m height 0 12 m thickness with a hinge height of 0 16 m from the floor the mass and moment of inertia of the flap were 33 kg and 1 84 kg m2 respectively the center of mass of the flap was 0 16 m above the hinge meanwhile 14 wave gauges were placed in the basin see fig 5 b the locations of the wave gauges are listed in table 2 with the origin at the middle of the wake maker x positive rightward and y positive upward in fig 5 among them the wave elevations at gauges 4 5 and 12 are compared several sph simulations were performed by mimicking the geometrical setup of the experiments the particle size d p in the simulations was varied to conduct a convergence test for wave conditions of t 1 2 s and h 1 0 12 m the particle size d p was varied to 0 04 0 03 0 02 and 0 01 m for wave conditions of t 2 2 s and h 2 0 20 m d p was varied to 0 05 0 04 0 03 and 0 02 m the wave elevations at gauges 4 5 and 12 and the motions of the flaps were compared to analyze the convergence and accuracy of the sph model fig 6 presents the convergence tests and comparisons of wave elevations for gauges 4 5 and 12 between the numerical sph results and the experimental results the coordinates in the experiment and sph were defined as follows the x axis was along the direction of wave propagation and rightward the y axis was along the width of the tank and inward the z axis was along the height of the tank and upward and the rotation angle was positive when the flap pitched toward the land all results presented in fig 5 are converted to full scale as shown in fig 6 a and d the sph and experimental results are in good agreement with each other in particular for cases with d p 0 01 m when wave height h 3 m and d p 0 02 m when wave height h 5 m however the wave elevations at the initial moment for different d p are inconsistent indicating different modeled initial water depths for different d p this is resulted by the round off error when generating particles for example when d p 0 02 m the desired initial water depth is 0 691 m however the actual water depth in the sph is 0 70 m because the precision for generating the particles is 0 02 m furthermore when d p 0 04 m the actual water depth is 0 68 m this phenomenon is also observed in other recorded wave elevations when the differences caused by water depths are ignored the profiles and amplitudes of wave elevations for gauge 4 show a slight sensitivity to d p and nearly converge when d p 0 01 m h 0 12 m and d p 0 02 m h 0 20 m resulting in h d p of 12 and 10 respectively for time histories of wave elevations at gauges 5 and 12 which were installed near the owsc at the seaside and leeside respectively strong nonlinear water surface profiles with higher order harmonic waves are observed those higher order harmonic waves couple with the incoming waves and transmitted waves however small discrepancies in the experimental and numerical layouts can result in significant changes in the positions where the superposition occurred therefore causing that the wave amplitudes of experimental results are higher than those of sph results at gauges 5 and 12 thus the sph and experimental results presented in fig 6 b c e and f are not in good agreement in addition wave gauge 12 was placed at the leeside of the flap and the wave amplitudes therein should ideally be lower than those of gauge 4 due to the energy capture by the flap however the waves therein are higher due to variations in the basin floor fig 7 shows the convergence tests and comparisons of flap rotations between numerical sph and experimental results as shown the flap rotations in the sph simulations agree well with those from the experimental results the changes in d p result in slight changes in the flap rotations as the wave height increases the flap rotations become more vigorous owing to larger wave forces in total the sph and experimental results of wave elevations at gauge 4 and the flap rotations agree well and the wave elevations at gauges 5 and 12 agree satisfactorily with those from the experimental results additionally the sph results converge when h d p approaches the value of 10 consistent with the findings of altomare et al 2017 therefore dualsphysics can be utilized to model 3d owscs and the particle size d p in the sph model is set to h 10 meanwhile the other parameters in the sph model were empirically determined specifically the smoothing length r was estimated to 1 5d p a symplectic algorithm was utilized as the integration scheme and the time step size in the sph was calculated according to the courant friedrich levy condition cfl number was 0 2 forcing terms and viscous diffusion terms crespo et al 2015 the coefficient of artificial viscosity was α 0 01 the simulations were performed on an nvidia geforce rtx 2080ti gpu when d p 0 02 m a total of approximately 4 5 billion particles were simulated and the time required to complete a simulation of 12 s was approximately 40 h 4 wake and energy output models this section presents the wake and energy output models obtained from the numerical results of several sph simulations with varying incoming wave heights pto damping and flap widths both models were validated against additional sph cases all the sph results were converted to full scale and the analytical models were established for full scale owscs 4 1 proposal and validation of the wake model ten sph cases were simulated with varying incoming wave heights pto damping and flap widths for ocean engineering modeling the wave excitation force is the dominant force and is usually converted to prototype scale by using the froude scaling law wei et al 2015 in this study the scaling factor of length was 25 when the scaling factor of density was 1 the scaling factor of time can be calculated as 5 subsequently the scaling factors of wave height pto damping flap width and power can be calculated as 25 1 953 125 25 and 78 125 respectively in the full scale sph simulations the wave basins were measured to be 500 m length 500 m width 17 5 m depth and the floor of the wave basins were flat the owsc was placed in the middle of the basin 100 m away from the wave maker initially the water depth was 13 35 m and the incoming wave heights were between 3 75 and 7 5 m the wave period was 10 s the last 25 m in the numerical wave basin was modeled as a wave absorber the damping of the pto system was between 1 95 107 and 5 86 107 n s rad 1 the flap widths varied from 20 to 35 m the configurations of the simulated sph cases are listed in table 3 subsequently fft was utilized to analyze the wave heights in the wake regions h r as shown in fig 8 and then normalized by dividing them by the incoming wave heights h as wave height changes primarily occurred within 275 m at the leeside of the flap only parts of the flow fields are presented in fig 8 the shapes of the wake regions are mainly caused by wave diffractions as shown when the waves pass by the flaps the wave heights at the leeside of the flaps decrease significantly owing to the energy capturing by the flaps which is known as wave deficit hereafter the reduced waves gradually recover as the waves propagate caused by the wave height gradients between the reduced or affected waves and the unaffected waves meanwhile the deficit regions resemble triangles that widens with the distance to the flap in addition on both sides of the deficit region the wave heights are greater than those of the incoming waves possibly caused by the wave run up that occurs during the interactions between waves and flaps and these are known as wave surplus hereafter the width of the surplus regions does not widen significantly with the propagation however the wave heights in the surplus regions decrease owing to the gradients between the affected and unaffected waves the shapes of the wake regions exhibit slight sensitivities to the wave height pto damping and flap width however the recovery speeds of the wake regions significantly depend on those parameters in particular the larger the wave height and pto damping as well as the smaller the width the faster the affected regions recover among them the wave height affects the recovery speed the most this is because for large waves the energy carried by the waves is sufficiently large to quickly smooth out the uneven wave height distributions in the wake regions in fig 8 the wave deficit gaussian centers represent that there have the smallest wave heights in the slice with the same value of x and the wave surplus gaussian centers mean that there have the largest wave heights to attain larger energy output the owscs should be placed near the wave surplus gaussian centers as much as possible as previously mentioned wave diffraction and run up during the wave interactions of owsc lead to wave deficit and wave surplus in the wake regions by using h r to denote the wave heights in the wake regions the wave height changes can be calculated as δh h h r subsequently the δh comprises δh d and δh s which are the wave deficit and wave surplus respectively in fig 8 the black lines indicate the wave height change percentage δh h in the wake region in terms of y at different x values the black lines show that as y increases from negative to positive the wave height change percentage exhibits an upward downward upward and downward in that order as x increases those black lines flatten gradually showing trends of straight lines the wave height change percentage lines resemble a combination of four gaussian functions among which two are utilized to present the wave deficit δh d and the remaining to present the wave surplus δh s subsequently a simplified wave height change percentage model is shown in fig 9 wherein h r δh δh d and δh s are depicted assuming that the wave deficit δh d is positive and the wave surplus δh s is negative δh can be computed as δh d δh s herein δh d and δh s are described using two gaussian functions the wave height change percentage δh h can be written as 14 δ h h 1 a 0 a 1 x a 6 e y a 2 a 3 x 2 2 a 4 a 5 x 2 e y a 2 a 3 x 2 2 a 4 a 5 x 2 a 7 a 8 x e y a 9 a 10 x 2 2 a 11 a 12 x 2 e y a 9 a 10 x 2 2 a 11 a 12 x 2 wherein the former two gaussian functions are used to model the wave deficit and the latter two to model the wave surplus coefficients a 0 a 12 are assumed to be polynomial functions of the wave height pto damping and flap width e denotes the natural logarithm as shown in figs 8 and 9 and eq 14 the gaussian centers and variations are assumed to be linearly related to x coefficients a 0 a 12 are assumed to be of the following form 15 a i b 7 h b 4 b 1 b 8 k 25 b 5 b 2 b 0 w b 6 b 3 b 9 i 0 1 12 where b 0 b 9 are constant coefficients the multivariate least squares method was utilized to determine the constant coefficients in eq 14 and then the coefficients in eq 15 finally the obtained wake model of wave height change percentage is shown in table a1 next the configurations of the tested 10 sph cases were input into the wake model to predict the wave height change percentage that were then compared with the numerical results of sph as presented in fig 10 for those 10 cases the obtained wake model agrees well with the sph numerical results for the wave height change percentage near the flaps the wake model slightly under predicts the wave deficit however this does not greatly affect the optimization results because the devices are placed with a spacing from each other as the distances to the flaps in the x direction increase the wave height change percentage decreases and the wake model agrees well with the sph numerical results with the continuous increase in the distances the wake model slightly over predicts the wave deficit indicating higher wave energy loss predicted by the wake model and that the optimization results would be conservative as shown in fig 10 the wave height changes near the front and back boundaries of the wave basin increase possibly caused by the boundary particles in the sph these variations were not considered in the wake model moreover hit rate q is adopted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the obtained wake model expressed as 16 q 1 n p 1 n l p 100 w i t h l p 1 δ h p δ h p δ h p d q o r δ h p δ h p w q 0 o t h e r w i s e where d q and w q are the two thresholds set as 0 25 and 0 085 max δ h h min δ h h respectively δ h and δ h denote the real and predicted wave height changes respectively n denotes the total number of comparison points which is 200 for each sph case in this study after determining d q and w q an accurate boundary can be computed as shown in fig 11 most points locate within the accurate boundary and the hit rate q is 91 4 indicating good agreement between the wake model and sph for relatively large values of δ h h see fig 11 corresponding to the wake regions near the flaps in fig 10 the predicted wave deficit is smaller than the true ones for relatively small values of δ h h the predicted wave deficit agrees well with the true ones however some of them are larger than the true ones resulting in higher wave energy loss in the wake region corresponding to wake regions distant from the flaps in fig 10 simultaneously when the predicted values are zero the true values range between 0 05 and 0 12 which can be explained by the boundary particles in sph in general the obtained wake model can accurately predict the wave height change percentage in the wake regions of those 10 cases to further evaluate the generalization ability of the obtained wake model three additional sph cases were simulated and compared with the predicted values the configurations of those three sph cases are listed in table 4 subsequently the sph numerical results and the predicted values by the wake model are presented in fig 12 furthermore the comparisons between the sph results and the wake model predicted values are shown in fig 13 for new cases the wake model provides accurate predictions of wave height change percentage in the wake regions and the hit rate q is 90 0 4 2 proposal and validation of the energy output model the energy output p w of the owscs in cases cw1 cw10 and cg1 cg3 were computed using eq 10 and are listed in table 5 subsequently an energy output model is established based on the results of cw1 cw10 by assuming that p w is a polynomial function in terms of wave height pto damping and flap width eq 15 the obtained model can then be written as 17 p w 1986 h 14 90 2 87 17 56 k 25 1 87 10 6 0 819 9 34 10 7 w 44 71 4 82 4 44 10 6 the predicted p w of the owscs using eq 17 are also listed in table 5 and compared with the true values from the sph cases the error in table 5 is defined as p w predicted p w true p w true 100 as shown the average prediction error of cases cw1 cw10 is 5 6 and that of cases cg1 cg3 is 4 0 moreover the hit rate or accuracy eq 16 of the energy output model can be calculated as 85 indicating the acceptable prediction ability of the energy output model and the feasibility of the model in predicting the p w of the owscs 4 3 discussions regarding wake and energy output models as shown in eq 17 for the wave height investigated herein 3 75 7 5 m the energy output of the owscs increases with the wave height until the wave height reaches 14 90 m consequently it can be concluded that the larger the wave height the higher the energy output of the owscs will be therefore in the layouts of owsc arrays the latter converters should be placed near the wave surplus gaussian centers of the former ones meanwhile as the increase of flap width within the predefined range 20 35 m p w always increases when k 4 68 107 n s rad 1 p w increases as the increase of k after that p w decreases as shown in figs 8 10 and 12 the positions of the gaussian centers for the wave surplus and wave deficit are linearly related to x and the slopes of those lines exhibit slight sensitivities to the wave height pto damping and flap width assuming that α d and α s are the angles between wave deficit gaussian center line and the x axis as well as the wave surplus gaussian center line and the x axis see fig 9 respectively α d and α s can then be calculated using arctan a 3 and arctan a 10 respectively with a 3 and a 10 as the coefficients of the proposed wake model table 6 lists the values of a 2 w α d a 7 w and α s of the wake models and corresponding mean and standard errors std for cases cw1 cw10 and cg1 cg3 as shown these parameters change slightly depending on the wave height pto damping and flap width especially for a 7 w and α s their std mean values are 0 17 and 0 02 implying that they can be specified as their own mean values when roughly determining the wave surplus gaussian center lines subsequently the latter owscs should be placed near the wave surplus gaussian centers as much as possible thereby simply optimizing the owsc array layouts 5 optimization of owsc arrays the obtained wake and energy output models were utilized in the de algorithm to optimize the owsc arrays several scenarios were considered and analyzed to ascertain the feasibility of the proposed approach by varying numbers of devices in the wave energy farm n d s1 s s2 lengths of farm in x l x s3 s s4 lengths of farm in y l y s5 s s6 incoming wave heights h s7 s s8 spacing in x s x s9 s s10 spacing in y s y s11 s s12 and number of sample points selected on the converters in de n s s13 s s14 the configurations of the tested scenarios are listed in table 7 wherein s was regarded as the basic configuration and the others were derived from s the spacing in the basic configuration was attributed as approximately twice the flap width ensuring a net spacing of flap width when the spacing was varied to maintain the maximum devices that can be installed in the farm l x and l y were also simultaneously varied to ensure that the ratios l x s x and l y s y remain unchanged see s9 s12 in table 7 5 1 calculating energy output and constraint value prior to optimizing the owsc arrays issues regarding the calculation of the total energy output of the owscs p tw and the method to determine the constraint value c v of each individual in de needed to be confirmed first when calculating the p tw of the owscs x y k and w are first separated from the individual array on computer and the devices are saved in the ascending order of x for the former devices their wake regions will cover the latter ones therefore the wake models of the former devices should be solved and the resulted wave height changes on the other devices behind them should be computed owsc is a long structure whose width is greatly larger than thickness resulting in that the wave heights at different locations on the surface at the leeside would differ with each other therefore a total of n s sample points are picked out on the surface see fig 14 the enlarged owsc is evenly divided into n s 1 segments where the local wave height changes are predicted i e δh i 1 δh i 2 and δh i ns and averaged to represent the nominal wave height of the whole owsc 18 δ h i 1 n s δ h i 1 δ h i 2 δ h i n s subsequently because the wave height changes are caused by the energy capture of the former owscs and according to the linear wave theory and the relation between wave energy and wave height e h 2 with e as the wave energy jts 145 2 2013 the total wave height change caused by all former owscs can be computed as follows next the final wave heights of the owscs can be computed the wave heights pto damping and flap width are then input into the energy output model to determine p tw as for the constraint value of the individual c v it will be negative if the individual satisfies the requirements of the spacing and the value is computed as the summation of the separation distances between the devices that are greater than the spacing if the individual does not satisfy the requirements c v becomes positive and the value is computed as the summation of the separation distances smaller than the spacing 5 2 results and discussions the optimized layouts of the owsc arrays of the scenarios are presented in fig 15 wherein their widths can be measured according to the scale shown at bottom right corner of fig 15 it is observed that staggered layouts occur frequently ensuring that the latter owscs are less affected by the wave deficits of the former ones the wake and energy output models indicate that pto damping and flap width of the owscs both directly and indirectly affect p tw simultaneously thus the effects of pto damping and flap width on array configurations are complicated and implicit however regarding pto damping the optimized damping is approximately 4 68 107 n s rad 1 precisely corresponding to the maximum energy output shown in eq 17 thereby implying that k 4 68 107 n s rad 1 can be directly adopted for the owscs as a constant value regarding flap width fig 15 shows that the widths of the former owscs in the wave energy farm are 20 m whereas those of the last column of the owscs are 35 m this is because the former owscs affect the incoming wave heights of the latter ones and the flap width significantly affects the recovery speed of the wake region therefore small width of the former owscs is utilized to reduce the wake effects on the latter owscs as for the last column of the owscs no owscs are installed behind them hence a large width of 35 m can be utilized to capture more wave power additionally the total energy outputs per unit width of the owsc arrays of the scenarios are presented in fig 16 from fig 16 s1 s and s2 wherein the number of devices is varied it is observed that as n d increases the total energy output per unit width of the owscs slightly decreases caused by the latter owscs placed in the wake regions of the former ones however the total energy output of the wave energy farm increases during this process as the farm size increases in both x and y direction fig 16 s and s3 s6 the total energy output per unit width also increases this might be explained as that for larger farms the separation distances between the devices can be larger thereby resulting in smaller wake effects between the devices and thereby a higher energy output furthermore the energy output model demonstrates that p w is positively related to the wave height therefore when wave height increases the total energy output per unit width of the owscs significantly increases as shown in fig 16 s7 s and s8 meanwhile similar to s3 s6 the energy output per unit width in s9 s12 also increases as the increases of s x and s y caused by the smaller wake effects between the owscs therefore it can be safely said that the larger the wave energy farm and the farther the owscs the higher the energy output will be fig 16 s13 s and s14 vary the number of sample points selected from the flaps in de n s as shown the performances of owsc arrays can hardly be enhanced by increasing n s however larger n s can lead to considerably higher computational time therefore n s 5 is utilized and recommended in this study regarding the computational time of those scenarios both the number of devices n d and number of sample points n s can affect the computational time when n s 5 it costs 0 25 0 67 and 2 68 h for cases with n d 10 15 and 20 respectively when n d 15 it costs 0 25 0 83 and 3 19 h for cases with n s 5 10 and 15 respectively it can be seen that the computational time rapidly increases as the increases of n d and n s however these computational times are acceptable and optimizing owsc array layouts is now feasible through the wake model and de based approach in total the optimized energy output per unit width of the owsc arrays positively correlates to the wave energy farm size incoming wave height and device spacing as well as negatively correlates to the number of devices staggered layouts with narrow and wide owscs respectively placed in the front and back of the wave energy farm are efficient meanwhile a constant pto damping of 4 68 107 n s rad 1 is recommended for the owscs 6 conclusions in this study a novel optimization approach for owsc arrays was proposed to maximize their total energy output specifically numerical simulations of owscs with variable wave heights pto damping and flap width were performed using sph based on the simulation data an analytical wake model and an energy output model of owsc were proposed using the proposed models and de algorithm layouts pto damping and flap width of owscs in a wave energy farm were optimized the self compiled de code has been made available for other researchers the following conclusions are drawn 1 a gaussian function based analytical wake model is proposed and has accuracies of over 90 compared with sph results a polynomial function based analytical energy output model is proposed and performs well with accuracies of over 85 2 generally the recovery speed of wave height in the wake region is positively related to the incoming wave height and pto damping but it is negatively related to flap width the shape of the wake region exhibits a slight sensitivity to incoming wave height pto damping and flap width 3 the gaussian center lines of wave surplus in the wake region of an owsc can be simply determined which start from 2 8 w away from the flap center and at 22 78 to the wave propagation direction the downstream owscs are recommended to be placed near these two lines 4 within the investigated ranges of the parameters the larger the incoming wave height and flap width are the higher will be the energy output of the owsc the energy output increases first and then decreases as the pto damping increases 5 staggered layouts of the owscs should be employed whereas narrow and wide owscs should be placed in the front and back of the wave energy farm respectively a constant value of k 4 68 107 n s rad 1 is recommended for the owscs 6 typically the total energy output per unit width of the optimized owsc arrays is positively related to the wave energy farm size incoming wave height and device spacing and is negatively related to the number of devices in this study the wave period was set as a constant and was regarded as the average wave period interacting with the studied owscs furthermore wave reflections were ignored in the current wake model to reduce the wave basin size in sph thereby the computational time despite these limitations the numerical results of this study provide new approaches and reference data for the array optimization of owscs in future studies the wave period will be included in the analytical wake model moreover a sensitivity analysis of the parameters e g wave period wave height pto damping flap size and hinge height will be conducted and the most influential parameters could be determined to simplify the analytical wake model the owsc array will also be optimized countering the construction cost besides dualsphysics was utilized in this study to simulate the wave interactions of owscs which was also used by brito et al 2020 and showed good agreements with experimental results however only first order or second order waves could be generated in present dualsphysics which were weakly nonlinear waves resulting in relatively low fidelity of the sph model consequently dualsphysics can be developed to generate higher order waves e g

21289,the aquaculture plant with a mooring system is a relatively novel concept compared with the traditional offshore structures and plenty of numerical models have been proposed to investigate its hydrodynamic behavior in this study the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by several existing numerical models is estimated based on the validation data in the published researches the traditional method is employed to calculate the statistics of the model bias factor and the bootstrap method is used to estimate the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor due to the small sample size in addition the reliability analysis of mooring line is conducted considering the model uncertainty for a case study the results indicate that the bootstrap method can effectively predict the uncertainty of the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor and the model uncertainty can significantly affect the reliability of the mooring line the bootstrap confidence interval of the reliability index can be calculated to achieve a more reasonable assessment of the failure probability for the designers therefore the characterization of the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor is of paramount importance for the reliability based design of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system keywords model uncertainty reliability analysis bootstrap method 1 introduction the safety of the aquaculture plant consisting of a cylindrical floater and a flexible net cage with its mooring system plays a vital part in the development of the world fishery industry during the reliability based design of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the model uncertainty may be one dominant source of the epistemic uncertainty the analysis of the model uncertainty was conducted in several previous researches for the civil engineering e g castaldo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the geological engineering e g phoon and kulhawy 2005 zhang et al 2015

razenejad and guedes soares 2015 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016 and 2018 for instance razenejad and guedes soares 2015 estimated the model uncertainty in the short term hydrodynamic behavior for oscillating water column devices uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016 2018 quantified the model uncertainty of the mathematical models for the calculation of the wave induced response of a semisubmersible based wind turbine for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the estimation of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models has received little attention therefore it is necessary to conduct the quantification of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical tools in the past several decades many validated numerical models were proposed for the hydrodynamic analysis of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system however the numerical models in the past researches are simplified based on some approximations or assumptions and the effectiveness of numerical models is obtained based on the qualitative evaluation which leads to the incomplete performance evaluation thus it is not very clear how good the numerical simulation tools are for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system due to the imperfections and idealizations of the numerical models e g xu et al 2013 and the potential high sensitivity of the structural reliability to the model uncertainty the investigation of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models is of paramount importance for the prediction of the reliability of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system however the validation data for the model bias factor in the published researches are limited which may result in a significant statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor since the exact computation of the bootstrap estimates is quite feasible for the small sample size fisher and hall 1991 the bootstrap method can be used to investigate the uncertainty of the statistics the bootstrap method introduced by efron 1979 is a widely used way to estimate the sampling distribution of the statistics from the replicate data sets generated by the random resampling of the original data set and there are many researches on the application of the bootstrap method in the hydrology engineering e g noguchi et al 2011 hu et al 2013 zhu et al 2016

uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor can be quantified by the bootstrap method the aim of this study is to quantify the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models for the reliability based design of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the flow chart of the procedure for assessing the model uncertainty during the probabilistic analysis is illustrated in fig 1 this study is organized as follows firstly the numerical models for analyzing the hydrodynamic performance of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system are reviewed in section 2 after that the adopted methods to evaluate the deterministic statistics of the model bias factor and the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor are provided in section 3 and then section 4 presents the results of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models and performs a case study for the reliability analysis of the mooring line considering the model uncertainty finally some conclusions are listed in the last section 1 1 review of numerical models of aquaculture plant and its mooring system for providing a deep understanding of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquaculture plant and mooring system

system for the aquaculture plant under current through an aqua fe program cui et al 2013 employed the finite element method for the prediction of the motion and the mooring line tension of an aquaculture plant system under the action of waves and current xu et al 2013 used the lumped mass method to investigate the motion of net cage and the tension on mooring lines in waves ito et al 2014 employed the linear hydroelastic theory to obtain the motion of a net structure and estimate the mooring line tension the model uncertainty in the mooring line tension under the action of current

quality of interest for the safety of the aquaculture plant the comparison of the motion between the physical model tests and the numerical simulations under wave loads in cui et al 2013 xu et al 2013 and ito et al 2014 was conducted in this study in summary table 1 lists the validation data in the published numerical models as a basis for assessing the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system 2 methodology to assess the model uncertainty 2 1 traditional method for calculating the model uncertainty in this study the hydrodynamic characteristic of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system measured from the physical experiments is considered as a true value and the experimental uncertainty is not considered the model bias factor is used to characterize the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by the existing numerical models according to moan 2008 the model bias factor θ is defined as 1 θ x exp x num where x exp is the hydrodynamic characteristic observed by the physical experiments and x num is the hydrodynamic characteristic calculated by the numerical models the observations of the model bias factor can be assumed to be independent and identically distributed calculating the model bias factor based on the observations of model validation data from the published literature the statistical characteristics of the model bias factor are obtained as follows for n observations θ i i 1 2 n the mean value of θ is 2 θ 1 n i 1 n θ i the standard deviation of θ is 3 σ θ 1 n 1 i 1 n θ i θ n 2 and the coefficient of variation cov of θ is 4 cov θ σ θ θ the bias dispersion and variability of the numerical models can be indicated through the mean value standard deviation and cov of θ bai 2003 2 2 bootstrap method for calculating the statistical uncertainty in model bias factor a small sample size of the model bias factor may lead to a large uncertainty in the statistics of the model bias factor the nonparametric bootstrap method is adopted in this study to predict the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor for hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system based on the limited observations in the published researches as the original sample set the bootstrap samples are obtained through the random sampling with replacement to furnish the uncertainty information on the statistics of the model bias factor the main procedures of the characterization of the model uncertainty by the bootstrap method are shown in fig 2 and the details are presented as follows firstly generate a series of the bootstrap samples from the original sample set of the model bias factor and the size of the bootstrap samples is denoted as n through the random sampling with replacement the occurrence of each observation in a bootstrap sample may be zero one or more than one secondly calculate the sample statistics of the model bias factor for the individual bootstrap samples after that the sample statistics of the jth bootstrap sample j 1 2 n including the mean value standard deviation and cov can be calculated by 5 b j 1 n i 1 n b j i σ j 1 n 1 i 1 n b j i b j 2 cov j σ j b j and then estimate the bootstrap statistics of the sample mean value and standard deviation of the model bias factor the bootstrap statistics of the sample mean value are derived by 6 θ m e a n 1 n j 1 n b j σ θ 1 n 1 j 1 n b j 1 n j 1 n b j 2 cov θ σ θ θ m e a n the bootstrap statistics of the sample standard deviation are calculated by 7 σ θ m e a n 1 n j 1 n σ j σ σ θ 1 n 1 j 1 n σ j 1 n j 1 n σ j 2 cov σ θ σ σ θ σ θ m e a n finally the probability distribution of the sample mean value and standard deviation of the model bias factor is obtained by the kernel density estimation kde silverman 1986 pagan and ullah 1999 in this study a normal distribution is selected as the kernel function and the ksdensity in matlab software is employed to conduct the kernel density estimation 2 3 empirical bootstrap confidence interval of the reliability considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor the reliability analysis can be conducted and the empirical bootstrap confidence interval of the structural reliability can be obtained by the bootstrap method for each bootstrap sample of the model bias factor the model uncertainty can be assumed to be log normally distributed nejad et al 2014 horn et al 2019 the reliability considering the model uncertainty calculated by the traditional method r 0 can be obtained as an initial estimate of the true reliability r then the difference δ is defined as 8 δ r 0 r and the 100 1 α confidence interval of δ is estimated as δ 1 α 2 δ α 2 satisfying that 9 p r 0 r δ 1 α 2 1 α 2 p r 0 r δ α 2 α 2 thus eq 9 can be written as 10 p δ 1 α 2 r 0 r δ α 2 1 α p r 0 δ α 2 r r 0 δ 1 α 2 1 α after calculating the reliability r corresponding to each bootstrap sample the bootstrap difference δ can be written as 11 δ r r 0 as demonstrated by the bootstrap principle the probability distribution of δ can be employed as an approximation to that of δ then the 100 1 α empirical bootstrap confidence interval can be written as r 0 δ α 2 r 0 δ 1 α 2 3 results and discussions with respect to the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models for the aquaculture plant and mooring system the statistics of the model bias factor are calculated by the traditional method and the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor is estimated by the bootstrap method 3 1 model uncertainty obtained by traditional method to illustrate the collection of the validation data fig 3 shows the scatter plot of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension for the aquaculture plant based on the observations in the published researches in table 1 then the statistics of the model bias factor including the mean value the standard deviation std and the coefficient of variation cov in the drag force on and the volume reduction of aquaculture net the mooring line tension and the motion of float collar are listed in table 2 the results indicate that the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by different numerical models has a non negligible difference and it is essential to assess the model uncertainty under different environmental loads for the reliability analysis for the drag force on the aquaculture net balash et al 2009 has the most significant underestimation in average since the corresponding mean value of the model bias factor is the largest among the numerical models and it is greater than 1 0 however kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 may averagely overestimate the drag force on the aquaculture net to the most extent lader et al 2003 has the largest dispersion of the model bias factor and the smallest dispersion occurs in turner et al 2017 for the volume reduction of the aquaculture net the most significant bias occurs in klebert et al 2015 the mooring line tension under the current load calculated by decew et al 2010 and cui et al 2013 may be averagely overestimated however huang et al 2006 tends to significantly underestimate the mooring line tension and it has a more remarkable average deviation of the model prediction the largest scattering of the model bias factor occurs in huang et al 2006 and the smallest scattering can be seen in cui et al 2013 in addition ito et al 2014 has a more significant dispersion of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension under wave loads in average ito et al 2014 tends to significantly underestimate the mooring line tension whereas cui et al 2013 and xu et al 2013 show a slight underestimation of the mooring line tension under wave loads however the largest scattering occurs in ito et al 2014 and the smallest scattering is observed in cui et al 2013 for the motion of float collar ito et al 2014 appears to averagely underestimate the heave and surge motion and averagely overestimate the pitch motion significantly however the size of the samples for assessing the model uncertainty in many published researches is very small which may induce a significant variation of the statistics of the model bias factor although a larger sample size will provide more information on the model uncertainty it is not realistic to further conduct sufficient cases for the model validation therefore it is of vital importance to propose a suitable method to predict the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor employing the limited observations in the published researches 3 2 statistical uncertainty in model bias factor by bootstrap method for the bootstrap analysis the size of the bootstrap samples can be selected as 10 000 most and knabe 2010 luo et al 2013 and the convergence analysis indicates that 10 000 bootstrap samples are able to obtain the reliable and accurate results of the statistics of interest the statistics of the model bias factor for the individual bootstrap samples are derived and then the bootstrap statistical properties of the sample mean value and standard deviation can be estimated based on the collection of the sample statistics of the bootstrap samples the kernel density estimation can be adopted to obtain the probability distribution of the sample mean value and standard deviation of the model bias factor figs 4 and 5 show the probability distribution of the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension in xu et al 2013 the results obtained from the kernel density estimation agree quite well with those calculated by the empirical distribution and the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor show a trend of the left skewed distribution the bootstrap statistical parameters of the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor in hydrodynamic characteristics are listed in table 3 the results indicate that the bootstrap mean of the mean value of the model bias factor matches well with the mean value of the model bias factor in table 2 which demonstrates that the characteristics of the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor can be properly estimated by the bootstrap method in addition the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor has the same order of magnitude as that of the uncertainty assumed in the reliability analysis toft and sørensen 2011 nejad et al 2014 the significant bootstrap standard deviation of the mean value and standard deviation reflects a large variation of the statistics of the model bias factor due to the small sample size which will further lead to the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor for hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system and the additional information on the uncertainty in the statistics of the model bias factor in hydrodynamic characteristics is derived for instance the bootstrap cov of the standard deviation of the model bias factor of the mooring line tension under the current load in cui et al 2013 is slightly larger than that in huang et al 2006 which is different from the variation results of the model bias factor in table 2 and the bootstrap cov of the standard deviation is significantly larger than that of the mean value of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension the bootstrap standard deviation of the standard deviation of the model bias factor has the same order of magnitude as that of the mean value of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension which provides more information on the random variability of the model imperfection and may largely affect the safety factor in terms of the model uncertainty therefore it is necessary to include the effect of the limited samples of the model bias factor on the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor for hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system 3 3 case study for reliability analysis of mooring line considering the model uncertainty the effect of the model uncertainty in the mooring line tension shown in xu et al 2013 on the reliability of mooring line is investigated for a case study for the mooring line the ultimate limit state function g x associated with the tension failure is expressed by 12 g x r χ s where r is the resistance χ is the model uncertainty s is the load effect with regard to the fatigue failure of mooring line the fatigue limit state function g x is expressed as 13 g x δ χ m d δ χ m v 0 t l k γ 1 m b a m where δ is the miner s sum at failure χ is the model uncertainty d is the long term fatigue damage of mooring line v 0 is the load cycle per unit time a b are the scale and shape parameters of weibull distribution which can be employed to represent the probability distribution of stress range г is the gamma function k m are the intercept and slope parameters in the s n curve respectively t l is a period of service time for the structural reliability analysis the model bias factor in the mooring line tension is assumed to be log normally distributed the first order reliability method form can be used to perform the reliability analysis hou et al 2017 the influence of the uncertainty in the sample statistics of the model bias factor on the structural reliability is characterized by using the bootstrap method after the convergence analysis for the reliability evaluation 10 000 bootstrap samples are used to calculate the statistical properties including the mean value standard deviation and cov of the reliability of mooring line since the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor obtained from the bootstrap analysis are uncertain see figs 4 and 5 the reliability of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state is a stochastic variable then the confidence interval rather than a single fixed value of the reliability of mooring line can be calculated using the method mentioned in section 3 3 3 4 ultimate limit state in this section the resistance of the fiber rope in the mooring line is assumed to be normally distributed with the mean value of 15 kn and the cov of 0 05 the probability distribution of the extreme tension on the mooring line can be assumed as the generalized extreme value distribution hou et al 2019 with the shape scale and location parameters of 0 106 1 470 9 427 based on the reliability analysis the reliability index of the mooring line is 2 308 when the model uncertainty is not included when considering the model uncertainty in section 4 1 the reliability index of the mooring line decreases to 1 965 correspondingly the failure probability of the mooring line increases from 1 05 to 2 47 this provides strong evidence that the model uncertainty has a remarkable effect on the failure probability of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state based on the bootstrap method the mean value of the reliability index of the mooring line is 1 993 which agrees well with the result concerning the model uncertainty by the traditional method and the bootstrap method also provides the additional information on the random reliability index of the mooring line including the standard deviation of 0 148 and the cov of 0 074 the pdf of the reliability index of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state is shown in fig 6 the reliability index of the mooring line varies between 1 65 and 2 6 and the probability distribution of the reliability index of the mooring line is right skewed this indicates that it may be not appropriate to assume the probability distribution of the reliability index of the mooring line as a normal distribution through the bootstrap analysis the confidence intervals of the reliability index and failure probability of the mooring line corresponding to different confidence levels are listed in table 4 the range of the confidence interval of the failure probability of the mooring line becomes wider with the increase of confidence levels at the 99 confidence level the upper bound of the failure probability can be about 6 98 times the lower bound while the mean value of the failure probability is about 3 75 times the lower bound moreover the ratio of the range width of the confidence interval of the failure probability to the mean value of the failure probability is 1 08 1 26 and 1 59 corresponding to the 90 95 and 99 confidence levels respectively thus it is beneficial to include the reliability confidence interval of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state for the mooring system design of the aquaculture plant 3 5 fatigue limit state referring to hou et al 2018 the random variables for the fatigue reliability analysis of the mooring line are listed in table 5 and the form is employed to calculate the time dependent fatigue reliability of the mooring line the bootstrap statistical properties of the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line are listed in table 6 the standard deviation of the reliability index decreases gradually for a longer service time while the cov of the reliability index increases significantly and fig 7 shows the probability distribution of the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line the reliability index of the mooring line under the fatigue limit state follows a right skewed probability distribution similar to that under the ultimate limit state and the variation range of the reliability index for 20 years of service is the widest meaning that the uncertainty in the probability of exceedance in terms of the maximum fatigue damage is the most significant fig 8 presents the effect of the model uncertainty on the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line the fatigue failure probability of 0 1 and 1 corresponds to the reliability index of 3 09 and 2 33 the results demonstrate that the reliability of the mooring line under the fatigue limit state considering the model uncertainty will be conservative for the design of the mooring line considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor the 90 confidence interval of the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line through the bootstrap analysis is also shown in fig 8 it can be found that the reliability index of the mooring line considering the deterministic statistics of the model bias factor falls in the reliability confidence interval considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor thus it is essential to include the model uncertainty into the fatigue reliability analysis and estimate the uncertainty in the probability of fatigue failure of the mooring line in addition the mean value of the reliability index of the mooring line in table 6 matches well with that concerning the model uncertainty obtained in section 4 1 which is shown with the red circle line of fig 8 and the uncertainty of the reliability index of the mooring line is obtained through the bootstrap analysis different from the results considering the deterministic statistics of the model bias factor the bootstrap method provides the bootstrap confidence interval of the fatigue reliability index considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor which enables the engineer to predict the probability of failure more rationally the confidence intervals of the reliability index and failure probability of mooring line under the fatigue limit state corresponding to different confidence levels are shown in fig 9 fig 10 presents the width of the confidence interval of the failure probability of the mooring line the results indicate that at the same confidence level there has a much wider confidence interval of the fatigue failure probability of the mooring line for a longer service time and the confidence level largely affects the upper bound of the reliability index of the mooring line under the fatigue limit state therefore it is worth investigating the selection of the confidence level from a practical point of view for the probabilistic engineering design 4 conclusions this study investigates the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by several existing numerical models for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system based on the collection of the published validation data as the sample sets of the model bias factor the deterministic statistics of the model bias factor and the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor are evaluated by the traditional method and the bootstrap method respectively to investigate the effect of the model uncertainty the reliability of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state is quantified as a case study several conclusions are listed as follows it is of great necessity to estimate the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics of the existing numerical models especially when the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics is significant and the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor show a trend of the left skewed distribution the bootstrap analysis indicates that the small sample size has a significant influence on the bootstrap cov of the standard deviation of the model bias factor considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor the probability distribution of the reliability index of the mooring line is right skewed rather than the normal distribution in addition the model uncertainty should be included in the reliability analysis under the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state and the bootstrap confidence interval of the reliability index is beneficial for conducting a more reasonable assessment for the reliability based design of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the uncertainty in the probability distribution of the model bias factor in hydrodynamic characteristics for the offshore engineering structures will be further investigated credit authorship contribution statement guo hai dong conceptualization methodology supervision funding acquisition

the uncertainty of the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor and the model uncertainty can significantly affect the reliability of the mooring line the bootstrap confidence interval of the reliability index can be calculated to achieve a more reasonable assessment of the failure probability for the designers therefore the characterization of the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor is of paramount importance for the reliability based design of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system keywords model uncertainty reliability analysis bootstrap method 1 introduction the safety of the aquaculture plant consisting of a cylindrical floater and a flexible net cage with its mooring system plays a vital part in the development of the world fishery industry during the reliability based design of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the model uncertainty may be one dominant source of the epistemic uncertainty the analysis of the model uncertainty was conducted in several previous researches for the civil engineering e g castaldo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the geological engineering e g phoon and kulhawy 2005 zhang et al 2015

razenejad and guedes soares 2015 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016 and 2018 for instance razenejad and guedes soares 2015 estimated the model uncertainty in the short term hydrodynamic behavior for oscillating water column devices uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016 2018 quantified the model uncertainty of the mathematical models for the calculation of the wave induced response of a semisubmersible based wind turbine for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the estimation of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models has received little attention therefore it is necessary to conduct the quantification of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical tools in the past several decades many validated numerical models were proposed for the hydrodynamic analysis of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system however the numerical models in the past researches are simplified based on some approximations or assumptions and the effectiveness of numerical models is obtained based on the qualitative evaluation which leads to the incomplete performance evaluation thus it is not very clear how good the numerical simulation tools are for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system due to the imperfections and idealizations of the numerical models e g xu et al 2013 and the potential high sensitivity of the structural reliability to the model uncertainty the investigation of the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models is of paramount importance for the prediction of the reliability of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system however the validation data for the model bias factor in the published researches are limited which may result in a significant statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor since the exact computation of the bootstrap estimates is quite feasible for the small sample size fisher and hall 1991 the bootstrap method can be used to investigate the uncertainty of the statistics the bootstrap method introduced by efron 1979 is a widely used way to estimate the sampling distribution of the statistics from the replicate data sets generated by the random resampling of the original data set and there are many researches on the application of the bootstrap method in the hydrology engineering e g noguchi et al 2011 hu et al 2013 zhu et al 2016

system for the aquaculture plant under current through an aqua fe program cui et al 2013 employed the finite element method for the prediction of the motion and the mooring line tension of an aquaculture plant system under the action of waves and current xu et al 2013 used the lumped mass method to investigate the motion of net cage and the tension on mooring lines in waves ito et al 2014 employed the linear hydroelastic theory to obtain the motion of a net structure and estimate the mooring line tension the model uncertainty in the mooring line tension under the action of current

quality of interest for the safety of the aquaculture plant the comparison of the motion between the physical model tests and the numerical simulations under wave loads in cui et al 2013 xu et al 2013 and ito et al 2014 was conducted in this study in summary table 1 lists the validation data in the published numerical models as a basis for assessing the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system 2 methodology to assess the model uncertainty 2 1 traditional method for calculating the model uncertainty in this study the hydrodynamic characteristic of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system measured from the physical experiments is considered as a true value and the experimental uncertainty is not considered the model bias factor is used to characterize the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by the existing numerical models according to moan 2008 the model bias factor θ is defined as 1 θ x exp x num where x exp is the hydrodynamic characteristic observed by the physical experiments and x num is the hydrodynamic characteristic calculated by the numerical models the observations of the model bias factor can be assumed to be independent and identically distributed calculating the model bias factor based on the observations of model validation data from the published literature the statistical characteristics of the model bias factor are obtained as follows for n observations θ i i 1 2 n the mean value of θ is 2 θ 1 n i 1 n θ i the standard deviation of θ is 3 σ θ 1 n 1 i 1 n θ i θ n 2 and the coefficient of variation cov of θ is 4 cov θ σ θ θ the bias dispersion and variability of the numerical models can be indicated through the mean value standard deviation and cov of θ bai 2003 2 2 bootstrap method for calculating the statistical uncertainty in model bias factor a small sample size of the model bias factor may lead to a large uncertainty in the statistics of the model bias factor the nonparametric bootstrap method is adopted in this study to predict the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor for hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system based on the limited observations in the published researches as the original sample set the bootstrap samples are obtained through the random sampling with replacement to furnish the uncertainty information on the statistics of the model bias factor the main procedures of the characterization of the model uncertainty by the bootstrap method are shown in fig 2 and the details are presented as follows firstly generate a series of the bootstrap samples from the original sample set of the model bias factor and the size of the bootstrap samples is denoted as n through the random sampling with replacement the occurrence of each observation in a bootstrap sample may be zero one or more than one secondly calculate the sample statistics of the model bias factor for the individual bootstrap samples after that the sample statistics of the jth bootstrap sample j 1 2 n including the mean value standard deviation and cov can be calculated by 5 b j 1 n i 1 n b j i σ j 1 n 1 i 1 n b j i b j 2 cov j σ j b j and then estimate the bootstrap statistics of the sample mean value and standard deviation of the model bias factor the bootstrap statistics of the sample mean value are derived by 6 θ m e a n 1 n j 1 n b j σ θ 1 n 1 j 1 n b j 1 n j 1 n b j 2 cov θ σ θ θ m e a n the bootstrap statistics of the sample standard deviation are calculated by 7 σ θ m e a n 1 n j 1 n σ j σ σ θ 1 n 1 j 1 n σ j 1 n j 1 n σ j 2 cov σ θ σ σ θ σ θ m e a n finally the probability distribution of the sample mean value and standard deviation of the model bias factor is obtained by the kernel density estimation kde silverman 1986 pagan and ullah 1999 in this study a normal distribution is selected as the kernel function and the ksdensity in matlab software is employed to conduct the kernel density estimation 2 3 empirical bootstrap confidence interval of the reliability considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor the reliability analysis can be conducted and the empirical bootstrap confidence interval of the structural reliability can be obtained by the bootstrap method for each bootstrap sample of the model bias factor the model uncertainty can be assumed to be log normally distributed nejad et al 2014 horn et al 2019 the reliability considering the model uncertainty calculated by the traditional method r 0 can be obtained as an initial estimate of the true reliability r then the difference δ is defined as 8 δ r 0 r and the 100 1 α confidence interval of δ is estimated as δ 1 α 2 δ α 2 satisfying that 9 p r 0 r δ 1 α 2 1 α 2 p r 0 r δ α 2 α 2 thus eq 9 can be written as 10 p δ 1 α 2 r 0 r δ α 2 1 α p r 0 δ α 2 r r 0 δ 1 α 2 1 α after calculating the reliability r corresponding to each bootstrap sample the bootstrap difference δ can be written as 11 δ r r 0 as demonstrated by the bootstrap principle the probability distribution of δ can be employed as an approximation to that of δ then the 100 1 α empirical bootstrap confidence interval can be written as r 0 δ α 2 r 0 δ 1 α 2 3 results and discussions with respect to the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by numerical models for the aquaculture plant and mooring system the statistics of the model bias factor are calculated by the traditional method and the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor is estimated by the bootstrap method 3 1 model uncertainty obtained by traditional method to illustrate the collection of the validation data fig 3 shows the scatter plot of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension for the aquaculture plant based on the observations in the published researches in table 1 then the statistics of the model bias factor including the mean value the standard deviation std and the coefficient of variation cov in the drag force on and the volume reduction of aquaculture net the mooring line tension and the motion of float collar are listed in table 2 the results indicate that the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by different numerical models has a non negligible difference and it is essential to assess the model uncertainty under different environmental loads for the reliability analysis for the drag force on the aquaculture net balash et al 2009 has the most significant underestimation in average since the corresponding mean value of the model bias factor is the largest among the numerical models and it is greater than 1 0 however kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 may averagely overestimate the drag force on the aquaculture net to the most extent lader et al 2003 has the largest dispersion of the model bias factor and the smallest dispersion occurs in turner et al 2017 for the volume reduction of the aquaculture net the most significant bias occurs in klebert et al 2015 the mooring line tension under the current load calculated by decew et al 2010 and cui et al 2013 may be averagely overestimated however huang et al 2006 tends to significantly underestimate the mooring line tension and it has a more remarkable average deviation of the model prediction the largest scattering of the model bias factor occurs in huang et al 2006 and the smallest scattering can be seen in cui et al 2013 in addition ito et al 2014 has a more significant dispersion of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension under wave loads in average ito et al 2014 tends to significantly underestimate the mooring line tension whereas cui et al 2013 and xu et al 2013 show a slight underestimation of the mooring line tension under wave loads however the largest scattering occurs in ito et al 2014 and the smallest scattering is observed in cui et al 2013 for the motion of float collar ito et al 2014 appears to averagely underestimate the heave and surge motion and averagely overestimate the pitch motion significantly however the size of the samples for assessing the model uncertainty in many published researches is very small which may induce a significant variation of the statistics of the model bias factor although a larger sample size will provide more information on the model uncertainty it is not realistic to further conduct sufficient cases for the model validation therefore it is of vital importance to propose a suitable method to predict the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor employing the limited observations in the published researches 3 2 statistical uncertainty in model bias factor by bootstrap method for the bootstrap analysis the size of the bootstrap samples can be selected as 10 000 most and knabe 2010 luo et al 2013 and the convergence analysis indicates that 10 000 bootstrap samples are able to obtain the reliable and accurate results of the statistics of interest the statistics of the model bias factor for the individual bootstrap samples are derived and then the bootstrap statistical properties of the sample mean value and standard deviation can be estimated based on the collection of the sample statistics of the bootstrap samples the kernel density estimation can be adopted to obtain the probability distribution of the sample mean value and standard deviation of the model bias factor figs 4 and 5 show the probability distribution of the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension in xu et al 2013 the results obtained from the kernel density estimation agree quite well with those calculated by the empirical distribution and the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor show a trend of the left skewed distribution the bootstrap statistical parameters of the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor in hydrodynamic characteristics are listed in table 3 the results indicate that the bootstrap mean of the mean value of the model bias factor matches well with the mean value of the model bias factor in table 2 which demonstrates that the characteristics of the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor can be properly estimated by the bootstrap method in addition the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor has the same order of magnitude as that of the uncertainty assumed in the reliability analysis toft and sørensen 2011 nejad et al 2014 the significant bootstrap standard deviation of the mean value and standard deviation reflects a large variation of the statistics of the model bias factor due to the small sample size which will further lead to the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor for hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system and the additional information on the uncertainty in the statistics of the model bias factor in hydrodynamic characteristics is derived for instance the bootstrap cov of the standard deviation of the model bias factor of the mooring line tension under the current load in cui et al 2013 is slightly larger than that in huang et al 2006 which is different from the variation results of the model bias factor in table 2 and the bootstrap cov of the standard deviation is significantly larger than that of the mean value of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension the bootstrap standard deviation of the standard deviation of the model bias factor has the same order of magnitude as that of the mean value of the model bias factor in the mooring line tension which provides more information on the random variability of the model imperfection and may largely affect the safety factor in terms of the model uncertainty therefore it is necessary to include the effect of the limited samples of the model bias factor on the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor for hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system 3 3 case study for reliability analysis of mooring line considering the model uncertainty the effect of the model uncertainty in the mooring line tension shown in xu et al 2013 on the reliability of mooring line is investigated for a case study for the mooring line the ultimate limit state function g x associated with the tension failure is expressed by 12 g x r χ s where r is the resistance χ is the model uncertainty s is the load effect with regard to the fatigue failure of mooring line the fatigue limit state function g x is expressed as 13 g x δ χ m d δ χ m v 0 t l k γ 1 m b a m where δ is the miner s sum at failure χ is the model uncertainty d is the long term fatigue damage of mooring line v 0 is the load cycle per unit time a b are the scale and shape parameters of weibull distribution which can be employed to represent the probability distribution of stress range г is the gamma function k m are the intercept and slope parameters in the s n curve respectively t l is a period of service time for the structural reliability analysis the model bias factor in the mooring line tension is assumed to be log normally distributed the first order reliability method form can be used to perform the reliability analysis hou et al 2017 the influence of the uncertainty in the sample statistics of the model bias factor on the structural reliability is characterized by using the bootstrap method after the convergence analysis for the reliability evaluation 10 000 bootstrap samples are used to calculate the statistical properties including the mean value standard deviation and cov of the reliability of mooring line since the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor obtained from the bootstrap analysis are uncertain see figs 4 and 5 the reliability of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state is a stochastic variable then the confidence interval rather than a single fixed value of the reliability of mooring line can be calculated using the method mentioned in section 3 3 3 4 ultimate limit state in this section the resistance of the fiber rope in the mooring line is assumed to be normally distributed with the mean value of 15 kn and the cov of 0 05 the probability distribution of the extreme tension on the mooring line can be assumed as the generalized extreme value distribution hou et al 2019 with the shape scale and location parameters of 0 106 1 470 9 427 based on the reliability analysis the reliability index of the mooring line is 2 308 when the model uncertainty is not included when considering the model uncertainty in section 4 1 the reliability index of the mooring line decreases to 1 965 correspondingly the failure probability of the mooring line increases from 1 05 to 2 47 this provides strong evidence that the model uncertainty has a remarkable effect on the failure probability of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state based on the bootstrap method the mean value of the reliability index of the mooring line is 1 993 which agrees well with the result concerning the model uncertainty by the traditional method and the bootstrap method also provides the additional information on the random reliability index of the mooring line including the standard deviation of 0 148 and the cov of 0 074 the pdf of the reliability index of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state is shown in fig 6 the reliability index of the mooring line varies between 1 65 and 2 6 and the probability distribution of the reliability index of the mooring line is right skewed this indicates that it may be not appropriate to assume the probability distribution of the reliability index of the mooring line as a normal distribution through the bootstrap analysis the confidence intervals of the reliability index and failure probability of the mooring line corresponding to different confidence levels are listed in table 4 the range of the confidence interval of the failure probability of the mooring line becomes wider with the increase of confidence levels at the 99 confidence level the upper bound of the failure probability can be about 6 98 times the lower bound while the mean value of the failure probability is about 3 75 times the lower bound moreover the ratio of the range width of the confidence interval of the failure probability to the mean value of the failure probability is 1 08 1 26 and 1 59 corresponding to the 90 95 and 99 confidence levels respectively thus it is beneficial to include the reliability confidence interval of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state for the mooring system design of the aquaculture plant 3 5 fatigue limit state referring to hou et al 2018 the random variables for the fatigue reliability analysis of the mooring line are listed in table 5 and the form is employed to calculate the time dependent fatigue reliability of the mooring line the bootstrap statistical properties of the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line are listed in table 6 the standard deviation of the reliability index decreases gradually for a longer service time while the cov of the reliability index increases significantly and fig 7 shows the probability distribution of the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line the reliability index of the mooring line under the fatigue limit state follows a right skewed probability distribution similar to that under the ultimate limit state and the variation range of the reliability index for 20 years of service is the widest meaning that the uncertainty in the probability of exceedance in terms of the maximum fatigue damage is the most significant fig 8 presents the effect of the model uncertainty on the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line the fatigue failure probability of 0 1 and 1 corresponds to the reliability index of 3 09 and 2 33 the results demonstrate that the reliability of the mooring line under the fatigue limit state considering the model uncertainty will be conservative for the design of the mooring line considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor the 90 confidence interval of the fatigue reliability index of the mooring line through the bootstrap analysis is also shown in fig 8 it can be found that the reliability index of the mooring line considering the deterministic statistics of the model bias factor falls in the reliability confidence interval considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor thus it is essential to include the model uncertainty into the fatigue reliability analysis and estimate the uncertainty in the probability of fatigue failure of the mooring line in addition the mean value of the reliability index of the mooring line in table 6 matches well with that concerning the model uncertainty obtained in section 4 1 which is shown with the red circle line of fig 8 and the uncertainty of the reliability index of the mooring line is obtained through the bootstrap analysis different from the results considering the deterministic statistics of the model bias factor the bootstrap method provides the bootstrap confidence interval of the fatigue reliability index considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor which enables the engineer to predict the probability of failure more rationally the confidence intervals of the reliability index and failure probability of mooring line under the fatigue limit state corresponding to different confidence levels are shown in fig 9 fig 10 presents the width of the confidence interval of the failure probability of the mooring line the results indicate that at the same confidence level there has a much wider confidence interval of the fatigue failure probability of the mooring line for a longer service time and the confidence level largely affects the upper bound of the reliability index of the mooring line under the fatigue limit state therefore it is worth investigating the selection of the confidence level from a practical point of view for the probabilistic engineering design 4 conclusions this study investigates the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics by several existing numerical models for the aquaculture plant and its mooring system based on the collection of the published validation data as the sample sets of the model bias factor the deterministic statistics of the model bias factor and the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor are evaluated by the traditional method and the bootstrap method respectively to investigate the effect of the model uncertainty the reliability of the mooring line under the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state is quantified as a case study several conclusions are listed as follows it is of great necessity to estimate the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics of the existing numerical models especially when the model uncertainty in hydrodynamic characteristics is significant and the mean value and the standard deviation of the model bias factor show a trend of the left skewed distribution the bootstrap analysis indicates that the small sample size has a significant influence on the bootstrap cov of the standard deviation of the model bias factor considering the statistical uncertainty in the model bias factor the probability distribution of the reliability index of the mooring line is right skewed rather than the normal distribution in addition the model uncertainty should be included in the reliability analysis under the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state and the bootstrap confidence interval of the reliability index is beneficial for conducting a more reasonable assessment for the reliability based design of the aquaculture plant and its mooring system the uncertainty in the probability distribution of the model bias factor in hydrodynamic characteristics for the offshore engineering structures will be further investigated credit authorship contribution statement guo hai dong conceptualization methodology supervision funding acquisition
