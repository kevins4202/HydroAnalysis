2125,droughts are among the most socio economically costly natural phenomenon while most of the related research has focused on drought as a hazard it is essential to go beyond such practice and utilize hazard information in integration with vulnerability and resilience we put forth a multi dimensional high resolution assessment of drought risk in pakistan on a national scale to this end we utilize a drought risk index dri based on integrated drought hazard dhi drought vulnerability dvi and drought resilience drei indices we further employ geospatial techniques to identify and pinpoint statistically significant clustering in the form of hot and cold spots higher and lower values concentration respectively to the best of our knowledge this is a preliminary effort to engage the state of the art space time pattern mining technique for the simultaneous spatial temporal dynamics investigation of droughts we observed varying north south geographical distributions in dhi across the country with higher drought intensities in southern regions while a sizeable spatial drought risk disparity is evident across pakistan the worst dri results are seen in balochistan followed by sindh notably around one third of the country is identified as the hot spot with the highest drought risk which ascertains a grave situation under global warming our comprehensive results provide more insights to prepare for drought mitigation adaptation measures and systematic impact evaluation in the face of environmental changes keywords droughts geospatial modeling risk analysis geographic patterns pakistan data availability the data used in this paper is freely available and all the resources are mentioned within the paper 1 introduction there is a global consensus that droughts are among the most socio economically expensive hazards worldwide spatial temporal shifts in droughts have multi scaler e g local national regional and global consequences for both human and natural systems cook et al 2020 almost all climate belts experience significant impacts of droughts on socio economic development and ecological systems byakatonda et al 2018 expressly droughts affect water supply agricultural yields production of energy and soil moisture resulting in severe impacts on societies basso ritchie 2014 islam et al 2022 khoshnazar et al 2021 liu et al 2019 from 1900 to 2019 3 billion people have been affected by droughts this has led to usd1 75 1012 economic damages and 11 million deaths em dat 2020 yujie liu chen 2021 this situation shows the gravity of droughts as one of the costliest natural hazards wu et al 2022a as anthropogenic activities based climate change continues the impacts of droughts are further expected to worsen in developing countries that are vulnerable to droughts ipcc 2021 yujie liu chen 2021 under these circumstances proper drought monitoring profiling and assessment to support informed decision making and resource allocation to mitigate drought associated risks become imperative the conceptual comprehension of droughts is tricky due to disparities in procedural measurements observational parameters and inconsistency in climatic situations dracup et al 1980 while there is no consensus on the inclusive and precise mathematical definition of droughts in general terms it is described as a water deficiency compared to normal situations which encompasses all types of drought lloyd hughes 2014 more precisely the combination of anomalies in precipitation and temperature referred to as meteorological drought leads to soil moisture deficit known as agricultural drought and a lack of water in lakes and streams defined as hydrological drought khoshnazar et al 2021 this description however can be distinguished based on operational and conceptual aspects mishra singh 2010 here the operational perspective reflects how frequent severe and long the drought is for a given return period on the other hand the conceptual viewpoint represents droughts in relative terms such as a drought event being a long and dry spell in addition to meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts some scholars and institutions also represent socio economic drought this is described as the conditions when water resource systems fail to meet water demands association of droughts with economic goods i e water demand and supply ams 2004 mishra singh 2010 in recent decades droughts have gained significant attention among scholars due to their frequent occurrence globally aghakouchak et al 2014 b√∂hnisch et al 2021 byakatonda et al 2018 checchi robinson 2013 hina et al 2021 mondol et al 2021 qiu 2010 van dijk et al 2013 the primary emphasis of these studies has been drought as a hazard however it is essential for corrective decision making prioritization and resources allocation to go further beyond such practice and utilize hazard information in integration with vulnerability and resilience which results in a more reliable outcome khoshnazar et al 2021 sajjad et al 2020a shahid behrawan 2008 while such evaluation might require additional efforts to quantify all three aspects of risk i e hazard vulnerability and resilience the resultant product would progressively provide much more detailed information to end users such as relevant government authorities risk practitioners specialists in disaster risk mitigation and non government organization while droughts have continuously been affecting pakistan resulting in severe impacts they are also among the major factors behind the stagnant economic growth of the country dawn 2022 the 1998 2002 drought is known to be the worst to hit the country since its independence in 1947 this drought affected 3 3 million people and 30 million livestock other impacts included loss of farming related jobs deteriorated physical health and malnutrition among children the centre for strategic and contemporary research cscr 2018 the united nations in its recent global outlook report lists pakistan among the most drought hit countries across the globe united nations convention to combat desertification united nations convention to combat desertification unccd 2022 recently pakistan received 25 lesser rainfall during the monsoon season of 2018 with balochistan province receiving 45 and sindh province receiving 70 below average precipitation due to this situation 1 2 million in balochistan and 3 million people in sindh were affected united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha 2019 the prevalence of droughts in an agrarian society significantly impacts the yield of different crops which can consequently compromise the demand and supply of agri products hussain et al 2022 regardless of the gravity of the drought situation in pakistan studies related to drought risk in pakistan are insufficient the existing ones mainly focus on drought as a hazard and provide small scale assessments which do not provide a national outlook of drought risk along with national level decision making and policy development additionally the existing literature on droughts in pakistan considerably lacks in identifying spatial temporal heterogeneities in drought risk integrating hazard vulnerability and resilience relatedly while the provided information is not comprehensive in the context of drought risk the absence of higher resolution administrative level assessment makes it difficult to identify localized patterns although pakistan is among the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change ipcc 2022 kreft et al 2016 there has not been any assessment to provide a high resolution national scale assessment of drought risk in this country it is imperative to have such an assessment to drive informed decision making and drought planning the current knowledge gap hinders devising appropriate action plans and effective resource allocation to build resilience against droughts in pakistan hence it is imperative to carry out research to support the country s efforts regarding drought risk reduction and adaptation in view of the above this study leverages multi source and interdisciplinary data integrates several geo information models and statistical approaches i e spatial autocorrelation local indicators of spatial association space time patterns mining etc and accounts for hazard vulnerability and resilience to provide a comprehensive high resolution assessment on drought risk in pakistan at a national scale in order to obtain drought hazard the well known precipitation and temperature based drought index di standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which is well known for its utilization as a meteorological di is employed in this paper khoshnazar et al 2021 in this context our main objectives are described as 1 the national level drought risk index estimation based on hazard vulnerability and resilience 2 evaluating high resolution spatial distributions of drought risk and its components and 3 spatial patterns and hot spots identification of drought risk and its components using spatial distributional models while the results from this study will have important implications for characterizing priority intervention areas and informed decision making to drive mitigation and adaptation efforts useful references for effective policy responses will be provided to enhance the overall resilience of pakistan against such hazards similarly the integrated approach adopted in this paper to account for all aspects of risk i e hazard vulnerability and resilience would contribute to the knowledge body in this field 2 methodology this section discusses the methodology applied to calculate our drought risk index dri which is achieved through an integration of the drought hazard index dhi drought vulnerability index dvi and drought resilience index drei all of which are discussed in the following subsections in details following the computation of dri comprehensive high resolution thematic maps are produced for the spatial distribution of the aforementioned indices for the sake of effective results communication in particular we employ well known spatial modeling techniques including the global moran s i based spatial autocorrelation to evaluate geographical patterns e g dispersed random or clustered and the local indicators of spatial association lisa to identify and pinpoint statistically significant clustering in the form of hot higher values concentration and cold spots lower values concentration both of these models are applied at a 95 confidence interval i e p 05 in addition this study represents the application of space time pattern mining derived emerging hot cold spots identification via accounting for both spatial and temporal elements to advance our understanding of high resolution spatial temporal dynamics of drought hazards in pakistan 2 1 case of pakistan pakistan is a developing nation in south asia with 225 million people covering an area of 881 913 km2 its latitude is 30 3 n and its longitude is 69 3 e indicating that pakistan is situated in the northern hemisphere the country is among the most prone countries to disasters and the impacts of climate change ipcc 2021 among these disasters one of the most frequently occurring and socio economically devastating is drought while the droughts associated effects are staggering globally pakistan is no exception for an agrarian country with one quarter population living in poverty severe water scarcity and food insecurity issues poor institutional capabilities and lower disaster resilience droughts are significant threats to people and ecosystems jamil 2019 nabi et al 2019 sajjad 2021 due to global warming induced increment in temperature the frequency and severity of droughts in pakistan are rising this situation further deteriorated due to lesser rainfall and the adverse effects of el nino ali et al 2021 hina et al 2021 for instance there was 25 percent lesser rainfall in pakistan in 2018 with sindh and balochistan provinces southern regions receiving the lowest 70 and 45 percent below average respectively conditions like this make these provinces more vulnerable to the drought phenomenon consequently 5 million people were impacted due to drought in 2018 ndc 2019 similarly the rainfall deficit led drought in pakistan from 1999 to 2003 affected 2 2 million people caused 143 deaths and resulted in usd 384 million in damages em dat 2020 another recent drought in 2019 due to the combined effect of el nino and decreased amount of rainfall during the monsoon season impacted 4 7 million people and caused severe food shortage related challenges in sindh province 2 2 drought risk index dri the applied drought risk index dri is obtained following the risk assessment framework put forth by sajjad and chan 2019 and the drought risk assessment framework introduced by khoshnazar et al 2021 at the tehsil level a sub administrative division under the district government in pakistan where localized planning and decision making take place this method takes a system approach and considers risk as the intervention between hazard vulnerability and resilience of the system in this order we first calculate dhi dvi and drei each of which is explained in the subsections below these indices are normalized and their values vary from 0 to 1 while 0 depicts the lowest hazard and vulnerability dhi and dvi and they rise as their values get higher the worst value is 1 for drei this is vice versa meaning 0 shows the lowest and 1 depicts the highest resilience the best value is 1 accordingly dri is defined as the geometric mean of dhi dvi and 1 drei as follows dri d h i d v i 1 d r e i 1 3 as fig 1 shows to obtain dri we need to calculate dhi dvi and drei here a brief description of each is provided while they are discussed in depth in the next sections 2 3 2 5 dhi dhi is calculated using drought index di information indicating the historical drought situation of each cell with a specific value dvi dvi is obtained through the weighted aggregation of the different socio economic agricultural environmental and infrastructural indicators drei drei is calculated as the average of its factors drei is obtained as the average of the different economic institutional and social factors interested readers are referred to khoshnazar et al 2021a for more detailed information on dri calculation the methodology is applied for all cells of the tehsil level map providing us with a spatially distributed dataset of dri which varies between 0 the lowest risk and 1 the highest risk table 1 2 2 1 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei is a well known precipitation and temperature based di it is obtained by employing the method of the standardized precipitation index spi spi utilizes the precipitation data as the input while spei requires the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet vicente serrano et al 2010 spi introduced by mckee et al 1993 is obtained as explained below based on a dataset of ongoing long term precipitation 30 years or more a time scale for monthly data 3 6 9 12 24 or 48 months is specified then each precipitation data set is fitted into a distribution function mostly selected as gamma after determining the probability of the precipitation based on the historical records the probability of all precipitation data points is computed and applied along with an approximation of the inverse normal to find the precipitation deviation for a standard normal distribution wu et al 2022b for spei calculation the precipitation values are replaced by the difference between precipitation and pet gu et al 2019 we used spei with three and six month time steps hereafter referred to as spei03 and spei06 respectively which are suitable for agricultural drought monitoring khoshnazar corzo perez diaz et al 2021 vicente serrano 2006 in this regard the global netcdf file of spei03 and spei06 available in spatial resolution of 0 5 are employed we used the data between january 2000 december 2018 which is the last available data spei global drought monitor 2021 then we employed pakistan s tehsil level map n 433 to calculate the spei values equal to the average of spei values within the boundary of each administrative division 2 3 drought hazard index dhi as an index dhi summarizes the complex concept of droughts information into a value that sends a message and big picture to users especially policy makers joint research centre european commission 2008 the current subsection explains how dhi is calculated based on di values to conclude the historical variation of droughts in a given place as a number dhi is a composite indicator of two variables both are calculated based on the drought index di here spei information these two variables are associated with drought categories and the probability of occurrence for each category as is explained below to calculate the dhi for each cell in the tehsil level map computation of di is a prerequisite subsection 2 2 1 we employ the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei as our di explained in the previous subsection based on the di values we determine drought events as the literature suggests brito et al 2018 diaz et al 2020a khoshnazar et al 2021a di 0 is taken as the threshold to identify drought events then a drought event starts as the value of di gets equal to or lower than the threshold i e s p e i 0 that is the start point of low drought and ends as the value rises over the threshold drought duration is the number of months between the start and the end of droughts gu et al 2020 please note that this threshold i e s p e i 0 is the start point of dry conditions values of s p e i 0 represent the drought condition suggested by mckee et al 1993 and tong et al 2018 meanwhile we follow a conditional approach not an absolute approach for dhi calculation which means lower spei values are associated with severer drought categories table 2 afterwards according to table 2 drought events are labelled as low l moderate m severe s and extreme e for each of these four categories i e l m s and e we calculate the probability of occurrence as follows p r o b a b i l i t y o f o c c u r r e n c e n l t e where nl is the number of events of each label and te is the total number of drought events the jenks natural break method minimizes within class variances makes them as similar as possible and maximizes the variance between groups makes data classes as different as possible the advantage of this method is that it identifies real classes within the data that is why the literature suggests khoshnazar et al 2021a nasrollahi et al 2018 this method to find the rating of each category accordingly due to its ability to determine the best arrangement of values in different classes we applied the jenks natural break method to break the probability of occurrence of each category into four ratings in this research the obtained drought category and rating provide us with two values employed to calculate dhi the values are weights dw based on drought category l m s and e and ratings dr based on the very low low high and very high probability of occurrence as shown in table 2 khoshnazar et al 2021a nasrollahi et al 2018 the approach of allocating values 1 2 3 and 4 to weights dw follows the one proposed by becker et al 2017 to allocate values 1 2 3 and 4 to dw we consider dhi as the composite indicator weighted arithmetic average of dw and dr becker et al 2017 dw is an important measure that captures the influence of dr on dhi let 1 2 3 and 4 show the level of impact of each category on dhi from lowest to highest influence respectively and considering that higher dhi values show the worse cases obviously a low drought category l will have the lowest impact on dhi i e d w 1 and an extreme drought category e will have the highest impact on dhi i e d w 4 then dw values will be 1 2 3 and 4 for l m s and e categories respectively it should be noted that the same way of reasoning is incorporated to allocate values to the ratings dr afterwards dhi is calculated as as follows d h i ld r ld w md r md w sd r sd w ed r ed w where ldr and ldw represent the rating and weight for the low category drought respectively mdr and mdw represent similar values for the moderate drought and sdr and sdw for the severe drought category finally edr and edw are the ratings and weights determined for the extreme drought category eventually the calculated values for dhi are normalized between 0 and 1 employing the min max normalization approach an advantage of the min max normalization approach is its ability to preserve the relationships among the original data values hence even after the normalization process the extreme drought risk areas remain untouched as the normalized data is with the same scale it should be noted that all raw values of dhi before normalization vary between 10 the best possible raw dhi value and 40 the worst possible raw dhi value which means there aren t any outlier values the drawback of min max normalization approach for dhi hence it is reasonable to use this normalization approach in order to gain more accuracy we also split the overall period i e 2000 2018 into two time windows including 2000 2009 decade 1 d1 and 2010 2018 decade 2 d2 accordingly we calculate six dhi datasets involving spei03 and spei06 for the period 2000 2018 and the two time windows these resultant dhi are represented by t03 and t06 for the entire drought analysis period i e 2000 2018 based on three and six month steps respectively d103 and d106 for the first decade i e 2000 2009 based on three and six month steps respectively and d203 and d206 for the second decade i e 2010 2018 based on three and six month steps respectively the same terminology 03 and 06 is used for the overall drought risk assessment based on three and six month steps 2 4 drought vulnerability index dvi by definition vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected by a natural hazards event such as droughts flooding and landslides among many others liu chen 2021 hence in this study we take vulnerability as the propensity of an area of interest i e tehsil to disproportionally get affected by droughts in pakistan for the computation of dvi the initial and one of the most critical factors is the selection of indicators the selected indicators in the context of dvi must reflect the vulnerable characteristics of an area in terms of collective socio economic agricultural environmental and infrastructure aspects liu chen 2021 therefore based on the literature scale of this study and data availability we complied with the list of indicators as presented in fig 2 for population density pd we used the gridded population of the world version 4 gpw 2021 data for 2020 that estimates the human population density number of persons per square kilometer night time light ntl data determine lights generated by human settlements gas flares fires and illuminated marine vessels and strongly correlate with energy consumption and economic activities zhang et al 2013 accordingly ntl can be taken as an indicator of infrastructure development to obtain ntl we used the consistent and corrected nighttime light ccnl dataset in 2013 obtained from the defense meteorological program operational line scan system dmsp ols version 4 data ccnl 2020 reflecting artificial lights the data are represented in a 1000 m resolution soil workability sw comprises physical hindrances to cultivation and restrictions to cultivation imposed by texture clay mineralogy fischer et al 2008 this data describes soil limitations for plant growth in a qualitative manner using four classes including no or slight limitations class1 moderate limitations class2 sever limitations class3 and very severe limitations class4 the four classes are normally rated between 80 and 100 of the growth potential class1 60 80 class2 40 60 class3 and 40 class4 values of 1 2 3 and 4 are allocated to class1 class2 class3 and class4 respectively we used global agro ecological zones assessment for agriculture gaez data for sw fischer et al 2008 soil water capacity swc indicates soil water holding capacity on a two minute grid cell we classified soil based on this dataset into four classes as follows class1 low swc 25 mm class2 moderate 25 100 mm class3 high 100 200 mm and class4 very high 200 mm we allocated 1 2 3 and 4 to class1 class2 class3 and class4 respectively for swc we used the united states department of agriculture usda 1998 data top soil ph tsp and sub soil ph ssp are representatives of the acidity and alkalinity of the soil and give the soil reaction of topsoil and subsoil respectively these factors categorize the soil ph into five ranges each with a specific agricultural significance as table 3 represents these five ranges construct three classes including class1 the best class class2 and class3 the worst class then values of 1 2 and 3 are allocated to class1 class2 and class3 respectively for tsp and ssp we used harmonized world soil database version 1 2 and food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao data nachtergaele et al 2012 open waters ow shrubs land cover slc herbaceous vegetation hv and cultivated and managed vegetation cmv are based on the integration of multiple global remote sensing derived land cover products at one kilometer resolution the values of the three mentioned indicators are between 0 and 100 percent for each cell we used global 1 km consensus land cover data for ow slc hv and cmv calculations tuanmu jetz 2014 the values of the ten factors are calculated at the tehsil level in this order we employed arcgis pro software and calculated the value of each tehsil based on the average of the values of cells embraced by the administrative border finally we follow up the min max standardization approach to transfer all indicators into a range between 0 and 1 wang et al 2020 considering this point that we use 1 n t l and 1 s w c during standardization that is because all indicators show a more vulnerable situation facing a drought event as they rise except ntl and swc which are more vulnerable in lower values 2 4 1 dvi calculation scenarios in this paper we assess three scenarios for allocating the weights of the dvi s indicators first equal weight is taken for all dvi indicators second we use the analytic hierarchy process ahp for weighting the indicators and third we use the fuzzy ahp method the equal weight of dvi indicators in the first scenario means taking a normal average of the values of indicators as the dvi shahid behrawan 2008 khoshnazar et al 2021 suggested that different system elements are not equally vulnerable when drought occurs thereby suggesting a heterogeneous vulnerability factor they used the analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1990 to find the weights of the used indicators for the dvi calculation ahp works based on the experts opinions uses pairwise comparison and provides us with the weight of each indicator wi varying between 0 and 1 with the summation of all indicators weights equal to 1 we used this approach as the second scenario to find the weights of the dvi indicators finally as our third scenario fuzzy ahp chang 1996 works based on the fuzzy theory introduced by zadeh 1965 fuzzy logic is in contrast to boolean logic fuzzy logic allows propositions with variable responses while classic logic only accounts for conclusions that are either true or false as ambiguity and uncertainty are a part of decisions fuzzy ahp is vastly applied to decision making sipahi timor 2010 in this research we applied the fuzzy ahp method chang 1996 to find the weights of dvi indicators similar to ahp in this method weight of each indicator wi varies between 0 and 1 and the summation of all indicators weights is 1 ahp and fuzzy ahp methods works based on experts opinion for which a questionnaire is required in this respect we asked our selected group of experts to follow two approaches for filling out the questionnaires the first approach was based on an agricultural perspective meaning that agriculture was our priority during the assessment the second approach was socio economic giving socio economic activities priority then we obtained five datasets for the weights of the dvi s indicators including the three mentioned scenarios with two perspectives for the second and third scenarios 2 5 drought resilience index drei we employed the disaster resilience results provided by sajjad 2021 at the district level in pakistan as the drei the author has assessed the resilience of communities facing natural environmental hazards such as drought in the mentioned research the methodology followed by sajjad 2021 is as follows in order to calculate the index three sub components including economic institutional and social are defined each of them has a couple of indicators contributing either positively or negatively toward the overall resilience as shown in fig 3 sajjad 2021 after data collection to enable the comparison of the indicators with different units the max min approach is employed to normalize these values for indicators with negative impact 1 n o r m a l i z e d i n d i c a t o r is used instead of the normalized indicator the normalized values of indicators are between 0 and 1 while 0 shows the worst and 1 shows the best situation after the indicators normalization the drei is equal to the average of all indicators the process is applied to all districts in pakistan providing us with a spatially distributed dataset of drei values one drei value for each district 2 6 distribution patterns and clustering space time analysis this study uses the emerging hot spot analysis tool esri 2016 to identify temporal trends and spatial patterns in our dhi dataset based on spei in this respect a two fold approach is applied for instance we first created a network common data form netcdf data cube for our spei values known as a space time data cube using arcgis pro see details here https bit ly 3gzhh8a in this space time cube each bin contains a location and time step ids count value and summary fields or variables aggregated during the cube creation as fig 4 shows a time series is shown by the bins related to the same location i e if the location id is the same similarly bins associated with the same time step interval i e sharing the same time step id will encompass a time slice the count value of each bin shows the number of incidents happening at the related location within the related time step interval esri 2016 based on this arrangement of the space time data cube the emerging hot spot analysis tool then evaluates spatial temporal trends and patterns of drought hazard in each tehsil via employing a combination of two measures for statistical analysis as follows harris et al 2017 initially the tool calculates the getis ord gi statistic getis ord 1992 hot spot analysis employing the conceptualization of spatial relationship values for each bin see details here https bit ly 3ilkfjq this measure detects the location and degree of spatial clustering for drought hazards later the tool uses the well known non parametric approach called the mann kendall trend test kendall gibbons 1990 mann 1945 to assess temporal trends if any in the time series data accordingly the emerging hot spot analysis tool classifies the locations tehsil in our case based on the subsequent z score and p value in the case of overall data and with the hot spot z score standard deviations and p value statistical probabilities in case of binned data as a result a small p value and a high z score indicate a significant hot spot while a small p value and low negative z score indicate a significant cold spot the higher or lower the z score the more intense the hotspot cold spot clustering a z score near zero means no spatial clustering adeyeri et al 2017 scott janikas 2009 in this study we follow the guidelines from the environmental systems research institute esri and consider the assessment of eight pattern categories table 4 in the spei under both three and six month time steps esri 2016 the data are analyzed in the combined form both hot and cold spots for sixteen patterns i e eight each for hot and cold spots 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal drought hazard dynamics the results of geographical dhi distribution show a considerable north south spatial heterogeneity in drought hazard across the study area with southern regions experiencing relatively higher drought intensities than northern areas fig 5 the shades from blue to red in fig 5 represent lower and higher drought intensity respectively overall it is evident that the distribution of higher drought intensity is more visible in the balochistan and sindh provinces of pakistan while khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab provinces are relatively safer from a regional spatial perspective the results ascertain that the areas in south punjab particularly those at the confluence of punjab sindh and balochistan provinces are experiencing severe drought situations as compared to central and northern punjab yellow to reddish shades in fig 5 although the general north south disparities in the drought intensity are visible for all the periods i e the entire study period differences across both time steps i e three and six months are evident for instance for all the periods i e the entire study period the first decade and the second decade there is a clear difference in the distribution of dhi across three and six month steps with higher drought intensity under six month steps the intensity of dhi in balochistan province under the three month step t03 for the entire study period and second decade is lower than that of t06 on the contrary for the first decade 2000 2009 the intensity for the three month time step d103 is higher as compared with the six month d106 see the middle panels in fig 5 after evaluating the general distribution of dhi it is desirable to pinpoint the areas where higher and lower dhi are clustered across the study area firstly the global geographical association of dhi is assessed through the global moran s index based spatial autocorrelation and the results are presented in table 5 among the analysis of clustering random patterns and dispersed distribution through the global moran s index spatial clustering is observed for all the dhis across the study area suggesting the accumulation of higher drought hazards in certain areas given the resultant values of moran s index for several dhis i e values closer to 1 it is evident that there is a high positive spatial association of dhi for all the periods and time steps 95 confidence this means the higher intensity drought tends to cluster in certain regions of the study area among all the dhis the strongest spatial association is observed for d203 moran s index value 0 975 and the weakest is observed for d106 moran s index value 0 901 this situation reflects a slight increase in the spatial clustering of higher drought intensity given the z score values presented in table 6 there is 1 probability that these identified clustered patterns in dhi are due to any random chance i e rejecting the null hypothesis that dhi does not represent the clustered pattern across the study area once it is established that the dhi exhibits geographical clustering the next step is to pinpoint these regions based on statistically significant p 05 hot spots areas with higher intensity of drought hazard identification the results from lisa identify hot and cold spots of dhi across the study area fig 6 based on the analysis two distinct regions could easily be identified as hot regions with red shades and cold regions with blue shades spots in the southern and northern areas of the study area 95 confidence in terms of the entire study period the situation in sindh and balochistan province is severe as the maximum number of areas are identified as hot spots regions in red color for the first decade i e 2000 2009 d103 and d106 the hot spots in balochistan are concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of the province on the other hand the hot spots in sindh under the six month time step d106 are relatively more dispersed in punjab these hot spots are primarily identified in south punjab regions near the confluence of three provinces i e punjab sindh and balochistan notably this concentration of hotspots has shifted to southern areas in the recent decade i e d203 and d206 as a result the hot spots have not been identified in southern punjab areas in the recent decade this shift in dhi hot spots is comparatively more visible in balochistan province lower panels in fig 6 the quantification of hot and cold spots identified through lisa is presented in table 6 it is observed that the largest percentage of cold spots is identified for d203 39 on the contrary the study area s largest proportion of dhi hot spots is observed for t03 37 for t06 this proportion is 34 this situation reflects that 37 of tehsils in pakistan are experiencing higher drought intensity based on the entire study period 2000 2018 long term assessment it is noteworthy that there has been a slight increase e g 23 under d106 vs 30 under d206 in the proportion of hot spots in the recent decade i e 2010 2018 which might signal the concentrated exhibition of high intensity droughts in pakistan in the recent decade the proportion of the identified hot and cold spots is larger for the three month time step for each period i e the entire study period decade one and decade two this situation suggests the dissipation of drought hazards over the longer time step the analysis via the space time pattern mining technique for evaluating sixteen patterns in spei results in several cold and hot spots across the study area fig 7 given a large number of data i e 433 tehsils and 20 years of monthly data on spei 21 4 million space time bins are evaluated to identify these patterns the cold spots i e regions with significantly low spei dry areas are concentrated in sindh and balochistan provinces at the same time the hot spots i e regions with significantly higher spei wet areas are concentrated in punjab and kpk regions the general distribution of hot and cold spot patterns is the same for both three month and six month time steps in terms of the three month step four hot and cold spots are identified the identified patterns of these hot and cold spots under the three month time step include sporadic intensifying oscillating and consecutive as the cold spots represent a statistically significant 95 confidence low concentration of spei they are of particular interest in the context of droughts among all the identified cold spots the most dominant ones are intensifying 8 sporadic 30 and oscillating 5 5 upper panel in fig 7 for the three month time step it is evident that the intensifying cold spots are mostly present in the north western regions of sindh province with some sparse distribution in balochistan this situation reflects severe circumstances as the dry conditions for these areas are intensifying 95 confidence particularly under pakistan s rising warming similarly identifying statistically significant oscillating cold spots shows that while these areas have been the hot spots in the past they recently observed dry conditions which might transform into drought conditions if these trends linger in the future notably the intensifying cold spots 2 5 under the six month time step are mostly present in balochistan representing a reverse situation than the three month time step lower panel in fig 7 this could indicate short term drought conditions in sindh province during the long term in balochistan it is noteworthy that the consecutive cold spots mostly present in sindh province increased from 1 under the three month time step to 5 under the six month time step 3 2 geographies of drought vulnerability and resilience the dvi computation and distribution results and lisa based identification of statistically significant hot spots the most vulnerable areas are presented in fig 8 a and b respectively while the results show a north south geographical disparity in the distribution of dvi most western regions across pakistan are relatively more vulnerable to droughts regions in red shades fig 8a the most vulnerable province is kpk followed by balochistan and punjab where higher dvi is concentrated in the northern parts of the provinces in sindh province the central regions are comparatively more vulnerable regions shaded in yellow color the hot spots clusters of highly vulnerable regions p 05 of dvi are identified only for balochistan s and punjab s northern parts the situation in kpk seems more severe since most of the areas are identified as significant hot spots of dvi 95 confidence few outliers in terms of high low brown shades and low high blue shades clusters are also identified in punjab and kpk provinces respectively fig 8b the resilience assessment shows that northern areas in punjab are particularly resilient to natural hazards such as droughts yellow shades in fig 8c the only region in sindh with higher resilience is karachi the largest city in pakistan sharing a 42 contribution to pakistan s national gross domestic product gdp the least resilient areas mainly belong to balochistan kpk and sindh among which the situation in balochistan is the worst this low resilience in balochistan might be the consequence of the deprived economic conditions of the province despite being the largest in pakistan according to the area the higher resilience in punjab and poor conditions in balochistan and kpk are further confirmed by identifying lisa based hot and cold spots for instance a maximum of punjab s tehsils is identified as high high resilience clusters green shades in fig 8d on the contrary tehsils in balochistan and kpk are identified as low low clusters red shades in fig 7d reflecting the critical situation regarding hazard resilience in these regions it is noted that before running the lisa analysis the global autocorrelation for dvi and drei is also checked similar to dhi the results show a statistically significant p 0 01 spatial association of both dvi and drei in the study area representing a clustered pattern for both indices table 7 given moran s index value it is evident that this spatial association is stronger for resilience than drought vulnerability moran s index values 0 801 and 0 652 respectively 3 3 drought risk distribution and identification of high risk clusters based on the integration of dhi dvi and drei the drought risk index dri is achieved for each tehsil across the study area the drought risk assessment results show considerable geographical heterogeneity fig 9 the general distribution of dri represents a gradual increase in drought risk from north to south putting regions in southern pakistan at higher risk of drought impacts the findings ascertain that the drought risk situation is worst in balochistan province followed by sindh under both time steps i e dri03 and dri06 in fig 9 the only region with low drought risk in sindh province is karachi which could result from its low vulnerability and higher resilience as explained in section 3 2 notably despite being highly vulnerable and less resilient the drought risk in kpk is lower intermediate i e values ranging between 0 00 and 0 40 additionally the lisa based cluster identification pinpoints the areas of statistically significant high and low drought risk agglomeration high high and low low clusters respectively for instance most of the areas in balochistan province are identified as high risk clusters in terms of droughts followed by sindh and punjab provinces karachi is marked as a low low cluster representing a significant cold spot in punjab a few tehsils in the south western region are identified as the hot spot of drought risk otherwise most tehsils are either cold spots low low clusters representing lower drought risk or insignificant at p 05 the spatial autocorrelation results for dri also show statistically significant global clustered patterns 95 confidence for both dri03 and dri06 table 7 moran s index values show a slightly stronger spatial association in dri06 moran s index value 0 903 than in dri03 moran s index value 0 898 results from the lisa based assessment are presented in table 8 the findings show that a large proportion approximately one third of tehsils in pakistan is identified as a hot spot of high drought risk 36 and 34 under dri03 and dri06 respectively this situation reflects perilous conditions for people communities living in these particular hot spots of dri in the face of ongoing climate change and global warming phenomena 4 discussions given the geographical disparities in droughts the spatial drought risk distributions should be considered integral to any drought policy in this study a comprehensive drought risk index is developed by combining hazard vulnerability and resilience the spatial modeling based evaluations are further presented to support decision making policy responses and resource allocation in terms of assessment approach this study advocates that drought risk evaluation should not only rely on hazard exclusively or integrate it with vulnerability such as presented by yujie liu chen 2021 but should also consider community resilience khoshnazar et al 2021 spinoni et al 2020b sajjad chan 2019 while the presented geographical drought risk distribution helps pin pointing priority intervention areas high risk regions i e hot spots from this study could further be focused on evaluating the inequalities in socio economic drought risks in those particular tehsils fig 9 via integrating gridded administrative level population and gdp datasets providing an important and interesting research question for future research the drought risk hot spots presented in this study provide means to scale down important areas for further evaluations interventions and resource allocation related decision making while there is no hazard vulnerability and resilience integrated drought risk assessment available in pakistan the national scale high resolution administrative unit level drought evaluation such as presented here is also absent therefore even though no comparable studies are available to compare our results the regional droughts distribution and trends identified in our study are in line with similar localized studies for instance dhi distribution in kpk presented in our study i e more severe conditions in southern regions of the province is in line with the one reported by rahman et al 2021 similar findings on the spatial temporal trends in the kpk province are also reported rahman et al 2022 adnan et al 2015 characterized drought hazards in sindh province during 1951 2010 and reported northern and central regions being more vulnerable to droughts similar to the one observed in our assessment fig 5 while the spatial drought distribution presented in this study figs 5 and 8 provides a roadmap to prioritize different regions for immediate or gradual actions in the context of mitigation and adaptation the intensifying spei cold spots statistically significant dry regions 95 confidence pinpoints tehsils where droughts are likely to become more prominent this situation prerequisites special attention from local governments to devise and implement appropriate measures to avoid drought associated impacts on health agriculture livestock and ecosystems ahmad et al 2020 undrr 2021 the results show that the intensification of droughts is the most obvious in balochistan and sindh provinces in general the areas with lower resilience high vulnerability fig 8 and highest drought hazard are dominated by higher drought risk another possible reason behind high risk dominance in sindh province could be the long term statistically significant downward trends in rainfall over the past half century recently identified by ali et al 2021 hence additional mitigation measures are needed in these regions it is interesting to note that kpk being relatively more vulnerable and less resilient has a low intermediate drought risk figs 8 and 9 potentially due to the lower level of drought hazard in this part of the study area fig 5 such evaluation is particularly important for targeted interventions regarding hazard mitigation vulnerability reduction and resilience improvements for instance vulnerability and resilience are the aspects that need particular attention in kpk province the multi dimensional evaluation provided in this study could help design more effective decision making and resource allocation to mitigate cope and adapt to drought risks for instance fig 10 represents the behavior of identified hot cold spots throughout the study period i e 2000 2018 in pakistan furthermore the sensitivity evaluation of these hot cold spots provides information on the emergence of hot cold spots in space and time fig 10 at different confidences representing a broader geographical perspective to pin point regions of high risk integrating adopting such assessments in the national and sub national disaster risk management interventions by the relevant authorities e g the national and provincial disaster management authorities in pakistan can progressively support mitigating drought impacts the assessment presented in this study is essential to estimate monitoring and managing drought impacts while droughts affect agricultural yield worldwide basso ritchie 2014 and create challenges like water scarcity pakistan is no exception waseem et al 2022 chen li 2016 dobson et al 2020 eslamian eslamian 2017 as the country is also among the water scarce nations mekonnen hoekstra 2016 given a higher drought risk in sindh and balochistan fig 9 special attention should be paid to risk hot spots and higher drought condition areas identified in this study 5 conclusions based on the integration of drought hazard vulnerability and resilience dhi dvi and drei respectively a drought risk index dri is developed for pakistan furthermore several geoinformation tools are applied to identify temporal trends spatial patterns and significant hot cold spots across the study area a north south geographical disparity is observed in dhi while the drought intensities were higher in southern regions than in northern regions balochistan and sindh provinces faced higher drought intensity while khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab provinces encountered better conditions moreover the results showed that there has been a slight increase in the proportion of hot spots in the recent decade the worst dri results are seen in balochistan province followed by sindh under both time steps of the drought index higher drought risk is dominant in regions with lower resilience high vulnerability and highest drought hazard the lisa based assessment showed that a large proportion of tehsils of the country is identified as hot spots of high dri in pakistan overall considerable measures are recommended in the highest drought risk areas identified in this study this research comes in handy for decision making policy responses and resource allocation in pakistan to reduce drought impacts we encourage implementing the newly introduced drought risk assessment framework that considers resilience besides hazard and vulnerability in other countries especially those expected to face droughts and water scarcity as an effect of climate change credit authorship contribution statement ali

2125,droughts are among the most socio economically costly natural phenomenon while most of the related research has focused on drought as a hazard it is essential to go beyond such practice and utilize hazard information in integration with vulnerability and resilience we put forth a multi dimensional high resolution assessment of drought risk in pakistan on a national scale to this end we utilize a drought risk index dri based on integrated drought hazard dhi drought vulnerability dvi and drought resilience drei indices we further employ geospatial techniques to identify and pinpoint statistically significant clustering in the form of hot and cold spots higher and lower values concentration respectively to the best of our knowledge this is a preliminary effort to engage the state of the art space time pattern mining technique for the simultaneous spatial temporal dynamics investigation of droughts we observed varying north south geographical distributions in dhi across the country with higher drought intensities in southern regions while a sizeable spatial drought risk disparity is evident across pakistan the worst dri results are seen in balochistan followed by sindh notably around one third of the country is identified as the hot spot with the highest drought risk which ascertains a grave situation under global warming our comprehensive results provide more insights to prepare for drought mitigation adaptation measures and systematic impact evaluation in the face of environmental changes keywords droughts geospatial modeling risk analysis geographic patterns pakistan data availability the data used in this paper is freely available and all the resources are mentioned within the paper 1 introduction there is a global consensus that droughts are among the most socio economically expensive hazards worldwide spatial temporal shifts in droughts have multi scaler e g local national regional and global consequences for both human and natural systems cook et al 2020 almost all climate belts experience significant impacts of droughts on socio economic development and ecological systems byakatonda et al 2018 expressly droughts affect water supply agricultural yields production of energy and soil moisture resulting in severe impacts on societies basso ritchie 2014 islam et al 2022 khoshnazar et al 2021 liu et al 2019 from 1900 to 2019 3 billion people have been affected by droughts this has led to usd1 75 1012 economic damages and 11 million deaths em dat 2020 yujie liu chen 2021 this situation shows the gravity of droughts as one of the costliest natural hazards wu et al 2022a as anthropogenic activities based climate change continues the impacts of droughts are further expected to worsen in developing countries that are vulnerable to droughts ipcc 2021 yujie liu chen 2021 under these circumstances proper drought monitoring profiling and assessment to support informed decision making and resource allocation to mitigate drought associated risks become imperative the conceptual comprehension of droughts is tricky due to disparities in procedural measurements observational parameters and inconsistency in climatic situations dracup et al 1980 while there is no consensus on the inclusive and precise mathematical definition of droughts in general terms it is described as a water deficiency compared to normal situations which encompasses all types of drought lloyd hughes 2014 more precisely the combination of anomalies in precipitation and temperature referred to as meteorological drought leads to soil moisture deficit known as agricultural drought and a lack of water in lakes and streams defined as hydrological drought khoshnazar et al 2021 this description however can be distinguished based on operational and conceptual aspects mishra singh 2010 here the operational perspective reflects how frequent severe and long the drought is for a given return period on the other hand the conceptual viewpoint represents droughts in relative terms such as a drought event being a long and dry spell in addition to meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts some scholars and institutions also represent socio economic drought this is described as the conditions when water resource systems fail to meet water demands association of droughts with economic goods i e water demand and supply ams 2004 mishra singh 2010 in recent decades droughts have gained significant attention among scholars due to their frequent occurrence globally aghakouchak et al 2014 b√∂hnisch et al 2021 byakatonda et al 2018 checchi robinson 2013 hina et al 2021 mondol et al 2021 qiu 2010 van dijk et al 2013 the primary emphasis of these studies has been drought as a hazard however it is essential for corrective decision making prioritization and resources allocation to go further beyond such practice and utilize hazard information in integration with vulnerability and resilience which results in a more reliable outcome khoshnazar et al 2021 sajjad et al 2020a shahid behrawan 2008 while such evaluation might require additional efforts to quantify all three aspects of risk i e hazard vulnerability and resilience the resultant product would progressively provide much more detailed information to end users such as relevant government authorities risk practitioners specialists in disaster risk mitigation and non government organization while droughts have continuously been affecting pakistan resulting in severe impacts they are also among the major factors behind the stagnant economic growth of the country dawn 2022 the 1998 2002 drought is known to be the worst to hit the country since its independence in 1947 this drought affected 3 3 million people and 30 million livestock other impacts included loss of farming related jobs deteriorated physical health and malnutrition among children the centre for strategic and contemporary research cscr 2018 the united nations in its recent global outlook report lists pakistan among the most drought hit countries across the globe united nations convention to combat desertification united nations convention to combat desertification unccd 2022 recently pakistan received 25 lesser rainfall during the monsoon season of 2018 with balochistan province receiving 45 and sindh province receiving 70 below average precipitation due to this situation 1 2 million in balochistan and 3 million people in sindh were affected united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha 2019 the prevalence of droughts in an agrarian society significantly impacts the yield of different crops which can consequently compromise the demand and supply of agri products hussain et al 2022 regardless of the gravity of the drought situation in pakistan studies related to drought risk in pakistan are insufficient the existing ones mainly focus on drought as a hazard and provide small scale assessments which do not provide a national outlook of drought risk along with national level decision making and policy development additionally the existing literature on droughts in pakistan considerably lacks in identifying spatial temporal heterogeneities in drought risk integrating hazard vulnerability and resilience relatedly while the provided information is not comprehensive in the context of drought risk the absence of higher resolution administrative level assessment makes it difficult to identify localized patterns although pakistan is among the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change ipcc 2022 kreft et al 2016 there has not been any assessment to provide a high resolution national scale assessment of drought risk in this country it is imperative to have such an assessment to drive informed decision making and drought planning the current knowledge gap hinders devising appropriate action plans and effective resource allocation to build resilience against droughts in pakistan hence it is imperative to carry out research to support the country s efforts regarding drought risk reduction and adaptation in view of the above this study leverages multi source and interdisciplinary data integrates several geo information models and statistical approaches i e spatial autocorrelation local indicators of spatial association space time patterns mining etc and accounts for hazard vulnerability and resilience to provide a comprehensive high resolution assessment on drought risk in pakistan at a national scale in order to obtain drought hazard the well known precipitation and temperature based drought index di standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which is well known for its utilization as a meteorological di is employed in this paper khoshnazar et al 2021 in this context our main objectives are described as 1 the national level drought risk index estimation based on hazard vulnerability and resilience 2 evaluating high resolution spatial distributions of drought risk and its components and 3 spatial patterns and hot spots identification of drought risk and its components using spatial distributional models while the results from this study will have important implications for characterizing priority intervention areas and informed decision making to drive mitigation and adaptation efforts useful references for effective policy responses will be provided to enhance the overall resilience of pakistan against such hazards similarly the integrated approach adopted in this paper to account for all aspects of risk i e hazard vulnerability and resilience would contribute to the knowledge body in this field 2 methodology this section discusses the methodology applied to calculate our drought risk index dri which is achieved through an integration of the drought hazard index dhi drought vulnerability index dvi and drought resilience index drei all of which are discussed in the following subsections in details following the computation of dri comprehensive high resolution thematic maps are produced for the spatial distribution of the aforementioned indices for the sake of effective results communication in particular we employ well known spatial modeling techniques including the global moran s i based spatial autocorrelation to evaluate geographical patterns e g dispersed random or clustered and the local indicators of spatial association lisa to identify and pinpoint statistically significant clustering in the form of hot higher values concentration and cold spots lower values concentration both of these models are applied at a 95 confidence interval i e p 05 in addition this study represents the application of space time pattern mining derived emerging hot cold spots identification via accounting for both spatial and temporal elements to advance our understanding of high resolution spatial temporal dynamics of drought hazards in pakistan 2 1 case of pakistan pakistan is a developing nation in south asia with 225 million people covering an area of 881 913 km2 its latitude is 30 3 n and its longitude is 69 3 e indicating that pakistan is situated in the northern hemisphere the country is among the most prone countries to disasters and the impacts of climate change ipcc 2021 among these disasters one of the most frequently occurring and socio economically devastating is drought while the droughts associated effects are staggering globally pakistan is no exception for an agrarian country with one quarter population living in poverty severe water scarcity and food insecurity issues poor institutional capabilities and lower disaster resilience droughts are significant threats to people and ecosystems jamil 2019 nabi et al 2019 sajjad 2021 due to global warming induced increment in temperature the frequency and severity of droughts in pakistan are rising this situation further deteriorated due to lesser rainfall and the adverse effects of el nino ali et al 2021 hina et al 2021 for instance there was 25 percent lesser rainfall in pakistan in 2018 with sindh and balochistan provinces southern regions receiving the lowest 70 and 45 percent below average respectively conditions like this make these provinces more vulnerable to the drought phenomenon consequently 5 million people were impacted due to drought in 2018 ndc 2019 similarly the rainfall deficit led drought in pakistan from 1999 to 2003 affected 2 2 million people caused 143 deaths and resulted in usd 384 million in damages em dat 2020 another recent drought in 2019 due to the combined effect of el nino and decreased amount of rainfall during the monsoon season impacted 4 7 million people and caused severe food shortage related challenges in sindh province 2 2 drought risk index dri the applied drought risk index dri is obtained following the risk assessment framework put forth by sajjad and chan 2019 and the drought risk assessment framework introduced by khoshnazar et al 2021 at the tehsil level a sub administrative division under the district government in pakistan where localized planning and decision making take place this method takes a system approach and considers risk as the intervention between hazard vulnerability and resilience of the system in this order we first calculate dhi dvi and drei each of which is explained in the subsections below these indices are normalized and their values vary from 0 to 1 while 0 depicts the lowest hazard and vulnerability dhi and dvi and they rise as their values get higher the worst value is 1 for drei this is vice versa meaning 0 shows the lowest and 1 depicts the highest resilience the best value is 1 accordingly dri is defined as the geometric mean of dhi dvi and 1 drei as follows dri d h i d v i 1 d r e i 1 3 as fig 1 shows to obtain dri we need to calculate dhi dvi and drei here a brief description of each is provided while they are discussed in depth in the next sections 2 3 2 5 dhi dhi is calculated using drought index di information indicating the historical drought situation of each cell with a specific value dvi dvi is obtained through the weighted aggregation of the different socio economic agricultural environmental and infrastructural indicators drei drei is calculated as the average of its factors drei is obtained as the average of the different economic institutional and social factors interested readers are referred to khoshnazar et al 2021a for more detailed information on dri calculation the methodology is applied for all cells of the tehsil level map providing us with a spatially distributed dataset of dri which varies between 0 the lowest risk and 1 the highest risk table 1 2 2 1 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei is a well known precipitation and temperature based di it is obtained by employing the method of the standardized precipitation index spi spi utilizes the precipitation data as the input while spei requires the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet vicente serrano et al 2010 spi introduced by mckee et al 1993 is obtained as explained below based on a dataset of ongoing long term precipitation 30 years or more a time scale for monthly data 3 6 9 12 24 or 48 months is specified then each precipitation data set is fitted into a distribution function mostly selected as gamma after determining the probability of the precipitation based on the historical records the probability of all precipitation data points is computed and applied along with an approximation of the inverse normal to find the precipitation deviation for a standard normal distribution wu et al 2022b for spei calculation the precipitation values are replaced by the difference between precipitation and pet gu et al 2019 we used spei with three and six month time steps hereafter referred to as spei03 and spei06 respectively which are suitable for agricultural drought monitoring khoshnazar corzo perez diaz et al 2021 vicente serrano 2006 in this regard the global netcdf file of spei03 and spei06 available in spatial resolution of 0 5 are employed we used the data between january 2000 december 2018 which is the last available data spei global drought monitor 2021 then we employed pakistan s tehsil level map n 433 to calculate the spei values equal to the average of spei values within the boundary of each administrative division 2 3 drought hazard index dhi as an index dhi summarizes the complex concept of droughts information into a value that sends a message and big picture to users especially policy makers joint research centre european commission 2008 the current subsection explains how dhi is calculated based on di values to conclude the historical variation of droughts in a given place as a number dhi is a composite indicator of two variables both are calculated based on the drought index di here spei information these two variables are associated with drought categories and the probability of occurrence for each category as is explained below to calculate the dhi for each cell in the tehsil level map computation of di is a prerequisite subsection 2 2 1 we employ the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei as our di explained in the previous subsection based on the di values we determine drought events as the literature suggests brito et al 2018 diaz et al 2020a khoshnazar et al 2021a di 0 is taken as the threshold to identify drought events then a drought event starts as the value of di gets equal to or lower than the threshold i e s p e i 0 that is the start point of low drought and ends as the value rises over the threshold drought duration is the number of months between the start and the end of droughts gu et al 2020 please note that this threshold i e s p e i 0 is the start point of dry conditions values of s p e i 0 represent the drought condition suggested by mckee et al 1993 and tong et al 2018 meanwhile we follow a conditional approach not an absolute approach for dhi calculation which means lower spei values are associated with severer drought categories table 2 afterwards according to table 2 drought events are labelled as low l moderate m severe s and extreme e for each of these four categories i e l m s and e we calculate the probability of occurrence as follows p r o b a b i l i t y o f o c c u r r e n c e n l t e where nl is the number of events of each label and te is the total number of drought events the jenks natural break method minimizes within class variances makes them as similar as possible and maximizes the variance between groups makes data classes as different as possible the advantage of this method is that it identifies real classes within the data that is why the literature suggests khoshnazar et al 2021a nasrollahi et al 2018 this method to find the rating of each category accordingly due to its ability to determine the best arrangement of values in different classes we applied the jenks natural break method to break the probability of occurrence of each category into four ratings in this research the obtained drought category and rating provide us with two values employed to calculate dhi the values are weights dw based on drought category l m s and e and ratings dr based on the very low low high and very high probability of occurrence as shown in table 2 khoshnazar et al 2021a nasrollahi et al 2018 the approach of allocating values 1 2 3 and 4 to weights dw follows the one proposed by becker et al 2017 to allocate values 1 2 3 and 4 to dw we consider dhi as the composite indicator weighted arithmetic average of dw and dr becker et al 2017 dw is an important measure that captures the influence of dr on dhi let 1 2 3 and 4 show the level of impact of each category on dhi from lowest to highest influence respectively and considering that higher dhi values show the worse cases obviously a low drought category l will have the lowest impact on dhi i e d w 1 and an extreme drought category e will have the highest impact on dhi i e d w 4 then dw values will be 1 2 3 and 4 for l m s and e categories respectively it should be noted that the same way of reasoning is incorporated to allocate values to the ratings dr afterwards dhi is calculated as as follows d h i ld r ld w md r md w sd r sd w ed r ed w where ldr and ldw represent the rating and weight for the low category drought respectively mdr and mdw represent similar values for the moderate drought and sdr and sdw for the severe drought category finally edr and edw are the ratings and weights determined for the extreme drought category eventually the calculated values for dhi are normalized between 0 and 1 employing the min max normalization approach an advantage of the min max normalization approach is its ability to preserve the relationships among the original data values hence even after the normalization process the extreme drought risk areas remain untouched as the normalized data is with the same scale it should be noted that all raw values of dhi before normalization vary between 10 the best possible raw dhi value and 40 the worst possible raw dhi value which means there aren t any outlier values the drawback of min max normalization approach for dhi hence it is reasonable to use this normalization approach in order to gain more accuracy we also split the overall period i e 2000 2018 into two time windows including 2000 2009 decade 1 d1 and 2010 2018 decade 2 d2 accordingly we calculate six dhi datasets involving spei03 and spei06 for the period 2000 2018 and the two time windows these resultant dhi are represented by t03 and t06 for the entire drought analysis period i e 2000 2018 based on three and six month steps respectively d103 and d106 for the first decade i e 2000 2009 based on three and six month steps respectively and d203 and d206 for the second decade i e 2010 2018 based on three and six month steps respectively the same terminology 03 and 06 is used for the overall drought risk assessment based on three and six month steps 2 4 drought vulnerability index dvi by definition vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected by a natural hazards event such as droughts flooding and landslides among many others liu chen 2021 hence in this study we take vulnerability as the propensity of an area of interest i e tehsil to disproportionally get affected by droughts in pakistan for the computation of dvi the initial and one of the most critical factors is the selection of indicators the selected indicators in the context of dvi must reflect the vulnerable characteristics of an area in terms of collective socio economic agricultural environmental and infrastructure aspects liu chen 2021 therefore based on the literature scale of this study and data availability we complied with the list of indicators as presented in fig 2 for population density pd we used the gridded population of the world version 4 gpw 2021 data for 2020 that estimates the human population density number of persons per square kilometer night time light ntl data determine lights generated by human settlements gas flares fires and illuminated marine vessels and strongly correlate with energy consumption and economic activities zhang et al 2013 accordingly ntl can be taken as an indicator of infrastructure development to obtain ntl we used the consistent and corrected nighttime light ccnl dataset in 2013 obtained from the defense meteorological program operational line scan system dmsp ols version 4 data ccnl 2020 reflecting artificial lights the data are represented in a 1000 m resolution soil workability sw comprises physical hindrances to cultivation and restrictions to cultivation imposed by texture clay mineralogy fischer et al 2008 this data describes soil limitations for plant growth in a qualitative manner using four classes including no or slight limitations class1 moderate limitations class2 sever limitations class3 and very severe limitations class4 the four classes are normally rated between 80 and 100 of the growth potential class1 60 80 class2 40 60 class3 and 40 class4 values of 1 2 3 and 4 are allocated to class1 class2 class3 and class4 respectively we used global agro ecological zones assessment for agriculture gaez data for sw fischer et al 2008 soil water capacity swc indicates soil water holding capacity on a two minute grid cell we classified soil based on this dataset into four classes as follows class1 low swc 25 mm class2 moderate 25 100 mm class3 high 100 200 mm and class4 very high 200 mm we allocated 1 2 3 and 4 to class1 class2 class3 and class4 respectively for swc we used the united states department of agriculture usda 1998 data top soil ph tsp and sub soil ph ssp are representatives of the acidity and alkalinity of the soil and give the soil reaction of topsoil and subsoil respectively these factors categorize the soil ph into five ranges each with a specific agricultural significance as table 3 represents these five ranges construct three classes including class1 the best class class2 and class3 the worst class then values of 1 2 and 3 are allocated to class1 class2 and class3 respectively for tsp and ssp we used harmonized world soil database version 1 2 and food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao data nachtergaele et al 2012 open waters ow shrubs land cover slc herbaceous vegetation hv and cultivated and managed vegetation cmv are based on the integration of multiple global remote sensing derived land cover products at one kilometer resolution the values of the three mentioned indicators are between 0 and 100 percent for each cell we used global 1 km consensus land cover data for ow slc hv and cmv calculations tuanmu jetz 2014 the values of the ten factors are calculated at the tehsil level in this order we employed arcgis pro software and calculated the value of each tehsil based on the average of the values of cells embraced by the administrative border finally we follow up the min max standardization approach to transfer all indicators into a range between 0 and 1 wang et al 2020 considering this point that we use 1 n t l and 1 s w c during standardization that is because all indicators show a more vulnerable situation facing a drought event as they rise except ntl and swc which are more vulnerable in lower values 2 4 1 dvi calculation scenarios in this paper we assess three scenarios for allocating the weights of the dvi s indicators first equal weight is taken for all dvi indicators second we use the analytic hierarchy process ahp for weighting the indicators and third we use the fuzzy ahp method the equal weight of dvi indicators in the first scenario means taking a normal average of the values of indicators as the dvi shahid behrawan 2008 khoshnazar et al 2021 suggested that different system elements are not equally vulnerable when drought occurs thereby suggesting a heterogeneous vulnerability factor they used the analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1990 to find the weights of the used indicators for the dvi calculation ahp works based on the experts opinions uses pairwise comparison and provides us with the weight of each indicator wi varying between 0 and 1 with the summation of all indicators weights equal to 1 we used this approach as the second scenario to find the weights of the dvi indicators finally as our third scenario fuzzy ahp chang 1996 works based on the fuzzy theory introduced by zadeh 1965 fuzzy logic is in contrast to boolean logic fuzzy logic allows propositions with variable responses while classic logic only accounts for conclusions that are either true or false as ambiguity and uncertainty are a part of decisions fuzzy ahp is vastly applied to decision making sipahi timor 2010 in this research we applied the fuzzy ahp method chang 1996 to find the weights of dvi indicators similar to ahp in this method weight of each indicator wi varies between 0 and 1 and the summation of all indicators weights is 1 ahp and fuzzy ahp methods works based on experts opinion for which a questionnaire is required in this respect we asked our selected group of experts to follow two approaches for filling out the questionnaires the first approach was based on an agricultural perspective meaning that agriculture was our priority during the assessment the second approach was socio economic giving socio economic activities priority then we obtained five datasets for the weights of the dvi s indicators including the three mentioned scenarios with two perspectives for the second and third scenarios 2 5 drought resilience index drei we employed the disaster resilience results provided by sajjad 2021 at the district level in pakistan as the drei the author has assessed the resilience of communities facing natural environmental hazards such as drought in the mentioned research the methodology followed by sajjad 2021 is as follows in order to calculate the index three sub components including economic institutional and social are defined each of them has a couple of indicators contributing either positively or negatively toward the overall resilience as shown in fig 3 sajjad 2021 after data collection to enable the comparison of the indicators with different units the max min approach is employed to normalize these values for indicators with negative impact 1 n o r m a l i z e d i n d i c a t o r is used instead of the normalized indicator the normalized values of indicators are between 0 and 1 while 0 shows the worst and 1 shows the best situation after the indicators normalization the drei is equal to the average of all indicators the process is applied to all districts in pakistan providing us with a spatially distributed dataset of drei values one drei value for each district 2 6 distribution patterns and clustering space time analysis this study uses the emerging hot spot analysis tool esri 2016 to identify temporal trends and spatial patterns in our dhi dataset based on spei in this respect a two fold approach is applied for instance we first created a network common data form netcdf data cube for our spei values known as a space time data cube using arcgis pro see details here https bit ly 3gzhh8a in this space time cube each bin contains a location and time step ids count value and summary fields or variables aggregated during the cube creation as fig 4 shows a time series is shown by the bins related to the same location i e if the location id is the same similarly bins associated with the same time step interval i e sharing the same time step id will encompass a time slice the count value of each bin shows the number of incidents happening at the related location within the related time step interval esri 2016 based on this arrangement of the space time data cube the emerging hot spot analysis tool then evaluates spatial temporal trends and patterns of drought hazard in each tehsil via employing a combination of two measures for statistical analysis as follows harris et al 2017 initially the tool calculates the getis ord gi statistic getis ord 1992 hot spot analysis employing the conceptualization of spatial relationship values for each bin see details here https bit ly 3ilkfjq this measure detects the location and degree of spatial clustering for drought hazards later the tool uses the well known non parametric approach called the mann kendall trend test kendall gibbons 1990 mann 1945 to assess temporal trends if any in the time series data accordingly the emerging hot spot analysis tool classifies the locations tehsil in our case based on the subsequent z score and p value in the case of overall data and with the hot spot z score standard deviations and p value statistical probabilities in case of binned data as a result a small p value and a high z score indicate a significant hot spot while a small p value and low negative z score indicate a significant cold spot the higher or lower the z score the more intense the hotspot cold spot clustering a z score near zero means no spatial clustering adeyeri et al 2017 scott janikas 2009 in this study we follow the guidelines from the environmental systems research institute esri and consider the assessment of eight pattern categories table 4 in the spei under both three and six month time steps esri 2016 the data are analyzed in the combined form both hot and cold spots for sixteen patterns i e eight each for hot and cold spots 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal drought hazard dynamics the results of geographical dhi distribution show a considerable north south spatial heterogeneity in drought hazard across the study area with southern regions experiencing relatively higher drought intensities than northern areas fig 5 the shades from blue to red in fig 5 represent lower and higher drought intensity respectively overall it is evident that the distribution of higher drought intensity is more visible in the balochistan and sindh provinces of pakistan while khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab provinces are relatively safer from a regional spatial perspective the results ascertain that the areas in south punjab particularly those at the confluence of punjab sindh and balochistan provinces are experiencing severe drought situations as compared to central and northern punjab yellow to reddish shades in fig 5 although the general north south disparities in the drought intensity are visible for all the periods i e the entire study period differences across both time steps i e three and six months are evident for instance for all the periods i e the entire study period the first decade and the second decade there is a clear difference in the distribution of dhi across three and six month steps with higher drought intensity under six month steps the intensity of dhi in balochistan province under the three month step t03 for the entire study period and second decade is lower than that of t06 on the contrary for the first decade 2000 2009 the intensity for the three month time step d103 is higher as compared with the six month d106 see the middle panels in fig 5 after evaluating the general distribution of dhi it is desirable to pinpoint the areas where higher and lower dhi are clustered across the study area firstly the global geographical association of dhi is assessed through the global moran s index based spatial autocorrelation and the results are presented in table 5 among the analysis of clustering random patterns and dispersed distribution through the global moran s index spatial clustering is observed for all the dhis across the study area suggesting the accumulation of higher drought hazards in certain areas given the resultant values of moran s index for several dhis i e values closer to 1 it is evident that there is a high positive spatial association of dhi for all the periods and time steps 95 confidence this means the higher intensity drought tends to cluster in certain regions of the study area among all the dhis the strongest spatial association is observed for d203 moran s index value 0 975 and the weakest is observed for d106 moran s index value 0 901 this situation reflects a slight increase in the spatial clustering of higher drought intensity given the z score values presented in table 6 there is 1 probability that these identified clustered patterns in dhi are due to any random chance i e rejecting the null hypothesis that dhi does not represent the clustered pattern across the study area once it is established that the dhi exhibits geographical clustering the next step is to pinpoint these regions based on statistically significant p 05 hot spots areas with higher intensity of drought hazard identification the results from lisa identify hot and cold spots of dhi across the study area fig 6 based on the analysis two distinct regions could easily be identified as hot regions with red shades and cold regions with blue shades spots in the southern and northern areas of the study area 95 confidence in terms of the entire study period the situation in sindh and balochistan province is severe as the maximum number of areas are identified as hot spots regions in red color for the first decade i e 2000 2009 d103 and d106 the hot spots in balochistan are concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of the province on the other hand the hot spots in sindh under the six month time step d106 are relatively more dispersed in punjab these hot spots are primarily identified in south punjab regions near the confluence of three provinces i e punjab sindh and balochistan notably this concentration of hotspots has shifted to southern areas in the recent decade i e d203 and d206 as a result the hot spots have not been identified in southern punjab areas in the recent decade this shift in dhi hot spots is comparatively more visible in balochistan province lower panels in fig 6 the quantification of hot and cold spots identified through lisa is presented in table 6 it is observed that the largest percentage of cold spots is identified for d203 39 on the contrary the study area s largest proportion of dhi hot spots is observed for t03 37 for t06 this proportion is 34 this situation reflects that 37 of tehsils in pakistan are experiencing higher drought intensity based on the entire study period 2000 2018 long term assessment it is noteworthy that there has been a slight increase e g 23 under d106 vs 30 under d206 in the proportion of hot spots in the recent decade i e 2010 2018 which might signal the concentrated exhibition of high intensity droughts in pakistan in the recent decade the proportion of the identified hot and cold spots is larger for the three month time step for each period i e the entire study period decade one and decade two this situation suggests the dissipation of drought hazards over the longer time step the analysis via the space time pattern mining technique for evaluating sixteen patterns in spei results in several cold and hot spots across the study area fig 7 given a large number of data i e 433 tehsils and 20 years of monthly data on spei 21 4 million space time bins are evaluated to identify these patterns the cold spots i e regions with significantly low spei dry areas are concentrated in sindh and balochistan provinces at the same time the hot spots i e regions with significantly higher spei wet areas are concentrated in punjab and kpk regions the general distribution of hot and cold spot patterns is the same for both three month and six month time steps in terms of the three month step four hot and cold spots are identified the identified patterns of these hot and cold spots under the three month time step include sporadic intensifying oscillating and consecutive as the cold spots represent a statistically significant 95 confidence low concentration of spei they are of particular interest in the context of droughts among all the identified cold spots the most dominant ones are intensifying 8 sporadic 30 and oscillating 5 5 upper panel in fig 7 for the three month time step it is evident that the intensifying cold spots are mostly present in the north western regions of sindh province with some sparse distribution in balochistan this situation reflects severe circumstances as the dry conditions for these areas are intensifying 95 confidence particularly under pakistan s rising warming similarly identifying statistically significant oscillating cold spots shows that while these areas have been the hot spots in the past they recently observed dry conditions which might transform into drought conditions if these trends linger in the future notably the intensifying cold spots 2 5 under the six month time step are mostly present in balochistan representing a reverse situation than the three month time step lower panel in fig 7 this could indicate short term drought conditions in sindh province during the long term in balochistan it is noteworthy that the consecutive cold spots mostly present in sindh province increased from 1 under the three month time step to 5 under the six month time step 3 2 geographies of drought vulnerability and resilience the dvi computation and distribution results and lisa based identification of statistically significant hot spots the most vulnerable areas are presented in fig 8 a and b respectively while the results show a north south geographical disparity in the distribution of dvi most western regions across pakistan are relatively more vulnerable to droughts regions in red shades fig 8a the most vulnerable province is kpk followed by balochistan and punjab where higher dvi is concentrated in the northern parts of the provinces in sindh province the central regions are comparatively more vulnerable regions shaded in yellow color the hot spots clusters of highly vulnerable regions p 05 of dvi are identified only for balochistan s and punjab s northern parts the situation in kpk seems more severe since most of the areas are identified as significant hot spots of dvi 95 confidence few outliers in terms of high low brown shades and low high blue shades clusters are also identified in punjab and kpk provinces respectively fig 8b the resilience assessment shows that northern areas in punjab are particularly resilient to natural hazards such as droughts yellow shades in fig 8c the only region in sindh with higher resilience is karachi the largest city in pakistan sharing a 42 contribution to pakistan s national gross domestic product gdp the least resilient areas mainly belong to balochistan kpk and sindh among which the situation in balochistan is the worst this low resilience in balochistan might be the consequence of the deprived economic conditions of the province despite being the largest in pakistan according to the area the higher resilience in punjab and poor conditions in balochistan and kpk are further confirmed by identifying lisa based hot and cold spots for instance a maximum of punjab s tehsils is identified as high high resilience clusters green shades in fig 8d on the contrary tehsils in balochistan and kpk are identified as low low clusters red shades in fig 7d reflecting the critical situation regarding hazard resilience in these regions it is noted that before running the lisa analysis the global autocorrelation for dvi and drei is also checked similar to dhi the results show a statistically significant p 0 01 spatial association of both dvi and drei in the study area representing a clustered pattern for both indices table 7 given moran s index value it is evident that this spatial association is stronger for resilience than drought vulnerability moran s index values 0 801 and 0 652 respectively 3 3 drought risk distribution and identification of high risk clusters based on the integration of dhi dvi and drei the drought risk index dri is achieved for each tehsil across the study area the drought risk assessment results show considerable geographical heterogeneity fig 9 the general distribution of dri represents a gradual increase in drought risk from north to south putting regions in southern pakistan at higher risk of drought impacts the findings ascertain that the drought risk situation is worst in balochistan province followed by sindh under both time steps i e dri03 and dri06 in fig 9 the only region with low drought risk in sindh province is karachi which could result from its low vulnerability and higher resilience as explained in section 3 2 notably despite being highly vulnerable and less resilient the drought risk in kpk is lower intermediate i e values ranging between 0 00 and 0 40 additionally the lisa based cluster identification pinpoints the areas of statistically significant high and low drought risk agglomeration high high and low low clusters respectively for instance most of the areas in balochistan province are identified as high risk clusters in terms of droughts followed by sindh and punjab provinces karachi is marked as a low low cluster representing a significant cold spot in punjab a few tehsils in the south western region are identified as the hot spot of drought risk otherwise most tehsils are either cold spots low low clusters representing lower drought risk or insignificant at p 05 the spatial autocorrelation results for dri also show statistically significant global clustered patterns 95 confidence for both dri03 and dri06 table 7 moran s index values show a slightly stronger spatial association in dri06 moran s index value 0 903 than in dri03 moran s index value 0 898 results from the lisa based assessment are presented in table 8 the findings show that a large proportion approximately one third of tehsils in pakistan is identified as a hot spot of high drought risk 36 and 34 under dri03 and dri06 respectively this situation reflects perilous conditions for people communities living in these particular hot spots of dri in the face of ongoing climate change and global warming phenomena 4 discussions given the geographical disparities in droughts the spatial drought risk distributions should be considered integral to any drought policy in this study a comprehensive drought risk index is developed by combining hazard vulnerability and resilience the spatial modeling based evaluations are further presented to support decision making policy responses and resource allocation in terms of assessment approach this study advocates that drought risk evaluation should not only rely on hazard exclusively or integrate it with vulnerability such as presented by yujie liu chen 2021 but should also consider community resilience khoshnazar et al 2021 spinoni et al 2020b sajjad chan 2019 while the presented geographical drought risk distribution helps pin pointing priority intervention areas high risk regions i e hot spots from this study could further be focused on evaluating the inequalities in socio economic drought risks in those particular tehsils fig 9 via integrating gridded administrative level population and gdp datasets providing an important and interesting research question for future research the drought risk hot spots presented in this study provide means to scale down important areas for further evaluations interventions and resource allocation related decision making while there is no hazard vulnerability and resilience integrated drought risk assessment available in pakistan the national scale high resolution administrative unit level drought evaluation such as presented here is also absent therefore even though no comparable studies are available to compare our results the regional droughts distribution and trends identified in our study are in line with similar localized studies for instance dhi distribution in kpk presented in our study i e more severe conditions in southern regions of the province is in line with the one reported by rahman et al 2021 similar findings on the spatial temporal trends in the kpk province are also reported rahman et al 2022 adnan et al 2015 characterized drought hazards in sindh province during 1951 2010 and reported northern and central regions being more vulnerable to droughts similar to the one observed in our assessment fig 5 while the spatial drought distribution presented in this study figs 5 and 8 provides a roadmap to prioritize different regions for immediate or gradual actions in the context of mitigation and adaptation the intensifying spei cold spots statistically significant dry regions 95 confidence pinpoints tehsils where droughts are likely to become more prominent this situation prerequisites special attention from local governments to devise and implement appropriate measures to avoid drought associated impacts on health agriculture livestock and ecosystems ahmad et al 2020 undrr 2021 the results show that the intensification of droughts is the most obvious in balochistan and sindh provinces in general the areas with lower resilience high vulnerability fig 8 and highest drought hazard are dominated by higher drought risk another possible reason behind high risk dominance in sindh province could be the long term statistically significant downward trends in rainfall over the past half century recently identified by ali et al 2021 hence additional mitigation measures are needed in these regions it is interesting to note that kpk being relatively more vulnerable and less resilient has a low intermediate drought risk figs 8 and 9 potentially due to the lower level of drought hazard in this part of the study area fig 5 such evaluation is particularly important for targeted interventions regarding hazard mitigation vulnerability reduction and resilience improvements for instance vulnerability and resilience are the aspects that need particular attention in kpk province the multi dimensional evaluation provided in this study could help design more effective decision making and resource allocation to mitigate cope and adapt to drought risks for instance fig 10 represents the behavior of identified hot cold spots throughout the study period i e 2000 2018 in pakistan furthermore the sensitivity evaluation of these hot cold spots provides information on the emergence of hot cold spots in space and time fig 10 at different confidences representing a broader geographical perspective to pin point regions of high risk integrating adopting such assessments in the national and sub national disaster risk management interventions by the relevant authorities e g the national and provincial disaster management authorities in pakistan can progressively support mitigating drought impacts the assessment presented in this study is essential to estimate monitoring and managing drought impacts while droughts affect agricultural yield worldwide basso ritchie 2014 and create challenges like water scarcity pakistan is no exception waseem et al 2022 chen li 2016 dobson et al 2020 eslamian eslamian 2017 as the country is also among the water scarce nations mekonnen hoekstra 2016 given a higher drought risk in sindh and balochistan fig 9 special attention should be paid to risk hot spots and higher drought condition areas identified in this study 5 conclusions based on the integration of drought hazard vulnerability and resilience dhi dvi and drei respectively a drought risk index dri is developed for pakistan furthermore several geoinformation tools are applied to identify temporal trends spatial patterns and significant hot cold spots across the study area a north south geographical disparity is observed in dhi while the drought intensities were higher in southern regions than in northern regions balochistan and sindh provinces faced higher drought intensity while khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab provinces encountered better conditions moreover the results showed that there has been a slight increase in the proportion of hot spots in the recent decade the worst dri results are seen in balochistan province followed by sindh under both time steps of the drought index higher drought risk is dominant in regions with lower resilience high vulnerability and highest drought hazard the lisa based assessment showed that a large proportion of tehsils of the country is identified as hot spots of high dri in pakistan overall considerable measures are recommended in the highest drought risk areas identified in this study this research comes in handy for decision making policy responses and resource allocation in pakistan to reduce drought impacts we encourage implementing the newly introduced drought risk assessment framework that considers resilience besides hazard and vulnerability in other countries especially those expected to face droughts and water scarcity as an effect of climate change credit authorship contribution statement ali

210098 china corresponding author the numerical error of the xinanjiang xaj model has long been ignored despite its wide application in china separating the mathematically formulated model from the computationally formulated model and further solving by an appropriate time stepping scheme provides a chance to systematically examine the numerical error of the xaj model because the exact analytical solution is difficult to obtain owing to its nonlinearity the mathematically formulated model is proposed by deriving a state space representation of the xaj model by identifying the state variables fluxes and governing differential equations five experiments were conducted around the original xaj model and its state space representation with different parameter groups input series and time stepping schemes to examine the numerical error at the submodule and model levels we found that only the tension water storage capacity curve submodule of the original xaj model is numerical error free and the adaptive step explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme is the most efficient because it balances the accuracy efficiency and physical constraint preservation the numerical error of the total amount of the discharge at the watershed outlet within a time period q produced by the original xaj model is relatively large which mainly comes from the free water storage capacity curve submodule the large numerical error of q occurs with high precipitation intensity and decreases as the flood receded the submodules related to the runoff generation process introduce and amplify numerical errors while the submodules related to the runoff concentration process has the ability to alleviate numerical errors this study helps to deepen our understanding of the numerical error of the xaj model and thus guides its application and modification keywords xinanjiang model submodules numerical errors time stepping scheme computational efficiency physical constraint preservation data availability i have shared the link to my data in the acknowledgment section of the manuscript 1 introduction hydrological models are important tools that reflect our perception of natural hydrological processes and are widely used in flood forecasting huang et al 2022 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2021 water resources management du et al 2020 rebelo et al 2022 and other water related fields chen et al 2021 cornette et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 hydrological models are often classified into two types distributed and lumped models paul et al 2021 the distributed model is the model of the future because it provides a comprehensive insight into internal hydrological processes within a watershed as well as a solid foundation for multidisciplinary research but it has long been criticized due to the high data acquisition and computing power requirements fatichi et al 2016 simmons et al 2020 thus the lumped model is widely employed in practical applications owing to its simplicity and effectiveness zang et al 2021 the most widely used lumped hydrological model in china is the xinanjiang model zhao 1983 zhao 1992 the xinanjiang xaj model has been employed in the china national flood forecasting system wmo 2011 and has been adopted by hydrological departments at different administrative levels including all major river basin authorities across the country the key concept of the xaj model was proposed in 1963 and the first version of the xaj model was developed in 1973 zhao 1983 which matured in the 1980s and was later published in the journal of hydrology zhao 1992 it is common to solve the governing equations of the lumped model approximately rather than exactly since the exact solutions are always unavailable which causes numerical errors clark and kavetski 2010 the xaj model is formulated by integrating equations at a discrete time period and using the value at the beginning or ending of the discrete time period to replace the time period averaged value thus the xaj model is solved approximately which means numerical errors occur in the model within the 30 years since the publication of the xaj model research fields related to the model include model structure improvements jayawardena and zhou 2000 liu et al 2009 yao et al 2014 zang et al 2021 parameter sensitivity analysis hu et al 2019 l√º et al 2013 model parameter optimization cheng et al 2006 li et al 2013 l√º et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 model parameter regionalization li et al 2009 qi et al 2021 zhang and chiew 2009 and real time error correction liang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however to our knowledge only zhao s work zhao 1983 contains a statement regarding the numerical error of the xaj model he emphasized that numerical errors introduced by the forward euler method exist not only in the calculation of the linear reservoir but also in the calculation of evapotranspiration and infiltration among other problems the statement identifies the specific submodules in the xaj model that contain numerical errors and the underlying cause however questions like how many numerical errors existed in the xaj model what is the complete list of submodules that could introduce numerical errors in the xaj model and how do numerical errors interact with the submodules in the xaj model have not yet been answered previous studies have shown that the numerical error of the conceptual lumped hydrological model could degrade the model s performance as well as contaminate the parameter response surfaces clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski and clark 2010 schoups et al 2010 furthermore numerical errors could increase with extreme precipitation under climate change la follette et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to systematically analyze the numerical error of the xaj model the main obstacle in analyzing the numerical error of the xaj model is the absence of an analytical solution for the model to make matters worse the governing equations of the xaj model are implicitly formulated that is the mathematically and computationally formulated xaj models are identical which is a common aspect in the context of the conceptual lumped hydrological model clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski et al 2003 knoben et al 2020 the first step in tackling this obstacle is to separate the mathematically formulated xaj model from the computationally formulated xaj model by setting up a state space representation gupta et al 2012 kavetski and clark 2010 santos et al 2018 in state space representation a system is described by input fluxes output fluxes and state variables that correlate with differential equations santos et al 2018 state space representation provides a more comprehensive and systematic framework to describe multiple watershed hydrological processes and it is easy to introduce diverse numerical methods and implement them in flexible modular modeling frameworks fenicia et al 2011 knoben et al 2019 the state space representation of the xaj model is called the state space xaj model and the original xaj model is hereafter referred to as the reference xaj model the second step in analyzing the numerical errors of the reference xaj model is to solve the state space xaj model approximately with more accurate numerical methods that is time stepping schemes with error control techniques as the analytical solution is impossible to obtain owing to the high nonlinearity of the underlying differential equations this numerical solution is sufficient to approach the analytical solution with controlled numerical errors and could thus be used as a proxy for the analytical solution clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 the selection of time stepping schemes for state space representations is a compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency du and ekaterinaris 2022 time stepping schemes can be classified into explicit and implicit schemes according to the usage of state variables in the future time step and can also be classified into the fixed step scheme and adaptive step scheme based on the scheme that adjusts step size automatically to satisfy user specified error tolerance moin 2010 the simplest time stepping scheme is the first order explicit fixed step euler scheme credited to leonhard euler which is also called the forward euler method zhao 1983 and has long been criticized for its low accuracy and instability when applied to a conceptual lumped hydrological model clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski and clark 2011 kavetski et al 2003 la follette et al 2021 schoups et al 2010 for error control reasons only adaptive step time stepping schemes were used in this study different time stepping schemes have been recommended in previous studies such as the first order implicit fixed step adaptive step euler scheme clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski et al 2006 knoben et al 2020 santos et al 2018 second order explicit adaptive step heun scheme clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 and second order explicit adaptive step trapezoid scheme schoups et al 2010 this indicates the recommendation of time stepping schemes is highly dependent on the state space representation so there is a need to determine the appropriate adaptive step time stepping scheme to solve the state space xaj model the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 to build up the state space xaj model from the reference xaj model specify the state variables fluxes differential equations and model parameters of the state space xaj model and provide a full list of the submodules in the reference xaj model that could introduce numerical errors 2 to comprehensively evaluate adaptive step time stepping schemes and select an appropriate scheme for the state space xaj model 3 to determine the magnitude of the numerical error in the reference xaj model and the propagation of the numerical error between submodules in the reference xaj model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the state space xaj model we derived section 3 introduces time stepping schemes and the numerical experimental designs including data and parameters section 4 presents the results of five designed numerical experiments section 5 discusses the results of the experiments around the specific objectives of this study section 6 provides the conclusions of this paper 2 the xinanjiang model the xinanjiang xaj model zhao 1983 zhao 1992 is a conceptual lumped hydrological model that has a wide range of applications in china the key concept of the model is the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism that is there is no runoff generated until the tension water capacity is satisfied the xaj model takes a downward approach kleme≈° 1983 which means that the total amount of runoff generated is first evaluated and then further divided into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater the time step of the reference xaj model can be a daily or hourly step but only the daily step is used in this study section 2 1 introduces the modules and submodules of the xaj model and section 2 2 presents the state space representation of the xaj model the submodules of the reference xaj model which could introduce numerical errors are described in section 2 3 notations involved in this study and the derivation of the state space representation of the xaj model were provided in sections s1 and s2 of the supplementary material respectively 2 1 the modules and submodules of the xaj model the xaj model can be divided into four modules runoff generation runoff separation slope concentration and river net concentration the runoff generation and runoff separation modules are related to the runoff generation process and the slope concentration and river net concentration modules are related to the runoff concentration process the four modules are composed of six submodules evapotranspiration calculation ec tension water storage capacity curve twscc free water storage capacity curve fwscc interflow linear reservoir ilrs groundwater linear reservoir glrs and nash unit hydrograph nuh the module partition method is slightly different from the one presented by zhao 1992 as the original evapotranspiration calculation module is integrated into the original runoff generation module and the original runoff concentration module is spilt into a slope concentration module and a river net concentration module the module partition method used here provides convenience for the derivation of the state space xaj model and does not change the structure of the reference xaj model a schematic diagram of the xaj model which illustrates the structure of the model combined with the four modules and six submodules is shown in fig 1 the inputs of the xaj model are observed watershed averaged precipitation p in fig 1 and observed pan evaporation e obs in fig 1 and the outputs are actual evapotranspiration e t in fig 1 and discharge at the watershed outlet q in fig 1 the runoff generation module contains the evapotranspiration calculation ec submodule and the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule because the evapotranspiration and runoff calculation procedures are tightly coupled p and e obs came into the ec submodule to evaluate net precipitation as well as actual evapotranspiration from three different soil layers e u e l and e d in fig 1 based on the watershed averaged tension water storages of these soil layers w u w l and w d in fig 1 the twscc submodule calculates runoff r in fig 1 based on the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and the distribution curve of the single point field capacity within the watershed the runoff separation module aims to divide r into the surface runoff r t in fig 1 interflow r i in fig 1 and groundwater r g in fig 1 and contains the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule the slope concentration module is used to route surface runoff interflow and groundwater from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel the r i and r g are routed by the interflow linear reservoir ilrs submodule and groundwater linear reservoir glrs submodule respectively and produce discharge from the interflow q i in fig 1 and groundwater linear reservoir q g in fig 1 in the slope concentration module r t is routed to the adjacent river channel directly the input of the river net concentration module is the total outflow from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel q t in fig 1 that is the summation of r t q i and q g the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule is used to route water in the river channel network to the watershed outlet in the river net concentration module which forms a discharge at the watershed outlet q in fig 1 the number of cascading linear reservoir in the nuh submodule was set to three according to a previous study singh 1977 2 2 the state space representation of the xaj model the first and most important step to derive the state space representation of the xaj model the state space xaj model was to identify the state variables and fluxes the state variables describe the physical quantities of hydrological processes whose dimensions are independent of time la follette et al 2021 there are nine state variables in the xaj model table 1 the

reservoirs f 1 f 2 and f 3 of the river net concentration module the fluxes describe the change in state variables over time thus the dimensions of fluxes are time dependent there are 23 fluxes in the xaj model including two input fluxes observed watershed averaged precipitation p and observed pan evaporation e obs the fluxes and the dependence of state variables are shown in table 1 once the state variables and fluxes of the xaj model are identified differential equations can be used to describe the connection between the state variables and fluxes and how the state variables change across time forming the state space xaj model taking the fwscc submodule as an example the watershed averaged free water storage s 0 state variable was augmented by generated runoff r flux and decreased by generating surface runoff r t flux interflow r i flux and groundwater r g flux the governing differential equation of the fwscc submodule could be expressed as 1 d s 0 d t p n r s r i r g f w a imp where t denotes time d f w denotes the proportion of the saturated area within the watershed a imp denotes the proportion of impervious watershed area the differential equations of the state space xaj model could be expressed as 2 d d t w u w l w d s 0 o i o g f 1 f 2 f 3 p n r e u i u i u e l i l i l e d p n r s r i r g f w a imp r i q i r g q g q t q 1 q 1 q 2 q 2 q 3 where p n denotes net precipitation mm d i u is the recharge rate from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer mm d i l is recharge rate from the lower soil layer to the deep soil layer mm d q 1 q 2 and q 3 are the outflow discharges of the first second and third cascading linear reservoir mm d the equations of fluxes in eq 2 are presented in table 1 there are 14 tuneable parameters in the state space xaj model and the meaning and range of these parameters are listed in table 2 the parameters of the reference xaj model are the same as those of the state space xaj in the count meaning range and quantitative value but are somewhat different in units the unit of k i and k g of the reference xaj model is which makes the only difference between the parameters of the state space xaj model and the reference xaj model 2 3 the numerical error prone submodules of the xaj model the submodules of the reference xaj model which could introduce numerical errors can be identified by comparing the computational formulations of the reference xaj model and the analytical temporal integrations of corresponding equations of the state space xaj model taking the ec submodule as an example the computational formulations of the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the upper soil layer within a time period e u under the condition that 0 w u w um and the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer within a time period e l under the conditions that w u 0 and c w lm w l w lm could be expressed as 3 e u t e n t 4 e l t e n t w l t w lm where t denotes the beginning of a time period d e n t denotes the total amount of net evapotranspiration within a time period mm w l t denotes the watershed averaged tension water storage of the lower soil layer at the time t mm the corresponding equations of e u and e l under the same conditions of the state space xaj model could be expressed as 5 e u t e n t 6 e l t w l t w lm e n t where e n denotes the net evapotranspiration mm d e n is constant within a time period thus the e n t could be represented as 7 e n t t t Œ¥ t e n t d t e n t Œ¥ t where Œ¥ t denotes the length of the time period the analytical temporal integrations of e u and e l over the same time period could be derived as 8 e u t t t Œ¥ t e u t d t e n t 9 e l t t t Œ¥ t e l t d t e n t w lm Œ¥ t t t Œ¥ t w l t d t the calculation of e u in the reference xaj model does not introduce numerical errors since the eqs 3 and 8 are identical however w l t Œ¥ t is used to replace t t Œ¥ t w l t d t in the calculation of e l in the reference xaj model as shown in the eqs 4 and 9 which means the calculation of e l could introduce numerical errors so the ec submodule of the reference xaj model is numerical error prone in section s3 of the supplemental material the numerical error identification process for the remaining five submodules of the reference xaj model is described the identification results showed that except for the twscc submodule see s3 2 of the supplemental material for details all six submodules of the reference xaj model could introduce numerical errors 3 time stepping schemes and numerical experiments 3 1 time stepping schemes in most cases the time stepping scheme is used to get the numerical solution of a state space represented model since the exact solution is unavailable two implicit and five explicit time stepping schemes were used in this study and their accuracy orders ranged from 1 to 8 table 3 the first letter in the symbol indicates whether the time stepping scheme is implicit i or explicit e and the last letter in the symbol denotes the accuracy order of the time stepping scheme the time stepping schemes used here can also be classified into runge kutta and multistep families hairer et al 1993 previous studies focused on the time stepping schemes of the runge kutta family such as the implicit euler and the explicit heun schemes clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 schoups et al 2010 although the time stepping schemes of the multistep family have advantages in computational efficiency when compared with the one of the runge kutta family ji et al 2018 they received insufficient attention in the context of the conceptual lumped hydrological model thus the explicit adams time stepping scheme of the multistep family was used in this study the seven time stepping schemes used in this study are all provided by a canned ode package implemented with the julia programming language rackauckas and nie 2017 the adaptive stepsize control technique was applied in all time stepping schemes to achieve user prescribed accuracy with minimum computational cost this technique changes the time step based on local error estimation and the scaled error could be expressed as 10 e scaled y n 1 y n 1 œÑ a œÑ r max y n y n 1 where e scaled denotes scaled error y n 1 and y n 1 are the state variable value after a time step calculated by a time stepping scheme and its embedded higher order formula mm œÑ a denotes absolute error tolerance mm œÑ r denotes relative error tolerance y n and y n 1 are the state variable value at the current time and a time step ago mm 3 2 numerical experiments we designed five numerical experiments based on reductionist considerations the numerical error of submodules of the reference xaj model and the state space xaj model was tested in the first four experiments the last experiment focused on the numerical error of the entire reference xaj model while the output of the state space xaj model was treated as the analytical solution a total of 1 000 parameter groups were sampled using the symmetric latin hypercube slh method gong et al 2015 from the parameters and ranges of the xaj model listed in table 2 the slh method was chosen for its effectiveness and efficiency in exploring the parameter space all seven time stepping schemes listed in table 3 were used to solve the state space xaj model in these five experiments for evaluating numerical errors the root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse total out of bounds error tobe and original error oe were adopted the equations of

physically constrained maximum of the i th state variable max t 1 n z i t is used when there is no maximum physical constraint mm the details of five numerical experiments are summarized in table 4 3 2 1 experiment 1 in the evapotranspiration calculation ec submodule of the reference xaj model the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer of a time period is evaluated with the watershed averaged tension water storage of the lower soil layer w l at the beginning of the time period which could introduce numerical error experiment 1 was designed to explore the numerical error of the ec submodule the watershed averaged tension water storage of the upper w u lower w l and deep soil layer w d were set to 0 watershed averaged tension water storage capacity of the lower w lm and deep soil layer w dm respectively as the initial condition the input fluxes of experiment 1 are observed watershed averaged precipitation p and pan evaporation e obs and the total amount of p and e obs was set to 0 and 1 c w lm fifty input patterns with constant intensity were used with the length of input patterns ranging from 1 to 50 50 constant the specified initial condition and inputs were adopted to guarantee only the actual evapotranspiration rate from the lower soil layer e l is evaluated in this experiment while the constant intensity input series were used to derive an analytical solution the coefficient of potential evapotranspiration to pan evaporation k e was set to 1 while other parameters w um w lm and w dm were extracted from the sampled 1 000 parameter groups in experiments 1 to 4 œÑ a and œÑ r were set to 10 4 mm and 0 01 for all time stepping schemes the analytical solutions of the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer within a time period e l are detailed in section s4 1 of the supplementary material and could be expressed as 15 e l t t t Œ¥ t e l t d t w lm exp e obs w lm t w lm exp e obs w lm t Œ¥ t 3 2 2 experiment 2 the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule is used to generate runoff r while the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule divides r into surface runoff generated on the pervious area r s as well as interflow r i and groundwater flow r g generated within the watershed the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model is numerical error free because the analytical solution of the corresponding formulation is used the primary purpose of experiment 2 was to explore the numerical error of the twscc submodule of the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes and the fwscc submodule zero initial condition was used in this experiment which means w u w l w d and the watershed averaged free water storage s 0 was set to 0 at the beginning the total amount of p and e obs series were set to the maximum single point free water storage capacity within the watershed s mm and 0 respectively to exclude the impact of the ec submodule a total of fifty hybrid input patterns including five constant intensity patterns with a length of 1 10 20 50 and 100 and forty five variable intensity patterns generated randomly 50 hybrid were adopted the outflow coefficient of interflow k i and groundwater k g were both set to 0 and s mm was set to the maximum single point tension water storage capacity within the watershed w mm to derive an analytical solution the remaining parameters were extracted from the sampled 1 000 parameter groups the complete simulation count was 400 000 50 input patterns 1000 parameter groups the reference xaj model the state space xaj model with 7 time stepping schemes the analytical solutions of the total amount of the generated runoff r and surface runoff generated on the pervious area r s within a

corresponding to a given w 0 at the beginning of a time period w 0 denotes the watershed averaged tension water storage mm 3 2 3 experiment 3 the interflow and groundwater linear reservoir submodule ilrs and glrs within the slope concentration module describes the process of routing generated interflow r i and groundwater r g from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel which contains two parameters the interflow c i and groundwater c g storage recession coefficient the output fluxes of the ilrs and glrs submodules are discharge from the interflow linear reservoir q i and the groundwater linear reservoir q g the ilrs and glrs submodules of the reference xaj model could introduce numerical error because the q i and q g at the beginning of a time period were used as the averaged values of the time period experiment 3 was designed to explore the numerical error of the ilrs and glrs submodules the storage of interflow o i and groundwater o g linear reservoirs were set to 0 as the initial condition the input fluxes of experiment 3 are r i and r g and the total amount of r i and r g were both set to 1 the 50 constant input patterns were adopted and the constant intensity of the input series was used to derive the analytical solution the parameters c i and c g were extracted from the 1000 parameter groups the analytical solutions of the total amount of discharge from the interflow linear reservoir q i and the groundwater linear reservoir q g within a time period are detailed in section s4 3 of the supplementary material and could be expressed as 18 q i t r i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c i exp t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c i exp t Œ¥ t ln c i 19 q g t r g Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c g exp t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c g exp t Œ¥ t ln c g 3 2 4 experiment 4 we designed experiment 4 to explore the numerical error of the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule of both the reference and state space xaj model the input and output flux of the nuh submodule is the total outflow from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel q t and the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir q 3 in the reference xaj model q 3 at the beginning of a time period is the analytical solution but using this value to replace the total amount of the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir within the time period q 3 could introduce numerical error in experiment 4 the storage value of the first f 1 second f 2 and third f 3 cascading linear reservoir was set to 0 at the initial time the total amount of input flux q t was set to 1 and the 50 hybrid input patterns were adopted the only parameter of the nuh submodule is the outflow coefficient of the nash cascading linear reservoir k f and the parameter was extracted from the 1000 parameter groups the analytical solution of q 3 could be derived but the analytical solution of q 3 is difficult to derive so we first verified the accuracy of the q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model with the analytical solution of q 3 once the accuracy was validated q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model was treated as the analytical solution of q 3 the analytical solution of q 3 was provided in section s4 4 of the supplementary material and could be expressed as 20 u Œ¥ t t exp t k f exp Œ¥ t k f i 1 3 t Œ¥ t k f 3 i 3 i i 1 3 t k f 3 i 3 i 21 q 3 t q t t u Œ¥ t t where is the convolution symbol 3 2 5 experiment 5 the numerical error of the reference xaj model was explored in experiment 5 all state variables listed in table 1 were set to 0 as the initial condition and all parameters listed in table 2 were extracted from the 1000 parameter groups in experiment 5 œÑ a and œÑ r were set to the same value for all time stepping schemes and four error tolerance values were selected 10 1 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 the input of this experiment was the daily hydrometeorological series with a duration of seven years from the tunxi watershed including p and e obs 1 tunxi the tunxi watershed is a typical humid hilly watershed in southeast china with annual precipitation of about 1750 mm and a drainage area of 2690 km2 the first year s data of input were used for spinning up to alleviate the influence of the zero initial conditions the total amounts of the fluxes of both the reference xaj model and the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes were saved daily for comparison which includes r r t r i r g q i q g q t and q 3 the complete simulation count of experiment 5 was 29 000 1 tunxi 1000 parameter groups the reference xaj model the state space xaj model with 7 time stepping schemes 4 error tolerance values 4 results 4 1 the numerical error of the submodules experiments 1 to 4 illustrate the numerical error of the submodules of the xaj model these four experiments are all composed of one or two submodules from the reference xaj model and each experiment produced 400 000 output series the numerical error of each output series was evaluated by rmse see eq 11 for the definition of this the results of the four experiments are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a presents the 400 000 rmse values of the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer within a time period e l produced by the evapotranspiration calculation ec submodule in experiment 1 the boxplots represent the distribution of the rmse values by 25 50 median and 75 quantile as well as outliers which are grouped by the submodule of the reference xaj model and the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes the results indicated that the ec submodule from the reference xaj model had much larger rmse values at orders of 101 to 105 in terms of the median the maximum and median of rmse of e l produced by the submodule from the reference xaj model are 30 03 and 0 02 mm respectively while the maximum and median of rmse of e l produced by the submodule from the state space xaj model associated with er4 see table 3 for the definition of this and other scheme abbreviations are 4 76 10 4 and 3 20 10 7 mm respectively which are at the order of 105 among all the time stepping schemes used ie1 has the worst performance with maximum and median of rmse as high as 0 27 and 1 83 10 3 mm respectively when compared with the others the performance of ie1 is consistent in all four experiments fig 2 b to f and the poor performance could be attributed to the first order accuracy of ie1 experiment 2 focused on the numerical errors of the total amount of runoff r generated by the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule and the total amount of the surface runoff generated on the pervious area r s produced by the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule within a time period the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model is the analytical solution of the corresponding formulation which means there is no numerical error in the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model and is verified by the numerical experiment fig 2 b in most cases the rrmse values of r produced by the twscc submodule of the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes are less than 0 38 except for ie1 and the maximum rrmse of er4 is smaller than 0 01 which means that the numerical error of the twscc submodule of the state space xaj model solved by different time stepping schemes can be ignored fig 2 c indicates that the fwscc submodule of the reference xaj model produces larger rmse values of r s than that from the state space xaj model at least of the order of 101 as the median of rrmse can be as high as 4 49 as can be seen from fig 2 b to c ir5 outperforms the others from the perspective of the median whereas er4 has the best performance from the perspective of the maximum experiment 3 evaluated the numerical errors of the interflow ilrs and groundwater glrs linear reservoir submodules as they had the same initial states and input series but different outflow coefficients as shown in fig 2 d to e the submodules of the reference xaj model produce significantly large rmse values than those of the state space xaj model the maximum rrmse values of the total amount of discharge from the interflow q i and groundwater q g linear reservoir within a time period produced by submodules of the reference xaj model are 96 54 and 99 53 respectively which means that a large unexpected numerical error is introduced all time stepping schemes except ie1 show comparable performance in experiment 3 the maximum rrmse values of q i and q g produced by submodules of the state space xaj model associated with er4 are 3 12 10 4 and 1 46 10 3 respectively this means that the numerical error produced by the ilrs and glrs submodule of the state space xaj model can be ignored experiment 4 was designed to evaluate the numerical error of the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule in the reference xaj model the analytical solution of the nash unit hydrograph at the beginning of a time period is used to replace the average value of the time period which causes numerical errors because the analytical solution of the total amount of outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir within a time period q 3 is difficult to obtain q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model is treated as an analytical solution once the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir q 3 is comparable with the analytical solution of q 3 fig 2 f indicates the rmse of q 3 produce by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model associated with all time stepping schemes except ie1 is sufficiently small and the maximum of rrmse is smaller than 0 45 except for ie1 once the q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model is treated as an analytical solution the numerical error of the nuh submodule of the reference xaj model can be assessed as shown in fig 2 g the rmse of q 3 are similar regardless of the time stepping scheme used the median of rrmse of q 3 is 86 04 when compared with q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model associated with er4 which is a very large numerical error magnitude to conclude with these results in all four experiments the submodule from the reference xaj model produces a higher numerical error than those from the state space xaj model and usually comes at a rate greater than 10 times which indicates the benefit of the state space xaj model the performance of the state space xaj model strongly depends on the time stepping scheme there is no single time stepping scheme that outperforms the others for all four experiments but ie1 does have the worst performance across the four experiments 4 2 the computational efficiency of time stepping schemes owing to the nonlinearity of the state space xaj model the analytical solution is difficult to obtain and a time stepping scheme is required to derive an approximate solution experiment 1 to 4 assessed the numerical error associated with seven different time stepping schemes with identical error tolerances with œÑ r 0 01 and œÑ a 10 4 mm in addition to the numerical error computational efficiency also plays an important role in the selection of time stepping schemes before evaluating the numerical error of the entire xaj model the computational efficiency of the state space xaj model associated with different time stepping schemes was first assessed in experiment 5 the average count of the function evaluations of a single time step was selected as an objective metric of computational efficiency fig 3 a summarizes the number of function evaluations of the state space xaj model with different time stepping schemes with œÑ r 0 01 and œÑ a 10 4 mm the median number of the function evaluations of ie1 ev3 er4 ir5 ed5 et7 and et8 are 6801 25 86 43 35 130 and 84 respectively which indicates that the ie1 time stepping scheme requires far more computational time than the others and ev3 has the fastest running speed in addition the total running time of the state space xaj model with 1 000 parameter groups associated with ie1 ev3 er4 ir5 ed5 et7 and et8 time stepping schemes are 104636 7 461 1 1058 4 953 8 539 7 1533 1 and 1050 0 s respectively intel i5 9400f 2 90 ghz cpu 16 gb ram implemented with julia programming language fig 3 c indicates the trend of the median number of function evaluations with error tolerance for various time stepping schemes the ranking of different time stepping schemes is relatively stable although the decrease in error tolerance the ie1 has the most median number of function evaluations for all the error tolerance values selected while the ev3 has the least median number for corresponding cases furthermore the median number of function evaluations of the ie1 time stepping schemes increases much more rapidly than others with the decrease in error tolerance 4 3 the physical constraint preservation of time stepping schemes in the context of hydrological models many physical quantities have a physical constraint for example the soil moisture content should be non negative and no greater than the saturation moisture content all nine state variables in the state space xaj model see table 1 should be non negative and four of them have a maximum threshold that is the watershed averaged tension water storage of different soil layers w u w l and w d and the watershed averaged free water storage s 0 the physical constraint preservation property of the physical quantities in the reference xaj model is ensured by using the zeroing negative fluxes method clark and kavetski 2010 that is a flux becomes zero once the physical quantity exceeds its boundary at the expense of accuracy the physical constraint preservation property is difficult to meet in the state space xaj model without specific treatment in other words the out of bounds error does exist in these cases which is also reported in similar researches clark and kavetski 2010 santos et al 2018 as the out of bounds error is highly dependent on the time stepping scheme used and has unexpected side effects the out of bounds error of the state space xaj model associated with different time stepping schemes is evaluated after the computational efficiency for an output series produced by the state space xaj model solved by a time stepping scheme the out of bounds error is evaluated by using tobe see eq 12 for the definition of this in experiment 5 each time stepping scheme produced 1 000 output series which means 1 000 tobe values were calculated correspondingly as can be seen in fig 3 b the median of tobe values of ie1 ev3 er4 ir5 ed5 et7 and et8 are 0 013 2 676 0 007 0 303 1 570 0 436 and 2 247 mm respectively er4 has the lowest tobe values and ie1 shares the same magnitude the tobe values of the ev3 ed5 and et8 are relatively high and larger than 1 mm for most cases the result indicates that er4 and ie1 have the best physical constraint preservation among all seven time stepping schemes in the case of the state space xaj model 4 4 the numerical error of the reference xaj model the analytical solution of the state space xaj model is required to assess the numerical error of the reference xaj model owing to the nonlinear nature of the state space xaj model the analytical solution was difficult to obtain thus an approximate solution associated with a certain time stepping scheme was used as an analytical solution in experiment 5 among seven different time stepping schemes used in experiment 5 the approximate solution produced by er4 is chosen to function as the analytical solution because it has the minimum out of bounds error acceptable computational efficiency and consistently better performance in experiments 1 to 4 the original error oe see eq 14 for the definition of this series of the total amount of the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir within a time period q 3 could be evaluated by reducing the output series of q 3 of the reference xaj model by the analytical solution q 3 could be converted to the total amount of the discharge at the watershed outlet within a time period q with unit conversion and it was used here for the convenience of analyzing a total of 1 000 oe series of q 3 can be derived in experiment 5 and are shown in fig 4 with a 90 probability range median and corresponding precipitation as shown in fig 4 the oe of q 3 produced by the reference xaj model increased with precipitation during the flood period and can be positive or negative the negative value of oe of q 3 occurs before the positive one frequently with a larger magnitude the larger magnitude of negative value could be attributed to the runoff generation module of the reference xaj model because the oe values of r are usually smaller than 0 the oe of q 3 decreases as the flood recedes but the numerical error of q 3 exists consistently as the minimum 90 probability range of oe of q 3 is 0 009 mm the high oe value of q 3 occurring with heavy precipitation indicated the runoff generation and separation module of the reference xaj model have a relatively bigger influence on the numerical error because only the generated runoff r and the surface runoff generated within the watershed r t occur when there is precipitation the numerical error of the total amount of eight fluxes of the reference xaj model within a time period is further analysed with rmse as shown in fig 5 the total amount of generated runoff within a time period r has the second smallest rmse when compared with others the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule of the reference xaj model amplified the numerical error as the median of rmse for r is 0 06 mm while the median of rmse for r t is 0 60 mm the two submodules in the slope concentration module of the reference xaj model both alleviated the numerical error for the interflow linear reservoir ilrs submodule the median of rmse for r i is 0 5 mm and the median rmse for q i decreased to 0 3 mm for the groundwater linear reservoir glrs submodule the median rmse for r g is 0 60 mm and the median rmse for q g decreased significantly to 0 03 mm the input of the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule is q t and the median rmse for q t is 0 67 mm the nuh submodule of the reference xaj model could moderate the numerical error as the minimum lower quantile and median of q 3 are smaller than those of q t however the nuh submodule could have the possibility to amplify numerical error because the upper quantile and maximum of q 3 are bigger than those of q t as suggested by the result shown in fig 5 the numerical error of the reference xaj model cannot be ignored as the median and maximum of rmse for q 3 are 0 41 and 4 64 mm and the numerical error of q 3 mainly comes from the fwscc submodule 5 discussion 5 1 the full list of submodules containing numerical errors in the book that introduces the xaj model systematically zhao 1983 only some submodules that could introduce numerical errors are identified such as the evapotranspiration calculation submodule interflow linear reservoir submodule and groundwater linear reservoir submodule in this study a possible list of the submodules that could introduce numerical errors is identified by comparing the computational formulations of the reference xaj model and the analytical temporal integrations of corresponding equations of the state space xaj model the possible list was further verified through four designed numerical experiments the results of experiment 1 to 4 show that the median rmse of e l r r s q i q g and q 3 are 0 02 0 00 0 22 1 49 10 3 1 78 10 4 and 2 70 10 3 mm respectively which means that only the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule introduce no numerical errors thus verifying the credibility of the possible list thus the full list of submodules that could introduce numerical errors of the reference xaj model daily time step is evapotranspiration calculation ec free water storage capacity curve fwscc interflow linear reservoir ilrs groundwater linear reservoir glrs and nash unit hydrograph nuh the identification of the complete list of submodules could introduce numerical errors of a specific hydrological model such as xaj model used model in this study has two potential benefits to the hydrological modeling community given the abundance of hydrological models paul et al 2021 it is challenging to thoroughly examine the numerical error of each model however a number of submodules are utilized across various models such as the linear reservoir mentioned in this study and fuse 070 clark and kavetski 2010 the first benefit is that users of a model could know in advance whether the model is prone to numerical error based on the existence of submodules that could introduce numerical errors that have been confirmed by previous researches additionally because distributed hydrological models and land surface models are computationally intensive structures that do not require sophisticated numerical techniques are typically preferred the candidate list of such kind of structure could be expanded during the identification process for example the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model could be used for runoff generation calculation and is free of numerical error therefore it could be added to the candidate list 5 2 recommendation for the time stepping scheme the adaptive step explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme er4 is recommended for the state space xaj model this scheme provides the best compromise between accuracy computational expense and preservation of physical constraint besides er4 is also a classical time stepping scheme with abundant instruction which makes it a practical choice this recommendation is similar to those made by clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 and schoups et al 2010 as an adaptive step explicit runge kutta family time stepping scheme with an accuracy order greater than 1 however this study does not recommend the adaptive step first order implicit euler scheme ie1 recommended by santos 2018 owing to the relatively high numerical error shown in experiments 1 to 4 and the computational expenses shown in experiment 5 the implicit time stepping scheme has the advantage of robustness clark and kavetski 2010 however the implicit time stepping schemes used in this study ie1 and ir5 did not show clear superiority there was no stiffness hairer and wanner 1999 hairer et al 1993 detected in five experiments which is the possible reason for that the stiffness is related to model structure initial condition forcing data and parameter set in this study the initial conditions of the state space xaj model were set to 0 as is common practice though we did not cover all the forcing data and parameter spaces it can be inferred the stiffness did not frequently occur in the state space xaj model based on considering the reasonably large combinations of input conditions and parameter sets which could stand for common and typical cases furthermore the time stepping schemes used in previous studies mainly come from the runge kutta family and those from the multistep family are insufficiently evaluated the adaptive step explicit third order adams scheme ev3 from the multistep family used in this study demonstrates the combination of the lowest computational expense fig 3 a and the highest out of bounds error of the model state variables fig 3 b the out of bounds error which is related to the physical constraint preserving property of a time stepping scheme could cause side effects such as unexpected program interruption oscillation and mass imbalance the common treatment to eliminate the out of bounds error could be divided into two ways the first way is to fix the out of bounds error every step at the expense of accuracy clark and kavetski 2010 while the second way is to select a time stepping scheme with the lowest out of bounds error values through several comparisons la follette et al 2021 however those two ways cannot satisfy the preservation of physical constraints and the requirement of accuracy at the same time a new or modified time stepping scheme which is strictly physical constraint preservation christlieb et al 2015 and achieves a balance between accuracy and speed desires future researches 5 3 the numerical error of the reference xaj model there was a relatively large numerical error in the total amount of the discharge at the watershed outlet within a time period q of the reference xaj model as shown by experiment 5 the median and maximum of rmse for q associated with 1000 parameter groups are 12 86 and 144 46 m3 s considering similar problems also exist in other hydrological models such as lumped hydrological model clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 santos et al 2018 schoups et al 2010 and land surface models clark et al 2021 this study could function as another attempt to make the community aware of the problem of uncontrolled numerical error in hydrological models in general submodules ec and fwscc related to the runoff generation process could cause and amplify numerical errors while submodules ilrs glrs and nuh related to the runoff concentration process have the ability to reduce numerical errors to some extent for the case of reference xaj model for the nuh submodule there exists a threshold for the rmse of q t that decreases with the increasement of the parameter k f the rmse of q t could be amplified when smaller than this threshold or reduced when bigger than this threshold after the nuh submodule stability analysis may be able to identify the causes of the amplification or decrease effect which requires further researches although the numerical error of the xaj model was pointed by zhao 1983 forty years ago and similar problems were proposed a dozen years ago for other models clark and kavetski 2010 it appears that the numerical error problems did not attract enough attention according to the results of experiment 5 it could be inferred that the existence of cancel out could partly attribute to this phenomenon firstly there occurs cancel out exists among different fluxes q t is the summation of r t q i and q g and the median of rmse values of q t should be 0 84 mm with no cancel out but the actual value is 0 67 mm indicating the existence of cancel out among fluxes secondly the numerical error prone submodule could have the ability to cancel out several numerical error take the glrs submodule as an example the median of rmse values for r g input of glrs submodule is 0 60 mm while the median of rmse values for q g output of glrs submodule has decreased to 0 03 mm thirdly we found that large oe magnitude of q occurs with high precipitation intensity and decreases as the flood receded fig 4 the decrease of oe during the non flood period could attribute to the dominance of river concentration processes finally a finely tuned parameter set could cancel out numerical error of the model to some extent based on the existence of cancel out a model without special consideration of numerical error and appropriate numerical technique could also provide a satisfactory prediction this is a typical instance of using wrong reasons for right answers kirchner 2009 the modeler could have more confidence in the prediction and the community could understand the hydrological process better by removing the numerical error that could have been avoided 6 summary and conclusions this study aimed to systematically examine the numerical error of the widely used xinanjiang model the reference xaj model in china the state space xaj model was derived from the reference xaj model based on the identification of state variables fluxes and the description of connections between state variables and fluxes with differential equations the model parameters and parameter ranges of the state space xaj model are also provided which are quite similar to those of the reference xaj model a total of five numerical experiments with seven time stepping schemes 1 000 parameter groups and different input series accompanied by both the state space xaj model and the reference xaj model were conducted to study the numerical error at submodule and model levels our findings can be summarized as follows 1 of all six submodules of the reference xaj model at a daily time step only the tension water storage capacity curve twscc is numerical error free as it is exactly the analytical solution which is further verified by experiments 1 to 4 the full list of the submodules that could introduce numerical errors is the evapotranspiration calculation ec free water storage capacity curve fwscc interflow linear reservoir ilrs groundwater linear reservoir glrs and nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule 2 of all seven time stepping schemes with adaptive time steps we recommend the adaptive step explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme as it achieves a good balance between accuracy efficiency and physical constraint preservation this is a classical time stepping scheme with abundant instructions which makes it practical in addition the physical constraint preserving property of state variables should be considered when selecting time stepping schemes 3 there exists a relatively large and thus not neglectable numerical error in the reference xaj model as the median and maximum of the rmse values of q are 12 86 and 144 46 m3 s the large magnitude of oe of q occurs with high precipitation intensity and decreases as the flood receded the free water storage capacity curve submodule of the reference xaj model is the primary source of numerical error the ec and fwscc submodules that represent the runoff generation process in the reference xaj model introduce and amplify numerical errors while the ilrs glrs and nuh submodules that represent the runoff concentration process in the reference xaj model have the ability to alleviate the numerical errors in this study the state space xaj model is derived an appropriate adaptive time stepping scheme for the state space xaj model is chosen and the numerical error of the reference xaj model at the submodule and model levels is quantified this could contribute to the application and modification of the xaj model and the hydrological modelling community credit authorship contribution statement jianfei zhao conceptualization methodology visualization formal analysis writing original draft writing

210098 china corresponding author the numerical error of the xinanjiang xaj model has long been ignored despite its wide application in china separating the mathematically formulated model from the computationally formulated model and further solving by an appropriate time stepping scheme provides a chance to systematically examine the numerical error of the xaj model because the exact analytical solution is difficult to obtain owing to its nonlinearity the mathematically formulated model is proposed by deriving a state space representation of the xaj model by identifying the state variables fluxes and governing differential equations five experiments were conducted around the original xaj model and its state space representation with different parameter groups input series and time stepping schemes to examine the numerical error at the submodule and model levels we found that only the tension water storage capacity curve submodule of the original xaj model is numerical error free and the adaptive step explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme is the most efficient because it balances the accuracy efficiency and physical constraint preservation the numerical error of the total amount of the discharge at the watershed outlet within a time period q produced by the original xaj model is relatively large which mainly comes from the free water storage capacity curve submodule the large numerical error of q occurs with high precipitation intensity and decreases as the flood receded the submodules related to the runoff generation process introduce and amplify numerical errors while the submodules related to the runoff concentration process has the ability to alleviate numerical errors this study helps to deepen our understanding of the numerical error of the xaj model and thus guides its application and modification keywords xinanjiang model submodules numerical errors time stepping scheme computational efficiency physical constraint preservation data availability i have shared the link to my data in the acknowledgment section of the manuscript 1 introduction hydrological models are important tools that reflect our perception of natural hydrological processes and are widely used in flood forecasting huang et al 2022 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2021 water resources management du et al 2020 rebelo et al 2022 and other water related fields chen et al 2021 cornette et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 hydrological models are often classified into two types distributed and lumped models paul et al 2021 the distributed model is the model of the future because it provides a comprehensive insight into internal hydrological processes within a watershed as well as a solid foundation for multidisciplinary research but it has long been criticized due to the high data acquisition and computing power requirements fatichi et al 2016 simmons et al 2020 thus the lumped model is widely employed in practical applications owing to its simplicity and effectiveness zang et al 2021 the most widely used lumped hydrological model in china is the xinanjiang model zhao 1983 zhao 1992 the xinanjiang xaj model has been employed in the china national flood forecasting system wmo 2011 and has been adopted by hydrological departments at different administrative levels including all major river basin authorities across the country the key concept of the xaj model was proposed in 1963 and the first version of the xaj model was developed in 1973 zhao 1983 which matured in the 1980s and was later published in the journal of hydrology zhao 1992 it is common to solve the governing equations of the lumped model approximately rather than exactly since the exact solutions are always unavailable which causes numerical errors clark and kavetski 2010 the xaj model is formulated by integrating equations at a discrete time period and using the value at the beginning or ending of the discrete time period to replace the time period averaged value thus the xaj model is solved approximately which means numerical errors occur in the model within the 30 years since the publication of the xaj model research fields related to the model include model structure improvements jayawardena and zhou 2000 liu et al 2009 yao et al 2014 zang et al 2021 parameter sensitivity analysis hu et al 2019 l√º et al 2013 model parameter optimization cheng et al 2006 li et al 2013 l√º et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 model parameter regionalization li et al 2009 qi et al 2021 zhang and chiew 2009 and real time error correction liang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however to our knowledge only zhao s work zhao 1983 contains a statement regarding the numerical error of the xaj model he emphasized that numerical errors introduced by the forward euler method exist not only in the calculation of the linear reservoir but also in the calculation of evapotranspiration and infiltration among other problems the statement identifies the specific submodules in the xaj model that contain numerical errors and the underlying cause however questions like how many numerical errors existed in the xaj model what is the complete list of submodules that could introduce numerical errors in the xaj model and how do numerical errors interact with the submodules in the xaj model have not yet been answered previous studies have shown that the numerical error of the conceptual lumped hydrological model could degrade the model s performance as well as contaminate the parameter response surfaces clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski and clark 2010 schoups et al 2010 furthermore numerical errors could increase with extreme precipitation under climate change la follette et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to systematically analyze the numerical error of the xaj model the main obstacle in analyzing the numerical error of the xaj model is the absence of an analytical solution for the model to make matters worse the governing equations of the xaj model are implicitly formulated that is the mathematically and computationally formulated xaj models are identical which is a common aspect in the context of the conceptual lumped hydrological model clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski et al 2003 knoben et al 2020 the first step in tackling this obstacle is to separate the mathematically formulated xaj model from the computationally formulated xaj model by setting up a state space representation gupta et al 2012 kavetski and clark 2010 santos et al 2018 in state space representation a system is described by input fluxes output fluxes and state variables that correlate with differential equations santos et al 2018 state space representation provides a more comprehensive and systematic framework to describe multiple watershed hydrological processes and it is easy to introduce diverse numerical methods and implement them in flexible modular modeling frameworks fenicia et al 2011 knoben et al 2019 the state space representation of the xaj model is called the state space xaj model and the original xaj model is hereafter referred to as the reference xaj model the second step in analyzing the numerical errors of the reference xaj model is to solve the state space xaj model approximately with more accurate numerical methods that is time stepping schemes with error control techniques as the analytical solution is impossible to obtain owing to the high nonlinearity of the underlying differential equations this numerical solution is sufficient to approach the analytical solution with controlled numerical errors and could thus be used as a proxy for the analytical solution clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 the selection of time stepping schemes for state space representations is a compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency du and ekaterinaris 2022 time stepping schemes can be classified into explicit and implicit schemes according to the usage of state variables in the future time step and can also be classified into the fixed step scheme and adaptive step scheme based on the scheme that adjusts step size automatically to satisfy user specified error tolerance moin 2010 the simplest time stepping scheme is the first order explicit fixed step euler scheme credited to leonhard euler which is also called the forward euler method zhao 1983 and has long been criticized for its low accuracy and instability when applied to a conceptual lumped hydrological model clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski and clark 2011 kavetski et al 2003 la follette et al 2021 schoups et al 2010 for error control reasons only adaptive step time stepping schemes were used in this study different time stepping schemes have been recommended in previous studies such as the first order implicit fixed step adaptive step euler scheme clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski et al 2006 knoben et al 2020 santos et al 2018 second order explicit adaptive step heun scheme clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 and second order explicit adaptive step trapezoid scheme schoups et al 2010 this indicates the recommendation of time stepping schemes is highly dependent on the state space representation so there is a need to determine the appropriate adaptive step time stepping scheme to solve the state space xaj model the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 to build up the state space xaj model from the reference xaj model specify the state variables fluxes differential equations and model parameters of the state space xaj model and provide a full list of the submodules in the reference xaj model that could introduce numerical errors 2 to comprehensively evaluate adaptive step time stepping schemes and select an appropriate scheme for the state space xaj model 3 to determine the magnitude of the numerical error in the reference xaj model and the propagation of the numerical error between submodules in the reference xaj model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the state space xaj model we derived section 3 introduces time stepping schemes and the numerical experimental designs including data and parameters section 4 presents the results of five designed numerical experiments section 5 discusses the results of the experiments around the specific objectives of this study section 6 provides the conclusions of this paper 2 the xinanjiang model the xinanjiang xaj model zhao 1983 zhao 1992 is a conceptual lumped hydrological model that has a wide range of applications in china the key concept of the model is the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism that is there is no runoff generated until the tension water capacity is satisfied the xaj model takes a downward approach kleme≈° 1983 which means that the total amount of runoff generated is first evaluated and then further divided into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater the time step of the reference xaj model can be a daily or hourly step but only the daily step is used in this study section 2 1 introduces the modules and submodules of the xaj model and section 2 2 presents the state space representation of the xaj model the submodules of the reference xaj model which could introduce numerical errors are described in section 2 3 notations involved in this study and the derivation of the state space representation of the xaj model were provided in sections s1 and s2 of the supplementary material respectively 2 1 the modules and submodules of the xaj model the xaj model can be divided into four modules runoff generation runoff separation slope concentration and river net concentration the runoff generation and runoff separation modules are related to the runoff generation process and the slope concentration and river net concentration modules are related to the runoff concentration process the four modules are composed of six submodules evapotranspiration calculation ec tension water storage capacity curve twscc free water storage capacity curve fwscc interflow linear reservoir ilrs groundwater linear reservoir glrs and nash unit hydrograph nuh the module partition method is slightly different from the one presented by zhao 1992 as the original evapotranspiration calculation module is integrated into the original runoff generation module and the original runoff concentration module is spilt into a slope concentration module and a river net concentration module the module partition method used here provides convenience for the derivation of the state space xaj model and does not change the structure of the reference xaj model a schematic diagram of the xaj model which illustrates the structure of the model combined with the four modules and six submodules is shown in fig 1 the inputs of the xaj model are observed watershed averaged precipitation p in fig 1 and observed pan evaporation e obs in fig 1 and the outputs are actual evapotranspiration e t in fig 1 and discharge at the watershed outlet q in fig 1 the runoff generation module contains the evapotranspiration calculation ec submodule and the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule because the evapotranspiration and runoff calculation procedures are tightly coupled p and e obs came into the ec submodule to evaluate net precipitation as well as actual evapotranspiration from three different soil layers e u e l and e d in fig 1 based on the watershed averaged tension water storages of these soil layers w u w l and w d in fig 1 the twscc submodule calculates runoff r in fig 1 based on the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and the distribution curve of the single point field capacity within the watershed the runoff separation module aims to divide r into the surface runoff r t in fig 1 interflow r i in fig 1 and groundwater r g in fig 1 and contains the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule the slope concentration module is used to route surface runoff interflow and groundwater from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel the r i and r g are routed by the interflow linear reservoir ilrs submodule and groundwater linear reservoir glrs submodule respectively and produce discharge from the interflow q i in fig 1 and groundwater linear reservoir q g in fig 1 in the slope concentration module r t is routed to the adjacent river channel directly the input of the river net concentration module is the total outflow from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel q t in fig 1 that is the summation of r t q i and q g the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule is used to route water in the river channel network to the watershed outlet in the river net concentration module which forms a discharge at the watershed outlet q in fig 1 the number of cascading linear reservoir in the nuh submodule was set to three according to a previous study singh 1977 2 2 the state space representation of the xaj model the first and most important step to derive the state space representation of the xaj model the state space xaj model was to identify the state variables and fluxes the state variables describe the physical quantities of hydrological processes whose dimensions are independent of time la follette et al 2021 there are nine state variables in the xaj model table 1 the watershed averaged tension water storage of the upper soil layer w u lower soil layer w l and deep soil layer w d of the runoff generation module the watershed averaged free water storage s 0 of the runoff separation module the storage of the interflow linear reservoir o i and the groundwater linear reservoir o g of the slope concentration module and the storage of three cascading linear reservoirs f 1 f 2 and f 3 of the river net concentration module the fluxes describe the change in state variables over time thus the dimensions of fluxes are time dependent there are 23 fluxes in the xaj model including two input fluxes observed watershed averaged precipitation p and observed pan evaporation e obs the fluxes and the dependence of state variables are shown in table 1 once the state variables and fluxes of the xaj model are identified differential equations can be used to describe the connection between the state variables and fluxes and how the state variables change across time forming the state space xaj model taking the fwscc submodule as an example the watershed averaged free water storage s 0 state variable was augmented by generated runoff r flux and decreased by generating surface runoff r t flux interflow r i flux and groundwater r g flux the governing differential equation of the fwscc submodule could be expressed as 1 d s 0 d t p n r s r i r g f w a imp where t denotes time d f w denotes the proportion of the saturated area within the watershed a imp denotes the proportion of impervious watershed area the differential equations of the state space xaj model could be expressed as 2 d d t w u w l w d s 0 o i o g f 1 f 2 f 3 p n r e u i u i u e l i l i l e d p n r s r i r g f w a imp r i q i r g q g q t q 1 q 1 q 2 q 2 q 3 where p n denotes net precipitation mm d i u is the recharge rate from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer mm d i l is recharge rate from the lower soil layer to the deep soil layer mm d q 1 q 2 and q 3 are the outflow discharges of the first second and third cascading linear reservoir mm d the equations of fluxes in eq 2 are presented in table 1 there are 14 tuneable parameters in the state space xaj model and the meaning and range of these parameters are listed in table 2 the parameters of the reference xaj model are the same as those of the state space xaj in the count meaning range and quantitative value but are somewhat different in units the unit of k i and k g of the reference xaj model is which makes the only difference between the parameters of the state space xaj model and the reference xaj model 2 3 the numerical error prone submodules of the xaj model the submodules of the reference xaj model which could introduce numerical errors can be identified by comparing the computational formulations of the reference xaj model and the analytical temporal integrations of corresponding equations of the state space xaj model taking the ec submodule as an example the computational formulations of the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the upper soil layer within a time period e u under the condition that 0 w u w um and the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer within a time period e l under the conditions that w u 0 and c w lm w l w lm could be expressed as 3 e u t e n t 4 e l t e n t w l t w lm where t denotes the beginning of a time period d e n t denotes the total amount of net evapotranspiration within a time period mm w l t denotes the watershed averaged tension water storage of the lower soil layer at the time t mm the corresponding equations of e u and e l under the same conditions of the state space xaj model could be expressed as 5 e u t e n t 6 e l t w l t w lm e n t where e n denotes the net evapotranspiration mm d e n is constant within a time period thus the e n t could be represented as 7 e n t t t Œ¥ t e n t d t e n t Œ¥ t where Œ¥ t denotes the length of the time period the analytical temporal integrations of e u and e l over the same time period could be derived as 8 e u t t t Œ¥ t e u t d t e n t 9 e l t t t Œ¥ t e l t d t e n t w lm Œ¥ t t t Œ¥ t w l t d t the calculation of e u in the reference xaj model does not introduce numerical errors since the eqs 3 and 8 are identical however w l t Œ¥ t is used to replace t t Œ¥ t w l t d t in the calculation of e l in the reference xaj model as shown in the eqs 4 and 9 which means the calculation of e l could introduce numerical errors so the ec submodule of the reference xaj model is numerical error prone in section s3 of the supplemental material the numerical error identification process for the remaining five submodules of the reference xaj model is described the identification results showed that except for the twscc submodule see s3 2 of the supplemental material for details all six submodules of the reference xaj model could introduce numerical errors 3 time stepping schemes and numerical experiments 3 1 time stepping schemes in most cases the time stepping scheme is used to get the numerical solution of a state space represented model since the exact solution is unavailable two implicit and five explicit time stepping schemes were used in this study and their accuracy orders ranged from 1 to 8 table 3 the first letter in the symbol indicates whether the time stepping scheme is implicit i or explicit e and the last letter in the symbol denotes the accuracy order of the time stepping scheme the time stepping schemes used here can also be classified into runge kutta and multistep families hairer et al 1993 previous studies focused on the time stepping schemes of the runge kutta family such as the implicit euler and the explicit heun schemes clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 schoups et al 2010 although the time stepping schemes of the multistep family have advantages in computational efficiency when compared with the one of the runge kutta family ji et al 2018 they received insufficient attention in the context of the conceptual lumped hydrological model thus the explicit adams time stepping scheme of the multistep family was used in this study the seven time stepping schemes used in this study are all provided by a canned ode package implemented with the julia programming language rackauckas and nie 2017 the adaptive stepsize control technique was applied in all time stepping schemes to achieve user prescribed accuracy with minimum computational cost this technique changes the time step based on local error estimation and the scaled error could be expressed as 10 e scaled y n 1 y n 1 œÑ a œÑ r max y n y n 1 where e scaled denotes scaled error y n 1 and y n 1 are the state variable value after a time step calculated by a time stepping scheme and its embedded higher order formula mm œÑ a denotes absolute error tolerance mm œÑ r denotes relative error tolerance y n and y n 1 are the state variable value at the current time and a time step ago mm 3 2 numerical experiments we designed five numerical experiments based on reductionist considerations the numerical error of submodules of the reference xaj model and the state space xaj model was tested in the first four experiments the last experiment focused on the numerical error of the entire reference xaj model while the output of the state space xaj model was treated as the analytical solution a total of 1 000 parameter groups were sampled using the symmetric latin hypercube slh method gong et al 2015 from the parameters and ranges of the xaj model listed in table 2 the slh method was chosen for its effectiveness and efficiency in exploring the parameter space all seven time stepping schemes listed in table 3 were used to solve the state space xaj model in these five experiments for evaluating numerical errors the root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse total out of bounds error tobe and original error oe were adopted the equations of

physically constrained maximum of the i th state variable max t 1 n z i t is used when there is no maximum physical constraint mm the details of five numerical experiments are summarized in table 4 3 2 1 experiment 1 in the evapotranspiration calculation ec submodule of the reference xaj model the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer of a time period is evaluated with the watershed averaged tension water storage of the lower soil layer w l at the beginning of the time period which could introduce numerical error experiment 1 was designed to explore the numerical error of the ec submodule the watershed averaged tension water storage of the upper w u lower w l and deep soil layer w d were set to 0 watershed averaged tension water storage capacity of the lower w lm and deep soil layer w dm respectively as the initial condition the input fluxes of experiment 1 are observed watershed averaged precipitation p and pan evaporation e obs and the total amount of p and e obs was set to 0 and 1 c w lm fifty input patterns with constant intensity were used with the length of input patterns ranging from 1 to 50 50 constant the specified initial condition and inputs were adopted to guarantee only the actual evapotranspiration rate from the lower soil layer e l is evaluated in this experiment while the constant intensity input series were used to derive an analytical solution the coefficient of potential evapotranspiration to pan evaporation k e was set to 1 while other parameters w um w lm and w dm were extracted from the sampled 1 000 parameter groups in experiments 1 to 4 œÑ a and œÑ r were set to 10 4 mm and 0 01 for all time stepping schemes the analytical solutions of the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer within a time period e l are detailed in section s4 1 of the supplementary material and could be expressed as 15 e l t t t Œ¥ t e l t d t w lm exp e obs w lm t w lm exp e obs w lm t Œ¥ t 3 2 2 experiment 2 the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule is used to generate runoff r while the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule divides r into surface runoff generated on the pervious area r s as well as interflow r i and groundwater flow r g generated within the watershed the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model is numerical error free because the analytical solution of the corresponding formulation is used the primary purpose of experiment 2 was to explore the numerical error of the twscc submodule of the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes and the fwscc submodule zero initial condition was used in this experiment which means w u w l w d and the watershed averaged free water storage s 0 was set to 0 at the beginning the total amount of p and e obs series were set to the maximum single point free water storage capacity within the watershed s mm and 0 respectively to exclude the impact of the ec submodule a total of fifty hybrid input patterns including five constant intensity patterns with a length of 1 10 20 50 and 100 and forty five variable intensity patterns generated randomly 50 hybrid were adopted the outflow coefficient of interflow k i and groundwater k g were both set to 0 and s mm was set to the maximum single point tension water storage capacity within the watershed w mm to derive an analytical solution the remaining parameters were extracted from the sampled 1 000 parameter groups the complete simulation count was 400 000 50 input patterns 1000 parameter groups the reference xaj model the state space xaj model with 7 time stepping schemes the analytical solutions of the total amount of the generated runoff r and surface runoff generated on the pervious area r s within a time period are detailed in section s4 2 of the supplementary material and could be expressed as 16 r t p t Œ¥ t w m 1 a w t p t Œ¥ t w mm 1 b 1 a w t w mm 1 b 17 r s t 1 a imp p t Œ¥ t s mm 1 e x 1 a

corresponding to a given w 0 at the beginning of a time period w 0 denotes the watershed averaged tension water storage mm 3 2 3 experiment 3 the interflow and groundwater linear reservoir submodule ilrs and glrs within the slope concentration module describes the process of routing generated interflow r i and groundwater r g from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel which contains two parameters the interflow c i and groundwater c g storage recession coefficient the output fluxes of the ilrs and glrs submodules are discharge from the interflow linear reservoir q i and the groundwater linear reservoir q g the ilrs and glrs submodules of the reference xaj model could introduce numerical error because the q i and q g at the beginning of a time period were used as the averaged values of the time period experiment 3 was designed to explore the numerical error of the ilrs and glrs submodules the storage of interflow o i and groundwater o g linear reservoirs were set to 0 as the initial condition the input fluxes of experiment 3 are r i and r g and the total amount of r i and r g were both set to 1 the 50 constant input patterns were adopted and the constant intensity of the input series was used to derive the analytical solution the parameters c i and c g were extracted from the 1000 parameter groups the analytical solutions of the total amount of discharge from the interflow linear reservoir q i and the groundwater linear reservoir q g within a time period are detailed in section s4 3 of the supplementary material and could be expressed as 18 q i t r i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c i exp t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c i exp t Œ¥ t ln c i 19 q g t r g Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c g exp t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t ln c g exp t Œ¥ t ln c g 3 2 4 experiment 4 we designed experiment 4 to explore the numerical error of the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule of both the reference and state space xaj model the input and output flux of the nuh submodule is the total outflow from the hillslope to the adjacent river channel q t and the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir q 3 in the reference xaj model q 3 at the beginning of a time period is the analytical solution but using this value to replace the total amount of the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir within the time period q 3 could introduce numerical error in experiment 4 the storage value of the first f 1 second f 2 and third f 3 cascading linear reservoir was set to 0 at the initial time the total amount of input flux q t was set to 1 and the 50 hybrid input patterns were adopted the only parameter of the nuh submodule is the outflow coefficient of the nash cascading linear reservoir k f and the parameter was extracted from the 1000 parameter groups the analytical solution of q 3 could be derived but the analytical solution of q 3 is difficult to derive so we first verified the accuracy of the q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model with the analytical solution of q 3 once the accuracy was validated q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model was treated as the analytical solution of q 3 the analytical solution of q 3 was provided in section s4 4 of the supplementary material and could be expressed as 20 u Œ¥ t t exp t k f exp Œ¥ t k f i 1 3 t Œ¥ t k f 3 i 3 i i 1 3 t k f 3 i 3 i 21 q 3 t q t t u Œ¥ t t where is the convolution symbol 3 2 5 experiment 5 the numerical error of the reference xaj model was explored in experiment 5 all state variables listed in table 1 were set to 0 as the initial condition and all parameters listed in table 2 were extracted from the 1000 parameter groups in experiment 5 œÑ a and œÑ r were set to the same value for all time stepping schemes and four error tolerance values were selected 10 1 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 the input of this experiment was the daily hydrometeorological series with a duration of seven years from the tunxi watershed including p and e obs 1 tunxi the tunxi watershed is a typical humid hilly watershed in southeast china with annual precipitation of about 1750 mm and a drainage area of 2690 km2 the first year s data of input were used for spinning up to alleviate the influence of the zero initial conditions the total amounts of the fluxes of both the reference xaj model and the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes were saved daily for comparison which includes r r t r i r g q i q g q t and q 3 the complete simulation count of experiment 5 was 29 000 1 tunxi 1000 parameter groups the reference xaj model the state space xaj model with 7 time stepping schemes 4 error tolerance values 4 results 4 1 the numerical error of the submodules experiments 1 to 4 illustrate the numerical error of the submodules of the xaj model these four experiments are all composed of one or two submodules from the reference xaj model and each experiment produced 400 000 output series the numerical error of each output series was evaluated by rmse see eq 11 for the definition of this the results of the four experiments are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a presents the 400 000 rmse values of the total amount of actual evapotranspiration from the lower soil layer within a time period e l produced by the evapotranspiration calculation ec submodule in experiment 1 the boxplots represent the distribution of the rmse values by 25 50 median and 75 quantile as well as outliers which are grouped by the submodule of the reference xaj model and the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes the results indicated that the ec submodule from the reference xaj model had much larger rmse values at orders of 101 to 105 in terms of the median the maximum and median of rmse of e l produced by the submodule from the reference xaj model are 30 03 and 0 02 mm respectively while the maximum and median of rmse of e l produced by the submodule from the state space xaj model associated with er4 see table 3 for the definition of this and other scheme abbreviations are 4 76 10 4 and 3 20 10 7 mm respectively which are at the order of 105 among all the time stepping schemes used ie1 has the worst performance with maximum and median of rmse as high as 0 27 and 1 83 10 3 mm respectively when compared with the others the performance of ie1 is consistent in all four experiments fig 2 b to f and the poor performance could be attributed to the first order accuracy of ie1 experiment 2 focused on the numerical errors of the total amount of runoff r generated by the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule and the total amount of the surface runoff generated on the pervious area r s produced by the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule within a time period the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model is the analytical solution of the corresponding formulation which means there is no numerical error in the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model and is verified by the numerical experiment fig 2 b in most cases the rrmse values of r produced by the twscc submodule of the state space xaj model associated with seven time stepping schemes are less than 0 38 except for ie1 and the maximum rrmse of er4 is smaller than 0 01 which means that the numerical error of the twscc submodule of the state space xaj model solved by different time stepping schemes can be ignored fig 2 c indicates that the fwscc submodule of the reference xaj model produces larger rmse values of r s than that from the state space xaj model at least of the order of 101 as the median of rrmse can be as high as 4 49 as can be seen from fig 2 b to c ir5 outperforms the others from the perspective of the median whereas er4 has the best performance from the perspective of the maximum experiment 3 evaluated the numerical errors of the interflow ilrs and groundwater glrs linear reservoir submodules as they had the same initial states and input series but different outflow coefficients as shown in fig 2 d to e the submodules of the reference xaj model produce significantly large rmse values than those of the state space xaj model the maximum rrmse values of the total amount of discharge from the interflow q i and groundwater q g linear reservoir within a time period produced by submodules of the reference xaj model are 96 54 and 99 53 respectively which means that a large unexpected numerical error is introduced all time stepping schemes except ie1 show comparable performance in experiment 3 the maximum rrmse values of q i and q g produced by submodules of the state space xaj model associated with er4 are 3 12 10 4 and 1 46 10 3 respectively this means that the numerical error produced by the ilrs and glrs submodule of the state space xaj model can be ignored experiment 4 was designed to evaluate the numerical error of the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule in the reference xaj model the analytical solution of the nash unit hydrograph at the beginning of a time period is used to replace the average value of the time period which causes numerical errors because the analytical solution of the total amount of outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir within a time period q 3 is difficult to obtain q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model is treated as an analytical solution once the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir q 3 is comparable with the analytical solution of q 3 fig 2 f indicates the rmse of q 3 produce by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model associated with all time stepping schemes except ie1 is sufficiently small and the maximum of rrmse is smaller than 0 45 except for ie1 once the q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model is treated as an analytical solution the numerical error of the nuh submodule of the reference xaj model can be assessed as shown in fig 2 g the rmse of q 3 are similar regardless of the time stepping scheme used the median of rrmse of q 3 is 86 04 when compared with q 3 produced by the nuh submodule of the state space xaj model associated with er4 which is a very large numerical error magnitude to conclude with these results in all four experiments the submodule from the reference xaj model produces a higher numerical error than those from the state space xaj model and usually comes at a rate greater than 10 times which indicates the benefit of the state space xaj model the performance of the state space xaj model strongly depends on the time stepping scheme there is no single time stepping scheme that outperforms the others for all four experiments but ie1 does have the worst performance across the four experiments 4 2 the computational efficiency of time stepping schemes owing to the nonlinearity of the state space xaj model the analytical solution is difficult to obtain and a time stepping scheme is required to derive an approximate solution experiment 1 to 4 assessed the numerical error associated with seven different time stepping schemes with identical error tolerances with œÑ r 0 01 and œÑ a 10 4 mm in addition to the numerical error computational efficiency also plays an important role in the selection of time stepping schemes before evaluating the numerical error of the entire xaj model the computational efficiency of the state space xaj model associated with different time stepping schemes was first assessed in experiment 5 the average count of the function evaluations of a single time step was selected as an objective metric of computational efficiency fig 3 a summarizes the number of function evaluations of the state space xaj model with different time stepping schemes with œÑ r 0 01 and œÑ a 10 4 mm the median number of the function evaluations of ie1 ev3 er4 ir5 ed5 et7 and et8 are 6801 25 86 43 35 130 and 84 respectively which indicates that the ie1 time stepping scheme requires far more computational time than the others and ev3 has the fastest running speed in addition the total running time of the state space xaj model with 1 000 parameter groups associated with ie1 ev3 er4 ir5 ed5 et7 and et8 time stepping schemes are 104636 7 461 1 1058 4 953 8 539 7 1533 1 and 1050 0 s respectively intel i5 9400f 2 90 ghz cpu 16 gb ram implemented with julia programming language fig 3 c indicates the trend of the median number of function evaluations with error tolerance for various time stepping schemes the ranking of different time stepping schemes is relatively stable although the decrease in error tolerance the ie1 has the most median number of function evaluations for all the error tolerance values selected while the ev3 has the least median number for corresponding cases furthermore the median number of function evaluations of the ie1 time stepping schemes increases much more rapidly than others with the decrease in error tolerance 4 3 the physical constraint preservation of time stepping schemes in the context of hydrological models many physical quantities have a physical constraint for example the soil moisture content should be non negative and no greater than the saturation moisture content all nine state variables in the state space xaj model see table 1 should be non negative and four of them have a maximum threshold that is the watershed averaged tension water storage of different soil layers w u w l and w d and the watershed averaged free water storage s 0 the physical constraint preservation property of the physical quantities in the reference xaj model is ensured by using the zeroing negative fluxes method clark and kavetski 2010 that is a flux becomes zero once the physical quantity exceeds its boundary at the expense of accuracy the physical constraint preservation property is difficult to meet in the state space xaj model without specific treatment in other words the out of bounds error does exist in these cases which is also reported in similar researches clark and kavetski 2010 santos et al 2018 as the out of bounds error is highly dependent on the time stepping scheme used and has unexpected side effects the out of bounds error of the state space xaj model associated with different time stepping schemes is evaluated after the computational efficiency for an output series produced by the state space xaj model solved by a time stepping scheme the out of bounds error is evaluated by using tobe see eq 12 for the definition of this in experiment 5 each time stepping scheme produced 1 000 output series which means 1 000 tobe values were calculated correspondingly as can be seen in fig 3 b the median of tobe values of ie1 ev3 er4 ir5 ed5 et7 and et8 are 0 013 2 676 0 007 0 303 1 570 0 436 and 2 247 mm respectively er4 has the lowest tobe values and ie1 shares the same magnitude the tobe values of the ev3 ed5 and et8 are relatively high and larger than 1 mm for most cases the result indicates that er4 and ie1 have the best physical constraint preservation among all seven time stepping schemes in the case of the state space xaj model 4 4 the numerical error of the reference xaj model the analytical solution of the state space xaj model is required to assess the numerical error of the reference xaj model owing to the nonlinear nature of the state space xaj model the analytical solution was difficult to obtain thus an approximate solution associated with a certain time stepping scheme was used as an analytical solution in experiment 5 among seven different time stepping schemes used in experiment 5 the approximate solution produced by er4 is chosen to function as the analytical solution because it has the minimum out of bounds error acceptable computational efficiency and consistently better performance in experiments 1 to 4 the original error oe see eq 14 for the definition of this series of the total amount of the outflow discharge of the third cascading linear reservoir within a time period q 3 could be evaluated by reducing the output series of q 3 of the reference xaj model by the analytical solution q 3 could be converted to the total amount of the discharge at the watershed outlet within a time period q with unit conversion and it was used here for the convenience of analyzing a total of 1 000 oe series of q 3 can be derived in experiment 5 and are shown in fig 4 with a 90 probability range median and corresponding precipitation as shown in fig 4 the oe of q 3 produced by the reference xaj model increased with precipitation during the flood period and can be positive or negative the negative value of oe of q 3 occurs before the positive one frequently with a larger magnitude the larger magnitude of negative value could be attributed to the runoff generation module of the reference xaj model because the oe values of r are usually smaller than 0 the oe of q 3 decreases as the flood recedes but the numerical error of q 3 exists consistently as the minimum 90 probability range of oe of q 3 is 0 009 mm the high oe value of q 3 occurring with heavy precipitation indicated the runoff generation and separation module of the reference xaj model have a relatively bigger influence on the numerical error because only the generated runoff r and the surface runoff generated within the watershed r t occur when there is precipitation the numerical error of the total amount of eight fluxes of the reference xaj model within a time period is further analysed with rmse as shown in fig 5 the total amount of generated runoff within a time period r has the second smallest rmse when compared with others the free water storage capacity curve fwscc submodule of the reference xaj model amplified the numerical error as the median of rmse for r is 0 06 mm while the median of rmse for r t is 0 60 mm the two submodules in the slope concentration module of the reference xaj model both alleviated the numerical error for the interflow linear reservoir ilrs submodule the median of rmse for r i is 0 5 mm and the median rmse for q i decreased to 0 3 mm for the groundwater linear reservoir glrs submodule the median rmse for r g is 0 60 mm and the median rmse for q g decreased significantly to 0 03 mm the input of the nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule is q t and the median rmse for q t is 0 67 mm the nuh submodule of the reference xaj model could moderate the numerical error as the minimum lower quantile and median of q 3 are smaller than those of q t however the nuh submodule could have the possibility to amplify numerical error because the upper quantile and maximum of q 3 are bigger than those of q t as suggested by the result shown in fig 5 the numerical error of the reference xaj model cannot be ignored as the median and maximum of rmse for q 3 are 0 41 and 4 64 mm and the numerical error of q 3 mainly comes from the fwscc submodule 5 discussion 5 1 the full list of submodules containing numerical errors in the book that introduces the xaj model systematically zhao 1983 only some submodules that could introduce numerical errors are identified such as the evapotranspiration calculation submodule interflow linear reservoir submodule and groundwater linear reservoir submodule in this study a possible list of the submodules that could introduce numerical errors is identified by comparing the computational formulations of the reference xaj model and the analytical temporal integrations of corresponding equations of the state space xaj model the possible list was further verified through four designed numerical experiments the results of experiment 1 to 4 show that the median rmse of e l r r s q i q g and q 3 are 0 02 0 00 0 22 1 49 10 3 1 78 10 4 and 2 70 10 3 mm respectively which means that only the tension water storage capacity curve twscc submodule introduce no numerical errors thus verifying the credibility of the possible list thus the full list of submodules that could introduce numerical errors of the reference xaj model daily time step is evapotranspiration calculation ec free water storage capacity curve fwscc interflow linear reservoir ilrs groundwater linear reservoir glrs and nash unit hydrograph nuh the identification of the complete list of submodules could introduce numerical errors of a specific hydrological model such as xaj model used model in this study has two potential benefits to the hydrological modeling community given the abundance of hydrological models paul et al 2021 it is challenging to thoroughly examine the numerical error of each model however a number of submodules are utilized across various models such as the linear reservoir mentioned in this study and fuse 070 clark and kavetski 2010 the first benefit is that users of a model could know in advance whether the model is prone to numerical error based on the existence of submodules that could introduce numerical errors that have been confirmed by previous researches additionally because distributed hydrological models and land surface models are computationally intensive structures that do not require sophisticated numerical techniques are typically preferred the candidate list of such kind of structure could be expanded during the identification process for example the twscc submodule of the reference xaj model could be used for runoff generation calculation and is free of numerical error therefore it could be added to the candidate list 5 2 recommendation for the time stepping scheme the adaptive step explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme er4 is recommended for the state space xaj model this scheme provides the best compromise between accuracy computational expense and preservation of physical constraint besides er4 is also a classical time stepping scheme with abundant instruction which makes it a practical choice this recommendation is similar to those made by clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 and schoups et al 2010 as an adaptive step explicit runge kutta family time stepping scheme with an accuracy order greater than 1 however this study does not recommend the adaptive step first order implicit euler scheme ie1 recommended by santos 2018 owing to the relatively high numerical error shown in experiments 1 to 4 and the computational expenses shown in experiment 5 the implicit time stepping scheme has the advantage of robustness clark and kavetski 2010 however the implicit time stepping schemes used in this study ie1 and ir5 did not show clear superiority there was no stiffness hairer and wanner 1999 hairer et al 1993 detected in five experiments which is the possible reason for that the stiffness is related to model structure initial condition forcing data and parameter set in this study the initial conditions of the state space xaj model were set to 0 as is common practice though we did not cover all the forcing data and parameter spaces it can be inferred the stiffness did not frequently occur in the state space xaj model based on considering the reasonably large combinations of input conditions and parameter sets which could stand for common and typical cases furthermore the time stepping schemes used in previous studies mainly come from the runge kutta family and those from the multistep family are insufficiently evaluated the adaptive step explicit third order adams scheme ev3 from the multistep family used in this study demonstrates the combination of the lowest computational expense fig 3 a and the highest out of bounds error of the model state variables fig 3 b the out of bounds error which is related to the physical constraint preserving property of a time stepping scheme could cause side effects such as unexpected program interruption oscillation and mass imbalance the common treatment to eliminate the out of bounds error could be divided into two ways the first way is to fix the out of bounds error every step at the expense of accuracy clark and kavetski 2010 while the second way is to select a time stepping scheme with the lowest out of bounds error values through several comparisons la follette et al 2021 however those two ways cannot satisfy the preservation of physical constraints and the requirement of accuracy at the same time a new or modified time stepping scheme which is strictly physical constraint preservation christlieb et al 2015 and achieves a balance between accuracy and speed desires future researches 5 3 the numerical error of the reference xaj model there was a relatively large numerical error in the total amount of the discharge at the watershed outlet within a time period q of the reference xaj model as shown by experiment 5 the median and maximum of rmse for q associated with 1000 parameter groups are 12 86 and 144 46 m3 s considering similar problems also exist in other hydrological models such as lumped hydrological model clark and kavetski 2010 la follette et al 2021 santos et al 2018 schoups et al 2010 and land surface models clark et al 2021 this study could function as another attempt to make the community aware of the problem of uncontrolled numerical error in hydrological models in general submodules ec and fwscc related to the runoff generation process could cause and amplify numerical errors while submodules ilrs glrs and nuh related to the runoff concentration process have the ability to reduce numerical errors to some extent for the case of reference xaj model for the nuh submodule there exists a threshold for the rmse of q t that decreases with the increasement of the parameter k f the rmse of q t could be amplified when smaller than this threshold or reduced when bigger than this threshold after the nuh submodule stability analysis may be able to identify the causes of the amplification or decrease effect which requires further researches although the numerical error of the xaj model was pointed by zhao 1983 forty years ago and similar problems were proposed a dozen years ago for other models clark and kavetski 2010 it appears that the numerical error problems did not attract enough attention according to the results of experiment 5 it could be inferred that the existence of cancel out could partly attribute to this phenomenon firstly there occurs cancel out exists among different fluxes q t is the summation of r t q i and q g and the median of rmse values of q t should be 0 84 mm with no cancel out but the actual value is 0 67 mm indicating the existence of cancel out among fluxes secondly the numerical error prone submodule could have the ability to cancel out several numerical error take the glrs submodule as an example the median of rmse values for r g input of glrs submodule is 0 60 mm while the median of rmse values for q g output of glrs submodule has decreased to 0 03 mm thirdly we found that large oe magnitude of q occurs with high precipitation intensity and decreases as the flood receded fig 4 the decrease of oe during the non flood period could attribute to the dominance of river concentration processes finally a finely tuned parameter set could cancel out numerical error of the model to some extent based on the existence of cancel out a model without special consideration of numerical error and appropriate numerical technique could also provide a satisfactory prediction this is a typical instance of using wrong reasons for right answers kirchner 2009 the modeler could have more confidence in the prediction and the community could understand the hydrological process better by removing the numerical error that could have been avoided 6 summary and conclusions this study aimed to systematically examine the numerical error of the widely used xinanjiang model the reference xaj model in china the state space xaj model was derived from the reference xaj model based on the identification of state variables fluxes and the description of connections between state variables and fluxes with differential equations the model parameters and parameter ranges of the state space xaj model are also provided which are quite similar to those of the reference xaj model a total of five numerical experiments with seven time stepping schemes 1 000 parameter groups and different input series accompanied by both the state space xaj model and the reference xaj model were conducted to study the numerical error at submodule and model levels our findings can be summarized as follows 1 of all six submodules of the reference xaj model at a daily time step only the tension water storage capacity curve twscc is numerical error free as it is exactly the analytical solution which is further verified by experiments 1 to 4 the full list of the submodules that could introduce numerical errors is the evapotranspiration calculation ec free water storage capacity curve fwscc interflow linear reservoir ilrs groundwater linear reservoir glrs and nash unit hydrograph nuh submodule 2 of all seven time stepping schemes with adaptive time steps we recommend the adaptive step explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme as it achieves a good balance between accuracy efficiency and physical constraint preservation this is a classical time stepping scheme with abundant instructions which makes it practical in addition the physical constraint preserving property of state variables should be considered when selecting time stepping schemes 3 there exists a relatively large and thus not neglectable numerical error in the reference xaj model as the median and maximum of the rmse values of q are 12 86 and 144 46 m3 s the large magnitude of oe of q occurs with high precipitation intensity and decreases as the flood receded the free water storage capacity curve submodule of the reference xaj model is the primary source of numerical error the ec and fwscc submodules that represent the runoff generation process in the reference xaj model introduce and amplify numerical errors while the ilrs glrs and nuh submodules that represent the runoff concentration process in the reference xaj model have the ability to alleviate the numerical errors in this study the state space xaj model is derived an appropriate adaptive time stepping scheme for the state space xaj model is chosen and the numerical error of the reference xaj model at the submodule and model levels is quantified this could contribute to the application and modification of the

2127,as sediment measurements are laborious and costly alternative techniques are required to provide such information from more easily measured variables thus the objective of this study was to use machine learning based models to predict the surface sediment concentration ssc in the doce river basin the cross sectional averages of measurements from seven sediment monitoring stations of the ag√™ncia nacional de √°guas e saneamento b√°sico located in the doce riverbed were used as the ssc data a total of 62 predictor variables were used which were derived from data on the terrain slope pedology land use and cover precipitation river discharge and velocity actual evapotranspiration surface runoff soil moisture temperature and normalized difference vegetation index the boruta and recursive feature elimination variable selection methods were employed to reduce the number of predictor variables the random forest cubist support vector machine and extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithms as well as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression were applied to predict the ssc data the machine learning algorithms provided superior results particularly the cubist and xgboost models which exhibited the lowest prediction error and highest efficiency metrics according to the varimp function from caret package the most important predictor variables for the ssc modeling were the daily river discharge on the sediment collection date and time lagged discharge the cumulative daily mean precipitation was also important for the sediment modeling our findings demonstrate that machine learning models may be a very helpful tool for sediment monitoring and understanding sediment dynamics in the doce river basin over time keywords hydrosedimentological modeling sediment monitoring supervised learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the monitoring of the surface sediment concentration ssc in rivers and reservoirs is crucial for the planning and management of water resources because sediments cause water quality problems river and reservoir silting poor navigability aquatic environment degradation and hydroelectric plant malfunctions shiau and chen 2015 kaveh et al 2017 tavakoli targhi et al 2017 al mukhtar 2019 fromant et al 2021 field measurements of the scc are quite laborious demanding substantial time and financial resources therefore it is difficult to obtain a detailed database of ssc measurements as these are often sporadic and only cover a short period malik et al 2017 al mukhtar et al 2019 in contrast data such as river discharge are available more easily and on different time scales such data can be collected hourly or in even shorter intervals given this context it is necessary for models for ssc prediction to be developed using other more simply assessed variables al mukhtar 2019 several recent studies on the hysteresis phenomenon of the ssc have indicated that the ssc increases more slowly than the river discharge despite the relationship between these variables hamshaw et al 2018 keesstra et al 2019 malutta et al 2020 cao et al 2021 haddadchi and hicks 2021 river sediment dynamics are difficult to understand and simulate owing to the relationship between physical and climatic factors bharti et al 2017 along with their nonstationary behavior and high variability ssc prediction requires the application of models that can perform effectively even with missing data and given the nonlinear relationships with explanatory variables malik et al 2017 owing to this complexity the techniques that have been used to model this phenomenon have exhibited a limited predictive capacity mustafa 2016 which explains the lack of universal acceptance of the proposed models lafdani et al 2013 malik et al 2017 various approaches have been used to study sediment dynamics in drainage basins such as the universal soil loss equation and revised universal soil loss equation models magesh and chandrasekar 2016 efthimiou et al 2017 other notable models are the soil and water assessment tool swat yesuf et al 2015 ricci and de girolamo 2018 and watershed erosion prediction project srivastava et al 2019 the swat has exhibited superior results in simulating the surface concentration and sediment transport however as this model requires a large dataset the available information is often insufficient for calibration even in intensively monitored basins bharti et al 2017 another method that is used for estimating ssc involves the suspended sediment rating curve and consists of an exponential regression model that relates the ssc to the river discharge however this approach also exhibits limitations in modeling the nonstationary behavior of the process hamaamin et al 2019 machine learning based models and novel computational methods have incorporated new perspectives into sediment concentration modeling bhattacharya et al 2007 afan et al 2016 these models have demonstrated efficiency with highly complex dynamic and nonstationary sediment data nourani et al 2014 as these models are empirical their modeling is based on the relationship between the input and output data of the models as such they are dependent only on the database and for this reason tend to be more accurate olyaie et al 2015 however the mathematical equations that are derived from such analyses can hardly be related to the physical processes of the phenomena under study thus they are considered as black box models chen and chau 2016 √∂zger and kabata≈ü 2015 effective machine learning based models that have been applied in hydrosedimentology include artificial neural networks buyukyildiz and kumcu 2017 chen and chau 2016 olyaie et al 2015 ramezani and nikoo 2015 tao et al 2019 yawar et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems kisi and zounemat kermani 2016 hamaamin et al 2019 kisi and mundher 2019 samet et al 2019 the random forest rf chen et al 2018 peterson et al 2018 umar et al 2018 al mukhtar 2019 and support vector machines svms nourani et al 2016 rashidi and vafakhah 2016 buyukyildiz and kumcu 2017 himanshu et al 2017 rahgoshay et al 2019 extreme gradient boosting xgboost which is based on decision trees has also exhibited excellent results ni et al 2020 but its application to sediment concentration prediction remains overlooked machine learning models require the availability of a large amount of data for training validation and testing which is a challenge for sediment modeling because sediment samples are costly there are few sediment gauge stations in brazil to monitor the ssc and field campaigns are scheduled quarterly but many stations have missing data thereby providing little information for more detailed studies on sediment dynamics this work evaluated the possibility of joining data from different stations belonging to the same watercourse to expand the database enabling the use of machine learning models the study was conducted in the doce river basin brazil which suffers from severe soil degradation problems due to agricultural and mining activities on november 5th 2015 the fund√£o mining dam rupture released millions of mining disposal tons in the watercourse of this watershed increasing sediment yield even though there are few monitoring stations in the basin to evaluate ssc over time the application of machine learning based models may improve ssc monitoring because such models focus on more easily accessible predictor variables such as discharge and precipitation regimes thus the objective of this study was to use machine learning based models for ssc prediction and to assess the main predictor variables that affect sediment modelling in the doce river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was the doce river basin which is located in the southeast region of brazil fig 1 the focus was on the main doce riverbed where most sediment monitoring stations

measured in seven sediment monitoring stations fig 1 of the hydrometeorological network of the ag√™ncia nacional de √°guas e saneamento b√°sico ana were used as the observed ssc data which served as the response variable the data were retrieved from the hidroweb portal of the sistema nacional de informa√ß√µes sobre recursos h√≠dricos hidroweb 2022 table 1 presents the geographical locations codes and names of the sediment monitoring stations used in this study as well as the corresponding observation period and number of available observations for each station the drainage area of each monitoring station was delineated from the hydrographically conditioned digital elevation model hcdem with a 30 m spatial resolution using the r watershed tool of the geographic resources analysis support system grass software which was integrated into the qgis software version 3 16 9 qgis development team 2021 the delineation of these areas is crucial for determining the spatial variables that affect the ssc that is assessed at each sediment monitoring station to increase the amount of available data for training the machine learning models the sediment monitoring stations were aggregated to form two databases the region defined as the upper doce river with 230 data points which included stations 56075000 56110005 56425000 and 56539000 and the region defined as the lower doce river which included stations 56920000 56850000 and 56994500 with 178 observed ssc data points 2 3 determination of variables used to predict ssc the predictor variables for the drainage area upstream of each of the seven sediment monitoring stations that are located in the doce riverbed were determined the following variables were used the terrain slope pedology land use and cover precipitation river discharge water velocity actual evapotranspiration surface runoff soil moisture temperature and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi a total of 62 predictor variables were used appendices a the terrain slope data were extracted from the hcdem which was generated using the dem of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm project with a 30 m spatial resolution farr et al 2007 terrain slope calculations were performed using the qgis software version 3 16 9 the following terrain slope information was collected the mean terrain slope of each area main channel slope m m and terrain slope data according to the classification of the empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecu√°ria embrapa embrapa 2018 the main channel slope was defined using the constant equivalent gradient method s with the weighted harmonic mean of the square root of the gradient which is expressed by equation 1 mello and silva 2013 1 s i 1 n li i 1 n li di 2 where s is the constant equivalent gradient in m m 1 li is the length of stretch i in m and di is the gradient in each stretch i in m m 1 the terrain slope was classified using the r classify tool of the grass software which was integrated into the qgis software version 3 16 9 the values in km2 of each terrain slope category of the drainage areas were collected from the respective sediment monitoring stations the pedology data were retrieved from the vector file of the soil maps at a scale of 1 250 000 which were prepared by the instituto brasileiro de geografia e estat√≠stica ibge 2019 the values in km2 of the predominant soil types in the drainage areas were collected from the respective sediment monitoring stations the predominant soil types were eutrophic red nitisol nve orthic chromic luvisol tco eutrophic ultisol pve dystrophic tb haplic cambisol cxbd eutrophic ta fluvic neosol ryve and perferric red latosol lvj the land use and cover data were collected form the mapbiomas project version 5 which provides annual maps of land cover dynamics for the entirety of brazil with a spatial resolution of 30 m from 1985 to 2019 based on the landsat satellite series classification mapbiomas 2022 these data are available from the geospatial processing service google earth engine gee which is a cloud data processing platform gee 2017 and were extracted using this tool for the study area the areas in km2 of the following land use and cover classes were calculated native forest planted forest non forest natural formation pasture agriculture mosaic of agriculture and pasture mining non vegetated area and rocky outcrop this procedure was performed using the qgis software version 3 16 9 along with the land cover statistics lecos plugin for the drainage areas of the sediment monitoring stations that were used in this study the land use and cover maps provided by the mapbiomas project represent 30 classes in collection 5 the most relevant classes were reclassified and those with similar spectral characteristics were grouped together table 2 displays the reclassification of the land use and cover classes in this study which were determined using the r classify tool two rainfall databases were used the first database consisted of observed rainfall data from the rain gauge stations of the ana network which are available from the hidroweb portal hidroweb 2022 a total of 79 rain gauge stations that are located in the drainage area of the doce river basin were used fig 1 the mean daily precipitation was assessed using the inverse distance weighted deterministic interpolator to the power of two and the software r version 4 1 1 r core team 2021 the interpolated precipitation values consisted of those corresponding to the ssc sampling date and those that were assessed up to five days prior to the sediment collection day that is the precipitation that occurred 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the sediment collection in addition to the mean daily rainfall the cumulative daily mean rainfall at 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the sediment collection day were used as explanatory variables for the machine learning models the mean precipitation values in the drainage areas of the sediment monitoring stations were calculated using the qgis software version 3 16 9 the second database consisted of the daily precipitation values that were estimated by the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps project chirps 2022 which is a product of reanalysis that combines the precipitation data that are measured at rain gauge stations and data from orbital remote sensing data from 1981 are available with a spatial resolution of 0 05 5 km on a daily and global scale funk et al 2015 the chirps data were acquired and processed on the gee platform whereby the precipitation images were filtered for the study period and spatial limits of each drainage area of the sediment monitoring stations the time series with daily mean values were exported these time series corresponded to rainfall on the collection day and up to five days prior to collection and the cumulative precipitation values were also assessed at 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the collection day the precipitation data estimated by chirps has been widely used in brazil and it presented satisfactory results compared to rainfall data measured by gauge stations cavalcante et al 2020 oliveira j√∫nior et al 2021 nogueira et al 2018 paredes trejo et al 2017 the water velocity and discharge data were obtained from the hidroweb portal hidroweb 2022 the codes of the stations are the same as those of the sediment monitoring stations that are presented in table 1 in brazil sediment monitoring stations are installed where the discharge is already measured to enable the construction of sediment rating curves srcs carvalho ribeiro et al 2020 the water velocity was assessed on the day of the ssc data collection in each sediment monitoring station the discharge data corresponded to the day of the ssc data collection and lags of up to five days prior to the sampling date a strong correlation was expected between the ssc and time lagged discharge data owing to the lag between the increase in the discharge and subsequent increase in suspended sediments due to hysteresis cao et al 2021 haddadchi and hicks 2021 the mean minimum and maximum discharge data from 30 days before the sampling date were also used in this study the mean maximum and minimum real evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro soil moisture m and temperature t data were assessed for the scc sampling month the values of these variables were retrieved from the terraclimate database this database provides monthly data on the climate and water balance on the earth s surface on a global scale which are available from 1958 with a spatial resolution of 0 04 4 km abatzoglou et al 2018 the time series were acquired in terraclimate using the gee platform whereby the et ro m and t matrix data were filtered for the study period and limits of the drainage areas of the sediment monitoring stations the monthly data for the ssc sampling month were exported the ndvi time series that were used as explanatory variables were obtained from the climate data record of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa which provides ndvi monthly data from 1981 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 5 km on a global scale pedelty et al 2007 the data were acquired using the gee platform whereby the ndvi rasters were filtered for the period corresponding to the ssc sampling month and spatial limits of the drainage areas of each sediment monitoring station the monthly time series were exported in csv format 2 4 database preprocessing and variable selection methods in this study the data preprocessing consisted of identifying and removing outliers standardizing the data filling in the missing data and selecting the optimal set of variables for the machine learning models these procedures were necessary to improve the predictive capacity of the models and to reduce the computational cost of the data processing the identification and removal of outliers is a rather complex task because although these values hinder hydrological modeling they may represent atypical events that should not be excluded without analyzing the hydrological behavior in the study period ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 therefore the outliers were manually removed by comparing the ssc values with the river discharge data that were observed on the collection day and on previous days and the values were plotted on a graph owing to the different scales of the variables used in this study the data were standardized using the z score method which determines the relationship between the observed values minus the mean divided by the standard deviation this method is recommended for highly heterogeneous and dispersed datasets hair et al 2009 furthermore certain machine learning algorithms struggle to handle data on different scales james et al 2021 for which this method is useful among the predictor variables only those with up to 10 missing data were considered the missing data were filled in using the k nearest neighbors knn method and the function for missing data imputation in the caret package kuhn 2021 of the r software version 4 1 1 which considers the mean of the most frequently occurring values of the dataset james et al 2021 the boruta and recursive feature elimination rfe supervised variable selection methods were used with the rf function to reduce the number of predictor variables by eliminating redundant and irrelevant variables and selecting the optimal set of variables boruta uses the z score of the rf algorithm to indicate the importance of the variable this score expresses the average accuracy loss in each tree divided by its standard deviation the algorithm compares the predictive power of each explanatory variable with its randomized versions shadow shuffled feature that is it compares the relationship between y1 and x1 with random values of dataset xi the process is repeated for all predictor variables the maximum z score among shadow attributes mzsa is selected if the z score of the original values is significantly higher than the mzsa these variables are considered to be important for the modeling kursa et al 2010 the boruta algorithm was implemented using the boruta package kursa et al 2010 in the r software version 4 1 1 the rfe rf is used to select the optimal set of variables based on the prediction error of the rf algorithm each decision tree has a sample set out of bag which is not used for the model training this sample set is used to calculate the unbiased prediction error in rfe rf the prediction error of each variable is compared with the prediction error of its randomized versions shuffled feature as in the procedure of the boruta algorithm variables that are irrelevant to the model do not exhibit significant differences in the prediction errors compared to their randomized versions granitto et al 2006 the rfe rf algorithm was implemented using the caret package in the r software version 4 1 1 2 5 machine learning models for ssc prediction the models were based on machine learning algorithms which have yielded superior results in suspended sediment monitoring the rf and cubist algorithms svm functions xgboost and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression were applied to implement the models using the caret package of the r software version 4 1 1 the rf algorithm is based on the use of multiple decision trees each of which is constructed independently using a sample subset bootstrap that is randomly derived from the original data this process is repeated several times resulting in different combinations of decision trees for this reason the rf is more efficient than individual decision trees the results of the different models that are fitted to each tree are aggregated in the decision making process to construct the final model in a process that is known as bagging taniguchi et al 2018 the decision making process which includes the best models in the composition of the final model is based on the unbiased prediction error that is assessed from the out of bag sample subset constituting a fraction of the data that are selected in the bootstrapping process that are not used to train the models granitto et al 2006 the cubist algorithm is an extension of the quinlan m5 model tree quinlan 1992 in which linear regression models and decision trees are combined the response variables are initially partitioned into subsets with similar characteristics hierarchical rules subsequently the algorithm applies linear regression to these subsets thus the mean value of the prediction that is used in the decision tree models is replaced with linear regression on each leaf in the cubist model the cubist model also uses two functions in its predictions the first involves the neighbor function which applies the nearest neighbor algorithm on each leaf and combines it with the prediction that is obtained in the subset the second is the committee function which is similar to boosting that is the models that are subsequently fitted consider the prediction errors that have occurred in the previous fits butler et al 2018 svms transform the observed one dimensional data and compare these with their transformed values in the hyperplane this transformation aids in identifying patterns that would be difficult to detect in smaller space dimensions subsequently the vectors that separate and identify the patterns in the data support vectors are adjusted during the separation of the hyperplanes a flexible margin is considered and it is adjusted through cross validation which makes it possible to add bias towards reducing the variance in the model hearst et al 1998 as the computational cost of data transformation is high svms operate with kernel functions which compare the observed data in higher dimensions through the kernel trick without the need for transformation in this study svms with the radial basis function rbf were used to compare the data in infinite dimensions using an extension of the taylor series the rbf is used extensively with svms to resemble the knn algorithm thereby considering the weight of the nearest neighbor between the data during the separation of the hyperplanes norouzi et al 2019 the xgboost algorithm is based on the adjustment of multiple decision trees to minimize the residual between the observed and predicted data as proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 in general the model initiates the trees by adding all residuals to a single leaf and calculates the degree of similarity similarity score between the residuals thereafter the residuals are divided into different clusters leaves and the degree of similarity is recalculated the gain is calculated to assess whether it is advantageous to divide the residuals into different clusters the gain is the relationship between the degree of similarity between the leaves minus that assessed using all residuals root the highest gain values indicate the optimal branch for dividing the residuals up to a stopping criterion this splitting is fundamental because the output vector of each leaf that is used in the cost function of the model is the ratio between the sum of the residuals in each leaf divided by the total residuals plus the regularization term Œª ni et al 2020 therefore the aim of xgboost is to minimize the objective function objt that is expressed by equation 2 2 ob j t k 1 n l y i y i k 1 t œâ f i where l is the cost function n is the number of observations ≈∑i is the estimated value yi is the observed value and œâ is a regularization term of the xgboost model that is obtained using equation 3 3 œâ f Œ≥ t 1 2 Œª œâ 2 in which œâ is the output vector of each leaf of the decision tree Œª is a regularization term that is similar to the l2 penalty of the ridge regression that is used to avoid overfitting t is the number of leaves in the decision tree and Œ≥ is the complexity term for each leaf lasso regression penalizes the insertion of new variables that have little predictive capacity by means of regularization james et al 2021 linear regression adjusts the regression coefficients Œ≤i to minimize the cost function namely the residual sum of squares conversely lasso regression penalizes the regression coefficients Œ≤j and adds a new term to residual sum of squares rss as per equation 4 this term is the l1 penalty which zeroes the coefficients when the value of Œª is sufficiently large because the slope decreases as Œª increases which is particularly useful when a large number of variables can be removed james et al 2021 4 i 1 n y i Œ≤ 0 j 1 p Œ≤ j x ij 2 Œª j 1 p Œ≤ j where yi is the observed value Œ≤j and Œ≤0 are the regression coefficients xij is the explanatory variable and Œª is a hyperparameter of the equation which ranges from 0 to and is determined by cross validation to identify the value of Œª that results in the lowest variance 2 6 cross validation method and metrics used to evaluate models the leave one out cross validation loocv method was selected for training and testing the machine learning models that were used in this study it was implemented in the r software version 4 1 1 using the caret package loocv is a special case of k fold cross validation which also involves dividing the database into two sections for training and testing the models however instead of the creation of two subsets only one observation x1 y1 is used for testing whereas the remaining observations x2 y2 xn yn are used for training the prediction model is fitted to n 1 observations thereby predicting ≈∑1 for the x1 observation that is not included in the training dataset james et al 2021 this procedure is repeated until the entire dataset has been used for training and testing the advantage of this method is the reduced bias that results from repeating the model fit n 1 times the resulting predictive model is more stable because the training subsets are not randomly divided as in other types of k fold cross validation in which the results may vary with the selected data however the loocv method requires computers with a large processing capacity for a large dataset james et al 2021 the following metrics were used to evaluate the models in terms of the goodness of fit of the predicted data to the observed ssc data the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse willmott agreement index d coefficient of determination r2 kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient and performance index c the evaluation metrics of the models were assessed using the r software version 4 1 1 and the hydrogof package zambrano bigiariniz 2020 the efficiency index c which was proposed by camargo and sentelhas 1997 enables the classification of fitted models to aid in selecting the best performing model this index is the product of the willmott agreement index d and the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r an index of c 0 4 indicates that the model is classified as very poor from 0 41 to 0 5 is poor from 0 51 to 0 60 is fair from 0 61 to 0 65 is average from 0 66 to 0 75 is good from 0 76 to 0 85 is very good and c 0 85 indicates that the model is classified as excellent to present a summary of the methodological process used in this work fig 2 shows the flowchart of the discusser steps in the previous items 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics of ssc data table 3 presents the descriptive statistics of the ssc data from each of the seven sediment monitoring stations that were used in this study table 3 indicates that the highest standard deviation was identified at station 56539000 which is located in the upper doce river region because three ssc measurements were considerably higher than the average with values of 1764 1692 and 1288 which were recorded on 01 24 2016 12 10 2015 and 12 07 2000 respectively however during these periods the daily discharges were assessed on the sediment collection day and values that were close to the maximum discharge were recorded at this station that is 569 98 m3 s 01 24 2016 438 39 m3 s 10 12 2015 and 518 47 m3 s 12 07 2000 the total precipitation was also very high with cumulative means of 82 49 87 82 and 61 65 mm respectively six days before the collection days moreover the high values of suspended sediments were related to the fund√£o dam failure on november 5 2015 during which a large amount of mining tailings were released into the doce river basin aires et al 2018 this station is located in the region near the tailings outlet in the doce riverbed it is difficult to observe such high ssc values at the other stations because the measurement dates and fluvial sedimentation dynamics differ among the stations the water velocity and impoundment locations directly influence the amount of suspended particles as these affect the sediment transport capacity yuan et al 2019 3 2 variables used in ssc prediction among the predictor variables that are used in ssc modeling the dynamics of the land use and land cover classes have a significant effect on sedimentation in drainage basins the various anthropogenic activities particularly agricultural activities which often do not adopt conservationist practices increase the erosion processes thereby potentiating sedimentation rajbanshi et al 2020 the doce river basin is characterized by long term farming with rather strong anthropic use the majority of pastures are quite degraded and provide little protection to the soil thus doce river basin present serious silting issues ecoplan lume 2010 fig 3 depicts the evolution of the land use and cover classes for these regions in 1985 and 2019 fig 3 highlights the decrease in the pastural area in both regions that were analyzed in this study with values of 16 1369 6 km2 and 18 6600 5 km2 respectively most of the doce river basin is covered by pastures and these decreases primarily resulted from the increase in the agricultural and planted forest areas which increased by 34 418 km2 and 27 in the upper doce river and by 26 1395 8 km2 and 25 1551 0 km2 in the lower doce river respectively the crop and pasture class which also increased from 1985 to 2019 represents areas in which cropland and pasture could not be differentiated souza et al 2020 as the agricultural areas increased over time the increase observed in this class may mainly be attributed to agriculture although the non vegetated area rocky outcrop and water body land use classes were less expressive in the regions under study they exhibited strong variations from 1985 to 2019 possibly because the operational land imager landsat 8 satellite provides better target detectability 12 bit radiometric resolution than the thematic mapper landsat 5 satellite 8 bit radiometric resolution poursanidis et al 2015 some initiatives have been implemented to recover degraded areas in the doce river basin the new brazilian native vegetation protection law nvpl to ensure the conservation of permanent preservation app areas could improve the water and soil preservation in the watershed pires et al 2017 due to the high level of degradation of the doce river basin there is a need to restore 1 6 mha through forest plantations in apps while 30 of pacs can be effectively restored through natural regeneration carvalho ribeiro et al 2020 these measures can improve water quality and sediment yield decrease in the basin 3 3 selection of variables for machine learning models the number of predictor variables used in the machine learning models was reduced by applying the boruta and rfe variable selection algorithms this was crucial for optimizing the process by reducing the processing time and removing variables that were weakly related to the response variable which could impair the predictive ability of the models wei et al 2020 in the upper doce river region 12 variables were considered as excellent by the rfe algorithm whereas 24 variables were selected by boruta in the lower doce river region the two algorithms selected similar numbers of variables with rfe indicating 25 and boruta 29 accordingly the number of initial variables 62 was reduced considerably thereby confirming the importance of the preselection of variables all variables were ranked according to their ability to minimize the prediction errors using the varimp function of the caret package which was implemented in the software r and the importance results were expressed as percentages kuhn 2008 figs 4 and 5 depict the tenth best variables that were selected by the boruta and rfe algorithms in each machine learning model in this study the degree of importance of each variable differed significantly in each model however the daily discharge on the sediment collection day q 0 was identified as the most important variable in all models except for rf boruta fig 4 b in the upper doce river according to this model the most important variable in this region was the daily discharge two days prior to sediment collection q 2 the ssc is most commonly monitored by constructing a sediment rating curve in general this curve expresses the relationship between the daily discharge and sediment concentration zheng 2018 jaiyeola et al 2019 keogh et al 2019 benisi ghadim et al 2020 therefore the daily discharge was expected to exhibit a strong relationship with the ssc in the study area the time lagged discharge values are often considered in sediment monitoring studies the relationship between the increase in the ssc and river discharge exhibits a delay that is a certain amount of time is required for the ssc to begin to increase following the increase in the discharge which is a phenomenon that is known as hysteresis hamshaw et al 2018 keesstra et al 2019 malutta et al 2020 cao et al 2021 haddadchi et al 2021 figs 4 and 5 present the time lagged discharges among the five most important variables for the ssc prediction in the study area for most models the mean daily precipitation which was mainly measured by the rain gauges was noteworthy in the ssc prediction models the values of the cumulative mean daily precipitation up to 120 h before the sediment collection p acc 6 was highlighted in most models particularly in the cubist algorithm for the lower doce river region as illustrated in fig 5 c and d in which the cumulative mean daily precipitation was the second most important variable for the model cubist precipitation data are less likely to exhibit a strong correlation with sedimentation data because the sedimentation is dependent on various factors such as the soil infiltration capacity type of vegetation cover and gradient of the area among other characteristics zhao et al 2019 the precipitation data estimated by the chirps product showed less adequate than the precipitation observed in the rain gauge stations only in the lower doce river region fig 5 the chrips product was selected with emphasis on fig 5 h in which the precipitation of 72 h estimated by chirps p 3 ch was ranked in the fourth position the daily chirps data tend to underestimate light precipitation events and overestimate events with higher rainfall intensity belay et al 2019 which may have influenced the selection of variables by the models although the various variables of the land use classes are highly relevant to sedimentation in drainage basins rajbanshi et al 2020 they exhibited limited importance for the machine learning models used in this work fig 4 shows that in the upper doce river region only the mining mineracao and rocky outcrop afloramento rochoso variables were considered among the tenth most important for the models in the lower doce river region fig 5 the rocky outcrop afloreamento rochoso agriculture agricultura and crop and pasture mosic agri past were selected as indicated in fig 3 the agriculture and pasture classes have been undergoing changes in the study areas which may have had an effect on the sedimentation variables such as the pedology and gradient were not selected by the algorithms because these only vary with the drainage area of each sediment monitoring station therefore they fluctuate very little over time as demonstrated by the repeated values when the data of a specific station were selected on the other hand soil moisture soil and surface runoff in the month ro derived from terraclimate were selected in the lower doce river region fig 5 these variables are link to the process of sediment yield because of their relations with the detachment of soil particles gupta et al 2019 every machine learning model ranked the variables differently this ranking was significantly dependent on the mathematical formulation of each algorithm in certain situations the algorithms selected variables that were weakly physically related to sedimentation including rocky outcrop areas such relatively insignificant variables in the study area were selected because the mathematical equations that were derived from the analysis were difficult to relate to the physical process of the phenomenon under study this limitation is one of the main criticisms of the use of these algorithms which are considered as black box models chen and chau 2016 √∂zger and kabata≈ü 2015 notwithstanding these caveats they are complex and nonlinear models therefore the use of tools such as the varimp function of the caret package helps us understand the generated model allowing us to observe which variables are essential in modeling 3 4 evaluation of machine learning models for ssc prediction the results of the machine learning models evaluation metrics for each set of variables that were selected for the upper and lower doce river regions are presented in table 4 as illustrated in table 4 the cubist rfe and xgboost boruta machine learning algorithms exhibited the lowest rmse values at 66 73 mg l and 64 57 mg l respectively for the upper doce river region these two models also provided the best values for the lower doce river region table 4 with rmse values of 57 4 mg l for the cubist model and 57 mg l for the xgboost boruta model no significant differences were observed when using the set of variables that were selected by rfe or boruta for the cubist model in this region the majority of models underestimated the observed ssc data with negative pbias values for both the upper and lower doce river regions svms rfe exhibited the greatest underestimates with pbias surpassing 15 for the upper doce river region the cubist rfe algorithm also tended to underestimate the ssc data with pbias values of up to 11 for the lower doce river region although pbias values lower than 15 indicate that a model is satisfactory optimal pbias values are lower than 5 ferreira et al 2021 among the model performance indices the nse and kge have been used extensively to evaluate hydrological models and the kge is the most recommended index ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 althoff and rodrigues 2021 the highest nse values for the upper doce river region were obtained when using the cubist boruta and xgboost rfe algorithms at 0 88 and 0 89 respectively in contrast the xgboost rfe model provided the highest kge value at 0 9 although the indices were satisfactory for the lower doce region they indicated that the models exhibited a worse fit than for the upper doce river region in general all models yielded similar nses with values between 0 65 and 0 73 the kge was higher than the nse and reached the highest value kge 0 81 in xgboost rfe the lasso and cubist regression algorithms exhibited very similar values with a kge ranging from 0 78 to 0 8 as illustrated in table 4 the best results were obtained from the upper doce river region possibly because this area is much smaller than the lower doce river region moreover as its sediment monitoring stations are closer to one another as expected the measured sediment values exhibited greater homogeneity as demonstrated by aires et al 2022 the surface concentration of sediments in the doce river basin presents great variability thus the more distant the sediment stations it is expected that the data have a lower relationship with each other hindering the modeling process figs 6 and 7 show the dispersion of the predicted data in relation to the data observed in the upper and lower doce river regions considering each machine learning algorithm used in the ssc modeling for the doce river basin it can be observed from figs 6 and 7 that the ssc data that were predicted by the cubist rfe and xgboost rfe models were the closest to the linear curve which indicates less dispersion between the predicted and observed data the data that were predicted using the lasso and svm models yielded negative ssc values with no physical significance the models exhibited a better fit in the lower doce river region than in the upper doce river region with more dispersed values in relation to the linear curve fig 7 the algorithms that were closest to the linear curve were cubist and xgboost regardless of the variable selection algorithm the svm lasso regression and xgboost rfe models yielded negative predicted values in certain cases mainly with low ssc values fig 8 shows the predicted and observed values over the time extracted for each sediment monitoring station used in this work the predicted values were obtained from the xgboost rf model which presented the lowest rmse value fig 8 shows that the predicted values presented a great relationship with the values observed in each season station 56 425 000 located in the upper doce river region showed disagreement between the predicted and observed values however this station s database is consistent and the difference may be related to the location of this station stations 56075000 and 5 611 005 are close to urban centers and station 56 539 000 is near an environmental protection area on the other hand station 56 425 000 is in an agricultural production area as demonstrated by the results of this study machine learning algorithms offer strong potential for ssc monitoring although they are difficult to interpret these models provide a good ability to cope with the variability of sediment data which often lacks a direct relationship with the river discharge data as revealed in several studies olyaie et al 2015 ramezani et al 2015 chen et al 2016 kisi et al 2016 buyukyildiz et al 2017 umar et al 2018 peterson et al 2018 al mukhtar et al 2019 samet et al 2019 tao et al 2019 yawar et al 2019 hamaamin et al 2019 kisi et al 2019 saberioon et al 2020 overall the highest performing models were cubist and xgboost however the latter demands substantially more processing power than former in the study by saberioon et al 2020 good ssc prediction results were also obtained when using the cubist model with a 0 8 r2 and 19 55 mg l rmse these findings demonstrate the potential of this algorithm for sedimentation monitoring studies sedimentation monitoring requires the use of various models as in this study because the algorithms provide different results accordingly the selection of the optimal option will depend on the research objective as exemplified by the reduction in prediction errors or a model that provides acceptable errors albeit with the demand of a lower processing capacity the main difficulty in the use of machine learning models for river sedimentation monitoring is the limited observed data that are available for the model training and testing in this study several stations were added to increase the database however many drainage basins have fewer sediment monitoring stations which are often located far from one another thereby increasing the data variability considerably this data variability was observed in the fitting of the models in the lower doce river region which was inferior to that in the upper doce river region 4 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn based on the findings of this study the use of machine learning algorithms for the ssc prediction in the doce river basin yielded good results in particular the cubist and xgboost models exhibited the lowest prediction errors and highest efficiency metrics most of the machine learning models underestimated the observed ssc values including the lasso and svm models which predicted negative values the most important variables for the prediction models were the daily river discharge on the collection date and the time lagged discharge the cumulative daily mean precipitation that was recorded in the rain gauges was also important for the sedimentation modeling the rfe and boruta variable selection algorithms reduced the number of predictor variables in the ssc modeling significantly albeit without major differences in the variable selection between the two algorithms credit authorship contribution statement uilson

2127,as sediment measurements are laborious and costly alternative techniques are required to provide such information from more easily measured variables thus the objective of this study was to use machine learning based models to predict the surface sediment concentration ssc in the doce river basin the cross sectional averages of measurements from seven sediment monitoring stations of the ag√™ncia nacional de √°guas e saneamento b√°sico located in the doce riverbed were used as the ssc data a total of 62 predictor variables were used which were derived from data on the terrain slope pedology land use and cover precipitation river discharge and velocity actual evapotranspiration surface runoff soil moisture temperature and normalized difference vegetation index the boruta and recursive feature elimination variable selection methods were employed to reduce the number of predictor variables the random forest cubist support vector machine and extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithms as well as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression were applied to predict the ssc data the machine learning algorithms provided superior results particularly the cubist and xgboost models which exhibited the lowest prediction error and highest efficiency metrics according to the varimp function from caret package the most important predictor variables for the ssc modeling were the daily river discharge on the sediment collection date and time lagged discharge the cumulative daily mean precipitation was also important for the sediment modeling our findings demonstrate that machine learning models may be a very helpful tool for sediment monitoring and understanding sediment dynamics in the doce river basin over time keywords hydrosedimentological modeling sediment monitoring supervised learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the monitoring of the surface sediment concentration ssc in rivers and reservoirs is crucial for the planning and management of water resources because sediments cause water quality problems river and reservoir silting poor navigability aquatic environment degradation and hydroelectric plant malfunctions shiau and chen 2015 kaveh et al 2017 tavakoli targhi et al 2017 al mukhtar 2019 fromant et al 2021 field measurements of the scc are quite laborious demanding substantial time and financial resources therefore it is difficult to obtain a detailed database of ssc measurements as these are often sporadic and only cover a short period malik et al 2017 al mukhtar et al 2019 in contrast data such as river discharge are available more easily and on different time scales such data can be collected hourly or in even shorter intervals given this context it is necessary for models for ssc prediction to be developed using other more simply assessed variables al mukhtar 2019 several recent studies on the hysteresis phenomenon of the ssc have indicated that the ssc increases more slowly than the river discharge despite the relationship between these variables hamshaw et al 2018 keesstra et al 2019 malutta et al 2020 cao et al 2021 haddadchi and hicks 2021 river sediment dynamics are difficult to understand and simulate owing to the relationship between physical and climatic factors bharti et al 2017 along with their nonstationary behavior and high variability ssc prediction requires the application of models that can perform effectively even with missing data and given the nonlinear relationships with explanatory variables malik et al 2017 owing to this complexity the techniques that have been used to model this phenomenon have exhibited a limited predictive capacity mustafa 2016 which explains the lack of universal acceptance of the proposed models lafdani et al 2013 malik et al 2017 various approaches have been used to study sediment dynamics in drainage basins such as the universal soil loss equation and revised universal soil loss equation models magesh and chandrasekar 2016 efthimiou et al 2017 other notable models are the soil and water assessment tool swat yesuf et al 2015 ricci and de girolamo 2018 and watershed erosion prediction project srivastava et al 2019 the swat has exhibited superior results in simulating the surface concentration and sediment transport however as this model requires a large dataset the available information is often insufficient for calibration even in intensively monitored basins bharti et al 2017 another method that is used for estimating ssc involves the suspended sediment rating curve and consists of an exponential regression model that relates the ssc to the river discharge however this approach also exhibits limitations in modeling the nonstationary behavior of the process hamaamin et al 2019 machine learning based models and novel computational methods have incorporated new perspectives into sediment concentration modeling bhattacharya et al 2007 afan et al 2016 these models have demonstrated efficiency with highly complex dynamic and nonstationary sediment data nourani et al 2014 as these models are empirical their modeling is based on the relationship between the input and output data of the models as such they are dependent only on the database and for this reason tend to be more accurate olyaie et al 2015 however the mathematical equations that are derived from such analyses can hardly be related to the physical processes of the phenomena under study thus they are considered as black box models chen and chau 2016 √∂zger and kabata≈ü 2015 effective machine learning based models that have been applied in hydrosedimentology include artificial neural networks buyukyildiz and kumcu 2017 chen and chau 2016 olyaie et al 2015 ramezani and nikoo 2015 tao et al 2019 yawar et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems kisi and zounemat kermani 2016 hamaamin et al 2019 kisi and mundher 2019 samet et al 2019 the random forest rf chen et

2019 extreme gradient boosting xgboost which is based on decision trees has also exhibited excellent results ni et al 2020 but its application to sediment concentration prediction remains overlooked machine learning models require the availability of a large amount of data for training validation and testing which is a challenge for sediment modeling because sediment samples are costly there are few sediment gauge stations in brazil to monitor the ssc and field campaigns are scheduled quarterly but many stations have missing data thereby providing little information for more detailed studies on sediment dynamics this work evaluated the possibility of joining data from different stations belonging to the same watercourse to expand the database enabling the use of machine learning models the study was conducted in the doce river basin brazil which suffers from severe soil degradation problems due to agricultural and mining activities on november 5th 2015 the fund√£o mining dam rupture released millions of mining disposal tons in the watercourse of this watershed increasing sediment yield even though there are few monitoring stations in the basin to evaluate ssc over time the application of machine learning based models may improve ssc monitoring because such models focus on more easily accessible predictor variables such as discharge and precipitation regimes thus the objective of this study was to use machine learning based models for ssc prediction and to assess the main predictor variables that affect sediment modelling in the doce river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was the doce river basin which is located in the southeast region of brazil fig 1 the focus was on the main doce riverbed where most sediment monitoring stations are installed in the basin the basin has a drainage area of approximately 86 715 km2 of which 86 is located in the state of minas gerais and 14 is situated in the state of esp√≠rito santo the doce river is 879 km long its headwaters are located in the state of minas gerais within the mantiqueira and espinha√ßo mountain ranges and its mouth in the atlantic ocean is located in vila resende in the municipality of linhares esp√≠rito santo the predominant biome in the study area is the atlantic forest 98 with patches of cerrado cbh doce 2018 the basin has a population of approximately 3 5 million inhabitants and the main economic activities are mining the steel industry forestry and agriculture elesbon et al 2015 the doce river basin is highly anthropized with high sedimentation rates the land use primarily consists of agriculture 63 5 and planted and native forest 32 4 mapbiomas 2022 according to the k√∂ppen climate classification the basin predominantly has a monsoon influenced humid

measured in seven sediment monitoring stations fig 1 of the hydrometeorological network of the ag√™ncia nacional de √°guas e saneamento b√°sico ana were used as the observed ssc data which served as the response variable the data were retrieved from the hidroweb portal of the sistema nacional de informa√ß√µes sobre recursos h√≠dricos hidroweb 2022 table 1 presents the geographical locations codes and names of the sediment monitoring stations used in this study as well as the corresponding observation period and number of available observations for each station the drainage area of each monitoring station was delineated from the hydrographically conditioned digital elevation model hcdem with a 30 m spatial resolution using the r watershed tool of the geographic resources analysis support system grass software which was integrated into the qgis software version 3 16 9 qgis development team 2021 the delineation of these areas is crucial for determining the spatial variables that affect the ssc that is assessed at each sediment monitoring station to increase the amount of available data for training the machine learning models the sediment monitoring stations were aggregated to form two databases the region defined as the upper doce river with 230 data points which included stations 56075000 56110005 56425000 and 56539000 and the region defined as the lower doce river which included stations 56920000 56850000 and 56994500 with 178 observed ssc data points 2 3 determination of variables used to predict ssc the predictor variables for the drainage area upstream of each of the seven sediment monitoring stations that are located in the doce riverbed were determined the following variables were used the terrain slope pedology land use and cover precipitation river discharge water velocity actual evapotranspiration surface runoff soil moisture temperature and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi a total of 62 predictor variables were used appendices a the terrain slope data were extracted from the hcdem which was generated using the dem of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm project with a 30 m spatial resolution farr et al 2007 terrain slope calculations were performed using the qgis software version 3 16 9 the following terrain slope information was collected the mean terrain slope of each area main channel slope m m and terrain slope data according to the classification of the empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecu√°ria embrapa embrapa 2018 the main channel slope was defined using the constant equivalent gradient method s with the weighted harmonic mean of the square root of the gradient which is expressed by equation 1 mello and silva 2013 1 s i 1 n li i 1 n li di 2 where s is the constant equivalent gradient in m m 1 li is the length of stretch i in m and di is the gradient in each stretch i in m m 1 the terrain slope was classified using the r classify tool of the grass software which was integrated into the qgis software version 3 16 9 the values in km2 of each terrain slope category of the drainage areas were collected from the respective sediment monitoring stations the pedology data were retrieved from the vector file of the soil maps at a scale of 1 250 000 which were prepared by the instituto brasileiro de geografia e estat√≠stica ibge 2019 the values in km2 of the predominant soil types in the drainage areas were collected from the respective sediment monitoring stations the predominant soil types were eutrophic red nitisol nve orthic chromic luvisol tco eutrophic ultisol pve dystrophic tb haplic cambisol cxbd eutrophic ta fluvic neosol ryve and perferric red latosol lvj the land use and cover data were collected form the mapbiomas project version 5 which provides annual maps of land cover dynamics for the entirety of brazil with a spatial resolution of 30 m from 1985 to 2019 based on the landsat satellite series classification mapbiomas 2022 these data are available from the geospatial processing service google earth engine gee which is a cloud data processing platform gee 2017 and were extracted using this tool for the study area the areas in km2 of the following land use and cover classes were calculated native forest planted forest non forest natural formation pasture agriculture mosaic of agriculture and pasture mining non vegetated area and rocky outcrop this procedure was performed using the qgis software version 3 16 9 along with the land cover statistics lecos plugin for the drainage areas of the sediment monitoring stations that were used in this study the land use and cover maps provided by the mapbiomas project represent 30 classes in collection 5 the most relevant classes were reclassified and those with similar spectral characteristics were grouped together table 2 displays the reclassification of the land use and cover classes in this study which were determined using the r classify tool two rainfall databases were used the first database consisted of observed rainfall data from the rain gauge stations of the ana network which are available from the hidroweb portal hidroweb 2022 a total of 79 rain gauge stations that are located in the drainage area of the doce river basin were used fig 1 the mean daily precipitation was assessed using the inverse distance weighted deterministic interpolator to the power of two and the software r version 4 1 1 r core team 2021 the interpolated precipitation values consisted of those corresponding to the ssc sampling date and those that were assessed up to five days prior to the sediment collection day that is the precipitation that occurred 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the sediment collection in addition to the mean daily rainfall the cumulative daily mean rainfall at 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the sediment collection day were used as explanatory variables for the machine learning models the mean precipitation values in the drainage areas of the sediment monitoring stations were calculated using the qgis software version 3 16 9 the second database consisted of the daily precipitation values that were estimated by the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps project chirps 2022 which is a product of reanalysis that combines the precipitation data that are measured at rain gauge stations and data from orbital remote sensing data from 1981 are available with a spatial resolution of 0 05 5 km on a daily and global scale funk et al 2015 the chirps data were acquired and processed on the gee platform whereby the precipitation images were filtered for the study period and spatial limits of each drainage area of the sediment monitoring stations the time series with daily mean values were exported these time series corresponded to rainfall on the collection day and up to five days prior to collection and the cumulative precipitation values were also assessed at 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the collection day the precipitation data estimated by chirps has been widely used in brazil and it presented satisfactory results compared to rainfall data measured by gauge stations cavalcante et al 2020 oliveira j√∫nior et al 2021 nogueira et al 2018 paredes trejo et al 2017 the water velocity and discharge data were obtained from the hidroweb portal hidroweb 2022 the codes of the stations are the same as those of the sediment monitoring stations that are presented in table 1 in brazil sediment monitoring stations are installed where the discharge is already measured to enable the construction of sediment rating curves srcs carvalho ribeiro et al 2020 the water velocity was assessed on the day of the ssc data collection in each sediment monitoring station the discharge data corresponded to the day of the ssc data collection and lags of up to five days prior to the sampling date a strong correlation was expected between the ssc and time lagged discharge data owing to the lag between the increase in the discharge and subsequent increase in suspended sediments due to hysteresis cao et al 2021 haddadchi and hicks 2021 the mean minimum and maximum discharge data from 30 days before the sampling date were also used in this study the mean maximum and minimum real evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro soil moisture m and temperature t data were assessed for the scc sampling month the values of these variables were retrieved from the terraclimate database this database provides monthly data on the climate and water balance on the earth s surface on a global scale which are available from 1958 with a spatial resolution of 0 04 4 km abatzoglou et al 2018 the time series were acquired in terraclimate using the gee platform whereby the et ro m and t matrix data were filtered for the study period and limits of the drainage areas of the sediment monitoring stations the monthly data for the ssc sampling month were exported the ndvi time series that were used as explanatory variables were obtained from the climate data record of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa which provides ndvi monthly data from 1981 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 5 km on a global scale pedelty et al 2007 the data were acquired using the gee platform whereby the ndvi rasters were filtered for the period corresponding to the ssc sampling month and spatial limits of the drainage areas of each sediment monitoring station the monthly time series were exported in csv format 2 4 database preprocessing and variable selection methods in this study the data preprocessing consisted of identifying and removing outliers standardizing the data filling in the missing data and selecting the optimal set of variables for the machine learning models these procedures were necessary to improve the predictive capacity of the models and to reduce the computational cost of the data processing the identification and removal of outliers is a rather complex task because although these values hinder hydrological modeling they may represent atypical events that should not be excluded without analyzing the hydrological behavior in the study period ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 therefore the outliers were manually removed by comparing the ssc values with the river discharge data that were observed on the collection day and on previous days and the values were plotted on a graph owing to the different scales of the variables used in this study the data were standardized using the z score method which determines the relationship between the observed values minus the mean divided by the standard deviation this method is recommended for highly heterogeneous and dispersed datasets hair et al 2009 furthermore certain machine learning algorithms struggle to handle data on different scales james et al 2021 for which this method is useful among the predictor variables only those with up to 10 missing data were considered the missing data were filled in using the k nearest neighbors knn method and the function for missing data imputation in the caret package kuhn 2021 of the r software version 4 1 1 which considers the mean of the most frequently occurring values of the dataset james et al 2021 the boruta and recursive feature elimination rfe supervised variable selection methods were used with the rf function to reduce the number of predictor variables by eliminating redundant and irrelevant variables and selecting the optimal set of variables boruta uses the z score of the rf algorithm to indicate the importance of the variable this score expresses the average accuracy loss in each tree divided by its standard deviation the algorithm compares the predictive power of each explanatory variable with its randomized versions shadow shuffled feature that is it compares the relationship between y1 and x1 with random values of dataset xi the process is repeated for all predictor variables the maximum z score among shadow attributes mzsa is selected if the z score of the original values is significantly higher than the mzsa these variables are considered to be important for the modeling kursa et al 2010 the boruta algorithm was implemented using the boruta package kursa et al 2010 in the r software version 4 1 1 the rfe rf is used to select the optimal set of variables based on the prediction error of the rf algorithm each decision tree has a sample set out of bag which is not used for the model training this sample set is used to calculate the unbiased prediction error in rfe rf the prediction error of each variable is compared with the prediction error of its randomized versions shuffled feature as in the procedure of the boruta algorithm variables that are irrelevant to the model do not exhibit significant differences in the prediction errors compared to their randomized versions granitto et al 2006 the rfe rf algorithm was implemented using the caret package in the r software version 4 1 1 2 5 machine learning models for ssc prediction the models were based on machine learning algorithms which have yielded superior results in suspended sediment monitoring the rf and cubist algorithms svm functions xgboost and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression were applied to implement the models using the caret package of the r software version 4 1 1 the rf algorithm is based on the use of multiple decision trees each of which is constructed independently using a sample subset bootstrap that is randomly derived from the original data this process is repeated several times resulting in different combinations of decision trees for this reason the rf is more efficient than individual decision trees the results of the different models that are fitted to each tree are aggregated in the decision making process to construct the final model in a process that is known as bagging taniguchi et al 2018 the decision making process which includes the best models in the composition of the final model is based on the unbiased prediction error that is assessed from the out of bag sample subset constituting a fraction of the data that are selected in the bootstrapping process that are not used to train the models granitto et al 2006 the cubist algorithm is an extension of the quinlan m5 model tree quinlan 1992 in which linear regression models and decision trees are combined the response variables are initially partitioned into subsets with similar characteristics hierarchical rules subsequently the algorithm applies linear regression to these subsets thus the mean value of the prediction that is used in the decision tree models is replaced with linear regression on each leaf in the cubist model the cubist model also uses two functions in its predictions the first involves the neighbor function which applies the nearest neighbor algorithm on each leaf and combines it with the prediction that is obtained in the subset the second is the committee function which is similar to boosting that is the models that are subsequently fitted consider the prediction errors that have occurred in the previous fits butler et al 2018 svms transform the observed one dimensional data and compare these with their transformed values in the hyperplane this transformation aids in identifying patterns that would be difficult to detect in smaller space dimensions subsequently the vectors that separate and identify the patterns in the data support vectors are adjusted during the separation of the hyperplanes a flexible margin is considered and it is adjusted through cross validation which makes it possible to add bias towards reducing the variance in the model hearst et al 1998 as the computational cost of data transformation is high svms operate with kernel functions which compare the observed data in higher dimensions through the kernel trick without the need for transformation in this study svms with the radial basis function rbf were used to compare the data in infinite dimensions using an extension of the taylor series the rbf is used extensively with svms to resemble the knn algorithm thereby considering the weight of the nearest neighbor between the data during the separation of the hyperplanes norouzi et al 2019 the xgboost algorithm is based on the adjustment of multiple decision trees to minimize the residual between the observed and predicted data as proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 in general the model initiates the trees by adding all residuals to a single leaf and calculates the degree of similarity similarity score between the residuals thereafter the residuals are divided into different clusters leaves and the degree of similarity is recalculated the gain is calculated to assess whether it is advantageous to divide the residuals into different clusters the gain is the relationship between the degree of similarity between the leaves minus that assessed using all residuals root the highest gain values indicate the optimal branch for dividing the residuals up to a stopping criterion this splitting is fundamental because the output vector of each leaf that is used in the cost function of the model is the ratio between the sum of the residuals in each leaf divided by the total residuals plus the regularization term Œª ni et al 2020 therefore the aim of xgboost is to minimize the objective function objt that is expressed by equation 2 2 ob j t k 1 n l y i y i k 1 t œâ f i where l is the cost function n is the number of observations ≈∑i is the estimated value yi is the observed value and œâ is a regularization term of the xgboost model that is obtained using equation 3 3 œâ f Œ≥ t 1 2 Œª œâ 2 in which œâ is the output vector of each leaf of the decision tree Œª is a regularization term that is similar to the l2 penalty of the ridge regression that is used to avoid overfitting t is the number of leaves in the decision tree and Œ≥ is the complexity term for each leaf lasso regression penalizes the insertion of new variables that have little predictive capacity by means of regularization james et al 2021 linear regression adjusts the regression coefficients Œ≤i to minimize the cost function namely the residual sum of squares conversely lasso regression penalizes the regression coefficients Œ≤j and adds a new term to residual sum of squares rss as per equation 4 this term is the l1 penalty which zeroes the coefficients when the value of Œª is sufficiently large because the slope decreases as Œª increases which is particularly useful when a large number of variables can be removed james et al 2021 4 i 1 n y i Œ≤ 0 j 1 p Œ≤ j x ij 2 Œª j 1 p Œ≤ j where yi is the observed value Œ≤j and Œ≤0 are the regression coefficients xij is the explanatory variable and Œª is a hyperparameter of the equation which ranges from 0 to and is determined by cross validation to identify the value of Œª that results in the lowest variance 2 6 cross validation method and metrics used to evaluate models the leave one out cross validation loocv method was selected for training and testing the machine learning models that were used in this study it was implemented in the r software version 4 1 1 using the caret package loocv is a special case of k fold cross validation which also involves dividing the database into two sections for training and testing the models however instead of the creation of two subsets only one observation x1 y1 is used for testing whereas the remaining observations x2 y2 xn yn are used for training the prediction model is fitted to n 1 observations thereby predicting ≈∑1 for the x1 observation that is not included in the training dataset james et al 2021 this procedure is repeated until the entire dataset has been used for training and testing the advantage of this method is the reduced bias that results from repeating the model fit n 1 times the resulting predictive model is more stable because the training subsets are not randomly divided as in other types of k fold cross validation in which the results may vary with the selected data however the loocv method requires computers with a large processing capacity for a large dataset james et al 2021 the following metrics were used to evaluate the models in terms of the goodness of fit of the predicted data to the observed ssc data the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse willmott agreement index d coefficient of determination r2 kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient and performance index c the evaluation metrics of the models were assessed using the r software version 4 1 1 and the hydrogof package zambrano bigiariniz 2020 the efficiency index c which was proposed by camargo and sentelhas 1997 enables the classification of fitted models to aid in selecting the best performing model this index is the product of the willmott agreement index d and the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r an index of c 0 4 indicates that the model is classified as very poor from 0 41 to 0 5 is poor from 0 51 to 0 60 is fair from 0 61 to 0 65 is average from 0 66 to 0 75 is good from 0 76 to 0 85 is very good and c 0 85 indicates that the model is classified as excellent to present a summary of the methodological process used in this work fig 2 shows the flowchart of the discusser steps in the previous items 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics of ssc data table 3 presents the descriptive statistics of the ssc data from each of the seven sediment monitoring stations that were used in this study table 3 indicates that the highest standard deviation was identified at station 56539000 which is located in the upper doce river region because three ssc measurements were considerably higher than the average with values of 1764 1692 and 1288 which were recorded on 01 24 2016 12 10 2015 and 12 07 2000 respectively however during these periods the daily discharges were assessed on the sediment collection day and values that were close to the maximum discharge were recorded at this station that is 569 98 m3 s 01 24 2016 438 39 m3 s 10 12 2015 and 518 47 m3 s 12 07 2000 the total precipitation was also very high with cumulative means of 82 49 87 82 and 61 65 mm respectively six days before the collection days moreover the high values of suspended sediments were related to the fund√£o dam failure on november 5 2015 during which a large amount of mining tailings were released into the doce river basin aires et al 2018 this station is located in the region near the tailings outlet in the doce riverbed it is difficult to observe such high ssc values at the other stations because the measurement dates and fluvial sedimentation dynamics differ among the stations the water velocity and impoundment locations directly influence the amount of suspended particles as these affect the sediment transport capacity yuan et al 2019 3 2 variables used in ssc prediction among the predictor variables that are used in ssc modeling the dynamics of the land use and land cover classes have a significant effect on sedimentation in drainage basins the various anthropogenic activities particularly agricultural activities which often do not adopt conservationist practices increase the erosion processes thereby potentiating sedimentation rajbanshi et al 2020 the doce river basin is characterized by long term farming with rather strong anthropic use the majority of pastures are quite degraded and provide little protection to the soil thus doce river basin present serious silting issues ecoplan lume 2010 fig 3 depicts the evolution of the land use and cover classes for these regions in 1985 and 2019 fig 3 highlights the decrease in the pastural area in both regions that were analyzed in this study with values of 16 1369 6 km2 and 18 6600 5 km2 respectively most of the doce river basin is covered by pastures and these decreases primarily resulted from the increase in the agricultural and planted forest areas which increased by 34 418 km2 and 27 in the upper doce river and by 26 1395 8 km2 and 25 1551 0 km2 in the lower doce river respectively the crop and pasture class which also increased from 1985 to 2019 represents areas in which cropland and pasture could not be differentiated souza et al 2020 as the agricultural areas increased over time the increase observed in this class may mainly be attributed to agriculture although the non vegetated area rocky outcrop and water body land use classes were less expressive in the regions under study they exhibited strong variations from 1985 to 2019 possibly because the operational land imager landsat 8 satellite provides better target detectability 12 bit radiometric resolution than the thematic mapper landsat 5 satellite 8 bit radiometric resolution poursanidis et al 2015 some initiatives have been implemented to recover degraded areas in the doce river basin the new brazilian native vegetation protection law nvpl to ensure the conservation of permanent preservation app areas could improve the water and soil preservation in the watershed pires et al 2017 due to the high level of degradation of the doce river basin there is a need to restore 1 6 mha through forest plantations in apps while 30 of pacs can be effectively restored through natural regeneration carvalho ribeiro et al 2020 these measures can improve water quality and sediment yield decrease in the basin 3 3 selection of variables for machine learning models the number of predictor variables used in the machine learning models was reduced by applying the boruta and rfe variable selection algorithms this was crucial for optimizing the process by reducing the processing time and removing variables that were weakly related to the response variable which could impair the predictive ability of the models wei et al 2020 in the upper doce river region 12 variables were considered as excellent by the rfe algorithm whereas 24 variables were selected by boruta in the lower doce river region the two algorithms selected similar numbers of variables with rfe indicating 25 and boruta 29 accordingly the number of initial variables 62 was reduced considerably thereby confirming the importance of the preselection of variables all variables were ranked according to their ability to minimize the prediction errors using the varimp function of the caret package which was implemented in the software r and the importance results were expressed as percentages kuhn 2008 figs 4 and 5 depict the tenth best variables that were selected by the boruta and rfe algorithms in each machine learning model in this study the degree of importance of each variable differed significantly in each model however the daily discharge on the sediment collection day q 0 was identified as the most important variable in all models except for rf boruta fig 4 b in the upper doce river according to this model the most important variable in this region was the daily discharge two days prior to sediment collection q 2 the ssc is most commonly monitored by constructing a sediment rating curve in general this curve expresses the relationship between the daily discharge and sediment concentration zheng 2018 jaiyeola et al 2019 keogh et al 2019 benisi ghadim et al 2020 therefore the daily discharge was expected to exhibit a strong relationship with the ssc in the study area the time lagged discharge values are often considered in sediment monitoring studies the relationship between the increase in the ssc and river discharge exhibits a delay that is a certain amount of time is required for the ssc to begin to increase following the increase in the discharge which is a phenomenon that is known as hysteresis hamshaw et al 2018 keesstra et al 2019 malutta et al 2020 cao et al 2021 haddadchi et al 2021 figs 4 and 5 present the time lagged discharges among the five most important variables for the ssc prediction in the study area for most models the mean daily precipitation which was mainly measured by the rain gauges was noteworthy in the ssc prediction models the values of the cumulative mean daily precipitation up to 120 h before the sediment collection p acc 6 was highlighted in most models particularly in the cubist algorithm for the lower doce river region as illustrated in fig 5 c and d in which the cumulative mean daily precipitation was the second most important variable for the model cubist precipitation data are less likely to exhibit a strong correlation with sedimentation data because the sedimentation is dependent on various factors such as the soil infiltration capacity type of vegetation cover and gradient of the area among other characteristics zhao et al 2019 the precipitation data estimated by the chirps product showed less adequate than the precipitation observed in the rain gauge stations only in the lower doce river region fig 5 the chrips product was selected with emphasis on fig 5 h in which the precipitation of 72 h estimated by chirps p 3 ch was ranked in the fourth position the daily chirps data tend to underestimate light precipitation events and overestimate events with higher rainfall intensity belay et al 2019 which may have influenced the selection of variables by the models although the various variables of the land use classes are highly relevant to sedimentation in drainage basins rajbanshi et al 2020 they exhibited limited importance for the machine learning models used in this work fig 4 shows that in the upper doce river region only the mining mineracao and rocky outcrop afloramento rochoso variables were considered among the tenth most important for the models in the lower doce river region fig 5 the rocky outcrop afloreamento rochoso agriculture agricultura and crop and pasture mosic agri past were selected as indicated in fig 3 the agriculture and pasture classes have been undergoing changes in the study areas which may have had an effect on the sedimentation variables such as the pedology and gradient were not selected by the algorithms because these only vary with the drainage area of each sediment monitoring station therefore they fluctuate very little over time as demonstrated by the repeated values when the data of a specific station were selected on the other hand soil moisture soil and surface runoff in the month ro derived from terraclimate were selected in the lower doce river region fig 5 these variables are link to the process of sediment yield because of their relations with the detachment of soil particles gupta et al 2019 every machine learning model ranked the variables differently this ranking was significantly dependent on the mathematical formulation of each algorithm in certain situations the algorithms selected variables that were weakly physically related to sedimentation including rocky outcrop areas such relatively insignificant variables in the study area were selected because the mathematical equations that were derived from the analysis were difficult to relate to the physical process of the phenomenon under study this limitation is one of the main criticisms of the use of these algorithms which are considered as black box models chen and chau 2016 √∂zger and kabata≈ü 2015 notwithstanding these caveats they are complex and nonlinear models therefore the use of tools such as the varimp function of the caret package helps us understand the generated model allowing us to observe which variables are essential in modeling 3 4 evaluation of machine learning models for ssc prediction the results of the machine learning models evaluation metrics for each set of variables that were selected for the upper and lower doce river regions are presented in table 4 as illustrated in table 4 the cubist rfe and xgboost boruta machine learning algorithms exhibited the lowest rmse values at 66 73 mg l and 64 57 mg l respectively for the upper doce river region these two models also provided the best values for the lower doce river region table 4 with rmse values of 57 4 mg l for the cubist model and 57 mg l for the xgboost boruta model no significant differences were observed when using the set of variables that were selected by rfe or boruta for the cubist model in this region the majority of models underestimated the observed ssc data with negative pbias values for both the upper and lower doce river regions svms rfe exhibited the greatest underestimates with pbias surpassing 15 for the upper doce river region the cubist rfe algorithm also tended to underestimate the ssc data with pbias values of up to 11 for the lower doce river region although pbias values lower than 15 indicate that a model is satisfactory optimal pbias values are lower than 5 ferreira et al 2021 among the model performance indices the nse and kge have been used extensively to evaluate hydrological models and the kge is the most recommended index ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 althoff and rodrigues 2021 the highest nse values for the upper doce river region were obtained when using the cubist boruta and xgboost rfe algorithms at 0 88 and 0 89 respectively in contrast the xgboost rfe model provided the highest kge value at 0 9 although the indices were satisfactory for the lower doce region they indicated that the models exhibited a worse fit than for the upper doce river region in general all models yielded similar nses with values between 0 65 and 0 73 the kge was higher than the nse and reached the highest value kge 0 81 in xgboost rfe the lasso and cubist regression algorithms exhibited very similar values with a kge ranging from 0 78 to 0 8 as illustrated in table 4 the best results were obtained from the upper doce river region possibly because this area is much smaller than the lower doce river region moreover as its sediment monitoring stations are closer to one another as expected the measured sediment values exhibited greater homogeneity as demonstrated by aires et al 2022 the surface concentration of sediments in the doce river basin presents great variability thus the more distant the sediment stations it is expected that the data have a lower relationship with each other hindering the modeling process figs 6 and 7 show the dispersion of the predicted data in relation to the data observed in the upper and lower doce river regions considering each machine learning algorithm used in the ssc modeling for the doce river basin it can be observed from figs 6 and 7 that the ssc data that were predicted by the cubist rfe and xgboost rfe models were the closest to the linear curve which indicates less dispersion between the predicted and observed data the data that were predicted using the lasso and svm models yielded negative ssc values with no physical significance the models exhibited a better fit in the lower doce river region than in the upper doce river region with more dispersed values in relation to the linear curve fig 7 the algorithms that were closest to the linear curve were cubist and xgboost regardless of the variable selection algorithm the svm lasso regression and xgboost rfe models yielded negative predicted values in certain cases mainly with low ssc values fig 8 shows the predicted and observed values over the time extracted for each sediment monitoring station used in this work the predicted values were obtained from the xgboost rf model which presented the lowest rmse value fig 8 shows that the predicted values presented a great relationship with the values observed in each season station 56 425 000 located in the upper doce river region showed disagreement between the predicted and observed values however this station s database is consistent and the difference may be related to the location of this station stations 56075000 and 5 611 005 are close to urban centers and station 56 539 000 is near an environmental protection area on the other hand station 56 425 000 is in an agricultural production area as demonstrated by the results of this study machine learning algorithms offer strong potential for ssc monitoring although they are difficult to interpret these models provide a good ability to cope with the variability of sediment data which often lacks a direct relationship with the river discharge data as revealed in several studies olyaie et al 2015 ramezani et al 2015 chen et al 2016 kisi et al 2016 buyukyildiz et al 2017 umar et al 2018 peterson et al 2018 al mukhtar et al 2019 samet et al 2019 tao et al 2019 yawar et al 2019 hamaamin et al 2019 kisi et al 2019 saberioon et al 2020 overall the highest performing models were cubist and xgboost however the latter demands substantially more processing power than former in the study by saberioon et al 2020 good ssc prediction results were also obtained when using the cubist model with a 0 8 r2 and 19 55 mg l rmse these findings demonstrate the potential of this algorithm for sedimentation monitoring studies sedimentation monitoring requires the use of various models as in this study because the algorithms provide different results accordingly the selection of the optimal option will depend on the research objective as exemplified by the reduction in prediction errors or a model that provides acceptable errors albeit with the demand of a lower processing capacity the main difficulty in the use of machine learning models for river sedimentation monitoring is the limited observed data that are available for the model training and testing in this study several stations were added to increase the database however many drainage basins have fewer sediment monitoring stations which are often located far from one another thereby increasing the data variability considerably this data variability was observed in the fitting of the models in the lower doce river region which was inferior to that in the upper doce river region 4 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn based on the findings of this study the use of machine learning algorithms for the ssc prediction in the doce river basin yielded good results in particular the cubist and xgboost models exhibited the lowest prediction errors and highest efficiency metrics most of the machine learning models underestimated the observed ssc values including the lasso and svm models which predicted negative values the most important variables for the prediction models were the daily river discharge on the collection date and the time lagged discharge the cumulative daily mean precipitation that was recorded in the rain gauges was also important for the sedimentation modeling the rfe and boruta variable selection algorithms reduced the number of predictor variables in the ssc modeling significantly albeit without major differences in the variable selection between the two algorithms credit authorship contribution statement uilson

2128,meteorological drought md is strongly causal linked to agricultural drought ad therefore md can be used as an appropriate early warning of ad enhancing human mitigation of ad however drought responses of ad to md have not been well understood here we used the nonstationary standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index nspei and the standardized soil moisture index ssi to analyze the evolution characteristics of md and ad the drought response time drt and response patterns of drought in different climatic zones with different underlying surface conditions vegetation type irrigation were calculated a high frequency of md and ad in southeastern china and the tibetan plateau was detected besides ad in southeastern china and md in central and southern china showed a significant increasing trend meanwhile md and ad are in the same decreasing trend over the tibetan plateau the highest probability of compound droughts can be found in northern china and regions with a semi humid warm temperate climate drought response sensitivity is higher with shorter agriculture drought response time drt in southeastern china and eastern parts of the tibetan plateau than in other regions of china besides drt is short in summer and autumn and long in winter and spring moreover when compared to drt in irrigated agricultural areas drt in rainfed agricultural areas is longer and more spatially variable drt in double and triple crop irrigated areas is remarkably shorter than in single crop irrigated areas and drt with higher crop intensity is shorter keywords meteorological drought agricultural drought drought response human activities data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the most difficult natural phenomena to monitor and forecast for early warning moreover drought is a slow evolution process with a long duration and widespread influence ahmadi et al 2019 the ipcc sixth assessment report indicated that global warming will potentially push up the risks of global droughts sanjit et al 2021 kusunoki et al 2020 he et al 2018 china is located in the east asian monsoon region and has a complex and diverse climatic environment meteorological disasters caused by extreme weather account for about 70 of all natural disasters in china while droughts account for about 50 of meteorological disasters yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 china s annual agricultural drought disaster area accounts for more than 60 of the total agricultural disaster area therefore drought monitoring and early warning are critical in reducing agricultural disaster losses guo et al 2021 and in enhancing human mitigation of drought disasters the close association between different drought types and the evolution from one drought type to another is considered a drought response wu et al 2020a continual development of meteorological drought can lead to soil moisture deficit and resultant agricultural drought xu et al 2021 agricultural drought is attributed mainly to soil moisture deficit which is the combined consequence of precipitation deficit and soil moisture deficit as well as rising air temperature and evapotranspiration the impacts of agricultural droughts on crops are seasonally varying and are in close relation to different growing stages of crops mishra et al 2010 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2018 therefore it is crucial to highlight the process and pattern of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought zhang et al 2017 monitoring meteorological drought has usually been done using the palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei hu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 spei has been widely used because this index includes precipitation and evapotranspiration and is of multi scale nature li et al 2020 however the assumption of stationarity of hydrometeorological processes greatly limits its applicability in drought monitoring given nonstationary hydrometeorological processes therefore we improved spei and proposed a nonstationary version of spei i e nspei and nspei has good applicability in meteorological drought monitoring in china wen et al 2020 agricultural drought is inherently linked to soil moisture deficit hence soil moisture availability has been taken as the most important indicator for agricultural drought zhang et al 2019 yao et al 2020 due to the lack of a soil moisture observation network soil moisture data are usually sourced from reanalysis data and or remotely sensed data zhou et al 2021 previous studies analyzed drought response patterns in terms of drought characteristics and drought response relationships drought response time drt reflects the lag of drought and is widely used in drought response models based on spei ssi chen et al 2019 explored the response relationship between meteorological and agricultural droughts in the luan river basin the findings indicated that drt of meteorological to agricultural drought lasts 2 5 months during summer and autumn and 7 12 months during spring and winter huang et al 2015 showed that in the wei river basin the drt of meteorological and agricultural drought is 3 months during summer and 8 months during autumn and winter zhang et al 2021b also found significant correlations between meteorological and agricultural droughts over the yellow river basin li et al 2020 showed response relationships between meteorological and agricultural droughts across the yangtze river basin with a drt of less than 3 months li et al 2020 therefore drt is variable regionally and is varying seasonally china is the largest agricultural country with regionally varying climate types and underlying features therefore it is a typical case study to analyze the drt characteristics between meteorological and agricultural droughts under different climatic conditions across china the process of meteorological and agricultural drought can be influenced by multiple factors wen et al 2011 a study of meteorological to agricultural drought propagation in the wei river china showed that the drought response time changes in subsurface conditions by the budyko framework huang et al 2015 furthermore topography and vegetation cover are the main drivers affecting drt of meteorological and agricultural drought cao et al 2022 agricultural activities and potential human activities such as vegetation type land cover change and water supply demand can significantly influence the process of drt in northern china xu et al 2019 van loon et al 2012b even in the loess plateau region and the qilian mountains the forest land has a significant impact on the drought process wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 previous studies have shown that variations in underlying surface and climatic conditions have remarkable impacts on the drought response process and this impact cannot be ignored therefore it is essential to consider the impact of these factors in the response process of agricultural drought to meteorological drought some studies have shown that different climates and substrates can influence the drought response although many previous studies have assessed the correlation between processes of drought responses at a watershed or regional scale the drt from meteorological to agriculture drought is often affected by climatic and watershed characteristics van loon et al 2012a most scholars have only focused on the effects of meteorological drought on hydrologic drought chen et al 2019 huang et al 2015 however few studies are available on the drt in meteorological to agriculture drought from the perspectives of landcover and irrigation conditions this study used the nspei and ssi to analyze agricultural drought responses to meteorological drought and the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate spatiotemporal evolutions of meteorological and agricultural droughts over china 2 to analyze spatial patterns of drt in different climatic zones and seasons and 3 to understand how changes in substratum vegetation type irrigation conditions affect the spatial distribution of drought response times 2 data the climatic zones in china are subdivided based on temperature moisture and dominant regional differentiation factors yao et al 2018 fig 1 b the vegetation types across china include grains forests deserts grasslands and shrubs ding et al 2021 fig 1c https www resdc cn the irrigated areas in china are based on actual irrigated areas mapped by the international water management institute iwmi iamaa by categorizing agricultural areas into irrigated and rain fed croplands based on cropping intensity agricultural areas are classified into single double and triple crop types zhang et al 2018 irrigated agricultural areas rain fed agricultural areas and farmlands are generally consistent when iwmi iamaa is compared with other irrigated areas salmon et al 2015 https waterdata iwmi org fig 1d meteorological data include daily relative humidity sunshine hours average temperature maximum and minimum temperature average wind speed

2266 meteorological stations from 1981 to 2019 are accepted in the ongoing analyses fig 1a era interim soil moisture product https www ecmwf int is from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim soil moisture is of higher accuracy when compared with other remotely sensed soil moisture such as esa cci gldas and era interim soil moisture products were updated with lower forecast error than the original version of era products zheng et al 2021 deng et al 2020 the spatial coverage of era interim reanalysis data is 90 90 n 0 360 e and was processed using the envi clipping to match china s territory 6 54 n 73 136 e the spatial resolution of the datasets is 0 1 0 1 and the time interval covers the period from january 1981 to december 2019 era interim has four layers of soil moisture 0 to 7 cm 7 to 28 cm 28 to 100 cm and 100 to 289 cm specifically soil moisture variability at a scale of less than 20 cm has been mainly related to local factors such as topography and vegetation li et al 2022 besides the contribution of deep root uptake to plant water demand is little wang et al 2019 hence we accept the soil moisture of 7 to 28 cm a relatively stable aquifer with root soil moisture 3 methods 3 1 standardized soil moisture index ssi firstly we determine the probability density functions pdfs for soil moisture sm data 16 pdfs are adopted such as birnbaum saunders exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value generalized pareto inverse gaussian logistic loglogistic lognormal nakagami normal rayleigh rician t location scale weibull

simplified into a linkage between the md nspei and ad ssi in different accumulation periods ssi 1 is the indicator characterizing short time md conditions furthermore the nspei n can indicate the accumulated precipitation deficiency and evaporation increment during the previous n months to cause sm shortage among the 12 time scales the strongest pearson correlation of the nspei n series and ssi 1 is identified as the drought response set where the highest pearson correlation is the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc the monthly sm shortage is affected by the accumulated previous n month ad xu et al 2021 the mpcc between the nspei n and ssi 1 shows a connection with md and ad hence the n accumulation period of md is defined as the drt 3 5 drought response rate drr the calculation method of drought response rate drr in the manuscript was referred to shi et al 2021 and sattar et al 2019 table 1 is the classification of meteorological and agricultural drought severity according to nspei and ssi values we used thresholds 0 and 0 5 to identify meteorological and agricultural drought events respectively fig 3 the subsequence continuously below the threshold is run drought event zhang et al 2021a drr is defined as the percentage response between md and ad where md is the md monitored by the drought index and ad is the drought event caused by md the ad event occurred following md fig 3 showing the sensitivity of meteorological drought response to agricultural drought sattar et al 2019 we used three month scale md and one month scale ad to better reflect the seasonal drought responses a higher drr indicated that ad is more sensitive to md and vice versa then drr was computed as follows p n m where p represents the response rate n the meteorological agricultural drought events refer to md events that trigger the ad events m represents the total number of md events 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal patterns of meteorological and agricultural droughts pearson correlation between nspei n and ssi 1 at grid scale was calculated the correlation is strong given that the correlation coefficient is larger than 0 5 we only analyzed the correlation coefficients significant at p 0 05 level and we calculated the mean value of the correlation coefficients the higher the correlation coefficient the thicker the line fig 4 we found that the correlation between ssi 1 and nspei 3 and nspei 2 is the highest fig 4 implying that seasonal changes in meteorological elements have a well response to soil moisture content bachmair et al 2018 wang et al 2014 we used nspei 3 to better reflect the seasonal md variations it can be seen from fig 4 that the highest correlation can be identified between one month scale ssi and three month scale nspei ssi 1 can mirror seasonal changes in ad the number of seasonal droughts from 1981 to 2019 is illustrated in fig 5 the number of md mainly ranges from 46 to 77 while that of ad ranges from 7 to 77 hence the number of md is much higher than ad the regions with a high number of droughts are spatially consistent zones ii v and the southeast parts of zones iii iv are dominated by the highest number of ad and md from summer to winter ad shifts spatially from north to south and returns to the north md moves from north to south across eastern china the west of zones vi vii is dominated by the highest number of ad and md the trends of md and ad using sen s slope and m k trend test can be found in fig 6 in spring and summer md is in a not significant decreasing trend in zones i to iv and a not significant increasing trend in zone vii fig 6a1 and b1 meanwhile md is in no significant upward trends in zones ii and iii and no significant decreasing trends in zone vii in autumn and winter fig 6c1 and d1 contrary to the seasonal variation of md ad in zones i to iv mainly shows an increasing trend fig 6a2 d2 ad in zones i to iii shows a significant increasing trend 95 confidence level however ad in zone v is in a significant decreasing trend the occurrence frequency of ad under different levels of md is defined as the ratio of the number of ad events to that of md events showing the regional compound md and ad when the md degree intensifies from mild to extreme drought the frequency of ad significantly increases the highest frequency of ad in zones ii and v can be more than 40 when md is mild and moderate moreover the frequency of ad occurring in zones i v is the highest up to 80 under severe md conditions as the md degree reach extreme drought ad occurs much more frequently than the other three md degrees in summary the frequent occurrence of compound meteorological and ad is found in zone ii the md is more likely to trigger ad in the eastern humid semi humid zone zones i iv while md triggers ad less frequently in the eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau 4 2 drt from meteorological to agricultural droughts fig 8 shows the spatial variation and box statistics of drt in different climatic zones drt in zone i is 3 months longer than in zone ii the drt from ad to md is 2 months in zones iii and iv and spatial variability is greater in zone iv than in zone iii which exhibits differences along the east to west direction the longest drt is in zone vi and long drt is in the eastern part of zone vii and the short drt is in the western of zone vii fig 6a and 6b therefore the drt in humid and semi humid regions of eastern china zones i iv is shorter than in the arid semi arid areas zones v vi and zone vii compared with zone vii zone v and zone iii are dominated by less spatial variability of terrain and md frequency hence the drought response in zones iii and v is similar and the spatial variability of drought response in vii is the greatest fig 8b furthermore the correlation coefficients of drought response in all climatic zones of china are significant at a 95 confidence level the drought response in humid semi humid climates across eastern china zones i iv is stronger than in the arid zones vi and vii the highest correlation coefficients of drought response are found in zone ii since the highest frequency of compound md and ad is in zone ii fig 7 however zones vi and vii are characterized by the lowest correlation coefficients between nspei and ssi fig 8c and 8d fig 9 shows spatial patterns of seasonal drt in spring and winter the drt of ad to md within 2 months is significantly shorter than in other climatic regions in zones iii iv the drt is shorter in summer and autumn and the distribution of the high and low drt areas is the same in summer and autumn on a regional scale drt in zones iii and vi is small with a drt of 1 2 months zones i and ii show longer drt in spring and winter than in summer and autumn especially drt is significantly longer in the eastern of zone ii than that in the western of zone ii zones v vii show the same seasonal characteristics of long drt when compared with those in zones i ii drt is subject to the greatest spatial diversity in zone vi and the spatial differences are significantly greater in summer and winter than in spring and autumn 4 3 agricultural drought response to meteorological drought under different vegetation types to further explore the influence of different vegetation types on the drt fig 10 we shown the temporal spatial of drt under different vegetation conditions zones i and iii iv are mainly distributed in woodlands with 45 of forested land in zone ii being the highest and zone i has the longest drt of 6 months fig 10a compared with other vegetation types shrubs in china are mainly in zones iii iv accounting for less than 10 of the regional area fig 10b grasslands mainly distribute in zones v vii accounting for less than 17 of zones v vii with the longest drt of 7 months in zones vii and v the drt in zone v is spatially similar while drt in zone vii mainly shows significant variations in east to west direction fig 10c except for zone i grains are the dominant vegetation types in zones i vi and zone v with the highest area proportion of 66 in zone ii among the grain types in climatic zones the longest drt is found in zone i and the greatest spatial variability was found in zone iv fig 10d hence the area of grains and forests is the highest and longest drt in zone i grains had the largest area with little spatial variability and a longer drt than forest land by 1 month from the same climate zone there are some differences in drt under different vegetation types in climate zone i the drt of grassland and grain was about 7 months which was higher than that of forest and shrub about 1 month the drt of grassland and shrub in zone ii was 4 months which was higher than that of forest and grain the drt of different vegetation types in zones iii iv and v showed no significant difference in various vegetation types the shortest drt for grain in zone vi was 5 months and the longest drt for grasslands in zone vii was about 7 months fig 10 the spatial distribution of drt in irrigated and rainfed crop zones is shown in fig 11 fig 11 illustrates that single crop irrigated areas are the largest in zone i accounting for 35 of zone i double crop and three crop irrigated areas are mainly located in zone ii and zone iii and the southern part of zone v is a typical rain fed crop area accounting for 17 of zone v fig 11b and 11c except for zones v and i the drt of rainfed crops is longer than irrigated crops in zone v both single crop irrigation and rainfed crops account for 17 of zone v while drt is 3 months longer in single crop irrigation than that in rainfed crops besides the proportion of single crop in irrigation areas is the largest accounting for 35 of zone i and the drt of single crop in irrigation area with 7 months is the same as that of the rainfed crop the drt of double crop and three crop in irrigated areas are shorter than that of single crop in irrigated areas illustrating that the higher the crop intensity the shorter the drt furthermore except for zone i the area of rain fed crops in china is higher than that of irrigated crops indicating that rain fed agriculture is the main mode of crop water resupply in china besides the drt of rainfed crop areas is generally slightly longer than that of irrigated areas but its spatial variability is greater compared to the other climatic zones the drt of irrigated and rainfed crops in zone ii and zone iii is the shortest being about 3 months however drt is the longest and spatial consistency is the highest in zone i hence grains in zone i are more resistant to drought than in other climatic zones from the same climate zone there are some differences in drt under different irrigation types the shortest drt for dual crop irrigation in zone ii is about 3 months in zone i v and vii the drt of single crop irrigation and rainfed crop was the longest which was longer than the other 1 month in the areas with the most concentrated irrigation of three crops the drt mainly lasts for 1 2 months compared with other irrigation types the response time is the shortest fig 11 5 discussions here we choose correlation analysis to assess drought response characteristics the drt quantitatively reflects the response process of ad to md van loon et al 2012a the drought response rate drr represents the sensitivity of drought response and the probability value can explain the strength of the response relationship between ad and md the value of drr with a higher value means more md signals will be transmitted to the hydrological cycle the drr in the eastern part of the tropical and subtropical humid regions zones iii iv and zone vii is much higher than in other climatic regions ranging from 60 to 80 fig 12 with similar spatial features drt is shorter in the tropical and subtropical humid regions zones iii iv than other zones therefore the higher the drr the stronger the drought response relationship meanwhile the shorter the drt some studies have suggested that there is higher transmission probability from md to ad in wetter climatic regions especially in equatorial and warm temperate regions including southern china and amazon rainforest etc it is mainly due to the differential hydrological cycle stronger hydrological transfer relationships and faster water cycling in humid regions zhu et al 2021 it means that soil moisture drought is more vulnerable to meteorological drought in humid regions the reason is the hydrological cycle system is composed of sm precipitation and evapotranspiration the increase in precipitations and temperature evapotranspiration will form a closer hydrological relationship this is attributed to the intensified hydrological cycle and formed strong hydrological transmission relationship seneviratne et al 2010 sm in arid regions is not sensitive to climate changes in dry climatic conditions and precipitation has a greater effect on soil moisture in humid regions hence decreased precipitation can lead to a rapid decline in surface soil moisture wu et al 2020b ding et al 2021 wang et al 2022 in terms of climatic conditions southeast china is located in the subtropical and tropical monsoon regions with more precipitation and evapotranspiration liu et al 2019 and some research shows that changes in topographic conditions will also lead to uneven distribution of water vapor khosh bin ghomash et al 2019 ding et al 2021 meanwhile it is also found that the drt of agricultural drought is significantly shorter in summer and autumn than that in spring and winter it is primarily attributed to high evapotranspiration in summer the melting moisture from snow and ice and agricultural irrigation increase sm in spring qi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a huang et al 2015 the drt of ad to md is significantly influenced by climatic conditions vegetation cover and irrigation type the drt is the longest in woodlands in zones i and v woodlands have deeper root systems and can use deeper sm given moisture deficit and lengthening drt davidson et al 2000 anderegg et al 2015 however grasslands are more sensitive to precipitation due to their relatively shallow root systems craine et al 2013 knapp et al 2015 therefore the drt of grassland is shorter than woodland besides the drt of grasses is also influenced by topographic conditions copeland et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the sm from snow and permafrost melt to plateau grasslands can delay drought response hence the drt of grasslands in zone vii is much longer than that of other climatic regions the correlation between grains and md using ndvi and spei indicates that grains have high moisture requirements during the growing season and are exposed to seasonal precipitation and farmland is vulnerable to drought therefore the drt of grains is slightly shorter xu et al 2018 rainfed agricultural areas are mainly located in arid semi arid and humid semi humid regions with adequate rainfall previous studies have shown that irrigation has a role in regulating regional microclimate irrigation may lead to an increase in latent heat fluxes a small decrease in maximum temperature and some increase in precipitation and sm which lead to an increase in moisture content and facilitate the redeployment of atmospheric moisture ozdogan et al 2010 huang et al 2015 mishra et al 2020 thus there may be a close relationship between the hydrological cycle in irrigated areas in areas where irrigation is required rainfall is often insufficient for normal crop growth as a result the drt in this area is short and timely irrigation is needed to replenish soil moisture the response process of ad to md is a complex process ad is calculated based on soil moisture data there are many soil moisture products but it has different applicability in different regions there are many indicators of meteorological drought and agricultural drought such as spi ndvi and so on the drt of ad to md also be affected by different drought indexes this is mainly because different factors are considered in the construction process of different drought indicators for example spi is a meteorological drought index based on precipitation and ndvi represents the growth state and coverage of vegetation therefore the research on drt has a certain uncertainty the response characteristics of ad show differences in sub regions although we have divided different climate zones and analyzed the drought response of underlying surface conditions in different climate regions there are still many factors ignored such as the driving factors of drought response meanwhile there are still some uncertainties in the division of different underlying surfaces including vegetation and irrigation types it is still necessary to further explore and discuss the mechanism for drought response moreover drought duration and intensity of drought response and threshold of drought transmission still need further exploration and discussion 6 conclusions the meteorological drought index nspei and agricultural drought index ssi can characterize the spatial and temporal aspects of drought meanwhile the drt of ad to md is investigated based on correlation analysis and run theory finally a quantitative evaluation of the effects of vegetation and irrigation conditions on drt is done across different climatic zones and subsurface conditions the aforementioned analyses help to obtain the following interesting and important findings and conclusions 1 the number of md is higher than ad besides the highest number of ad and md is mainly in zone ii and the southeast of zones iii iv ad mainly increases in zones i iii however the trend of md is opposite in most parts of eastern china and md and ad drought in zone vii show decreasing trend 2 under mild drought the frequency of ad is less than 50 when the md reaches extreme drought ad can start its development process and zone ii is the area with frequent compound md and ad drt in different climatic zones is spatially characterized by a lower in eastern china and higher in western china and the drt of humid zones zones iii iv is less than that of arid and semi arid zones zones v vi meanwhile on the seasonal scale drt in summer and autumn is shorter than that in spring and winter 3 grains are the dominant vegetation type in eastern china zones i iv and zones v and drt is generally shorter than other vegetation compared with rain fed crops irrigated crops are less adaptable to the climate and more vulnerable to drought hence the drt of the rainfed crop is longer than irrigated crop however the drt of single crop irrigated is significantly longer than double crop and three crop irrigated indicating that the higher the planting intensity the shorter the drt credit authorship contribution statement peng sun conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation visualization funding acquisition writing

2128,meteorological drought md is strongly causal linked to agricultural drought ad therefore md can be used as an appropriate early warning of ad enhancing human mitigation of ad however drought responses of ad to md have not been well understood here we used the nonstationary standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index nspei and the standardized soil moisture index ssi to analyze the evolution characteristics of md and ad the drought response time drt and response patterns of drought in different climatic zones with different underlying surface conditions vegetation type irrigation were calculated a high frequency of md and ad in southeastern china and the tibetan plateau was detected besides ad in southeastern china and md in central and southern china showed a significant increasing trend meanwhile md and ad are in the same decreasing trend over the tibetan plateau the highest probability of compound droughts can be found in northern china and regions with a semi humid warm temperate climate drought response sensitivity is higher with shorter agriculture drought response time drt in southeastern china and eastern parts of the tibetan plateau than in other regions of china besides drt is short in summer and autumn and long in winter and spring moreover when compared to drt in irrigated agricultural areas drt in rainfed agricultural areas is longer and more spatially variable drt in double and triple crop irrigated areas is remarkably shorter than in single crop irrigated areas and drt with higher crop intensity is shorter keywords meteorological drought agricultural drought drought response human activities data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the most difficult natural phenomena to monitor and forecast for early warning moreover drought is a slow evolution process with a long duration and widespread influence ahmadi et al 2019 the ipcc sixth assessment report indicated that global warming will potentially push up the risks of global droughts sanjit et al 2021 kusunoki et al 2020 he et al 2018 china is located in the east asian monsoon region and has a complex and diverse climatic environment meteorological disasters caused by extreme weather account for about 70 of all natural disasters in china while droughts account for about 50 of meteorological disasters yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 china s annual agricultural drought disaster area accounts for more than 60 of the total agricultural disaster area therefore drought monitoring and early warning are critical in reducing agricultural disaster losses guo et al 2021 and in enhancing human mitigation of drought disasters the close association between different drought types and the evolution from one drought type to another is considered a drought response wu et al 2020a continual development of meteorological drought can lead to soil moisture deficit and resultant agricultural drought xu et al 2021 agricultural drought is attributed mainly to soil moisture deficit which is the combined consequence of precipitation deficit and soil moisture deficit as well as rising air temperature and evapotranspiration the impacts of agricultural droughts on crops are seasonally varying and are in close relation to different growing stages of crops mishra et al 2010 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2018 therefore it is crucial to highlight the process and pattern of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought zhang et al 2017 monitoring meteorological drought has usually been done using the palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei hu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 spei has been widely used because this index includes precipitation and evapotranspiration and is of multi scale nature li et al 2020 however the assumption of stationarity of hydrometeorological processes greatly limits its applicability in drought monitoring given nonstationary hydrometeorological processes therefore we improved spei and proposed a nonstationary version of spei i e nspei and nspei has good applicability in meteorological drought monitoring in china wen et al 2020 agricultural drought is inherently linked to soil moisture deficit hence soil moisture availability has been taken as the most important indicator for agricultural drought zhang et al 2019 yao et al 2020 due to the lack of a soil moisture observation network soil moisture data are usually sourced from reanalysis data and or remotely sensed data zhou et al 2021 previous studies analyzed drought response patterns in terms of drought characteristics and drought response relationships drought response time drt reflects the lag of drought and is widely used in drought response models based on spei ssi chen et al 2019 explored the response relationship between meteorological and agricultural droughts in the luan river basin the findings indicated that drt of meteorological to agricultural drought lasts 2 5 months during summer and autumn and 7 12 months during spring and winter huang et al 2015 showed that in the wei river basin the drt of meteorological and agricultural drought is 3 months during summer and 8 months during autumn and winter zhang et al 2021b also found significant correlations between meteorological and agricultural droughts over the yellow river basin li et al 2020 showed response relationships between meteorological and agricultural droughts across the yangtze river basin with a drt of less than 3 months li et al 2020 therefore drt is variable regionally and is varying seasonally china is the largest agricultural country with regionally varying climate types and underlying features therefore it is a typical case study to analyze the drt characteristics between meteorological and agricultural droughts under different climatic conditions across china the process of meteorological and agricultural drought can be influenced by multiple factors wen et al 2011 a study of meteorological to agricultural drought propagation in the wei river china showed that the drought response time changes in subsurface conditions by the budyko framework huang et al 2015 furthermore topography and vegetation cover are the main drivers affecting drt of meteorological and agricultural drought cao et al 2022 agricultural activities and potential human activities such as vegetation type land cover change and water supply demand can significantly influence the process of drt in northern china xu et al 2019 van loon et al 2012b even in the loess plateau region and the qilian mountains the forest land has a significant impact on the drought process wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 previous studies have shown that variations in underlying surface and climatic conditions have remarkable impacts on the drought response process and this impact cannot be ignored therefore it is essential to consider the impact of these factors in the response process of agricultural drought to meteorological drought some studies have shown that different climates and substrates can influence the drought response although many previous studies have assessed the correlation between processes of drought responses at a watershed or regional scale the drt from meteorological to agriculture drought is often affected by climatic and watershed characteristics van loon et al 2012a most scholars have only focused on the effects of meteorological drought on hydrologic drought chen et al 2019 huang et al 2015 however few studies are available on the drt in meteorological to agriculture drought from the perspectives of landcover and irrigation conditions this study used the nspei and ssi to analyze agricultural drought responses to meteorological drought and the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate spatiotemporal evolutions of meteorological and agricultural droughts over china 2 to analyze spatial patterns of drt in different climatic zones and seasons and 3 to understand how changes in substratum vegetation type irrigation conditions affect the spatial distribution of drought response times 2 data the climatic zones in china are subdivided based on temperature moisture and dominant regional differentiation factors yao et al 2018 fig 1 b the vegetation types across china include grains forests deserts grasslands and shrubs ding et al 2021 fig 1c https www resdc cn the irrigated areas in china are based on actual irrigated areas mapped by the international water management institute iwmi iamaa by categorizing agricultural areas into irrigated and rain fed croplands based on cropping intensity agricultural areas are classified into single double and triple crop types zhang et al 2018 irrigated agricultural areas rain fed agricultural areas and farmlands are generally consistent when iwmi iamaa is compared with other irrigated areas salmon et al 2015 https waterdata iwmi org fig 1d meteorological data include daily relative humidity sunshine hours average temperature maximum and minimum temperature average wind speed

2266 meteorological stations from 1981 to 2019 are accepted in the ongoing analyses fig 1a era interim soil moisture product https www ecmwf int is from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim soil moisture is of higher accuracy when compared with other remotely sensed soil moisture such as esa cci gldas and era interim soil moisture products were updated with lower forecast error than the original version of era products zheng et al 2021 deng et al 2020 the spatial coverage of era interim reanalysis data is 90 90 n 0 360 e and was processed using the envi clipping to match china s territory 6 54 n 73 136 e the spatial resolution of the datasets is 0 1 0 1 and the time interval covers the period from january 1981 to december 2019 era interim has four layers of soil moisture 0 to 7 cm 7 to 28 cm 28 to 100 cm and 100 to 289 cm specifically soil moisture variability at a scale of less than 20 cm has been mainly related to local factors such as topography and vegetation li et al 2022 besides the contribution of deep root uptake to plant water demand is little wang et al 2019 hence we accept the soil moisture of 7 to 28 cm a relatively stable aquifer with root soil moisture 3 methods 3 1 standardized soil moisture index ssi firstly we determine the probability density functions pdfs for soil moisture sm data 16 pdfs are adopted such as birnbaum saunders exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value generalized pareto inverse gaussian logistic loglogistic lognormal nakagami normal rayleigh rician t location scale weibull

ssi 1 is identified as the drought response set where the highest pearson correlation is the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc the monthly sm shortage is affected by the accumulated previous n month ad xu et al 2021 the mpcc between the nspei n and ssi 1 shows a connection with md and ad hence the n accumulation period of md is defined as the drt 3 5 drought response rate drr the calculation method of drought response rate drr in the manuscript was referred to shi et al 2021 and sattar et al 2019 table 1 is the classification of meteorological and agricultural drought severity according to nspei and ssi values we used thresholds 0 and 0 5 to identify meteorological and agricultural drought events respectively fig 3 the subsequence continuously below the threshold is run drought event zhang et al 2021a drr is defined as the percentage response between md and ad where md is the md monitored by the drought index and ad is the drought event caused by md the ad event occurred following md fig 3 showing the sensitivity of meteorological drought response to agricultural drought sattar et al 2019 we used three month scale md and one month scale ad to better reflect the seasonal drought responses a higher drr indicated that ad is more sensitive to md and vice versa then drr was computed as follows p n m where p represents the response rate n the meteorological agricultural drought events refer to md events that trigger the ad events m represents the total number of md events 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal patterns of meteorological and agricultural droughts pearson correlation between nspei n and ssi 1 at grid scale was calculated the correlation is strong given that the correlation coefficient is larger than 0 5 we only analyzed the correlation coefficients significant at p 0 05 level and we calculated the mean value of the correlation coefficients the higher the correlation coefficient the thicker the line fig 4 we found that the correlation between ssi 1 and nspei 3 and nspei 2 is the highest fig 4 implying that seasonal changes in meteorological elements have a well response to soil moisture content bachmair et al 2018 wang et al 2014 we used nspei 3 to better reflect the seasonal md variations it can be seen from fig 4 that the highest correlation can be identified between one month scale ssi and three month scale nspei ssi 1 can mirror seasonal changes in ad the number of seasonal droughts from 1981 to 2019 is illustrated in fig 5 the number of md mainly ranges from 46 to 77 while that of ad ranges from 7 to 77 hence the number of md is much higher than ad the regions with a high number of droughts are spatially consistent zones ii v and the southeast parts of zones iii iv are dominated by the highest number of ad and md from summer to winter ad shifts spatially from north to south and returns to the north md moves from north to south across eastern china the west of zones vi vii is dominated by the highest number of ad and md the trends of md and ad using sen s slope and m k trend test can be found in fig 6 in spring and summer md is in a not significant decreasing trend in zones i to iv and a not significant increasing trend in zone vii fig 6a1 and b1 meanwhile md is in no significant upward trends in zones ii and iii and no significant decreasing trends in zone vii in autumn and winter fig 6c1 and d1 contrary to the seasonal variation of md ad in zones i to iv mainly shows an increasing trend fig 6a2 d2 ad in zones i to iii shows a significant increasing trend 95 confidence level however ad in zone v is in a significant decreasing trend the occurrence frequency of ad under different levels of md is defined as the ratio of the number of ad events to that of md events showing the regional compound md and ad when the md degree intensifies from mild to extreme drought the frequency of ad significantly increases the highest frequency of ad in zones ii and v can be more than 40 when md is mild and moderate moreover the frequency of ad occurring in zones i v is the highest up to 80 under severe md conditions as the md degree reach extreme drought ad occurs much more frequently than the other three md degrees in summary the frequent occurrence of compound meteorological and ad is found in zone ii the md is more likely to trigger ad in the eastern humid semi humid zone zones i iv while md triggers ad less frequently in the eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau 4 2 drt from meteorological to agricultural droughts fig 8 shows the spatial variation and box statistics of drt in different climatic zones drt in zone i is 3 months longer than in zone ii the drt from ad to md is 2 months in zones iii and iv and spatial variability is greater in zone iv than in zone iii which exhibits differences along the east to west direction the longest drt is in zone vi and long drt is in the eastern part of zone vii and the short drt is in the western of zone vii fig 6a and 6b therefore the drt in humid and semi humid regions of eastern china zones i iv is shorter than in the arid semi arid areas zones v vi and zone vii compared with zone vii zone v and zone iii are dominated by less spatial variability of terrain and md frequency hence the drought response in zones iii and v is similar and the spatial variability of drought response in vii is the greatest fig 8b furthermore the correlation coefficients of drought response in all climatic zones of china are significant at a 95 confidence level the drought response in humid semi humid climates across eastern china zones i iv is stronger than in the arid zones vi and vii the highest correlation coefficients of drought response are found in zone ii since the highest frequency of compound md and ad is in zone ii fig 7 however zones vi and vii are characterized by the lowest correlation coefficients between nspei and ssi fig 8c and 8d fig 9 shows spatial patterns of seasonal drt in spring and winter the drt of ad to md within 2 months is significantly shorter than in other climatic regions in zones iii iv the drt is shorter in summer and autumn and the distribution of the high and low drt areas is the same in summer and autumn on a regional scale drt in zones iii and vi is small with a drt of 1 2 months zones i and ii show longer drt in spring and winter than in summer and autumn especially drt is significantly longer in the eastern of zone ii than that in the western of zone ii zones v vii show the same seasonal characteristics of long drt when compared with those in zones i ii drt is subject to the greatest spatial diversity in zone vi and the spatial differences are significantly greater in summer and winter than in spring and autumn 4 3 agricultural drought response to meteorological drought under different vegetation types to further explore the influence of different vegetation types on the drt fig 10 we shown the temporal spatial of drt under different vegetation conditions zones i and iii iv are mainly distributed in woodlands with 45 of forested land in zone ii being the highest and zone i has the longest drt of 6 months fig 10a compared with other vegetation types shrubs in china are mainly in zones iii iv accounting for less than 10 of the regional area fig 10b grasslands mainly distribute in zones v vii accounting for less than 17 of zones v vii with the longest drt of 7 months in zones vii and v the drt in zone v is spatially similar while drt in zone vii mainly shows significant variations in east to west direction fig 10c except for zone i grains are the dominant vegetation types in zones i vi and zone v with the highest area proportion of 66 in zone ii among the grain types in climatic zones the longest drt is found in zone i and the greatest spatial variability was found in zone iv fig 10d hence the area of grains and forests is the highest and longest drt in zone i grains had the largest area with little spatial variability and a longer drt than forest land by 1 month from the same climate zone there are some differences in drt under different vegetation types in climate zone i the drt of grassland and grain was about 7 months which was higher than that of forest and shrub about 1 month the drt of grassland and shrub in zone ii was 4 months which was higher than that of forest and grain the drt of different vegetation types in zones iii iv and v showed no significant difference in various vegetation types the shortest drt for grain in zone vi was 5 months and the longest drt for grasslands in zone vii was about 7 months fig 10 the spatial distribution of drt in irrigated and rainfed crop zones is shown in fig 11 fig 11 illustrates that single crop irrigated areas are the largest in zone i accounting for 35 of zone i double crop and three crop irrigated areas are mainly located in zone ii and zone iii and the southern part of zone v is a typical rain fed crop area accounting for 17 of zone v fig 11b and 11c except for zones v and i the drt of rainfed crops is longer than irrigated crops in zone v both single crop irrigation and rainfed crops account for 17 of zone v while drt is 3 months longer in single crop irrigation than that in rainfed crops besides the proportion of single crop in irrigation areas is the largest accounting for 35 of zone i and the drt of single crop in irrigation area with 7 months is the same as that of the rainfed crop the drt of double crop and three crop in irrigated areas are shorter than that of single crop in irrigated areas illustrating that the higher the crop intensity the shorter the drt furthermore except for zone i the area of rain fed crops in china is higher than that of irrigated crops indicating that rain fed agriculture is the main mode of crop water resupply in china besides the drt of rainfed crop areas is generally slightly longer than that of irrigated areas but its spatial variability is greater compared to the other climatic zones the drt of irrigated and rainfed crops in zone ii and zone iii is the shortest being about 3 months however drt is the longest and spatial consistency is the highest in zone i hence grains in zone i are more resistant to drought than in other climatic zones from the same climate zone there are some differences in drt under different irrigation types the shortest drt for dual crop irrigation in zone ii is about 3 months in zone i v and vii the drt of single crop irrigation and rainfed crop was the longest which was longer than the other 1 month in the areas with the most concentrated irrigation of three crops the drt mainly lasts for 1 2 months compared with other irrigation types the response time is the shortest fig 11 5 discussions here we choose correlation analysis to assess drought response characteristics the drt quantitatively reflects the response process of ad to md van loon et al 2012a the drought response rate drr represents the sensitivity of drought response and the probability value can explain the strength of the response relationship between ad and md the value of drr with a higher value means more md signals will be transmitted to the hydrological cycle the drr in the eastern part of the tropical and subtropical humid regions zones iii iv and zone vii is much higher than in other climatic regions ranging from 60 to 80 fig 12 with similar spatial features drt is shorter in the tropical and subtropical humid regions zones iii iv than other zones therefore the higher the drr the stronger the drought response relationship meanwhile the shorter the drt some studies have suggested that there is higher transmission probability from md to ad in wetter climatic regions especially in equatorial and warm temperate regions including southern china and amazon rainforest etc it is mainly due to the differential hydrological cycle stronger hydrological transfer relationships and faster water cycling in humid regions zhu et al 2021 it means that soil moisture drought is more vulnerable to meteorological drought in humid regions the reason is the hydrological cycle system is composed of sm precipitation and evapotranspiration the increase in precipitations and temperature evapotranspiration will form a closer hydrological relationship this is attributed to the intensified hydrological cycle and formed strong hydrological transmission relationship seneviratne et al 2010 sm in arid regions is not sensitive to climate changes in dry climatic conditions and precipitation has a greater effect on soil moisture in humid regions hence decreased precipitation can lead to a rapid decline in surface soil moisture wu et al 2020b ding et al 2021 wang et al 2022 in terms of climatic conditions southeast china is located in the subtropical and tropical monsoon regions with more precipitation and evapotranspiration liu et al 2019 and some research shows that changes in topographic conditions will also lead to uneven distribution of water vapor khosh bin ghomash et al 2019 ding et al 2021 meanwhile it is also found that the drt of agricultural drought is significantly shorter in summer and autumn than that in spring and winter it is primarily attributed to high evapotranspiration in summer the melting moisture from snow and ice and agricultural irrigation increase sm in spring qi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a huang et al 2015 the drt of ad to md is significantly influenced by climatic conditions vegetation cover and irrigation type the drt is the longest in woodlands in zones i and v woodlands have deeper root systems and can use deeper sm given moisture deficit and lengthening drt davidson et al 2000 anderegg et al 2015 however grasslands are more sensitive to precipitation due to their relatively shallow root systems craine et al 2013 knapp et al 2015 therefore the drt of grassland is shorter than woodland besides the drt of grasses is also influenced by topographic conditions copeland et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the sm from snow and permafrost melt to plateau grasslands can delay drought response hence the drt of grasslands in zone vii is much longer than that of other climatic regions the correlation between grains and md using ndvi and spei indicates that grains have high moisture requirements during the growing season and are exposed to seasonal precipitation and farmland is vulnerable to drought therefore the drt of grains is slightly shorter xu et al 2018 rainfed agricultural areas are mainly located in arid semi arid and humid semi humid regions with adequate rainfall previous studies have shown that irrigation has a role in regulating regional microclimate irrigation may lead to an increase in latent heat fluxes a small decrease in maximum temperature and some increase in precipitation and sm which lead to an increase in moisture content and facilitate the redeployment of atmospheric moisture ozdogan et al 2010 huang et al 2015 mishra et al 2020 thus there may be a close relationship between the hydrological cycle in irrigated areas in areas where irrigation is required rainfall is often insufficient for normal crop growth as a result the drt in this area is short and timely irrigation is needed to replenish soil moisture the response process of ad to md is a complex process ad is calculated based on soil moisture data there are many soil moisture products but it has different applicability in different regions there are many indicators of meteorological drought and agricultural drought such as spi ndvi and so on the drt of ad to md also be affected by different drought indexes this is mainly because different factors are considered in the construction process of different drought indicators for example spi is a meteorological drought index based on precipitation and ndvi represents the growth state and coverage of vegetation therefore the research on drt has a certain uncertainty the response characteristics of ad show differences in sub regions although we have divided different climate zones and analyzed the drought response of underlying surface conditions in different climate regions there are still many factors ignored such as the driving factors of drought response meanwhile there are still some uncertainties in the division of different underlying surfaces including vegetation and irrigation types it is still necessary to further explore and discuss the mechanism for drought response moreover drought duration and intensity of drought response and threshold of drought transmission still need further exploration and discussion 6 conclusions the meteorological drought index nspei and agricultural drought index ssi can characterize the spatial and temporal aspects of drought meanwhile the drt of ad to md is investigated based on correlation analysis and run theory finally a quantitative evaluation of the effects of vegetation and irrigation conditions on drt is done across different climatic zones and subsurface conditions the aforementioned analyses help to obtain the following interesting and important findings and conclusions 1 the number of md is higher than ad besides the highest number of ad and md is mainly in zone ii and the southeast of zones iii iv ad mainly increases in zones i iii however the trend of md is opposite in most parts of eastern china and md and ad drought in zone vii show decreasing trend 2 under mild drought the frequency of ad is less than 50 when the md reaches extreme drought ad can start its development process and zone ii is the area with frequent compound md and ad drt in different climatic zones is spatially characterized by a lower in eastern china and higher in western china and the drt of humid zones zones iii iv is less than that of arid and semi arid zones zones v vi meanwhile on the seasonal scale drt in summer and autumn is shorter than that in spring and winter 3 grains are the dominant vegetation type in eastern china zones i iv and zones v and drt is generally shorter than other vegetation compared with rain fed crops irrigated crops are less adaptable to the climate and more vulnerable to drought hence the drt of the rainfed crop is longer than irrigated crop however the drt of single crop irrigated is significantly longer than double crop and three crop irrigated indicating that the higher the planting intensity the shorter the drt credit authorship contribution statement peng sun conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation visualization funding acquisition writing

2129,the effect of rapidly changing soil properties during surface sealing is usually neglected in hillslope infiltration runoff modeling practices despite its substantial impact based on the modified seal formation model and a two layer infiltration runoff model a physics based computationally efficient modeling framework is developed to simulate the rainfall infiltration runoff process on slopes during seal formation the framework considers the rapid variations of soil properties of the surface layer over time to reflect the soil sealing process while accounting for the steepness of the slope on sloping surfaces the raindrop impact can both facilitate soil sealing via the normal component to the slope dominant role and reverse the process because of the tangential component secondary role the proposed solution approach needs no numerical grid adjustment to address the progressive sealing layer compaction the model simulations accord well with the runoff experiments of different rainfall intensities and slope gradients during seal formation rainfall intensity and slope gradient can significantly affect the variation of soil hydraulic properties the new approach is compared to the case where the seal layer formation is not accounted for and to the case where a completely formed seal is assumed at the rainfall onset it is found that accounting for the sealing process affects the hydrological processes neglecting seal formation or assuming a completely formed seal layer would lead to large errors in both infiltration and runoff predictions the proposed model can improve rainfall infiltration runoff models applicable for hillslopes subject to fast changing soil properties during surface sealing or rapid soil compaction keywords soil sealing crust rainfall infiltration runoff slope soil compaction soil properties data availability i have shared the link to my data 1 introduction crust formation and surface sealing caused by rainfall are a common process in many soils all over the world e g assouline 2004 neave and rayburg 2007 malam issa et al 2011 han et al 2016 lu et al 2017 di prima et al 2018 liu et al 2019 assouline and thompson 2022 the seal is a relatively thin layer characterized by a higher bulk density and strength and by finer pores than the underlying soil mcintyre 1958 bradford et al 1987 hu et al 2012 armenise et al 2018 becker et al 2018 m√ºgler et al 2019 the soil physical and hydraulic properties including the bulk density the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the saturated and the residual water content were closely related to the degree of seal formation mualem and assouline 1989 le bissonnais et al 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 2002 augeard et al 2007 hardie and almajmaie 2019 kakeh et al 2020 for instance the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity can decrease by two or three orders of magnitude from that of the underlying subsoil layer during the seal formation process king and bjorneberg 2012 the low hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer reduces both infiltration and evaporation fluxes from the soil which plays an important crosscutting role in hydrological agricultural and ecological sciences e g carmi and berliner 2008 chen et al 2013 assouline et al 2015 sela et al 2015 bullard et al 2018a jiang et al 2018 tobias et al 2018 the seal formation process is very complex and is dominated by a wide variety of factors involving rainfall soil topographic and flow properties assouline 2004 augeard et al 2008 bullard et al 2018b ran et al 2018 the physical rainfall characteristics i e rainfall intensity and kinetic energy were found to play a major role in determining the seal properties and the rate of seal formation morin and benyamini 1977 baumhardt et al 1990 assouline and ben hur 2006 huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 vaezi et al 2017 models were developed that related the seal properties to the rainfall intensity and kinetic energy edwards and larson 1969 baumhardt et al 1990 mualem et al 1990 assouline and mualem 1997 yeom and sjoblom 2016 in these relationships a low intensity or kinetic energy rainfall would directly cause a less compacted seal layer with a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity these models focused mainly on flat surfaces and neglected slope related factors that may potentially affect surface sealing for example the high intensity or kinetic energy rainfall also suggests a higher mobility of soil particles due to splash and sheet erosion wu et al 2018 which may lead to severe erosion of the surface layer in the presence of a slope gradient thus retarding the seal formation this was shown experimentally by assouline and ben hur 2006 where slope gradient happened to be an important topographic factor affecting kinetic energy of raindrops net applied rainfall and overland flow thus impacting on the dynamics of seal formation slope gradient is the main factor that was neglected in earlier soil sealing models but its role in seal formation can be important and multifold first a higher slope gradient leads to less raindrops reaching the surface per unit slope area and a smaller normal component of the impinging force momentum chen and young 2006 second the probability for the occurrence of a thin water layer covering the soil surface and protecting it from raindrops compaction poesen 1986 is greater on low slopes third high splash and sheet erosion intensity may occur on steep slopes which constantly mobilizes the top layer and retards the seal formation poesen 1986 wu et al 2017 these infer that the increase of the slope gradient would decrease the rate of seal formation and impact on infiltration and runoff formation the seal formation models that focused on horizontal surfaces might therefore lead to inaccuracies in the prediction of infiltration runoff and erosion processes on sloping surfaces prone to seal formation moreover in soil infiltration models considering the seal layer impact which are few among all infiltration models the process of seal formation is rarely taken into account rodr√≠guez caballero et al 2015 morbidelli et al 2018 early infiltration models were developed for vertically homogeneous soils such as the widely used philip model philip 1957 chow et al 1988 the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 chu 1978 chen and young 2006 selker and assouline 2017 and the smith parlange model smith and parlange 1978 parlange et al 1982 since the crust or soil seal is common in nature some infiltration models treat the sealed soil column as a two layer profile i e a fine seal layer overlying a relatively coarser subsoil layer for instance hillel and gardner 1969 modeled a sealed soil as a uniform soil profile capped with a low permeable saturated thin layer of prescribed constant properties smith et al 1999 and corradini et al 2000 2011 presented a conceptual model to represent infiltration into layered or crusted soil profiles without restricting the state of surface saturation cerdan et al 2002 incorporated soil surface sealing processes in an expert based runoff model but the infiltrability of different surfaces were characterized by arbitrary prescribed values cui and zhu 2018 developed a new analytical model to simulate the infiltration and runoff on a crusted surface however in all these cases the soil sealing process was not considered but a static two layer system with a top seal layer with constant prescribed properties was used in fact a few studies tried to incorporate seal formation into soil infiltration modeling baumhardt 1990 assouline and mualem 1997 but these models did not account for the secondary processes in the seal formation that are related to the presence of a slope gradient with respect to hydrological modeling seal formation further complicates the non linear feedback of infiltration soil properties and therefore can add complexity to simulating the system assouline 2004 seal formation can rapidly change the hydraulic properties at the soil surface within the timeframe of hours le bissonnais et al 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 hardie and almajmaie 2019 kakeh et al 2020 surface sealing also affects surface runoff and erosion processes assouline and ben hur 2006 danino et al 2021 using averaged parameters to simplify the problem into a static process rather than a dynamic one may introduce errors that have not been carefully evaluated which can affect the subsequent simulated infiltration runoff and erosion rates smith et al 1999 corradini et al 2000 2011 chen et al 2013 2016 cui and zhu 2018 wu et al 2018 wu and chen 2020 however it is not trivial to include adequately dynamic soil physical and hydraulic parameters e g the saturated water content the residual water content the air entry pressure the particle size distribution factor and the saturated hydraulic conductivity changing at the rate of seal formation in infiltration modeling mathematically it involves solving partial differential equations with time varying parameters determined by time varying constitutive relations in our problem the constitutive relation between the parameter soil hydraulic conductivity k and the state variable pressure œà or moisture Œ∏ varies with time not only because of wetting but also as a function of the cumulative rainfall kinetic energy applied at the upper boundary condition of the solution domain a full consideration of seal formation and infiltration needs to introduce equations for sealing altered hydraulic properties and treat them as additional independent variables coupled in the system the above review indicates two main issues remaining unaddressed by previous studies i the lack of an appropriate approach that can model the dynamic seal formation and rainfall infiltration runoff processes on sloping surfaces ii how the co evolving seal formation and the infiltration runoff processes vary with rainfall soil and slope characteristics the aims of the present study were to 1 conduct a rational extension to the assouline and mualem 1997 seal formation model to account for the impact of slope steepness on seal formation 2 develop a theoretical framework to simulate hillslope rainfall infiltration runoff processes during the seal formation process and 3 address the questions of whether and how rainfall soil and slope characteristics affect seal formation and infiltration runoff processes these efforts are expected to produce a more realistic and accurate approach for infiltration and runoff prediction at hillslope surfaces with dynamic changes of soil properties induced by natural or artificial compaction 2 modeling approach this study focuses on the infiltration and runoff simulation on a sloping surface subject to rapidly changing soil properties during surface sealing the two layer soil profile is illustrated in fig 1 which shows a subsoil layer under the top sealing layer note that the soil hydraulic properties are variable with soil depth during the seal formation however considering the variable soil hydraulic properties with soil depth substantially increases model complexity the temporal and spatial variations of grids and parameters with small benefit instead we used a constant maximum thickness of seal layer during the seal formation and described the temporarily changing but depth averaged soil properties within this depth 2 1 seal formation model for sloping surfaces the dynamic model of assouline and mualem 1997 relates surface sealing to the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the undisturbed soil in its initial stage as well as the physical characteristics of the applied rainfall under given boundary conditions consider a homogeneous bare soil of initial bulk density œÅ i kg m 3 exposed to a continuous rainfall intensity p m s because of the raindrops impacts the mean bulk density of the seal layer increases with time by an increment Œ¥ œÅ 0 t kg m 3 up to a maximum of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 dependent on both soil and slope gradient s 0 the variation of the average bulk density of sealing layer can be described by assouline and mualem 1997 1 d Œ¥ œÅ 0 t dt 0 145 Œæ Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 t where t is time s Œæ is a constant related to the soil sealing process s0 sin Œ≥ is the slope gradient Œ≥ is the slope angle the change of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 with slope gradient is assumed to follow a power law trend i e Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 1 0 s 0 Œ∑ considering the slope effect on seal formation see the next paragraph and appendix for more discussion where Œ∑ is the power law exponent which is found to be 1 30 in the present study based on experimental data Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 represents the maximum variation of soil bulk density on a flat surface the current approach is based on the model presented in assouline and mualem 1997 while adding the consideration of the role of slope gradient that can potentially affect seal development on sloping surfaces the modification comes from two aspects on the one hand the increasing slope gradient reduces the impinging effect of raindrops this is because the amount of received rainfall and the part of kinetic energy per unit area corresponding to the normal component of raindrop velocity decrease with increasing slope angle this will slow down the seal formation on the other hand the energy corresponding to the tangential component of the raindrop velocity increases with the slope this can boost the splash erosion by raindrops on sloping surfaces that has a net effect of downslope soil particle transport also if runoff is generated the higher slope gradient will result in higher kinetic energy of the overland flow and increase the potential of water erosion these mechanisms associated to the tangential part of rainfall energy can delay the formation of the seal layer or destruct it partially furthermore this slope effect on sealing is likely to amplify with increasing rainfall intensity to address the overall slope effect the parameter Œæ in eq 1 is modified from its original form into 2 Œæ f 2 œâ k p cos Œ≥ d m 2 Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 œÑ œÅ i œà i where œâ is a constant representing the soil rainfall system k is a coefficient and equals œÄ œÅ w w 2 cos 2 Œ≥ 12 as shown in appendix w is a constant representing the medium of the falling drop for which the value 14 500 is adopted according to gunn and kinzer 1949 and laws 1941 d m is the median drop size of the rainfall m œÑ œÅ i œà i is the shear strength per unit area of the soil at the point of contact kg m 1 which is expressed as 0 11 œÅ i 107 13 œà i 0 13 according to assouline and mualem 1997 compared to the original expression of Œæ in assouline and mualem 1997 a slope factor cos Œ≥ and a new parameter f are added in the modified form the parameter f accounts for the tangential impact of rainfall on seal formation on sloping surfaces and can be expressed conceptually as 3 f e k f p k s s 0 0 5 where k f is an empirical coefficient k s is the initial saturated soil hydraulic conductivity which is used here to normalize p m s a factor f is introduced here to account for the trend that the rate of seal formation decreases with slope angle due to the tangential effect of rainfall on slopes the two proposed modifications of the parameter Œæ tend to delay and reduce the seal formation as discussed above more details considering the sealing model extension are described in appendix the major soil variables of the seal layer affecting infiltration including the saturated water content the residual water content the air entry pressure the particle size distribution factor and its saturated hydraulic conductivity are considered using the corresponding properties of the undisturbed soil along with the change in bulk density Œ¥ œÅ 0 t the relationships derived by mualem and assouline 1989 can be found in the eqs a14 a18 in appendix compared to the original seal formation model assouline and mualem 1997 the present model includes the slope gradient and considers the tangential effect of rainfall that could potentially delay or reduce the seal layer formation as a result two new parameters Œ∑ and k f see eqs 1 and 3 were introduced which need to be calibrated before using the proposed model 2 2 soil infiltration model considering the layering soil profile due to surface sealing the two layer infiltration model developed by smith et al 1993 1999 and corradini et al 1994 1997 2000 was applied in this study to effectively simulate rainwater moving through the two layer system chen et al 2013 2016 showed that this model accurately reproduces infiltration on a hillslope with a sealed soil surface to extend the model to sloping surfaces the governing equations can be modified by changing the terms depicting the gravity effect wu et al 2018 2019 2021 the details of the soil infiltration model are shown in appendix note that this infiltration model was developed to simulate soil infiltration in a two layer profile with constant soil properties which is not directly applicable for the soil infiltration with rapid changing soil properties at the vicinity of the soil surface this is because the varying soil properties can affect the soil water capillary pressure within the seal layer and at the interface with the undisturbed soil underneath to overcome this difficulty the solution approach applies a stepwise change for the soil properties i e the parameters remain constant during each time step for infiltration simulation and undergo an instantaneous adjustment at the end of each time step following the estimated hydraulic properties of the seal layer during its formation based on the dynamic model presented above the pressure value in the top layer is assumed to be unchanged after the adjustment of soil properties considering the interface pressure continuity while the soil moisture is adjusted in response to the sealing induced changes in soil properties within the time step this treatment relaxes the strong coupling between the governing differential equations and the time varying soil constitutive relation k œà or k Œ∏ function it allows separate computations for the infiltration and the sealing induced changes in soil properties within each time step while maintaining a weakly coupled process of infiltration and sealing development over time as well as the continuity of the pressure within the whole profile in addition the present approach imposes no requirement of dynamic grid adjustment as in common computational fluid dynamics practice for moving boundary problems which greatly reduces the complexity of numerical efforts 2 3 1d kinematic wave flow model the 1d kinematic wave approximation to the st venant equations has long been applied successfully to simulate hillslope overland flow similar equations were adopted by liu and singh 2004 and wu et al 2019 2020 the governing equations are shown in appendix 2 4 data for model calibration and validation the experimental data of assouline and ben hur 2006 were used for calibrating and evaluating the model the texture of the sandy soil used in the experiment was 88 sand 2 silt and 10 clay the organic matter content was 0 9 soil layers of 0 02 m thickness were packed in perforated metal trays of 0 30 m by 0 50 m by 0 10 m at a mean bulk density of 1260 kg m 3 the packed soil trays were placed in boxes over a coarse sand layer 0 08 m thick a rotating disc type rainfall simulator was used to generate rainfall at a prescribed constant value morin et al 1967 the trays were exposed to 70 mm of rainfall at two intensities 24 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 and three slope gradients 5 15 and 25 the coarse sand layer below the soil layers allowed free drainage of water to an outlet pipe set in the base of the box which was used to directly measure infiltration runoff was collected at the outlet of the trays and measured moreover because the length of the trays is short rills did not occur on the slope which would not affect the runoff and infiltration processes three cases with p 24 mm h 1 and s0 5 p 24 mm h 1 and s0 15 and p 60 mm h 1 and s0 5 were used to calibrate the model and the remaining three cases with p 24 mm h 1 and s0 25 p 60 mm h 1 and s0 15 and p 60 mm h 1 and s0 25 were used to validate the model the observed and calibrated parameters of the rainfall soil and slopes of the experiments are presented in table 1 the rainfall characteristics and the slope gradient are set before the exposition to rainfall there are six input parameters for the infiltration model including the initial soil water content Œ∏ i the saturated soil water content Œ∏ s the air entry pressure œà b the particle size distribution parameter Œª the residual soil water content Œ∏ r and the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s the soil characteristics were estimated by the neural network prediction of hydrus 1d model based on the measured soil texture and density in the lab schaap et al 2001 the soil water hydraulic properties are described by general functional forms of smith et al 1993 following assouline and mualem 1997 we assume that the maximal thickness of the disturbed layer d c is reached shortly after the beginning of rainfall for a given soil rainfall system since assouline and mualem 1997 observed a power law decrease in d c with rainfall intensity a power law expression for d c d c 5 83 p k s 0 314 can be determined by the seal thickness values under two different rainfall intensity in assouline and ben hur 2006 mm the initial soil water content manning s roughness and soil sealing parameters including Œ∏ i n d m Œ¥ œÅ 0 œâ Œ∑ and k f were calibrated by fitting the hydrological model predictions to the runoff data during the soil sealing process notably before the seal formation the soil properties are the same for the different soil depths and the soil parameters for the infiltration model remain the same for the two layers the space and time steps for the model were set to 0 05 m and 1 0 s respectively notably the small time step for the numerical solution is because of the rapidly varying soil properties of the seal layer during rainfall event with these parameters the soil hydraulic parameters of the seal layer were obtained by using the corresponding analytical solution of soil seal formation model then the above infiltration and runoff models were solved numerically using the standard runge kutta fourth order rk4 and the tvd maccormack approaches respectively before examining the capability of the proposed model the sensitivity of the modeling results to the computational time and the spatial step was examined by testing different time steps and cell sizes satisfying the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition it is found that the numerical errors caused by using the different time steps and cell sizes were negligible and the present temporal and spatial steps are sufficient for model accuracy 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 2 depicts the simulated and measured runoff rate rr versus time for the two intensities and three slope gradients it is shown that rr simulated by the present model are very close to the observed values the root mean square errors rmses between the simulated and measured rr are about 0 69 mm h 1 p 24 mm

it indicates that the newly developed model has the capability in simulating the soil sealing infiltration and runoff processes and can reflect the impact of processes related to slope gradient on seal formation dynamics fig 3 shows the variations of soil properties of the surface layer during the soil sealing process for two rainfall intensities and three slope gradients it is shown that the seal formation process can substantially change the soil properties of the surface soil among these properties of sealing layer Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 r and œà 1 b tends to increase during the formation while Œ∏ 1 s Œª 1 and k 1 s show a decreasing trend all the soil properties change very rapidly at first and much more slowly at later times taking the case of p 24 mm h 1 and s0 15 as an example the variation of these soil properties in the first 87 5 min rainfall are 9 7 9 7 9 7 7 0 9 7 and 154 5 times larger than that occurred in the last 87 5 min rainfall intensity and its kinetic energy are found to significantly affect soil sealing baumhardt 1990 assouline and mualem 1997 assouline 2004 besides the rainfall intensity the effect of slope gradient is also an important factor in this process with the increase of slope gradient the variations of soil properties of the seal layer become less significant fig 4 shows the cumulative runoff depth rd and infiltration depth id versus time during the surface sealing process the result indicates that the variations of rd and id can be divided into two stages in the first stage since saturation of the seal layer under formation is not reached and there is no ponding rd 0 mm while the infiltration rate equals the rainfall intensity and id shows a linear increasing trend once ponding occurs second stage rd increases exponentially while id shows a logarithmic increasing trend this is related to the gradual decrease of the soil permeability of the upper layer during soil sealing 3 2 effects of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on soil sealing and infiltration runoff data show that the seal formation is almost completed after approximately 60 mm of cumulative rainfall depth independently of the rainfall intensity because Œ¥ œÅ 0 t of the seal layer has reached 95 of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 see figs 2 and 3 consequently the impacts of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on soil sealing and infiltration runoff properties were examined under the same cumulative rainfall depth 60 mm the other model parameters remained the same as those in table 1 the results of Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 s Œ∏ 1 r œà 1 b Œª 1 k 1 s rd id and rr versus s 0 and p are shown in fig 5 for the soil properties of seal layer with the increase of slope gradient Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 r and œà 1 b versus s 0 show a monotonic decrease trend while Œ∏ 1 s Œª 1 and k 1 s tend to increase gradually the rainfall intensity has a slight impact on the trends of the soil properties versus slope gradient taking Œ¥ œÅ 0 and k 1 s as an example for p 24 mm h 1 the difference of Œ¥ œÅ 0 and k 1 s between s0 5 and 30 is 80 85 kg m 3 and 1 90 mm h 1 which vary to 88 71 kg m 3 and 2 35 mm h 1 for p 60 mm h 1 and to 97 93 kg m 3 and 2 92 mm h 1 for p 84 mm h 1 the variation of soil properties with rainfall intensity is similar to the trends of soil properties with slope gradient with the increase of rainfall intensity Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 r and œà 1 b tend to decrease gradually while Œ∏ 1 s Œª 1 and k 1 s increase gradually it suggests that both the rainfall intensity and slope gradient have a monotonic impact on the variation of soil properties as shown in fig 5 the variations of soil properties of the seal layer affect rd id and rr where rd equals the cumulative rainfall depth minus id m and rr equals the ratio between unit width discharge q and slope length m s with the increase of slope gradient rd and rr tend to decrease due to the higher k 1 s and less received rainfall amount and thus id would increase accordingly in comparison the variations of rd rr and id with rainfall intensity show opposite trends with the increase of rainfall intensity both rd and rr tend to increase monotonically while id tends to decrease gradually with a decelerating rate of change this is because the small rainfall intensity delays the soil sealing process see fig 3 and more water can infiltrate into the soil although a smaller Œ¥ œÅ 0 and a larger k 1 s occur at the end of high intensity rainfall moreover for the extremely large rainfall intensity the formed soil seal may be partially eroded resulting in a smaller decrease in id it demonstrates the dual role of rainfall intensity on sloping surfaces it can facilitate soil sealing because of the normal component dominant role and in the meantime can also exert impact to inhibit the process because of the tangential component secondary role which provide a theoretical explanation for the previous controversial findings armenise et al 2018 3 3 effects of Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 and Œæ on runoff process as the two most important parameters for the seal formation model see eq 1 the variations of maximum increase of soil bulk density Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 and soil destruction constant Œæ can significantly affect the runoff process taking the case with p 60 mm h 1 and s0 15 as an example the impacts of Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 v and Œæ Œæ v on rr are shown in fig 6 where Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 v and Œæ v are equal to the calibrated values of the parameters see table 1 it is shown that with the increase of Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 v ponding occurs earlier and the runoff rate increases quickly at first and then at a much slower pace towards a stable value comparatively the similar trends of runoff rate and ponding time can be also found with the increase of Œæ Œæ v the only difference is that the differences of runoff rate between different Œæ Œæ v tend to decrease greatly with time taking the difference between Œæ Œæ v 0 5 and 1 5 as an example it equals 38 68 mm h 1 at t 30 min which decreases to 20 91 and 12 01 mm h 1 at t 45 and 60 min respectively this indicates that both Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 and Œæ can significantly affect the runoff process and the final runoff rate for short duration rainfalls but for long duration rainfalls the final runoff rates are almost the same for different Œæ 3 4 comparing the present seal formation model with the original model compared to the original seal formation model assouline and mualem 1997 the present seal formation model includes the effect of slope gradient in several aspects to examine this impact consequently on hillslope runoff process the runoff rates simulated with the original seal formation model were compared to the observed values for different rainfall intensity and slope gradient as shown in fig 7 note that the case with p 24 mm h 1 and s0 5 was used to calibrate the original seal formation model and the most calibrated model parameters were the same as table 1 except Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 eq 1 and œâ eq 2 which can be expressed as Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 421 3 kg m 3 and œâ 1 15 10 3 in the original seal formation model respectively the original model predicts the effect of rainfall intensity as depicted by the good agreement between the simulated results for p 60 mm h 1 and s0 5 and the measured data but fails to reproduce the effect of slope comparing the results in fig 7 with the ones from the proposed new model fig 2 show that the modified model including the combined slope gradient effects significantly improve the runoff prediction accuracy 3 5 effects of changing soil properties of the seal layer on infiltration runoff process although the soil sealing process can significantly change the soil properties and eventually affect the soil infiltration process mualem and assouline 1989 le bissonnais et al 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 king and bjorneberg 2012 common soil infiltration models do not consider the seal formation process green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 chu 1978 parlange et al 1982 chow et al 1988 smith et al 1993 1999 corradini et al 1994 1997 2000 chen and young 2006 in general two approaches are commonly adopted the first one neglects the seal and directly uses the one layer soil infiltration model hereafter referred to as one layer model for clarity on the homogeneous non sealed soil the second approach considers a fully formed seal layer with no further change and uses the two layer soil infiltration model hereafter referred to as two layer model for clarity which is equivalent to an instant formation of a sealing layer to simulate infiltration on the sealed soil smith et al 1999 cerdan et al 2002 corradini et al 2000 2011 cui and zhu 2018 to evaluate the effects of changing soil properties of the seal layer on infiltration runoff process we compare the proposed model dynamic evolution of the soil properties of the seal layer with the results from the two approaches described above constant soil properties in the one and the two layer models taking p 60 mm h 1 and s0 15 as an example fig 8 shows the simulated trends of rr rd and id versus t on hillslopes based on the new model and the results from the two approaches respectively for the sealing soil its soil permeability varies gradually from the permeability of non sealed soil to the permeability of completely sealed one the simulated curves of rr rd and id versus t with the proposed model are therefore between the curve corresponding to the one layer model and the one corresponding to the two layer model the results show that the one layer model does not generate runoff for all the time the two layer model generates runoff almost immediately after the rainfall started while the proposed model generated runoff at a much later time t 14 min the runoff rates of the proposed model and the two layer model eventually approach similar values the cumulative infiltration and runoff for the two cases being quite different the result also suggests that the difference between the two layer and the proposed model is mostly determined at early time and does not change substantially after runoff generated in both cases it can be concluded that for general rainfall events except very short or very long duration rainfall using one layer or two layer soil infiltration models for a progressively sealing soil may cause substantial errors on the infiltration and runoff predictions the first one underestimating runoff and the second one overestimating it from the perspective of runoff generation mechanism the runoff production in proposed model is determined by the variations of both hydraulic gradient and the soil hydraulic properties of surface seal layer while in the two layer model is only determined by the variation of hydraulic gradient the great difference between the two layer and the proposed model in fig 8 suggests that during seal formation the variations of surface soil hydraulic properties have a nonnegligible impact on runoff production comparing to the role of gradient reduction the difference between the proposed model and the two layer model was further examined for 5 different slope gradients and 6 different rainfall intensities fig 9 note that results of the one layer model were not included because no runoff can be generated on the soil in our study without sealing for comparison a reference time is also presented which was chosen as the completion time to soil sealing t r defined as 4 t r t Œ¥ œÅ 0 t 0 999 Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 where t r is the time when Œ¥ œÅ 0 t of the seal layer reaches 99 9 of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 fig 9a b shows simulated ponding time and completion time of soil sealing respectively for 5 different slope gradients and 6 different rainfall intensities the results indicate that surface ponding and soil sealing advances more quickly for flat slope and large rainfall intensity as expected under a specific rainfall depth 60 mm the runoff depths rd simulated by proposed model for 5 different slope gradients and 6 different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 9c it is evident that rd tends to increase greatly with increasing rainfall intensity and decreasing slope gradient the relative difference of rd between the two models under 60 mm rainfall depth is sensitive to both rainfall intensity and slope gradient see fig 9d the relative difference becomes larger than 50 for steep slopes and low intensity rainfall since it takes a long time to complete soil sealing it indicates the importance of soil sealing process on infiltration and runoff predictions during a single rainfall event fig 9e shows how the relative difference of runoff between a progressive and a pre existing seal layer varies with cumulative rainfall depth which is proportional to the total kinetic energy the relative difference although continuously decreasing with rainfall depth is no less than 20 for the studied soil at a 100 mm cumulative rainfall a fairly large rainfall depth note that smaller rainfall intensities and higher slope gradients correspond to larger relative differences moreover according to the result a two layer infiltration model with static soil properties can only replace the progressive sealing model at a very high rainfall depth without causing a large error for infiltration and runoff predictions for practical applications this approximation is likely to reduce the accuracy of the simulation 3 6 sensitivity analysis to the soil hydraulic properties previous studies show that soil sealing formation affects soil infiltration mainly through modifying five major soil hydraulic properties including Œ∏ 1 s Œ∏ 1 r œà 1 b Œª 1 and k 1 s mualem and assouline 1989 le bissonnais et al 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 however how much these soil hydraulic properties affect the soil infiltration process remains unclear taking p 60 mm h 1 and t 60 min as an example a series of numerical tests were carried out to examine the sensitivity of soil infiltration and runoff characteristics to the variations of different soil hydraulic properties all the model parameters are the same as table 1 note that case 1 is a control group and all the soil hydraulic properties of case 1 are dynamic during the soil sealing process in comparison for cases 2 6 we held one soil hydraulic property constant that equal the value of original unsealed soil at initial time and let the other properties vary within the soil sealing process the simulated infiltration and runoff properties are shown in table 2 the results show that among these soil hydraulic properties tested k 1 s the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer is the most sensitive parameter and a constant k 1 s during the seal formation process can decrease rr and rd from 48 23 mm h 1 and 28 44 mm to 0 mm h 1 and 0 mm respectively the variations of œà 1 b and Œª 1 during the seal formation process can also slightly affect the soil infiltration and runoff characteristics the constant œà 1 b and Œª 1 tend to increase rr and rd but decrease id slightly however holding Œ∏ 1 s or Œ∏ 1 r as a constant has almost no impact on the rr rd and id this is possibly because Œ∏ 1 s and Œ∏ 1 r of the seal layer vary slightly during the seal formation process and their impacts on the infiltration and runoff processes decrease greatly for high intensity rainfalls in addition table 2 also suggests that the sharp decrease in k1s plays a dominant role in soil infiltration variation during the seal formation this suggests that an empirical expression for temporarily varying k1s may be used to replace the entire progressive sealing model based on the proposed model we can obtain a priori knowledge for the variation of k1s especially for complex conditions such as unsteady rainfall and complex slope shape such an empirical expression for k1s over time can then be developed by fitting the results of the proposed model however the proposed model has not yet been widely examined due to the lack of experimental data consequently the obtained expression will not be universal and one should still use caution because the parameters of seal formation may strongly be related to soil types and to initial conditions e g armenise et al 2018 zambon et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 for instance the initial water content can have a twofold impact on the runoff rate on the one hand the high initial water content will speed up ponding and surface runoff generation on the other hand the initial water content is closely related to the soil sealing by affecting the soil shear strength see eq 2 the high initial water content would decrease the soil shear strength and accelerate the soil sealing process assouline and mualem 1997 nevertheless more experimental studies are still needed to understand quantitatively the soil sealing process for different types of soils and initial conditions 3 7 model applications the quick development of soil sealing during rainfall events can substantially affect the runoff generation and erosion robinson and phillips 2001 neave and rayburg 2007 this is a direct application of the proposed model soil sealing may be demolished frequently by human or natural physical or bioactivities especially in agricultural regions armenise et al 2018 assouline and thompson 2022 this will happen at least annually rendering soil sealing a repeated process in sealing prone regions in these regions accurately predicting runoff and erosion will need the representation of the dynamic development of soil sealing it may also benefit investigations of the interplay of ecosystem and hydrological system in these regions in a broader picture the approach may help improve hydrological representation of processes involving soil compaction such as root zone hydrology in addition earthquake induced rapid changes in soil properties may be another topic finds potential application of this model shahir et al 2012 el haber et al 2019 4 conclusions combining a modified seal formation model accounting for slope steepness a two layer soil infiltration model and a kinematic wave overland flow model a numerical framework is proposed for simulating hillslope rainfall infiltration runoff process with rapidly changing soil properties during seal formation process the framework modifies the original seal formation model and soil infiltration model to improve the representation of the role of rainfall intensity and slope gradient in the seal formation and soil infiltration processes which can be applied to natural hillslopes with changing soil properties of the surface layer during the course of seal formation or other types of soil compaction the model is validated against laboratory observed rainfall infiltration runoff data at two rainfall intensities and three slope gradients during the seal formation process and good agreements are found between observed and simulated infiltration and runoff processes during the seal formation process the maximum increase of soil bulk density the residual water content and the air entry pressure of seal layer versus time show an increasing trend while the saturated water content the particle size distribution factor and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer versus time show a decreasing trend all soil properties of the seal layer change very rapidly at first and then tend to vary slowly among these soil properties hillslope infiltration and runoff are most sensitive to the variation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer on sloping surface the rainfall can both facilitate soil sealing because of the normal component dominant role and reverse the process because of the tangential component secondary role with the increase of rainfall intensity while remaining the same rainfall depth the maximum increment of soil bulk density the residual water content and the air entry pressure of seal layer show monotonic decrease trends while the saturated water content the particle size distribution factor and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer show the converse trends the dynamic soil properties can increase the runoff depth and rate but decrease the infiltration and these variations would reduce for higher intensity rainfalls it indicates that the impact of rainfall intensity on soil sealing process shifts from the compaction force dominant to the erosion intensity dominant gradually comparatively the slope gradient can only restrain the soil sealing process with the increase of slope gradient the variations of soil hydraulic properties show similar trends with the variations of soil hydraulic properties versus rainfall intensity which can ultimately increase the infiltration depth and decrease runoff depth due to the higher soil permeability and less received rainfall amount neglecting the impacts of rainfall intensity and slope gradient would cause great errors on soil infiltration and runoff predictions the maximum increment of soil bulk density and the soil disturbance constant for the seal formation model can significantly change the runoff process and the final runoff rate for short duration rainfall however for long duration rainfalls the final runoff rates are almost the same for different soil disturbance constants neglecting the soil sealing process can cause large errors in soil infiltration and runoff prediction on hillslopes using a one layer soil infiltration model for the original non sealed soil properties will lead to an underestimate of runoff and the differences between the one layer model and the proposed model tend to increase with rainfall duration comparatively using the two layer model assuming an instantaneous formation of the seal layer would overestimate the runoff rate and depth however seal formation is relatively rapid this suggests that for very large cumulative rainfall depths a two layer infiltration model with constant soil properties after seal formation may be a good approximation for predicting infiltration and runoff on hillslopes with seal formation process finally it should be stated that our intention for this study is to propose a new infiltration runoff model to account the soil sealing process on sloping surfaces which is a missing physical component in previous studies in addition the model parameters in this study were obtained from model calibration by fitting the laboratory experimental data since soil sealing model parameters introduced in this study all have physical meanings further studies are needed to use physically based

extension of the assouline and mualem 1997 sealing model to sloping surfaces consider a homogeneous bare soil of initial bulk density œÅ i kg m 3 on a sloping surface of area a m2 that is exposed to a

effect of raindrops on steep slopes where Œ∑ is the power law exponent which is assigned the value 1 30 in the present study note that Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 represents the maximum variation of soil bulk density on a flat surface the raindrop diameter d m can vary between 0 and d max the maximal drop diameter every drop hits the sloping surface with a velocity practically identical to the terminal velocity of the falling drop v d m s the compacting effect of the raindrop is determined by the component of kinetic energy corresponding to the normal component of velocity v denoted as e n d n m which can be expressed as a2 e n d œÄ œÅ w d 3 v d cos Œ≥ 2 12 where œÅ w is the density of water kg m 3 Œ≥ is the slope angle the factor cos Œ≥ is introduced here to specify the component of falling velocity of raindrops normal to the sloping surface in the case of a laminar flow v d is proportional to d according to stokes law when turbulent flow conditions occur v d is related to d 0 5 beard 1976 atlas and

the drop diameter constant and independent of the intensity as shown in fig 1 the momentum input of the vertically falling raindrops to a slope can be decomposed into a normal part and a tangential downslope part the normal component presses the soil to form the seal and its impact reduces on a slope compared to on a horizontal surface this effect is intuitive and has been accounted for by taking the slope angle into consideration in eq a10 the tangential component has a net effect to mobilize soil particles downslope which may delay the sealing formation and reduce the final sealing

2129,the effect of rapidly changing soil properties during surface sealing is usually neglected in hillslope infiltration runoff modeling practices despite its substantial impact based on the modified seal formation model and a two layer infiltration runoff model a physics based computationally efficient modeling framework is developed to simulate the rainfall infiltration runoff process on slopes during seal formation the framework considers the rapid variations of soil properties of the surface layer over time to reflect the soil sealing process while accounting for the steepness of the slope on sloping surfaces the raindrop impact can both facilitate soil sealing via the normal component to the slope dominant role and reverse the process because of the tangential component secondary role the proposed solution approach needs no numerical grid adjustment to address the progressive sealing layer compaction the model simulations accord well with the runoff experiments of different rainfall intensities and slope gradients during seal formation rainfall intensity and slope gradient can significantly affect the variation of soil hydraulic properties the new approach is compared to the case where the seal layer formation is not accounted for and to the case where a completely formed seal is assumed at the rainfall onset it is found that accounting for the sealing process affects the hydrological processes neglecting seal formation or assuming a completely formed seal layer would lead to large errors in both infiltration and runoff predictions the proposed model can improve

saturated hydraulic conductivity can decrease by two or three orders of magnitude from that of the underlying subsoil layer during the seal formation process king and bjorneberg 2012 the low hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer reduces both infiltration and evaporation fluxes from the soil which plays an important crosscutting role in hydrological agricultural and ecological sciences e g carmi and berliner 2008 chen et al 2013 assouline et al 2015 sela et al 2015 bullard et al 2018a jiang et al 2018 tobias et al 2018 the seal formation process is very complex and is dominated by a wide variety of factors involving rainfall soil topographic and flow properties assouline 2004 augeard et al 2008 bullard et al 2018b ran et al 2018 the physical rainfall characteristics i e rainfall intensity and kinetic energy were found to play a major role in determining the seal properties and the rate of seal formation morin and benyamini 1977 baumhardt et al 1990 assouline and ben hur 2006 huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 vaezi et al 2017 models were developed that related the seal properties to the rainfall intensity and kinetic energy edwards and larson 1969 baumhardt et al 1990 mualem et al 1990 assouline and mualem 1997 yeom and sjoblom 2016 in these relationships a low intensity or kinetic energy rainfall would directly cause a less compacted seal layer with a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity these models focused mainly on flat surfaces and neglected slope related factors that may potentially affect surface sealing for example the high intensity or kinetic energy rainfall also suggests a higher mobility of soil particles due to splash and sheet erosion wu et al 2018 which may lead to severe erosion of the surface layer in the presence of a slope gradient thus retarding the seal formation this was shown experimentally by assouline and ben hur 2006 where slope gradient happened to be an important topographic factor affecting kinetic energy of raindrops net applied rainfall and overland flow thus impacting on the dynamics of seal formation slope gradient is the main factor that was neglected in earlier soil sealing models but its role in seal formation can be important and multifold first a higher slope gradient leads to less raindrops reaching the surface per unit slope area and a smaller normal component of the impinging force momentum chen and young 2006 second the probability for the occurrence of a thin water layer covering the soil surface and protecting it from raindrops compaction poesen 1986 is greater on low slopes third high splash and sheet erosion intensity may occur on steep slopes which constantly mobilizes the top layer and retards the seal formation poesen 1986 wu et al 2017 these infer that the increase of the slope gradient would decrease the rate of seal formation and impact on infiltration and runoff formation the seal formation models that focused on horizontal surfaces might therefore lead to inaccuracies in the prediction of infiltration runoff and erosion processes on sloping surfaces prone to seal formation moreover in soil infiltration models considering the seal layer impact which are few among all infiltration models the process of seal formation is rarely taken into account rodr√≠guez caballero et al 2015 morbidelli et al 2018 early infiltration models were developed for vertically homogeneous soils such as the widely used philip model philip 1957 chow et al 1988 the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 chu 1978 chen and young 2006 selker and assouline 2017 and the smith parlange model smith and parlange 1978 parlange et al 1982 since the crust or soil seal is common in nature some infiltration models treat the sealed soil column as a two layer profile i e a fine seal layer overlying a relatively coarser subsoil layer for instance hillel and gardner 1969 modeled a sealed soil as a uniform soil profile capped with a low permeable saturated thin layer of prescribed constant properties smith et al 1999 and corradini et al 2000 2011 presented a conceptual model to represent infiltration into layered or crusted soil profiles without restricting the state of surface saturation cerdan et al 2002 incorporated soil surface sealing processes in an expert based runoff model but the infiltrability of different surfaces were characterized by arbitrary prescribed values cui and zhu 2018 developed a new analytical model to simulate the infiltration and runoff on a crusted surface however in all these cases the soil sealing process was not considered but a static two layer system with a top seal layer with constant prescribed properties was used in fact a few studies tried to incorporate seal formation into soil infiltration modeling baumhardt 1990 assouline and mualem 1997 but these models did not account for the secondary processes in the seal formation that are related to the presence of a slope gradient with respect to hydrological modeling seal formation further complicates the non linear feedback of infiltration soil properties and therefore can add complexity to simulating the system assouline 2004 seal formation can rapidly change the hydraulic properties at the soil surface within the timeframe of hours le bissonnais et al 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 hardie and almajmaie 2019 kakeh et al 2020 surface sealing also affects surface runoff and erosion processes assouline and ben hur 2006 danino et al 2021 using averaged parameters to simplify the problem into a static process rather than a dynamic one may introduce errors that have not been carefully evaluated which can affect the subsequent simulated infiltration runoff and erosion rates smith et al 1999 corradini et al 2000 2011 chen et al 2013 2016 cui and zhu 2018 wu et al 2018 wu and chen 2020 however it is not trivial to include adequately dynamic soil physical and hydraulic parameters e g the saturated water content the residual water content the air entry pressure the particle size distribution factor and the saturated hydraulic conductivity changing at the rate of seal formation in infiltration modeling mathematically it involves solving partial differential equations with time varying parameters determined by time varying constitutive relations in our problem the constitutive relation between the parameter soil hydraulic conductivity k and the state variable pressure œà or moisture Œ∏ varies with time not only because of wetting but also as a function of the cumulative rainfall kinetic energy applied at the upper boundary condition of the solution domain a full consideration of seal formation and infiltration needs to introduce equations for sealing altered hydraulic properties and treat them as additional independent variables coupled in the system the above review indicates two main issues remaining unaddressed by previous studies i the lack of an appropriate approach that can model the dynamic seal formation and rainfall infiltration runoff processes on sloping surfaces ii how the co evolving seal formation and the infiltration runoff processes vary with rainfall soil and slope characteristics the aims of the present study were to 1 conduct a rational extension to the assouline and mualem 1997 seal formation model to account for the impact of slope steepness on seal formation 2 develop a theoretical framework to simulate hillslope rainfall infiltration runoff processes during the seal formation process and 3 address the questions of whether and how rainfall soil and slope characteristics affect seal formation and infiltration runoff processes these efforts are expected to produce a more realistic and accurate approach for infiltration and runoff prediction at hillslope surfaces with dynamic changes of soil properties induced by natural or artificial compaction 2 modeling approach this study focuses on the infiltration and runoff simulation on a sloping surface subject to rapidly changing soil properties during surface sealing the two layer soil profile is illustrated in fig 1 which shows a subsoil layer under the top sealing layer note that the soil hydraulic properties are variable with soil depth during the seal formation however considering the variable soil hydraulic properties with soil depth substantially increases model complexity the temporal and spatial variations of grids and parameters with small benefit instead we used a constant maximum thickness of seal layer during the seal formation and described the temporarily changing but depth averaged soil properties within this depth 2 1 seal formation model for sloping surfaces the dynamic model of assouline and mualem 1997 relates surface sealing to the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the undisturbed soil in its initial stage as well as the physical characteristics of the applied rainfall under given boundary conditions consider a homogeneous bare soil of initial bulk density œÅ i kg m 3 exposed to a continuous rainfall intensity p m s because of the raindrops impacts the mean bulk density of the seal layer increases with time by an increment Œ¥ œÅ 0 t kg m 3 up to a maximum of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 dependent on both soil and slope gradient s 0 the variation of the average bulk density of sealing layer can be described by assouline and mualem 1997 1 d Œ¥ œÅ 0 t dt 0 145 Œæ Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 t where t is time s Œæ is a constant related to the soil sealing process s0 sin Œ≥ is the slope gradient Œ≥ is the slope angle the change of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 with slope gradient is assumed to follow a power law trend i e Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 1 0 s 0 Œ∑ considering the slope effect on seal formation see the next paragraph and appendix for more discussion where Œ∑ is the power law exponent which is found to be 1 30 in the present study based on experimental data Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 represents the maximum variation of soil bulk density on a flat surface the current approach is based on the model presented in assouline and mualem 1997 while adding the consideration of the role of slope gradient that can potentially affect seal development on sloping surfaces the modification comes from two aspects on the one hand the increasing slope gradient reduces the impinging effect of raindrops this is because the amount of received rainfall and the part of kinetic energy per unit area corresponding to the normal component of raindrop velocity decrease with increasing slope angle this will slow down the seal formation on the other hand the energy corresponding to the tangential component of the raindrop velocity increases with the slope this can boost the splash erosion by raindrops on sloping surfaces that has a net effect of downslope soil particle transport also if runoff is generated the higher slope gradient will result in higher kinetic energy of the overland flow and increase the potential of water erosion these mechanisms associated to the tangential part of rainfall energy can delay the formation of the seal layer or destruct it partially furthermore this slope effect on sealing is likely to amplify with increasing rainfall intensity to address the overall slope effect the parameter Œæ in eq 1 is modified from its original form into 2 Œæ f 2 œâ k p cos Œ≥ d m 2 Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 œÑ œÅ i œà i where œâ is a constant representing the soil rainfall system k is a coefficient and equals œÄ œÅ w w 2 cos 2 Œ≥ 12 as shown in appendix w is a constant representing the medium of the falling drop for which the value 14 500 is adopted according to gunn and kinzer 1949 and laws 1941 d m is the median drop size of the rainfall m œÑ œÅ i œà i is the shear strength per unit area of the soil at the point of contact kg m 1 which is expressed as 0 11 œÅ i 107 13 œà i 0 13 according to assouline and mualem 1997 compared to the original expression of Œæ in assouline and mualem 1997 a slope factor cos Œ≥ and a new parameter f are added in the modified form the parameter f accounts for the tangential impact of rainfall on seal formation on sloping surfaces and can be expressed conceptually as 3 f e k f p k s s 0 0 5 where k f is an empirical coefficient k s is the initial saturated soil hydraulic conductivity which is used here to normalize p m s a factor f is introduced here to account for the trend that the rate of seal formation decreases with slope angle due to the tangential effect of rainfall on slopes the two proposed modifications of the parameter Œæ tend to delay and reduce the seal formation as discussed above more details considering the sealing model extension are described in appendix the major soil variables of the seal layer affecting infiltration including the saturated water content the residual water content the air entry pressure the particle size distribution factor and its saturated hydraulic conductivity are considered using the corresponding properties of the undisturbed soil along with the change in bulk density Œ¥ œÅ 0 t the relationships derived by mualem and assouline 1989 can be found in the eqs a14 a18 in appendix compared to the original seal formation model assouline and mualem 1997 the present model includes the slope gradient and considers the tangential effect of rainfall that could potentially delay or reduce the seal layer formation as a result two new parameters Œ∑ and k f see eqs 1 and 3 were introduced which need to be calibrated before using the proposed model 2 2 soil infiltration model considering the layering soil profile due to surface sealing the two layer infiltration model developed by smith et al 1993 1999 and corradini et al 1994 1997 2000 was applied in this study to effectively simulate rainwater moving through the two layer system chen et al 2013 2016 showed that this model accurately reproduces infiltration on a hillslope with a sealed soil surface to extend the model to sloping surfaces the governing equations can be modified by changing the terms depicting the gravity effect wu et al 2018 2019 2021 the details of the soil infiltration model are shown in appendix note that this infiltration model was developed to simulate soil infiltration in a two layer profile with constant soil properties which is not directly applicable for the soil infiltration with rapid changing soil properties at the vicinity of the soil surface this is because the varying soil properties can affect the soil water capillary pressure within the seal layer and at the interface with the undisturbed soil underneath to overcome this difficulty the solution approach applies a stepwise change for the soil properties i e the parameters remain constant during each time step for infiltration simulation and undergo an instantaneous adjustment at the end of each time step following the estimated hydraulic properties of the seal layer during its formation based on the dynamic model presented above the pressure value in the top layer is assumed to be unchanged after the adjustment of soil properties considering the interface pressure continuity while the soil moisture is adjusted in response to the sealing induced changes in soil properties within the time step this treatment relaxes the strong coupling between the governing differential equations and the time varying soil constitutive relation k œà or k Œ∏ function it allows separate computations for the infiltration and the sealing induced changes in soil properties within each time step while maintaining a weakly coupled process of infiltration and sealing development over time as well as the continuity of the pressure within the whole profile in addition the present approach imposes no requirement of dynamic grid adjustment as in common computational fluid dynamics practice for moving boundary problems which greatly reduces the complexity of numerical efforts 2 3 1d kinematic wave flow model the 1d kinematic wave approximation to the st venant equations has long been applied successfully to simulate hillslope overland flow similar equations were adopted by liu and singh 2004 and wu et al 2019 2020 the governing equations are shown in appendix 2 4 data for model calibration and validation the experimental data of assouline and ben hur 2006 were used for calibrating and evaluating the model the texture of the sandy soil used in the experiment was 88 sand 2 silt and 10 clay the organic matter content was 0 9 soil layers of 0 02 m thickness were packed in perforated metal trays of 0 30 m by 0 50 m by 0 10 m at a mean bulk density of 1260 kg m 3 the packed soil trays were placed in boxes over a coarse sand layer 0 08 m thick a rotating disc type rainfall simulator was used to generate rainfall at a prescribed constant value morin et al 1967 the trays were exposed to 70 mm of rainfall at two intensities 24 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 and three slope gradients 5 15 and 25 the coarse sand layer below the soil layers allowed free drainage of water to an outlet pipe set in the base of the box which was used to directly measure infiltration runoff was collected at the outlet of the trays and measured moreover because the length of the trays is short rills did not occur on the slope which would not affect the runoff and infiltration processes three cases with p 24 mm h 1 and s0 5 p 24 mm h 1 and s0 15 and p 60 mm h 1 and s0 5 were used to calibrate the model and the remaining three cases with p 24 mm h 1 and s0 25 p 60 mm h 1 and s0 15 and p 60 mm h 1 and s0 25 were used to validate the model the observed and calibrated parameters of the rainfall soil and slopes of the experiments are presented in table 1 the rainfall characteristics and the slope gradient are set before the exposition to rainfall there are six input parameters for the infiltration model including the initial soil water content Œ∏ i the saturated soil water content Œ∏ s the air entry pressure œà b the particle size distribution parameter Œª the residual soil water content Œ∏ r and the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s the soil characteristics were estimated by the neural network prediction of hydrus 1d model based on the measured soil texture and density in the lab schaap et al 2001 the soil water hydraulic properties are described by general functional forms of smith et al 1993 following assouline and mualem 1997 we assume that the maximal thickness of the disturbed layer d c is reached shortly after the beginning of rainfall for a given soil rainfall system since assouline and mualem 1997 observed a power law decrease in d c with rainfall intensity a power law expression for d c d c 5 83 p k s 0 314 can be determined by the seal thickness values under two different rainfall intensity in assouline and ben hur 2006 mm the initial soil water content manning s roughness and soil sealing parameters including Œ∏ i n d m Œ¥ œÅ 0 œâ Œ∑ and k f were calibrated by fitting the hydrological model predictions to the runoff data during the soil sealing process notably before the seal formation the soil properties are the same for the different soil depths and the soil parameters for the infiltration model remain the same for the two layers the space and time steps for the model were set to 0 05 m and 1 0 s respectively notably the small time step for the numerical solution is because of the rapidly varying soil properties of the seal layer during rainfall event with these parameters the soil hydraulic parameters of the seal layer were obtained by using the corresponding analytical solution of soil seal formation model then the above infiltration and runoff models were solved numerically using the standard runge kutta fourth order rk4 and the tvd maccormack approaches respectively before examining the capability of the proposed model the sensitivity of the modeling results to the computational time and the spatial step was examined by testing different time steps and cell sizes satisfying the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition it is found that the numerical errors caused by using the different time steps and cell sizes were negligible and the present temporal and spatial steps are sufficient for model accuracy 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 2 depicts the simulated and measured runoff rate rr versus time for the two intensities and three slope gradients it is shown that rr simulated by the present model are very close to the observed values the root mean square errors rmses between the simulated and measured rr are about 0 69 mm h 1 p 24 mm h 1 and s0 5 1 64 mm h 1 p 24 mm h 1 and s0 15 3 03 mm h 1 p 24 mm h 1 and s0 25 3 16 mm h 1 p 60 mm h 1 and s0 5 2 21 mm h 1 p 60 mm h 1 and s0 15 and 3 77 mm h 1 p 60 mm h 1 and s0 25 respectively it indicates that the newly developed model has the capability in simulating the soil sealing infiltration and runoff processes and can reflect the impact of processes related to slope gradient on seal formation dynamics fig 3 shows the variations of soil properties of the surface layer during the soil sealing process for two rainfall intensities and three slope gradients it is shown that the seal formation process can substantially change the soil properties of the surface soil among these properties of sealing layer Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 r and œà 1 b tends to increase during the formation while Œ∏ 1 s Œª 1 and k 1 s show a decreasing trend all the soil properties change very rapidly at first and much more slowly at later times taking the case of p 24 mm h 1 and s0 15 as an example the variation of these soil properties in the first 87 5 min rainfall are 9 7 9 7 9 7 7 0 9 7 and 154 5 times larger than that occurred in the last 87 5 min rainfall intensity and its kinetic energy are found to significantly affect soil sealing baumhardt 1990 assouline and mualem 1997 assouline 2004 besides the rainfall intensity the effect of slope gradient is also an important factor in this process with the increase of slope gradient the variations of soil properties of the seal layer become less significant fig 4 shows the cumulative runoff depth rd and infiltration depth id versus time during the surface sealing process the result indicates that the variations of rd and id can be divided into two stages in the first stage since saturation of the seal layer under formation is not reached and there is no ponding rd 0 mm while the infiltration rate equals the rainfall intensity and id shows a linear increasing trend once ponding occurs second stage rd increases exponentially while id shows a logarithmic increasing trend this is related to the gradual decrease of the soil permeability of the upper layer during soil sealing 3 2 effects of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on soil sealing and infiltration runoff data show that the seal formation is almost completed after approximately 60 mm of cumulative rainfall depth independently of the rainfall intensity because Œ¥ œÅ 0 t of the seal layer has reached 95 of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 see figs 2 and 3 consequently the impacts of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on soil sealing and infiltration runoff properties were examined under the same cumulative rainfall depth 60 mm the other model parameters remained the same as those in table 1 the results of Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 s Œ∏ 1 r œà 1 b Œª 1 k 1 s rd id and rr versus s 0 and p are shown in fig 5 for the soil properties of seal layer with the increase of slope gradient Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 r and œà 1 b versus s 0 show a monotonic decrease trend while Œ∏ 1 s Œª 1 and k 1 s tend to increase gradually the rainfall intensity has a slight impact on the trends of the soil properties versus slope gradient taking Œ¥ œÅ 0 and k 1 s as an example for p 24 mm h 1 the difference of Œ¥ œÅ 0 and k 1 s between s0 5 and 30 is 80 85 kg m 3 and 1 90 mm h 1 which vary to 88 71 kg m 3 and 2 35 mm h 1 for p 60 mm h 1 and to 97 93 kg m 3 and 2 92 mm h 1 for p 84 mm h 1 the variation of soil properties with rainfall intensity is similar to the trends of soil properties with slope gradient with the increase of rainfall intensity Œ¥ œÅ 0 Œ∏ 1 r and œà 1 b tend to decrease gradually while Œ∏ 1 s Œª 1 and k 1 s increase gradually it suggests that both the rainfall intensity and slope gradient have a monotonic impact on the variation of soil properties as shown in fig 5 the variations of soil properties of the seal layer affect rd id and rr where rd equals the cumulative rainfall depth minus id m and rr equals the ratio between unit width discharge q and slope length m s with the increase of slope gradient rd and rr tend to decrease due to the higher k 1 s and less received rainfall amount and thus id would increase accordingly in comparison the variations of rd rr and id with rainfall intensity show opposite trends with the increase of rainfall intensity both rd and rr tend to increase monotonically while id tends to decrease gradually with a decelerating rate of change this is because the small rainfall intensity delays the soil sealing process see fig 3 and more water can infiltrate into the soil although a smaller Œ¥ œÅ 0 and a larger k 1 s occur at the end of high intensity rainfall moreover for the extremely large rainfall intensity the formed soil seal may be partially eroded resulting in a smaller decrease in id it demonstrates the dual role of rainfall intensity on sloping surfaces it can facilitate soil sealing because of the normal component dominant role and in the meantime can also exert impact to inhibit the process because of the tangential component secondary role which provide a theoretical explanation for the previous controversial findings armenise et al 2018 3 3 effects of Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 and Œæ on runoff process as the two most important parameters for the seal formation model see eq 1 the variations of maximum increase of soil bulk density Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 and soil destruction constant Œæ can significantly affect the runoff process taking the case with p 60 mm h 1 and s0 15 as an example the impacts of Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 v and Œæ Œæ v on rr are shown in fig 6 where Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 v and Œæ v are equal to the calibrated values of the parameters see table 1 it is shown that with the increase of Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 v ponding occurs earlier and the runoff rate increases quickly at first and then at a much slower pace towards a stable value comparatively the similar trends of runoff rate and ponding time can be also found with the increase of Œæ Œæ v the only difference is that the differences of runoff rate between different Œæ Œæ v tend to decrease greatly with time taking the difference between Œæ Œæ v 0 5 and 1 5 as an example it equals 38 68 mm h 1 at t 30 min which decreases to 20 91 and 12 01 mm h 1 at t 45 and 60 min respectively this indicates that both Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 and Œæ can significantly affect the runoff process and the final runoff rate for short duration rainfalls but for long duration rainfalls the final runoff rates are almost the same for different Œæ 3 4 comparing the present seal formation model with the original model compared to the original seal formation model assouline and mualem 1997 the present seal formation model includes the effect of slope gradient in several aspects to examine this impact consequently on hillslope runoff process the runoff rates simulated with the original seal formation model were compared to the observed values for different rainfall intensity and slope gradient as shown in fig 7 note that the case with p 24 mm h 1 and s0 5 was used to calibrate the original seal formation model and the most calibrated model parameters were the same as table 1 except Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 eq 1 and œâ eq 2 which can be expressed as Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 421 3 kg m 3 and œâ 1 15 10 3 in the original seal formation model respectively the original model predicts the effect of rainfall intensity as depicted by the good agreement between the simulated results for p 60 mm h 1 and s0 5 and the measured data but fails to reproduce the effect of slope comparing the results in fig 7 with the ones from the proposed new model fig 2 show that the modified model including the combined slope gradient effects significantly improve the runoff prediction accuracy 3 5 effects of changing soil properties of the seal layer on infiltration runoff process although the soil sealing process can significantly change the soil properties and eventually affect the soil infiltration process mualem and assouline 1989 le bissonnais et al 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 king and bjorneberg 2012 common soil infiltration models do not consider the seal formation process green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 chu 1978 parlange et al 1982 chow et al 1988 smith et al 1993 1999 corradini et al 1994 1997 2000 chen and young 2006 in general two approaches are commonly adopted the first one neglects the seal and directly uses the one layer soil infiltration model hereafter referred to as one layer model for clarity on the homogeneous non sealed soil the second approach considers a fully formed seal layer with no further change and uses the two layer soil infiltration model hereafter referred to as two layer model for clarity which is equivalent to an instant formation of a sealing layer to simulate infiltration on the sealed soil smith et al 1999 cerdan et al 2002 corradini et al 2000 2011 cui and zhu 2018 to evaluate the effects of changing soil properties of the seal layer on infiltration runoff process we compare the proposed model dynamic evolution of the soil properties of the seal layer with the results from the two approaches described above constant soil properties in the one and the two layer models taking p 60 mm h 1 and s0 15 as an example fig 8 shows the simulated trends of rr rd and id versus t on hillslopes based on the new model and the results from the two approaches respectively for the sealing soil its soil permeability varies gradually from the permeability of non sealed soil to the permeability of completely sealed one the simulated curves of rr rd and id versus t with the proposed model are therefore between the curve corresponding to the one layer model and the one corresponding to the two layer model the results show that the one layer model does not generate runoff for all the time the two layer model generates runoff almost immediately after the rainfall started while the proposed model generated runoff at a much later time t 14 min the runoff rates of the proposed model and the two layer model eventually approach similar values the cumulative infiltration and runoff for the two cases being quite different the result also suggests that the difference between the two layer and the proposed model is mostly determined at early time and does not change substantially after runoff generated in both cases it can be concluded that for general rainfall events except very short or very long duration rainfall using one layer or two layer soil infiltration models for a progressively sealing soil may cause substantial errors on the infiltration and runoff predictions the first one underestimating runoff and the second one overestimating it from the perspective of runoff generation mechanism the runoff production in proposed model is determined by the variations of both hydraulic gradient and the soil hydraulic properties of surface seal layer while in the two layer model is only determined by the variation of hydraulic gradient the great difference between the two layer and the proposed model in fig 8 suggests that during seal formation the variations of surface soil hydraulic properties have a nonnegligible impact on runoff production comparing to the role of gradient reduction the difference between the proposed model and the two layer model was further examined for 5 different slope gradients and 6 different rainfall intensities fig 9 note that results of the one layer model were not included because no runoff can be generated on the soil in our study without sealing for comparison a reference time is also presented which was chosen as the completion time to soil sealing t r defined as 4 t r t Œ¥ œÅ 0 t 0 999 Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 where t r is the time when Œ¥ œÅ 0 t of the seal layer reaches 99 9 of Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 fig 9a b shows simulated ponding time and completion time of soil sealing respectively for 5 different slope gradients and 6 different rainfall intensities the results indicate that surface ponding and soil sealing advances more quickly for flat slope and large rainfall intensity as expected under a specific rainfall depth 60 mm the runoff depths rd simulated by proposed model for 5 different slope gradients and 6 different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 9c it is evident that rd tends to increase greatly with increasing rainfall intensity and decreasing slope gradient the relative difference of rd between the two models under 60 mm rainfall depth is sensitive to both rainfall intensity and slope gradient see fig 9d the relative difference becomes larger than 50 for steep slopes and low intensity rainfall since it takes a long time to complete soil sealing it indicates the importance of soil sealing process on infiltration and runoff predictions during a single rainfall event fig 9e shows how the relative difference of runoff between a progressive and a pre existing seal layer varies with cumulative rainfall depth which is proportional to the total kinetic energy the relative difference although continuously decreasing with rainfall depth is no less than 20 for the studied soil at a 100 mm cumulative rainfall a fairly large rainfall depth note that smaller rainfall intensities and higher slope gradients correspond to larger relative differences moreover according to the result a two layer infiltration model with static soil properties can only replace the progressive sealing model at a very high rainfall depth without causing a large error for infiltration and runoff predictions for practical applications this approximation is likely to reduce the accuracy of the simulation 3 6 sensitivity analysis to the soil hydraulic properties previous studies show that soil sealing formation affects soil infiltration mainly through modifying five major soil hydraulic properties including Œ∏ 1 s Œ∏ 1 r œà 1 b Œª 1 and k 1 s mualem and assouline 1989 le bissonnais et al 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 however how much these soil hydraulic properties affect the soil infiltration process remains unclear taking p 60 mm h 1 and t 60 min as an example a series of numerical tests were carried out to examine the sensitivity of soil infiltration and runoff characteristics to the variations of different soil hydraulic properties all the model parameters are the same as table 1 note that case 1 is a control group and all the soil hydraulic properties of case 1 are dynamic during the soil sealing process in comparison for cases 2 6 we held one soil hydraulic property constant that equal the value of original unsealed soil at initial time and let the other properties vary within the soil sealing process the simulated infiltration and runoff properties are shown in table 2 the results show that among these soil hydraulic properties tested k 1 s the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer is the most sensitive parameter and a constant k 1 s during the seal formation process can decrease rr and rd from 48 23 mm h 1 and 28 44 mm to 0 mm h 1 and 0 mm respectively the variations of œà 1 b and Œª 1 during the seal formation process can also slightly affect the soil infiltration and runoff characteristics the constant œà 1 b and Œª 1 tend to increase rr and rd but decrease id slightly however holding Œ∏ 1 s or Œ∏ 1 r as a constant has almost no impact on the rr rd and id this is possibly because Œ∏ 1 s and Œ∏ 1 r of the seal layer vary slightly during the seal formation process and their impacts on the infiltration and runoff processes decrease greatly for high intensity rainfalls in addition table 2 also suggests that the sharp decrease in k1s plays a dominant role in soil infiltration variation during the seal formation this suggests that an empirical expression for temporarily varying k1s may be used to replace the entire progressive sealing model based on the proposed model we can obtain a priori knowledge for the variation of k1s especially for complex conditions such as unsteady rainfall and complex slope shape such an empirical expression for k1s over time can then be developed by fitting the results of the proposed model however the proposed model has not yet been widely examined due to the lack of experimental data consequently the obtained expression will not be universal and one should still use caution because the parameters of seal formation may strongly be related to soil types and to initial conditions e g armenise et al 2018 zambon et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 for instance the initial water content can have a twofold impact on the runoff rate on the one hand the high initial water content will speed up ponding and surface runoff generation on the other hand the initial water content is closely related to the soil sealing by affecting the soil shear strength see eq 2 the high initial water content would decrease the soil shear strength and accelerate the soil sealing process assouline and mualem 1997 nevertheless more experimental studies are still needed to understand quantitatively the soil sealing process for different types of soils and initial conditions 3 7 model applications the quick development of soil sealing during rainfall events can substantially affect the runoff generation and erosion robinson and phillips 2001 neave and rayburg 2007 this is a direct application of the proposed model soil sealing may be demolished frequently by human or natural physical or bioactivities especially in agricultural regions armenise et al 2018 assouline and thompson 2022 this will happen at least annually rendering soil sealing a repeated process in sealing prone regions in these regions accurately predicting runoff and erosion will need the representation of the dynamic development of soil sealing it may also benefit investigations of the interplay of ecosystem and hydrological system in these regions in a broader picture the approach may help improve hydrological representation of processes involving soil compaction such as root zone hydrology in addition earthquake induced rapid changes in soil properties may be another topic finds potential application of this model shahir et al 2012 el haber et al 2019 4 conclusions combining a modified seal formation model accounting for slope steepness a two layer soil infiltration model and a kinematic wave overland flow model a numerical framework is proposed for simulating hillslope rainfall infiltration runoff process with rapidly changing soil properties during seal formation process the framework modifies the original seal formation model and soil infiltration model to improve the representation of the role of rainfall intensity and slope gradient in the seal formation and soil infiltration processes which can be applied to natural hillslopes with changing soil properties of the surface layer during the course of seal formation or other types of soil compaction the model is validated against laboratory observed rainfall infiltration runoff data at two rainfall intensities and three slope gradients during the seal formation process and good agreements are found between observed and simulated infiltration and runoff processes during the seal formation process the maximum increase of soil bulk density the residual water content and the air entry pressure of seal layer versus time show an increasing trend while the saturated water content the particle size distribution factor and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer versus time show a decreasing trend all soil properties of the seal layer change very rapidly at first and then tend to vary slowly among these soil properties hillslope infiltration and runoff are most sensitive to the variation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer on sloping surface the rainfall can both facilitate soil sealing because of the normal component dominant role and reverse the process because of the tangential component secondary role with the increase of rainfall intensity while remaining the same rainfall depth the maximum increment of soil bulk density the residual water content and the air entry pressure of seal layer show monotonic decrease trends while the saturated water content the particle size distribution factor and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the seal layer show the converse trends the dynamic soil properties can increase the runoff depth and rate but decrease the infiltration and these variations would reduce for higher intensity rainfalls it indicates that the impact of rainfall intensity on soil sealing process shifts from the compaction force dominant to the erosion intensity dominant gradually comparatively the slope gradient can only restrain the soil sealing process with the increase of slope gradient the variations of soil hydraulic properties show similar trends with the variations of soil hydraulic properties versus rainfall intensity which can ultimately increase the infiltration depth and decrease runoff depth due to the higher soil permeability and less received rainfall amount neglecting the impacts of rainfall intensity and slope gradient would cause great errors on soil infiltration and runoff predictions the maximum increment of soil bulk density and the soil disturbance constant for the seal formation model can significantly change the runoff process and the final runoff rate for short duration rainfall however for long duration rainfalls the final runoff rates are almost the same for different soil disturbance constants neglecting the soil sealing process can cause large errors in soil infiltration and runoff prediction on hillslopes using a one layer soil infiltration model for the original non sealed soil properties will lead to an underestimate of runoff and the differences between the one layer model and the proposed model tend to increase with rainfall duration comparatively using the two layer model assuming an instantaneous formation of the seal layer would overestimate the runoff rate and depth however seal formation is relatively rapid this suggests that for very large cumulative rainfall depths a two layer infiltration model with constant soil properties after seal formation may be a good approximation for predicting infiltration and runoff on hillslopes with seal formation process finally it should be stated that our intention for this study is to propose a new infiltration runoff model to account the soil sealing process on sloping surfaces which is a missing physical component in previous studies in addition the model parameters in this study were obtained from model calibration by fitting the laboratory experimental data since soil sealing model parameters introduced in this study all have physical meanings further studies are needed to use physically based

extension of the assouline and mualem 1997 sealing model to sloping surfaces consider a homogeneous bare soil of initial bulk density œÅ i kg m 3 on a sloping surface of area a m2 that is exposed to a continuous rainfall of intensity p m s under impinging of raindrops the bulk density of the soil at sloping surface s d 0 increases with time t denote the increment as Œ¥ œÅ 0 s d 0 t kg m 3 which has a maximum Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 that is dependent on both soil and slope conditions studies on the increase of the bulk density of soils exposed to rainfall show that the more the soil is compacted the less it could be compacted further tackett and pearson 1965 thus following assouline and mualem 1997 the variation of the bulk density of soils can be described by a1 d Œ¥ œÅ 0 s d 0 t dt Œæ Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 Œ¥ œÅ

effect of raindrops on steep slopes where Œ∑ is the power law exponent which is assigned the value 1 30 in the present study note that Œ¥ œÅ 0 0 represents the maximum variation of soil bulk density on a flat surface the raindrop diameter d m can vary between 0 and d max the maximal drop diameter every drop hits the sloping surface with a velocity practically identical to the terminal velocity of the falling drop v d m s the compacting effect of the raindrop is determined by the component of kinetic energy corresponding to the normal component of velocity v denoted as e n d n m which can be expressed as a2 e n d œÄ œÅ w d 3 v d cos Œ≥ 2 12 where œÅ w is the density of water kg m 3 Œ≥ is the slope angle the factor cos Œ≥ is introduced here to specify the component of falling velocity of raindrops normal to the sloping surface in the case of a laminar flow v d is proportional to d according to stokes law when turbulent flow conditions occur v d is related to d 0 5 beard 1976 atlas and ulbrich 1977 found v d related to d 0 67 one could then assume the following general expression for v d a3 v d w d u where w and u are constants representing the medium and the flow regime of the falling drop the values of w and u in eq a 3 are determined by fitting the equation to measured velocities of drops in natural and simulated rainfall according to gunn and kinzer 1949 and laws 1941 we adopted the value of 0 5 for u and 14 500 for w replacing eq a 3 into eq a 2 leads to a4 e n d k d 3 2 u k œÄ œÅ w w 2 cos 2 Œ≥ 12 rainfall splash process is that the raindrop with diameter d cross

œÅ i œà i a10 it should be noted that for the natural rainfall the raindrop diameter should increase with rainfall intensity while for the raindrop generated by rainfall simulator we suggest keeping the drop diameter constant and independent of the intensity as shown in fig 1 the momentum input of the vertically falling raindrops to a slope can be decomposed into a normal part and a tangential downslope part the normal component presses the soil to form the seal and its impact reduces on a slope compared to on a horizontal surface this effect is intuitive and has been accounted for by taking the slope angle into consideration in eq a10 the tangential component has a net effect to mobilize soil particles downslope which may delay the sealing formation and reduce the final sealing layer thickness to account for this effect we modify eq a10 by introducing a coefficient f describing the tangential impact of rainfall on the sloping surface Œæ f 2 œâ k p d m 2 cos Œ≥ Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 œÑ œÅ i œà i a11 where f is related to the rainfall intensity slope gradient and soil properties for a given soil it can be expressed as f e k f p k s s 0 0 5 in the present study it is evident that f tends to decrease with an increase of slope gradient and rainfall intensity eq a 1 with Œæ defined by eq a11 describes the change of soil bulk density at the sloping surface s d 0 the distribution of the changes from the surface downward is determined by the exponential model mualem and assouline 1989 the exponential model assumes that the variation of d Œ¥ œÅ 0 s d t dt varies with soil depth s d

Œæ Œ¥ œÅ 0 s 0 Œ¥ œÅ 0 t a13 with eqs a11 and a13 we can simulate Œ¥ œÅ 0 t of seal layer using the finite difference method while avoiding the temporal and spatial variations of grids and parameters in traditional computational fluid dynamics methods the major properties of seal layer affecting soil infiltration process including the saturated water content the residual water content the air
