environmental sustainability removal of heavy metal ions such as ag ion from industrial wastewaters has become a necessity however while separation is one resolution the material to use for the

sustainability goal d glucose an important reducing carbohydrate exists widely in fruits honey kombucha tea and wine it is easily hydrolysed in the presence of an acid base chemical oxidant or enzymes to various hydrolysates such as carboxylic acids and lower chain hydrocarbons 11 13 the carboxylates are strongly chelating agents of heavy metals 11 14 it is perceived that glucose may be the real intermediate raw materials required for the future biofuel production glucose is biocompatible as it is produced from degradation of foods for energy production carbon materials are essentially valuable tools for many applications including wastewater treatment and energy utilities 15 18 they are considered important assets due to their many advantages such as availability of raw materials biocompatibility of these materials sequestering capability and relatively non toxicity the synthesis of carbon materials from sustainable sources such as glucose and other carbohydrates or biomass has been reported in the past 15 16 19 20 however none of these works to the best of our knowledge has reported the synthesis of fluorescent nanosheets from glucose at low temperature or without the presence of additives or surfactants we report for the first time a low temperature synthesis of ph dependent fluorescent carbon nanosheets derived from glucose f gcns in an alkaline solution without additives or surfactants the behaviour of the as synthesized materials was evaluated towards detecting and removing silver ion from industrial wastewater the photoluminescence properties of the material at different phs 6 12 and temperatures 25 95 c are fully elucidated furthermore the performance of the material was compared to that of the d glucose capped silver indium zinc sulphide quaternary quantum dots glu aizs to evaluate the valuable resourcefulness of the material 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and instrumentations all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich south africa and used without further purification deionized water was used for all aqueous preparations agilent inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes was used to determine the elemental concentrations shimadzu ultra violet uv visible spectrometer was used to obtain the absorbance spectra the fluorescence spectra were obtained using shimadzu photoluminescence pl spectrophotometer the scanning electron microscopic sem and transmission electron microscopic tem morphologies of the samples were recorded with jeol electron microscopes at a scanning voltage of 10 60 kv and an accelerating voltage of 200 kv 2 2 synthesis of carbon nanosheet and quaternary quantum dots in a typical reaction 100 ml of 0 1 mol l of d glucose ph 12 was heated at 55 c under reflux and continuous stirring for 2 h the same medium at different phs of 6 8 and 10 were also prepared to compare their fluorescent properties for the glu aisz quaternary composite the materials were synthesized using may et al s approach 21 with some modifications typically a mixture of agno3 incl3 glucose thioglycolic acid tga na2s zinc acetate dihydrate at 1 4 16 7 6 1 mole ratio was prepared in 100 ml deionized water the ph of the mixture was adjusted to ph 6 followed by reflux at 95 c for 1 h afterwards the as synthesized material was stored until further analysis 2 3 fluorescence determination of silver three milli litre 3 ml of the sensor solution 0 5 ml of ph 10 buffer and different concentrations of agno3 solutions were added to a centrifuge tube and made up to a volume of 5 ml with deionized water this was followed by fluorescence evaluation at an excitation wavelength of 471 nm at room temperature for the industrial laboratory wastewater 2 ml of the solution was first treated with 2 ml of 65 nitric acid and then diluted to 50 ml in a 50 ml centrifuge tube before subjecting to the same afore mentioned conditions the quantum dots were also subjected to the same conditions as mentioned above at an excited wavelength of 375 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of the sensor the results of the evaluation of the absorption and the photoluminescence characteristics of the f gcns sensor at different temperatures and solution phs are given in fig 1a f the corresponding digital images are given in fig s1 supplementary material according to fig 1a f the absorption peaks at 291 nm corresponded to the n Ï€ transition of the co groups for all solutions however no colour or fluorescence transition was visible for the ph 6 10 solutions for all tested temperature while at ph 12 the absorbance could be related to the visible yellow to red brown colours obtained after synthesis fig s1 supplementary material similar to the absorption spectra the pl spectra of the ph 12 solution revealed a gradual increase in the fluorescence intensity as the temperature increased fig 1e f table 1 shows the comparison of the synthesis conditions of the current f gcns with those of previously reported work 15 18 as shown in table 1 the current work showed the advantage of significantly few material requirements lower cost and lower temperature of synthesis energy efficiency 3 2 determination of silver the results of the interaction of the sensor with ag ion in aqueous solutions are given in fig 2a according to fig 2a the presence of silver ions quenched the fluorescence intensity of the sensor at 527 nm resulting in a colour change from yellow to dark gray formed as a result of the precipitation of silver ion from the solution similar behaviour was observed with the quaternary composite except that the quenching was observed at 600 nm rather than at 527 nm fig 2b however better linearity and lod were obtained for the f gcns than those obtained for the quantum dots as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the better sensing characteristics of the nanosheets over that of the quantum dots indicate the versatility of the nanosheets over the quaternary quantum dots fig 3 table 2 as shown in fig s1 supplementary material the pl intensity of the nanosheet solution after precipitation was maintained up to 70 91 suggesting that the sensor has the potential to be used for more than one cycle the results of the icp oes of the supernatant after separation indicated an average removal of 98 42 0 69 for concentration ranging from 100 to 200 ppm table 3 3 3 industrial wastewater application selectivity study the f gcns and glu aizs were used to separate silver ions from an acidified industrial wastewater containing lead and titanium ions as shown in fig 4a d higher quenching effect occurred during the interaction in the wastewater compared to that of the pristine aqueous water this behaviour suggested a possible co precipitation with other elements present in the waste solution to ascertain this hypothesis the heavy metal ions pb2 and ti2 ions in the wastewater other than ag ions were subjected to interact with the glu aizs quantum dots exhibited more quenching effect than the f gcns as shown in fig 4b d pb2 showed similar quenching behaviour as ag at 582 5 nm whereas ti2 exhibited fluorescence enhancement instead of quenching effect thus it was concluded that the significant quenching effect observed after the interaction of the sensor with the wastewater was largely due to the synergetic effect of the presence of ag and pb2 ions in the waste solution thus in terms of selectivity ag ion can be separated from ti2 ion in aqueous medium under the condition shown in this study while it cannot be obtained separately in the presence of pb2 ion further behaviour of the carbon nanosheet with other heavy metal ions will be considered in order to evaluate the changes in the morphologies of the sensors after interaction with ag ions sem and tem were employed fig 5 shows the results of the sem and tem evaluations of the sensors before and after interaction with the silver ions according to fig 5a b the sheet morphology can be seen for the f gcns before interaction with ag while spike like aggregates are apparent after interaction insets fig 5a b in contrast spherical structures are characteristics of the quaternary composites before and after interaction with ag ions fig 5c d apparently the size of the spherical particles after interaction became bigger fig 5c d indicating the presence of additional particles ag all these further confirmed the separation of the ag ions from the aqueous media as shown in fig 5b inset and d spherical morphologies were present for both the f gcns and glu aisz quantum dots this indicates that the spike like structures shown by the sem images in fig 5a insets may be formed by the combination of smaller spherical particles 3 4 detection mechanism the addition of ag ions to f gcns resulted in a colour change from yellow to dark gray and a decrease in the fluorescence intensity quenching at increased ag ion concentrations the colour change was associated with precipitation which informed the quenching behaviour as shown in fig 2 the decrease in the zeta potential of the f gcns solution before and after interaction with ag ion showed a change from 16 mv for f gcns alone at 0 ppm ag to 10 mv for f gcns ag at 100 pm ag this further explained the precipitation behaviour of the mixture in other words some of the added ag ions removed the negatively charged f gcns from solution as precipitate while the excess of the added ag ions detected by the zeta potential device changing the initial negatively charged solution from negative to positive in addition the absorption spectra of the f gcns ag mixture overlapped with the excitation wavelength of the f gcns as shown in fig s2 supplementary material this indicated that the inner filter effect ife contributed to the quenching effect of the f gcns 22 24 similar sensing mechanism was observed for the glu aisz qds in terms of precipitation reduction in the negative zeta potential charge from 29 8 mv glu aisz qd solution to 8 25 mv qd ag mixture at 100 ppm ag and overlapping of the excitation and absorption spectra fig s2 supplementary material 4 conclusion d glucose fluorescent carbon nanosheets were synthesized and utilized for the detection and separation of silver ions from aqueous solutions the material showed an lod of 1 74 ppm for a concentration range of 0 20 ppm and 16 16 ppm for a concentration range of 30 120 ppm silver indium zinc sulphide quaternary quantum dots were also synthesized and their sensing was compared with that of the glucose nanosheets the quantum dots showed poorer lod compared to that of the fluorescent nanosheets towards detecting silver ions in aqueous solutions an average of about 98 42 0 69 removal was realized for

12806,anaerobic granular sludge was successfully cultivated in the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr after 45 days of operation the results showed that the mature granular sludge exhibited better physicochemical characteristics granule percentage of 62 6 8 8 0 8 1 2 mm in diameter with smooth edges and regular shapes and sludge volume index of 20 0 ml g ss 16s rrna targeted fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish and scanning electron microscope sem examination revealed that the granular sludge had a unique clustered microbial community structure which would to be an optimal microbial arrangement for syntrophic colonies the large substrate concentration gradient that derived from the feast famine alternation regime of the substrate in a running cycle of asbr was the major cause of the clustered microbial distribution structure lots of syntrophic consortia formed by acetogens and methanogens randomly distributed throughout the interior of the granules furthermore the cavities existing amongst the syntrophic consortia were convenient for substrate transfer and biogas liberation thus enhancing the digestion performance of asbr and preventing granule disintegration caused by gas scour with sludge granulation the methane yield of asbr increased from the initial 0 23 l g cod to 0 28 l g cod meanwhile the maximum specific methanogenic activities smas of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively increased from 0 51 gcod gvss d to 0 73 gcod gvss d and from 0 35 gcod gvss d to 0 62 gcod gvss d the exploration of granular sludge formation sludge characteristic evolution and treatment performance in asbr reactor has theoretical value for its engineering promotion keywords anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr sludge granulation clustered community structure 16s rrna targeted fish methanogenic activity 1 introduction anaerobic biological treatment is an effective biochemical route for converting organic wastewater into energy and valuable products compared with aerobic treatment anaerobic treatment requires low energy consumption and low macro micro nutrients thus decreasing sludge production and carbon footprint due to biogas generation 1 therefore anaerobic treatment technology has received considerable attention and been widely used in treating organic wastewater the decomposition of complex organic substrate and subsequent production of methane was performed by synergistic interactions consisted of four functional guilds namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis therefore maintaining sufficient biomass and the cooperation and balance between each microbial group are critical to the efficiency and stability of anaerobic reactors 2 4 the development of granules is a crucial factor for the successful operation of anaerobic treatment systems with the development of granular sludge a high concentration of anaerobic biomass can be remained in the reactor thus permitting an application of high hydraulic loading to the anaerobic reactor 5 furthermore the granules can minimise the distance between anaerobic microbial which maximise the interspecies mass transfer between the syntrophic fatty acid degraders and the methanogens 6 7 various high rate reactors which are considered suitable for anaerobic treatment have been developed for the treatment of high strength organic wastewater the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor and internal circulation ic anaerobic reactor are the most widely used reactors because the granular sludge can be formed easily in the reactor 8 10 furthermore much effort has been undertaken in developing such reactors to understand the formation mechanism of anaerobic granular sludge and the spatial distribution rule of microbial community under the conditions of matrix characteristics and hydraulic shear action or under different conditions of inoculation sludge 11 13 macleod et al 14 previously proposed a three layered structure of the sucrose fed uasb granules by using only scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem liu et al 15 detected the multi layer architecture within the brewery degrading granules through fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish technology the hydrolytic clostridial species and hydrogenotrophic methanobacteriales predominate in the surface layer the middle layer consists of the syntrophic colonies of h2 producing acetogens hydrogenotrophic methanobacteriales and acetoclastic methanosaeta and the central layer is mainly microcolonies of methanosaeta cell sanz et al 16 observed the multi layer structure of anaerobic granules in uasb reactor treating brewery wastewater in which bacteria are located outside and archaea in the interior although acetoclastic and h2 utilizing methanogens have not been identified in their study the multi layered granular structure has also been suggested by batstone et al and satoh et al 17 18 anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr is a new generation anaerobic reactor with the operation procedure of feed reaction settling and withdrawal compared with uasb and egsb asbr exhibits the following advantages 1 a simple configuration without solid liquid gas separator and special water distribution system making asbr ideal in industry wastewater treatment particularly for treating small scale of wastewater in which anaerobic digestion processes are expected to be installed 2 asbr is flexible to operate because the periodic process of asbr has considerable degree of freedom in terms of cycle length and feed period and other operating parameters can be varied at the same sludge retention time srt 19 20 consequently asbr has a wide application prospect in wastewater treatment particularly in the treatment of the small flow wastewater or the wastewater with highly ss content many studies have reported the successful application of asbr in treating industrial wastewater such as swine manure leachate dairy and low concentration industrial wastewater 21 23 however sludge granulation in asbr is relatively slow or difficult which restricts its widespread application in engineering also not much attention is given to the properties and microbial community of the anaerobic granules formed in asbr the objectives of this study were to systematically explore the influence of sludge granulation on the asbr performance sludge physiochemical properties evolution and the microbial community structure so as to elucidate the mechanism of interaction between the microbial population structure of granular sludge and the reactor treatment performance therefore the granular sludge was cultured in a laboratory scale asbr and the evolution of the reactor treatment performance and sludge physiochemical properties were monitored meanwhile sem and fish were used to observe and analyse the microstructure and microbial community distribution of the granular sludge aimed to gain further insights into the distribution and percentage of the functional microbial within the asbr granules the research results would help to suggest a theoretical basis for engineering promotion of granule based asbr reactors 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the laboratory scale asbr was made of tempered glass with a headspace of 1 5 l and a working volume of 4 5 l height 30 cm diameter 18 cm fig 1 liquid was mixed through double blade axial agitation at a speed of 90 rpm the temperature ph and orp were monitored

or hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activities of the anaerobic sludge were tested periodically the sma acetate was analysed using the serum bottle test a known amount of sludge vss 2 g l was transferred into a 500 ml serum bottle and an appropriate quantity of acetate substrate solution was added to the serum bottle so as to obtain initial cod levels in the range of 2 2 5 g l the ph of the substrate solution was adjusted to the range of 6 8 7 2 before it was added into the test bottles ch4 production is measured by means of the liquid displacement method the entire test was performed in a constant temperature water bath shaker at 35 1 c at the end of the sma test the biomass was precisely quantified using the gravimetric method the sma was estimated by plotting the methane production in g cod against time in days and divided by g vss added the sma h2 co2 of the sludge was determined using h2 and co2 as the substrate for anaerobic sludge according the method reported by the authors in the previous article 24 2 3 particle size distribution the size distribution of microbial aggregates was analysed by using a laser particle analyzer mastersizer malvern 2000 uk the size distribution in each sample was analysed in triplicate with a particle size range of 0 to 2000 Î¼m 2 4 sludge morphology observation the flocculent sludge and granular sludge were observed and photographed by optical microscope olympus bx51 japan and sem jsm 6510lv japan respectively granules were fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 6 h at 4 c then the fixed granules were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and the subsequent pre treatment was performed in accordance with a previously reported method 25 the prepared samples were sputter coated with gold and analysed through sem at room temperature 2 5 sectioning fish and confocal imaging microbial composition and spatial distribution of granular sludge were determined using fish based on a protocol described previously 26 27 the anaerobic granules were fixed in freshly prepared 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 6 h at 4 c immediately after sampling them from asbr and the fixed granules were rinsed twice with phosphate buffer to elute the residual paraformaldehyde thereafter the fixed granules were embedded in tissue tek oct compound overnight to infiltrate the oct compound into the granule and subsequently frozen at 20 c the frozen granules were then cut into 20 Î¼m slices with a cryostat leica cm 1950 germany the specimen was finally dehydrated by successive 50 80 and 100 ethanol washes each for 3 min then air dried and stored at room temperature each prepared slide was then hybridised for 5 h at 46 c and examined via confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm using a leica tcs sp8 confocal laser scanning microscope in the experimental process 20 formamide concentration was used for all probes hybridisation the probes used in this study and the fluorescein dye marked at the 5 end are shown in table 1 the relative percentage of the diverse population in the granule was determined from the values for the area of the target microbial spot divided by the area of total granule field of view thus the percentages of bacteria aceticlastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens could be obtained 2 6 other component analysis chemical oxygen demand cod and volatile suspended solids vss were determined in accordance with the standard methods 28 biogas production was measured using a wet gas flowmeter and the methane content was determined by gas chromatography as previously described 29 acetate concentration was determined by gas chromatography agilent 6890 n gc using a db wax capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 50 Î¼m with n2 as the carrier gas 20 ml min and a flame ionisation detector the temperatures of injector detector and oven were 230 c 250 c and 100 c respectively burning gases were h2 air at 30 300 ml min flow rate the sample injection volume was 1 0 Î¼l 3 results and discussion 3 1 routine observation in order to track the process of anaerobic sludge granulation in asbr the change of sludge particle size distribution in the reactor was measured and the results are shown in fig 2 as illustrated the sludge in the initial stage of the reactor was dominated by flocs and the flocculent sludge with a particle size of 0 5 mm accounts for 86 3 5 5 of the total sludge with the operation of asbr the sludge flocs continued to aggregate to form larger and dense granules and thereby stay in the reactor while the free flocculent sludge was flushed out of the reactor after 45 days of operation the sludge particle size distribution changed significantly that the volume fraction of dispersed flocs d 500 Î¼m reduced to 37 4 5 8 and the granules d 500 Î¼m increased to 62 6 8 8 when continued to run to day 60 and day 90 the proportion of granular sludge d 500 Î¼m did not increase significantly but only the proportion of large sized particles d 1000 Î¼m increased therefore it could be preliminarily inferred that the sludge has been basically granulated after 45 days of operation the time for sludge granulation in this work was 15 days shorter than that reported by shao et al who observed granulation of biomass after two months in an asbr treating brewery wastewater 19 the rapid sludge granulation may be attributed to the wastewater composition and flow regime associated with reactor configuration the substrate used in this work was mainly glucose which is suggested to be benefit for granular sludge formation in uasb and anaerobic baffled reactor abr 30 moreover the mixing flow regime associated with the reactor configuration is also an important factor affecting granulation as the author concluded in the previous research article a strong shear force would enhance the production of extracellular proteins but the over produced proteins might slow down the nucleation of sludge and made the aggregates become loose and weak compared with magnetic stirring axial flow mixing could produce a milder shear force and a good convective mass transfer thus contributing to the rapid formation of granular sludge 31 in the granulation process the sludge concentration and the sludge settling performance were also tracked and monitored and the results are shown in fig 3 in the first 35 days of operation as the sludge flocs transformed into granules the mlss increased from 8125 mg l to 10 351 mg l subsequently the mlss was adjusted to approximately 8500 mg l by sludge discharge and maintained in a relatively stable range so that the srt of the reactor was maintained at 20 d by the 45th day of operation the sludge sv decreased from an initial value 62 to 17 and svi decreased from an initial value of 76 3 ml g to approximately 20 0 ml g and remained basically stable after that the svi of mature granule and flocculent were commonly 20 ml g and 20 40 ml g respectively 32 visible from above that sludge settling ability in the asbr reactors were related to the increases of granule percentages and average diameter sizes of the granule indicating good density and packed structure of anaerobic granules besides with the sludge granulation and the significantly improvement in its settling characteristics it could result in a good liquid separation and high biomass retention and be beneficial for preventing microbial washout from reactors 3 2 reactor performance and the sludge methanogenic activities from the start of the asbr reactor to the sludge granulation it continued to run stably for 100 days the organic loading rate olr was maintained at 3 0 kg m3 d and hrt was controlled in 24 h fig 4 a shows the development of asbr performance with respect to cod removal methane yield and the effluent acetate concentration as the sludge changed from previous flocculent to granules the effluent cod concentration decreased from 82 mg l to 48 mg l the effluent acetate concentration reduced significantly from 49 5 mg l to 19 2 mg l and the methane yield increased gradually from 0 24 l gcod to 0 27 l gcod analysis showed that high microbial activity of a granule is promoted by an efficient inter microbial substrate transfer due to short distances between microbial groups inside the granule thereby promoting the reactor treatment performance 33 fig 4 b presents the methanogenic activity of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased gradually with granule formation the sma acetate and sma h2 co2 respectively increased from 0 51 gcod gvss d to 0 73 gcod gvss d and from 0 35 gcod gvss d to 0 62 gcod gvss d on the 60th day the increase in the smas could also be attributed to the high concentration of microbial in the granules that can minimise the distance between the microbial and maximise interspecies transfer of acetate hydrogen and formate between the syntrophic acetogenic and methanogenic consortia 33 34 asbr exhibits a typical feast famine regime of the substrate in its running cycle fig 5 depicts the ph hydrogen partial pressure p h2 and acetate profiles observed during a typical cycle of asbr the profiles of p h2 and acetate showed a peak of 16 3 pa and 189 3 mg l respectively at the end of the feeding period at the same time ph of the mixture in the reactor decreased to as low as 6 64 due to the relative high concentration of acid produced during the 30 min feed after the feeding stage acetate and p h2 were consumed for the microbial growth and utilization thereby the concentration of them reduced gradually meanwhile the ph value of asbr recovered to 6 8 7 2 with acetate consumption which was favourable for maintain the metabolic activity of methanogens at the end of an operation cycle the acetate concentration and p h2 decreased to 19 2 mg l and 4 5 pa respectively 3 3 sludge morphology and microbial structure distribution to further reveal the changes in the sludge morphology during the culture process olympus bx51 japan and sem jsm 6510lv japan were used to observe and photograph the initial inoculated sludge and the sludge on the 1th 30th 45th 60th days respectively fig 6 it could be seen from the fig 6 that with the operation of asbr the sludge morphology changed dramatically that gradually forming a granular structure from the initial floc structure granular sludge was basically formed on the 45th day and then gradually developed into mature granular sludge with smooth edges regular shapes and diameters of 0 8 1 2 mm the microbial structure and spatial distribution of mature granular sludge were further scanned and photographed by sem fig 7 it showed that the mature granular sludge in asbr possessed a relatively regular shape and clear outline high magnification images showed that the granules consisted of a densely packed population of various sizes with cocci bacilli and filamentous species filamentous bacteria intertwined and wrapped around the cocci and bacilli inside the granular sludge so that the cocci and bacilli could be attached to the granules and thus the granular sludge could effectively resist the shock of hydraulic shear force fig 7a b the colonies of the coccal and bacilliform microbials were observed inside the granule and a number of cavities were also observed and presumed as a gas hole that benefitted substrate transfer and biogas escape moreover large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps were observed within the granules and most bacterial cells were surrounded and covered by eps fig 7c d the same results were observed by bhatti et al and baloch et al 35 36 the abundant eps inside the granules may act as a crucial binding medium for organisms that maintain a compact structure of granules 37 38 3 4 in situ analysis of the community structure of anaerobic granular sludge in situ diversity of the mature granular sludge sections in asbr were analysed using fish and different combinations of 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes fig 8 cross sectional fish images showed that the glucose fed asbr granule had a cluster like structure fig 8a the granular sludge consisted of abundant of biomass and interstitial cavities and its structure type was in completely different from the previously reported multi layer structure in literature 15 18 the syntrophic consortia of acetogen aceticlastic methanogens and acetogen hydrogenotrophic methanogens randomly distributed throughout the interior of the granules and this cluster like structure was repeatedly observed in all of the granular thin section analysed the magnified single channel image showed the acidogenic bacteria that hybridised with the cy5 labelled eubmix probe distributed throughout the whole granular cross section fig 8b acidogenic cocci predominantly formed in the outer rim of the granule and rod shaped acidogens were distributed in the interior of the granule this structure probably resulted from the deep mass transfer caused by the relatively high substrate concentration gradient in asbr as mentioned that asbr experienced a feast famine regime of the substrate in its running cycle and the sludge were exposed to approximately 435 mg cod l of substrate concentration after feeding and thus the cocci shaped bacteria had a competitive advantage in the granule surface methanosarcina that hybridised with the msmx860 probe was predominant in the granule and interestingly methanosarcina species were present in the monomer in this study fig 8c moreover a considerable amount of rod shaped hydrogenotrophic methanogens hybridising with the mg1200 mb1174 and mc1109 probes were also detected inside the granule and distributed along with the h2 producing acetogens fig 8d the abundant hydrogenotrophic methanogens were conducive to the consumption of hydrogen so as to maintain a low p h2 in the microenvironment of granular sludge and thus the degradation process of vfas such as propionic acid can proceed quickly and smoothly although granules with a typical multi layered structure have been reported in many studies based on uasb reactors fish images indicated a cluster community structure of the granules in the present work the major cause for the different microbial distribution structure of granular sludge between uasb and asbr might be the change of substrate concentration gradient that resulted from the differences in substrate feeding patterns substrate concentration gradient in uasb was not obvious and so the fermented intermediates could diffused only to a specific concentric layer of the granules thereby forming a multi layered organisation of various species of microorganisms bacteria including hydrolytic and fermentative microbes on the outer layer of the granules firstly hydrolysed complex substrate in wastewater to fundamental structural blocks e g glucose and amino acids and fermentative bacteria subsequently converted these products to fatty acids and alcohols meanwhile small amounts of hydrogen would also be generated in this step syntrophic acetogens clustered in the middle layer oxidised the previous products to h2 and acetate which were then converted to methane by the methanogenic archaea in the inner layer in contrast to uasb asbr had a periodic feeding pattern that resulting in a relatively high substrate concentration gradient in the reactor which is beneficial for substrate diffusion deeply into the centre of the granules the large number of cavities presented amongst the microbial cluster was also convenient for substrate transfer inside the granules which supported the distributional phenomenon of the acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria throughout the whole granules in this study in addition the existing cavities in the granules were convenient for biogas discharge from granules thereby preventing granule disintegration caused by gas scour it has been proved that from the formation of granular sludge to 100 days of operation the reactor always maintained a highly efficient and stable cod removal rate and methane production rate and the sludge granules still existed in the reactor without disintegration on the otherhand since the anaerobic degradation of intermediate products vfas were thermodynamically unfavourable g0 76 kj mol the reaction could easy to proceed only with the syntrophic association of h2 producing acetogenic bacteria and methanogens all of which facilitated the development of the cluster granular structure 39 compared with the multi layered structure of granules the cluster structure could address the mass transfer limitation problem and reduce the dead zone that induced from lack of substrate both of which were beneficial for reducing the zones with inactive or dead biomass inside the granules this result was verified by the fish image fig 8a of the whole cross section of the asbr granules which was occupied by abundant microorganisms throughout the whole granules and inactive zones were not observed furthermore it could be inferred that the clustered organisation should be the optimal microbial arrangement for the substrate influx and gas products efflux and the graphs of methane yield and sludge smas shown in fig 4 opportunely proved the above mechanism with the clustered granules formed the methanogenic activity of the sludge increased significantly that the sma acetate and sma h2 co2 increased to 0 73 and 0 62 gcod gvss d respectively previous studies have reported that the sma acetate of sludge from brewery treatment uasb reactors were in the range of 0 3 0 6 gcod gvss d which were lower than the activity of the granules described in the present study 8 13 the relatively high activity of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens was beneficial in reducing the hydrogen concentration in granules to a low level thus ensuring that vfa degradation proceeds smoothly and improving the anaerobic digestion efficiency quantitative fish was used to analyse the relative percentage of the total microbial biomass in the granular sludge to further assess the role of a microbial community in anaerobic treatment in the cross section of granular sludge approximately 49 of the total biomass area was stained with probe eub338mix in the additional hybridisation of the methanogenic archaea 26 of the methanogens were detectable using probe mg1200 mb1174 and mc1109 which suggested that the population of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens played an important role in the anaerobic granules for reducing hydrogen level thus providing a favourable thermodynamic condition for propionate and butyrate degradation 4 conclusions this study revealed that the granular sludge formed in asbr has a unique cluster structure which is completely different from the typical layered structure reported in literature the feast famine alternation regime of the substrate in a running cycle of asbr resulted in a high substrate concentration gradient in the reactor which should be the major cause of the clustered microbial distribution structure the clustered community structure has the optimal microbial arrangement for syntrophic colonies which can improve the intermediate mass transfer between acetogens and methanogens thereby enhancing the digestion performance of asbr furthermore the existing cavities in the granules are convenient for substrate transfer and biogas liberation thereby preventing granule disintegration caused by gas scour this study provided a more comprehensive insight for understanding the interrelation of granular

in situ hybridisation fish and scanning electron microscope sem examination revealed that the granular sludge had a unique clustered microbial community structure which would to be an optimal microbial arrangement for syntrophic colonies the large substrate concentration gradient that derived from the feast famine alternation regime of the substrate in a running cycle of asbr was the major cause of the clustered microbial distribution structure lots of syntrophic consortia formed by acetogens and methanogens randomly distributed throughout the interior of the granules furthermore the cavities existing amongst the syntrophic consortia were convenient for substrate transfer and biogas liberation thus enhancing the digestion performance of asbr and preventing granule disintegration caused by gas scour with sludge granulation the methane yield of asbr increased from the initial 0 23 l g cod to 0 28 l g cod meanwhile the maximum specific methanogenic activities smas of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively increased from 0 51 gcod gvss d to 0 73 gcod gvss d and from 0 35 gcod gvss d to 0 62 gcod gvss d the exploration of granular sludge formation sludge characteristic evolution and treatment performance in asbr reactor has theoretical value for its engineering promotion keywords anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr sludge granulation clustered community structure 16s rrna targeted fish methanogenic activity 1 introduction anaerobic biological treatment is an effective biochemical route for converting organic wastewater into energy and valuable products compared with aerobic treatment anaerobic treatment requires low energy consumption and low macro micro nutrients thus decreasing sludge production and carbon footprint due to biogas generation 1 therefore anaerobic treatment technology has received considerable attention and been widely used in treating organic wastewater the decomposition of complex organic substrate and subsequent production of methane was performed by synergistic interactions consisted of four functional guilds namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis therefore maintaining sufficient biomass and the cooperation and balance between each microbial group are critical to the efficiency and stability of anaerobic reactors 2 4 the development of granules is a crucial factor for the successful operation of anaerobic treatment systems with the development of granular sludge a high concentration of anaerobic biomass can be remained in the reactor thus permitting an application of high hydraulic loading to the anaerobic reactor 5 furthermore the granules can minimise the distance between anaerobic microbial which maximise the interspecies mass transfer between the syntrophic fatty acid degraders and the methanogens 6 7 various high rate reactors which are considered suitable for anaerobic treatment have been developed for the treatment of high strength organic wastewater the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor and internal circulation ic anaerobic reactor are the most widely used reactors because the granular sludge can be formed easily in the reactor 8 10 furthermore much effort has been undertaken in developing such reactors to understand the formation mechanism of anaerobic granular sludge and the spatial distribution rule of microbial community under the conditions of matrix characteristics and hydraulic shear action or under different conditions of inoculation sludge 11 13 macleod et al 14 previously proposed a three layered structure of the sucrose fed uasb granules by using only scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem liu et al 15 detected the multi layer architecture within the brewery degrading granules through fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish technology the hydrolytic clostridial species and hydrogenotrophic methanobacteriales predominate in the surface layer the middle layer consists of the syntrophic colonies of h2 producing acetogens hydrogenotrophic methanobacteriales and acetoclastic methanosaeta and the central layer is mainly microcolonies of methanosaeta cell sanz et al 16 observed the multi layer structure of anaerobic granules in uasb reactor treating brewery wastewater in which bacteria are located outside and archaea in the interior although acetoclastic and h2 utilizing methanogens have not been identified in their study the multi layered granular structure has also been suggested by batstone et al and satoh et al 17 18 anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr is a new generation anaerobic reactor with the operation procedure of feed reaction settling and withdrawal compared with uasb and egsb asbr exhibits the following advantages 1 a simple configuration without solid liquid gas separator and special water distribution system making asbr ideal in industry wastewater treatment particularly for treating small scale of wastewater in which anaerobic digestion processes are expected to be installed 2 asbr is flexible to operate because the periodic process of asbr has considerable degree of freedom in terms of cycle length and feed period and other operating parameters can be varied at the same sludge retention time srt 19 20 consequently asbr has a wide application prospect in wastewater treatment particularly in the treatment of the small flow wastewater or the wastewater with highly ss content many studies have reported the successful application of asbr in treating industrial wastewater such as swine manure leachate dairy and low concentration industrial wastewater 21 23 however sludge granulation in asbr is relatively slow or difficult which restricts its widespread application in engineering also not much attention is given to the properties and microbial community of the anaerobic granules formed in asbr the objectives of this study were to systematically explore the influence of sludge granulation on the asbr performance sludge physiochemical properties evolution and the microbial community structure so as to elucidate the mechanism of interaction between the microbial population structure of granular sludge and the reactor treatment performance therefore the granular sludge was cultured in a laboratory scale asbr and the evolution of the reactor treatment performance and sludge physiochemical properties were monitored meanwhile sem and fish were used to observe and analyse the microstructure and microbial community distribution of the granular sludge aimed to gain further insights into the distribution and percentage of the functional microbial within the asbr granules the research results would help to suggest a theoretical basis for engineering promotion of granule based asbr reactors 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the laboratory scale asbr was made of tempered glass with a

or hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activities of the anaerobic sludge were tested periodically the sma acetate was analysed using the serum bottle test a known amount of sludge vss 2 g l was transferred into a 500 ml serum bottle and an appropriate quantity of acetate substrate solution was added to the serum bottle so as to obtain initial cod levels in the range of 2 2 5 g l the ph of the substrate

constant temperature water bath shaker at 35 1 c at the end of the sma test the biomass was precisely quantified using the gravimetric method the sma was estimated by plotting the methane production in g cod against time in days and divided by g vss added the sma h2 co2 of the sludge was determined using h2 and co2 as the substrate for anaerobic sludge according the method reported by the authors in the previous article 24 2 3 particle size distribution the size distribution of microbial aggregates was analysed by using a laser particle analyzer mastersizer malvern 2000 uk the size

photographed by optical microscope olympus bx51 japan and sem jsm 6510lv japan respectively granules were fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 6 h at 4 c then the fixed granules were dehydrated through a

after 45 days of operation the sludge particle size distribution changed significantly that the volume fraction of dispersed flocs d 500 Î¼m reduced to 37 4 5 8 and the granules d 500 Î¼m increased to 62 6 8 8 when continued to run to day 60 and day 90 the proportion of granular sludge d 500 Î¼m did not increase significantly but only the proportion of large sized particles d 1000 Î¼m increased therefore it could be preliminarily inferred that the sludge has been basically granulated after 45 days of operation the time for sludge granulation in this work was 15 days shorter than that reported by shao et al who observed granulation of biomass after two months in an asbr treating brewery wastewater 19 the rapid sludge granulation may be attributed to the wastewater composition and

transformed into granules the mlss increased from 8125 mg l to 10 351 mg l subsequently the mlss was adjusted to approximately 8500 mg l by sludge discharge and maintained in a relatively stable range so that the srt of the reactor was maintained at 20 d by the 45th day of operation the sludge sv decreased from an initial value 62 to 17 and svi decreased from an initial value of 76 3 ml g to approximately 20 0 ml g and remained basically stable after that the svi of mature granule and flocculent were commonly 20 ml g and 20 40 ml g respectively 32 visible from above that sludge settling

significantly from 49 5 mg l to 19 2 mg l and the methane yield increased gradually from 0 24 l gcod to 0 27 l gcod analysis showed that high microbial activity of a granule is promoted by an efficient inter microbial substrate transfer due to short distances between microbial groups inside the granule thereby promoting the reactor treatment performance 33 fig 4 b presents the methanogenic activity of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased gradually with granule formation the sma acetate and sma h2 co2 respectively increased from 0 51 gcod gvss d to 0 73 gcod gvss d and from 0 35 gcod gvss d to 0 62 gcod gvss d on the 60th day the increase in the smas could also be attributed to the high concentration of microbial in the granules that can minimise the distance between the microbial and maximise interspecies transfer of acetate hydrogen and formate between the syntrophic acetogenic and methanogenic consortia 33 34 asbr exhibits a typical feast famine regime of the substrate in its running cycle fig 5 depicts the ph hydrogen partial pressure p h2 and acetate profiles observed during a typical cycle of asbr the profiles of p h2 and acetate showed a peak of 16 3 pa and 189 3 mg l respectively at the end of the feeding period at the same time ph of the mixture in the reactor decreased to as low as 6 64 due to the relative high concentration of acid produced during the 30 min feed after the feeding stage acetate and p h2 were consumed for the microbial growth and utilization thereby the concentration of them reduced gradually meanwhile the ph value of asbr recovered to 6 8 7 2 with acetate consumption which was favourable for maintain the metabolic activity of methanogens at the end of an operation cycle the acetate concentration and p h2 decreased to 19 2 mg l and 4 5 pa respectively 3 3 sludge morphology and microbial structure distribution to further reveal the changes in the sludge morphology during the culture process olympus bx51

and then gradually developed into mature granular sludge with smooth edges regular shapes and diameters of 0 8 1 2 mm the microbial structure and spatial distribution of mature granular sludge were further scanned and photographed by sem fig 7 it showed that the mature granular sludge in asbr possessed a relatively regular shape and clear outline high magnification images showed that the granules consisted of a densely packed population of various sizes with cocci bacilli and filamentous species filamentous bacteria intertwined and wrapped around the cocci and bacilli inside the granular sludge so that the cocci and bacilli could be attached to the granules and thus the granular sludge could effectively resist the shock of hydraulic shear force fig 7a b the colonies of the coccal and bacilliform microbials were observed inside the granule and a number of cavities were also observed and presumed as a gas hole that benefitted substrate transfer and biogas escape moreover large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps were observed within the granules and most bacterial cells were surrounded and covered by eps fig 7c d the same results were observed by bhatti et al and baloch et al 35 36 the abundant eps inside the granules may act as a crucial binding medium for organisms that maintain a compact structure of granules 37 38 3 4 in situ analysis of the community structure of anaerobic granular sludge in situ diversity of the mature granular sludge sections in asbr were analysed using fish and different combinations of 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes fig 8 cross sectional fish images showed that the glucose fed asbr granule had a cluster like structure fig 8a the granular sludge consisted of abundant of biomass and interstitial cavities and its structure type was in completely different from the previously reported multi layer structure in literature 15 18 the syntrophic consortia of acetogen aceticlastic methanogens and acetogen hydrogenotrophic methanogens randomly distributed throughout the interior of the granules and this cluster like structure was repeatedly observed in all of the granular thin section analysed the magnified single channel image showed the acidogenic bacteria that hybridised with the cy5 labelled eubmix probe distributed throughout the whole granular cross section fig 8b acidogenic cocci predominantly formed in the outer rim of the granule and rod shaped acidogens were distributed in the interior of the granule this structure probably resulted from the deep mass transfer caused by the relatively high substrate concentration gradient in asbr as mentioned that asbr experienced a feast famine regime of the substrate in its running cycle and the sludge were exposed to approximately 435 mg cod l of substrate concentration after feeding and thus the cocci shaped bacteria had a competitive advantage in the granule surface methanosarcina that hybridised with the msmx860 probe was predominant in the granule and interestingly methanosarcina species were present in the monomer in this study fig 8c moreover a considerable amount of rod shaped hydrogenotrophic methanogens hybridising with the mg1200 mb1174 and mc1109 probes were also detected inside the granule and distributed along with the h2 producing acetogens fig 8d the abundant hydrogenotrophic methanogens were conducive to the consumption of hydrogen so as to maintain a low p h2 in the microenvironment of granular sludge and thus the degradation process of vfas such as propionic acid can proceed quickly and smoothly although granules with a typical multi layered structure have been reported in many studies based on uasb reactors fish images indicated a cluster community structure of the granules in the present work the major cause for the different microbial distribution structure of granular sludge between uasb and asbr might be the change of substrate concentration gradient that resulted from the differences in substrate feeding patterns substrate concentration gradient in uasb was not obvious and so the fermented intermediates could diffused only to a specific concentric layer of the granules thereby forming a multi layered organisation of various species of microorganisms bacteria including hydrolytic and fermentative microbes on the outer layer of the granules firstly hydrolysed complex substrate in wastewater to fundamental structural blocks e g glucose and amino acids and fermentative bacteria subsequently converted these products to fatty acids and alcohols meanwhile small amounts of hydrogen would also be generated in this step syntrophic acetogens clustered in the middle layer oxidised the previous products to h2 and acetate which were then converted to methane by the methanogenic archaea in the inner layer in contrast to uasb asbr had a periodic feeding pattern that resulting in a relatively high substrate concentration gradient in the reactor which is beneficial for substrate diffusion deeply into the centre of the granules the large number of cavities presented amongst the microbial cluster was also convenient for substrate transfer inside the granules which supported the distributional phenomenon of the acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria throughout the whole granules in this study in addition the existing cavities in the granules were convenient for biogas discharge from granules thereby preventing granule disintegration caused by gas scour it has been proved that from the formation of granular sludge to 100 days of operation the reactor always maintained a highly efficient and stable cod removal rate and methane production rate and the sludge granules still existed in the reactor without disintegration on the otherhand since the anaerobic degradation of intermediate products vfas were thermodynamically unfavourable g0 76 kj mol the reaction could easy to proceed only with the syntrophic association of h2 producing acetogenic bacteria and methanogens all of which facilitated the development of the cluster granular structure 39 compared with the multi layered structure of granules the cluster structure could address the mass transfer limitation problem and reduce the dead zone that induced from lack of substrate both of which were beneficial for reducing the zones with inactive or dead biomass inside the granules this result was verified by the fish image fig 8a of the whole cross section of the asbr granules which was occupied by abundant microorganisms throughout the whole granules and inactive zones were not observed furthermore it could be inferred that the clustered organisation should be the optimal microbial arrangement for the substrate influx and gas products efflux and the graphs of methane yield and sludge smas shown in fig 4 opportunely proved the above mechanism with the clustered granules formed the methanogenic activity of the sludge increased significantly that the sma acetate and sma h2 co2 increased to 0 73 and 0 62 gcod gvss d respectively previous studies have reported that the sma acetate of sludge from brewery treatment uasb reactors were in the range of 0 3 0 6 gcod gvss d which were lower than the activity of the granules described in the present study 8 13 the relatively high activity of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens was beneficial in reducing the hydrogen concentration in granules to a low level thus ensuring that vfa degradation proceeds smoothly and improving the anaerobic digestion efficiency quantitative fish was used to analyse the relative percentage of the total microbial biomass in the granular sludge to further assess the role of a microbial community in anaerobic treatment in the cross section of granular sludge approximately 49 of the total biomass area was stained with probe eub338mix in the additional hybridisation of the methanogenic archaea 26 of the methanogens were detectable using probe mg1200 mb1174 and mc1109 which suggested that the population of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens played an important role in the anaerobic granules for reducing hydrogen level thus providing a favourable thermodynamic condition for propionate and butyrate degradation 4 conclusions this study revealed that the granular sludge formed in asbr has a unique cluster structure which is completely different from the typical layered structure reported in literature the feast famine alternation regime of the substrate in a running cycle of asbr resulted in a high substrate concentration gradient in the reactor which should be the major cause of the clustered microbial distribution structure the clustered community structure has the optimal microbial arrangement for syntrophic colonies which can improve the intermediate mass transfer between acetogens and methanogens thereby enhancing the digestion performance of asbr furthermore the existing cavities in the granules are convenient for substrate transfer and biogas liberation thereby preventing granule disintegration caused by gas scour this study provided a more comprehensive insight for understanding the interrelation of granular

12807,recently a lot of research work has been performed on microalgal assisted microbial fuel cells mfcs for electricity generation wastewater treatment and biomass production however a comprehensive investigation on the insight of microalgal assisted mfcs along with a deep discussion on the application of molecular biology approaches has not been reviewed yet in this review the state of the art on efficient use of microalgae alive non alive biomass in mfcs based on the strategy of mono culturing co culturing and substrate microalgae and bacteria symbiosis has been discussed the major concerns in microalgal assisted mfcs such as microbial strains selection cultivation mode stress tolerance inoculum ratio and expensive separators with the potential solutions including replacement of expensive separators and optimization of process parameters have been emphasized the genetic modification strategies gene knock in and gene knock out combined with transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics under the stress conditions to enhance the potential of microalgal assisted mfcs for electricity generation and microalgal biomass production have been highlighted the recent studies where the scale up was applied for the commercialization of microalgal assisted mfcs technology and techno economic feasibility comparison of laboratory and scale up unit price have been elucidated this review addresses an outlook of the microalgal assisted mfcs biotechnology along with the symbiosis of microalgae bacteria in mfcs and could be useful to the key processes and practical applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microalgae microbial fuel cells microalgae bacteria symbiosis synthetic biology 1 introduction the foremost disquiet of modern society is energy crises and the maintenance of water quality 1 the discharge of wastewater in large quantities causes a threat to environmental and human health 2 wastewater contains a massive amount of toxic substances such as aromatic hydrocarbons phenolics insecticides pesticides heavy metals and antibiotics so the proper treatment of wastewater is necessary to allow its safe use 3 the biological treatments that occurred in wastewater treatment plants contribute to a satisfactory approach to wastewater treatment 4 a bioelectrochemical system bes is a potential technology for electricity generation and wastewater treatment the bes contains several broad classes such as sediment fuel cells wetland fuel cells microbial electrolysis cells microbial fuel cells mfc and photosynthetic fuel cells the mfcs have been frequently reported for pollutant removal coupled with wastewater treatment and electricity generation 5 the performance of the mfcs is limited by aeration cost in the cathode compartment which consumes almost 50 of the total cost to overcome some drawbacks microalgae are considered the appropriate oxygen o2 supplier improving the power generation and removal of the pollutants simultaneously microalgal assisted mfcs have captured consideration from researchers due to enhanced electricity generation wastewater treatment and biofuel generation from microalgal biomass table 1 the cultivation of microalgae in mfcs under various strategies would be a favorable approach for biofuel generation steered by bacteria microalgae synergistic metabolism fig 1 microalgal assisted mfcs are a promising technology to resolve the energy crises and the maintenance of water quality 6 microalgal assisted mfcs are considered an appropriate technology for electricity generation pollutants removal and simultaneous wastewater treatment table 1 microalgae have several advantages over other photosynthetic plants such as high growth rate no competition for food and cultivation on non arable land the energy conversion efficiency of other photosynthetic plants c3 c4 is 4 6 to 6 while microalgae showed a maximum output of up to 9 7 microalgae also have the capacity for superior co2 fixation remove nutrients from wastewater and have the potential to be bioengineered 2 all these properties of microalgae make them a prominent candidate for use in mfcs and can consider as potential biomass feedstock the integration of microalgae with mfcs has become interesting technology since microalgae will act as o2 generators and serve as electron e acceptors in the cathode chamber 8 recently many research works have been performed on microalgal assisted mfcs for wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity generation the collected data obtained from the literature last 5 years have been used to provide a comprehensive direction for the current scenario associated with microalgal assisted mfcs most of the previous reviews have been focused on the configuration such as single and double chambered microbial electrolysis cells which lacks advancements in wastewater treatment and mfc biotechnology thus the motivation of the present review is to 1 collect the published results on the application of microalgae in mfcs from the analysis of the collected data from 2017 to 2022 we found that the microalgae can be used in the cathode and anode in mfcs under various modes such as mono culturing co culturing and substrate the alive microalgal cells in anode are utilized as the e donors while in cathode alive microalgal cells provided as e acceptor 2 deliberate the main concerns of microalgal assisted mfcs such as selection of the strains cultivation mode stress tolerance and inoculum ratio for mono culturing and co culturing 3 discuss the effect of operational such as temperature ph light intensity and dissolved oxygen and other parameters on the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs 4 report the current scenario of the use of synthetic biologies global regulator engineering mutations and engineering of promoter integrated with multi omics approaches metagenomics transcriptomics metabolomics and proteomics to enhance the understanding of genome structure stress tolerance of strains and electrochemical biochemical activity of microbial species in mfcs and 5 cover the recent progress towards scale up for commercialization and techno economic feasibility of mfcs comparison of laboratory and scale up unit price 2 culturing of microalgae in mfc microalgal assisted mfcs is an advanced technology in the era of bes which uses microalgae as an oxygenator and reduces the operational cost since there is no need for external aeration culturing of microalgae in mfcs mainly consists of two ways including the addition of live microalgae and dead biomass as substrate the presence of live microalgae in the cathode can provide o2 as an e acceptor whereas in an anode dead microalgae or biomass as a substrate can ultimately promote the growth of electroactive bacteria under anaerobic conditions the e transport chain etc of microalgae initiates from chloroplast through water splitting in photosystem ps ii and by h and results in the formation of o2 and excited e 9 the principles of microalgal assisted mfc include microalgal biomass utilization as substrate photosynthesis process in anodic and cathodic chamber depending on the substrate used and utilization of o2 as e acceptor 10 the below subsection discusses the studies of the use of microalgae in mfcs 2 1 in the cathode compartment the microalgae in the cathode chamber mono culturing co culture but there are few drawbacks with co culture such as access production of o2 which can cause the inhibition of process follow the photosynthetic pathway and allow to use of co2 as a carbon source resulting in the production of o2 11 the o2 produced by microalgae will act as an e acceptor in the cathode compartment fig 2 microalgae based cathode supports the wastewater treatment through cathodic reduction sequestration of co2 to enhance biomass production which can further be used for biofuel generation other cathodic materials including potassium ferricyanide are widely used and not as costly but toxic to the environment and need to be replenished platinum pt is commonly used in mfcs as a catalyst but due to high expense not suitable for commercial scale production thus the use of pt in mfcs does not meet the expectation of economic feasibility 12 microalgal biocathode is less expensive and helps in the removal of contaminants with co2 sequestration to produce biomass the harvested microalgal biomass from the cathodic chamber can be further used for biofuel generation chlorella sp is the most widely used microalgae in biocathode due to its ease of availability and has more potential for wastewater remediation than other microalgal species 13 the utilization of microalgae in a cathode chamber under the strategy of mono and co culturing for wastewater treatment has been well documented table 2 the chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in a tubular photobioreactor which was used as a cathodic chamber and the final power output reached up to 21 4 mw m 2 14 recently mfcs integrated with scenedesmus quadricauda biofilm named algae biofilm microbial fuel cell abmfc to maximize nutrient removal and bioenergy production the maximum power density reached 62 93 mw m 2 which was enhanced than the mfc without biofilm 52 33 mw m 2 by 18 the abmfc removed cod tn and tp and 80 2 96 0 and 91 5 respectively 15 in microalgal aerobic biocathode iron and manganese act as e mediators and o2 act as an e acceptor there are several advantages of using microalgae in biocathode which include improving the sustainability of mfcs microalgal biomass in biocathode can be used for biofuel generation and removing contaminants n p and co2 from wastewater 2 2 in the anode compartment autotrophic microalgae in the anode mostly produce h and e light phase and act as e donors for the production of electricity fig 2 whereas heterotrophic microalgae can also be utilized as a substrate in the dark phase by utilization of o2 for energy generation 16 in the anode chamber of microalgal assisted mfcs microalgae can synthesize a biofilm on the electrode and acculturation a substrate for the generation of e the double chamber mfc used scenedesmus obliquus at the anode and the maximum power generation was reached up to 118 mw m 2 17 two models were constructed with no mediator and carbon graphite electrodes 18 the chlorella pyrenoidosa as live cells was grown at the anode chamber while potassium ferricyanide was used at the cathode resulting in 30 2 mw m 2 power density the increment in power density might be due to the cellular alterations caused by the addition of chemicals such as resveratrol and 2 4 dinitrophenol the presence of these chemicals would increase the proton and e leak from mitochondria which is attributed to the enhanced power density the c pyrenoidosa was added in both the anode and cathode under different growth conditions resulting in a lower power density of 2 16 mw m 2 the presence of high do beyond optimum could affect the e transfer rate to the anode electrode and decrease the electricity generation 18 the spirulina platensis was added to the anode chamber and the power generation in light conditions was 0 132 mw m 2 while in dark conditions highest power generation was 1 64 mw m 2 with the 390 mv voltage output 19 high microalgal density in the anode compartment can enhance the production of o2 which is toxic for eab and affect eet which ultimately limits the productivity of mfcs the utilization of microalgae in various anode chambers of mfcs under several modes of culturing has been studied well table 2 the mediators less exogenous electrochemically active microorganisms include pseudomonas sp rhodoferax sp geobacter sp arcobacter sp clostridium sp shewanella sp and ochrobactrum sp showed high electricity generation potential the phototrophic microorganisms associated with chlamydomonas reinhardtii chlorobium limicola rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodobacter sphaeroides and mixed microalgal culture have been reported with high efficiency in direct e transport 20 the e transfer process is extracellular in microalgae and bacteria in which e is generally moved from substrate to anode either directly or via cytochrome located in the cell membrane nanowires or through e shuttles in bacteria the catalytic activity of organic matter undergoes the krebs cycle with an aid of flavin adenosine dinucleotide fad and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad which are reduced to fadh2 and nadh resulting in the release of carbon dioxide co2 the fadh2 and nadh act as e carriers to promote the etc for energy generation 21 the e is produced through the metabolic activity of electroactive bacteria transfer directly to the anode electrode in a mediator less setup and copper wire or titanium wire works as a conductive material to transfer the e to the cathode electrode 22 in microalgae e is produced through water splitting in ps ii by h ended up the formation of o2 and excited e and in photosynthetic bacteria degradation of organic compounds produces e directly instead of h2o splitting 23 the anodes are sensitive to o2 thus a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of o2 towards the anode 24 three sets of the test aerated aerobic and anaerobic anode were performed by bacterial strain pseudomonas monteilii lzu 3 the voltage output in aerobic 150 mv and anaerobic 68 mv was lower than in aerated anode at 183 mv 25 the sensitivity of o2 towards anodic biofilm formation can influence the electricity production a study presented that the inner layer of aerobic anode biofilms performed electricity generation whereas the outer layer only consumed o2 the e donor diffusion through the outer layer became the limiting factor in electricity generation by the anode 24 the mixed microalgal culture in the anode compartment used in the membrane design mfc resulted in low power density 4 Î¼w m 2 due to competition among strains in the mixed culture and decrease e flow rate 26 thus it is still contradictory to predict the positive and negative influence of o2 on the anode chamber the performance of the anode might be affected by selections such as high do and distance of electrodes the optimum concentration of do in an anode chamber might contribute to high electricity generation further efforts should be made for the construction of high performance aerotolerant anodes to facilitate the applications of microalgal assisted mfcs in electricity generation and wastewater treatment 3 co culturing of microalgae and bacteria in mfcs the interactions among bacteria and microalgae are identified in the microbial consortium and most of the interactions are species specific the bacterial and microalgae based mfc can provide multiple benefits including 1 enhanced power generation 2 wastewater treatment 3 algal biomass cultivation for biofuel generation 4 co2 assimilation and 5 production of o2 the interaction mechanism of microalgae bacteria in wastewater treatment and maintenances of suitable ecological symbiotic relationships are less elucidated yet 27 thus a comprehensive understanding of the symbiotic relationships of microalgae and bacteria is essential in near future for better performance of microalgal assisted mfcs and the application of microalgal bacterial consortium in wastewater treatment 10 therefore this section includes the interaction mode and enormous significance of microorganisms in biotechnological processes the major interactions between microalgae and bacteria are the exchange of substrate horizontal gene transfer and interaction between cell to cell fig 3 the exchange of substrates includes a mutual relationship among microorganisms as microalgae provide organic substances and o2 for bacteria and bacteria produce inorganic substances and co2 for microalgal growth 28 the bacteria discharge phytohormones vitamin b12 thiamine derivatives and siderophores which enhance the growth and metabolism of microalgae 27 several benefits can be obtained due to the mutual interaction of co2 and o2 from bacteria and microalgae the major benefits include the cultivation of microalgae and oxygenation for bacteria for cellular reproduction 29 in oligotrophic environments macronutrients such as phosphorous carbon and nitrogen mediate the interactions between microalgal and bacterial strains the rhizobium sp facilitates nitrogen for the growth of microalgae and chlorella supplied organic carbon to bacteria 30 these interactions can be categorized as commensalism and promote the cultivation of microalgal cells in mfcs the nitrogen fixation bacteria such as pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp can provide nitrogen and co culturing of these strains with microalgae could enhance the productivity of microalgae recently a three chambered bes was developed to obtain electricity clean cultivation of c vulgaris and treatment of industrial potato juice organic wastewater the configuration of mfc consisted of an anodic microalgal cultivation chamber and cathodic chamber the results revealed that an increase in current generation simultaneously enhances biomass production 0 87 to 1 11 g l 1 and higher protein content in microalgae 320 8 to 552 1 mg protein g 1 biomass 31 such co culturing interactions exhibit the synergistic metabolism to enhance electricity generation and biomass productivity in microalgal assisted mfcs horizontal gene transfer includes the exchange of the stress tolerance gene from a similar habitat of microorganisms 32 genetically engineered microalgal and bacterial strains incorporate the bacterial gene into the microalgal genome deliberate an advantage to stress tolerance from a particular environment it is estimated that microalgal and bacterial hgt occurs at a relatively low frequency the cell to cell interaction mechanism within bacteria and microalgae includes autoinducing peptides aip and autoinducers ai 2 these signaling molecules significantly play a role in exhibiting various ecological functions such as gene expression and the physiological behavior of bacteria this type of interaction between cell to cells is called quorum sensing qs 33 the mediators of qs are not restricted to bacterial cell interaction but are also intricate in microalgal and bacterial cross talks 34 a comprehensive analysis of these communication signaling and mechanism can extend the understanding of the relevant ecosystem and biological mechanisms which may provide economic benefit for biotechnological applications as microalgae respond negatively or positively to the signals and have developed the ability to sense bacterial qs signals 4 biotic and abiotic factors that influence microalgal assisted mfc a few microalgal and bacterial species survive under particular environmental conditions ph temperature water light and soluble salts and can grow in different wastewaters domestic industrial agricultural and municipal wastewater mixtures 27 the biotic and abiotic factors influence the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs there are more efforts are required to achieve simultaneous microalgal biomass generation for biofuel production electricity generation and wastewater treatment the effect of process parameters on microalgal assisted mfcs is described in the subsections below 4 1 biotic factors the voltage output in microalgal assisted mfcs majorly relies on the selection of microbes such as bacteria and microalgae and inoculum size responsible for the electrogenesis the inoculum in anodic chambers of mfcs can be a pure bacteria or and microbial consortia from municipal wastewater anaerobic bioreactor effluent activated and anaerobic sludge 35 4 1 1 pure culture the inoculation of pure cultures is useful to clarify the e transfer mechanism and to understand the behavior of particular species in mfcs the shewanella and geobacter are the most commonly reported exoelectrogens that are responsible for higher power densities in mfcs 36 37 the inoculation of geobacter sulfurreducens kn400 in an anode chamber under anaerobic conditions and potassium ferricyanide in the cathode produced one of the highest known power densities of 3900 mw m 2 the addition of acetate as an external substrate in the anode chamber induced electricity generation 38 the dual chambered mfc separated by pem inoculated with shewanella putrefaciens in anode and potassium ferricyanide in cathode generated 4400 mw m 2 power density under ionic liquid polymer ilp modified electrode materials the current generation in mfc might be boosted by a hydrophilic and positively charged ilp on carbon cloth which increase the bacterial loading capacity due to the electrostatic interactions and improved the mediated extracellular e transfer 39 the escherichia coli is a non exoelectrogen however under genetically modified conditions it can be used for the generation of current 40 41 many other microbes such as bacillus subtilis and klebsiella aerogenes are identified as weak exoelectrogens due to poor quality of electricity generation and facilitate extracellular e transport 42 the c vulgaris is the most commonly found microalgae in the cathode chamber of microalgal assisted mfcs 14 43 the incorporation of chlorella sp in the cathode chamber of mfc exhibited a higher power density of 54 48 mw m 2 the power generation in microalgal assisted mfc depends on the o2 concentration at the cathode 44 other species of microalgae and cyanobacteria have also proven their usefulness in mfcs 35 thus the use of strong exoelectrogens as pure culture shewanella and geobacter in the anode chamber and the use of microalgae chlorella sp in the cathode chamber could enhance the power density in microalgal assisted mfcs 4 1 2 microbial consortium the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs depends upon the electroactivity metabolic interactions and competition among microorganisms in the microbial consortium the synergistic interaction between the microbes plays a key role in the e transport mechanism and degradation of the pollutants the microbial consortia in the anode chamber of mfcs can be obtained from municipal wastewater anaerobic bioreactor effluent anaerobic sludge and activated sludge 35 the inoculation of anaerobic effluent with sulfamethoxazole as a substrate in the anode chamber of mfc resulted in 587 mv voltage output the dominating microbial community thauera geobacter and methylophilus was enriched with exoelectrogens which attributed to the enhanced electricity generation 45 the anode of double chambered mfc was fed with acetate nitrate and sulfide as substrate with anaerobic sludge as microbial consortium exhibited 530 mv voltage output the addition of external substrates altered the e transfer rate and enriched the microbial community structure 46 the single chambered mfc was inoculated with poultry processing wastewater and tetracycline as substrate resulting in low voltage output the electrochemical activity and microbial community of acetate consumption bacteria were inhibited by tetracycline 47 thus the inoculation of activated sludge in the anode chamber of mfcs would be more effective to enhance electricity generation the mixed culture of microalgae in the cathode chamber under controlled do conditions can also enhance the efficiency of microalgal assisted mfcs 4 2 abiotic factors the abiotic factors such as temperature ph light intensity dissolved o2 and co2 transfer can affect the efficiency of microalgal assisted mfc these factors are responsible for the growth of bacteria and microalgae in the anode and cathode chamber respectively the variation in abiotic factors beyond optimum could slow down the microbial growth or can cause inhibition the effect of each abiotic factor on bacteria and microalgae are provided in the below subsections 4 2 1 temperature and ph temperature plays a main role in the degradation of substrates and activation of exoelectrogens 10 the operating temperature could affect electrode potential voltage output and internal resistance of mfcs the raise in temperature could also affect the conductivity of the proton exchange membrane pem the conductivity of the membrane was decreased at a higher temperature 60 c with a pem this study provides evidence that extreme temperature decreases the conductivity of the membrane 48 a two chamber mfc separated by a pem was investigated for the effect of temperature over a broad range from 10 c to 55 c the highest power density was achieved at 37 c which decreased by 21 when the temperature was raised to 43 c at the highest temperature 55 c no steady power generation was observed the high temperature of mfcs might increase the internal resistance of the cells which is attributed to the lower power generation in mfcs 49 an optimum operating temperature between 30 c to 35 c is reported with the majority of pollutant removal and maximum power density based on the behavior of microbes inside the chambers 50 in the cathode chamber a rise in the range of optimal temperature will exponentially increase the microalgal cell growth but a decrease in the temperature range beyond the optimal point even stops the activity of cells the reported optimum temperature for most microalgal species is 25 c to 30 c 51 the growth of electrogenic organisms and their activity occurs in an optimum initial ph range of 6 8 any imbalance in the concentration of ions leads to a ph gradient by disturbing the reactions within the cell and decreasing the electricity generation in an anode chamber of microalgal assisted mfcs generally neutral ph 7 is required which is considered optimal for the growth of exoelectrogen 10 although the metabolic activity of bacteria is strongly dependent on the initial ph of the media if the initial ph is 7 5 after a few days of mfc operation the ph will increase because proton exchange through the membrane has been slower than the proton production rate most of the microalgal species showed better growth in the initial ph range between 6 8 and 7 2 in synthetic media 52 the increased ph will increase the salinity of the culture media and extreme salinity can inhibit the growth of microalgal cells in the cathode chamber the possible solution includes the usage of stress tolerant microalgal species in mfcs which can tolerate salt ph and temperature stress conditions the microalgal assisted mfcs required mild reaction conditions for microalgae and bacteria such as ambient temperature ranging from 25 to 35 c and optimized initial ph ranging from 6 to 8 depending on the bacterial and microalgal species 4 2 2 dissolved oxygen the dissolved oxygen do is considered a crucial parameter for the proper functioning of mfcs due to its determined energy production a decrease in power density of 53 4 was reported when the do inside the cathode compartment increased from 7 8 to 9 5 mg l 1 the high do concentrations cause the back diffusion of o2 into the anode compartment and a decline in power density 53 the release of o2 e and h are simultaneous processes and o2 neutralizes e and h due to high electronegativity 3 5 in the cathode chamber do acts as a terminal e acceptor and scavenges all the reducing equivalents protons and e generated by the algal metabolism resulting in lower electrogenesis the generation of the reducing equivalents has a positive influence on the electrogenesis but simultaneous production of o2 can negatively influence the activity of microalgal assisted mfcs 26 the optimum do at the cathode has been highlighted to be a key parameter of cell performance 54 55 the do concentration at 6 8 mg l 1 maximizes the voltage output of 282 mv and the power density of 149 76 mw m 2 with total inorganic nitrogen removal of 91 71 in a double chambered mfc the high do concentration can receive more e and then increase the cathodic potential to generate more electricity the higher voltage output indicates more e generation which is further accepted by the nitrate nitrite in the cathode chamber 56 the do concentration of 6 6 to 6 8 mg l 1 is optimal in the cathode chamber of mfcs the high concentration of do could inhibit the growth of microalgae so it is necessary to optimize the concentration for high efficiency of microalgal assisted mfc 4 2 3 light intensity the light intensity is a critical factor in microalgal assisted mfcs in an anode or cathode chamber that can affect electricity generation by affecting the photosynthesis process the concentration of microalgal biomass increased with light intensity up to 3500 lx 10 000 lx higher light irradiance up to 10 000 and lower light intensity below 3500 lx can cause photoinhibition in microalgal cells 53 although the dark period plays an essential role for microalgae to maintain respiration and o2 consumption the c vulgaris showed a drop in electricity generation when the illumination period was reduced from 8 h 12 h 72 57 columbic efficiency 57 the excessive light intensity can affect the performance of microalgal assisted mfc by affecting the o2 evolution rate the effects of light intensities on desmodesmus sp in the cathode showed variation in electricity generation the total o2 generation increased with the increase in light intensities and a better performance of microalgal assisted mfc can be achieved at optimum range 36 the light intensity between 3500 and 6500 lx can be ascribed as an optimum range for c vulgaris as the maximum power generation of 126 mw m 3 with coulombic efficiency of 78 was achieved under this range the do in the electrode increased by an increase in the light intensity as it is an indicator for boosting photosynthetic rate and attributed to enhanced power densities 53 the optimum range of the light intensity ranged between 3500 lx to 10 000 lx which can be effectively enhanced the microalgal biomass production in microalgal assisted mfcs 4 2 4 co2 transfer the rising level of co2 has a great impact on human and environmental health the data obtained from recently published statistics indicated the increase in the proportion of co2 in the environment is from 320 to 390 ppmv parts per million volume 58 the data obtained in 2018 showed that the atmospheric concentration of co2 was 409 23 ppmv 59 and it is speculated that it might raise to 800 ppmv by the year 2100 60 in microalgal assisted mfcs the co2 transfer from the anodic to cathodic chamber plays a vital role in the growth of microalgae an increase was observed in the growth of microalgae from 1 to 3 6 mg l 1 h 1 when the concentration of co2 was increased up to 10 by volume 61 the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and microalgae shares mutualistic interaction co2 o2 3 furthermore research is required to establish the exchange of substrate in bacteria and microalgae to maximize the power density advancing the practical application of microalgae cultivation coupled with wastewater in mfcs technology can promote the microalgal bacterial synergism and enhance the techno economic feasibility of microalgal assisted mfcs 5 major concerns associated with microalgal assisted mfc the interaction between microalgae and bacteria is not species specific which makes it difficult to distinguish between species specific metabolites in an integrated system characterization and selection of microalgal strains with biochemical composition to estimate power generation potential with recovery value added products is a crucial step 62 the majority of electroactive microorganisms are uncultured yet therefore it is challenging to identify their metabolic pathways and nutrient cycling in the cathode chamber the high growth of microalgal cells can inhibit the penetration power of light and ultimately inhibit growth the metabolic shifts and dynamic interactions between bacteria and microalgae over a timescale would change the in situ parameters of culture 62 infrequently in co culturing microalgae raise the ph and salinity of culture media which can inhibit the growth of electroactive bacteria the incorporation of consortium in an anode chamber of mfc will be suggested as more beneficial the microbes present in mixed cultures are considered more advantageous due to their stress resistance and nutrient adaptability 63 the working of microalgal assisted mfcs is based on the mitochondrial reactions of microalgal cells an increase in photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae by genetic modifications can overcome the limitation related to microalgal cells 64 the stress tolerance ability of microalgae and bacteria in microalgal assisted mfc can ultimately enhance electricity output and biomass production for biofuel generation the use of ion exchange membranes or separators such as proton exchange membranes pem limits the practical application of microalgal assisted mfcs technology due to the high cost and increase in internal resistance a pem is the most frequently used separator in mfcs due to its moderately high conductivity to cations and low internal resistance compared to other separators 65 the pem membranes can be divided according to the materials or the pore size cation exchange membranes cem anion exchange membranes aem bipolar membranes bpm and microfiltration membranes mfm and ultrafiltration membranes ufm nafion and ultrex membranes are commonly used in mfcs systems due to superior proton selectivity the cations such as na k nh4 ca2 and mg2 can also be transported by pem membranes 66 the use of efficient membrane material at a low cost remains a challenge for scaling up mfcs a few studies focused on substituting the membranes with cheaper materials such as glass fiber or just removing the membrane to reduce the cost of mfcs 67 the low cost ceramic materials have been used to prepare different types of membranes the clayware has been used as a pem and the obtained maximum power density reached up to 16 8 w m 3 the ceramic material enhanced the thickness of biofilm and e transfer rate 68 the coconut shell explored its potential as a pem and exhibited higher water absorption which improve proton movement through water molecules to the cathodic side and enhanced power generation 69 a microalgae assisted mfc inoculated with s platensis was operated without a membrane the highest power density was recorded at 1 64 mw m 2 in the dark phase in comparison to the light phase at 0 132 mw m 2 the membraneless microalgal assisted mfc showed lower power density due to the lack of suitable material for e and proton transfer rate 19 the microalgal assisted mfcs also be operated under membrane less systems or by using low cost separators to enhance the power generation and efficiency of the system the state of the art of microalgal assisted mfc scale up should be focused on suitable membrane configurations or the use of low cost materials as separators selection of suitable strains and replacement of pem other efficient materials depending on the operational system the electrogenic microalgae such as desmodesmus sp and tetradesmus sp have the potential to generate electricity and use less energy via the photosynthetic process the genetic modifications and various molecular biology techniques integrated into omics approaches could be deployed to enhance the electrochemical activity of bacteria and the productivity of microalgae 6 genetic engineering integrated with omics approaches the genetic engineering approaches have been implemented on microbes to make them diverse for biotechnological applications see section 3 the mechanism of genetic engineering includes targeting the key metabolic pathways of microorganisms either by up or down regulation over expression of genes and silencing the key gene to alter the desired metabolite content without interfering with the physiological properties of microorganisms 70 the genetic engineering techniques for genetic modulation can enhance the electroactivity of electrogenic microorganisms and ultimately enhance electricity generation these modulations include mutation or deletion of genes for enhancement of biofilm formation on the electrodes 71 manipulation of genes participated in the qs system 72 genetic engineering or overexpression of genes that are responsible for e shuttle synthesis 73 and knockout of the native global regulators 74 a novel approach for the engineering of bacterial strain pseudomonas aeruginosa p3 a 11 has been deployed to enhance the electrochemical activity with global regulator engineering gre 75 the gre was implemented via error prone pcr mutagenesis and high throughput sequencing and mfc operation was comprised for further evaluation a total of 4 mutants with higher electroactivity were obtained among which the mutant 11 m2 59 showed the highest voltage output 408 mv and exhibited stronger salt tolerance capacity 75 in another study by knockout of gr sigma factor rpos in p aeruginosa pao1 the formation of biofilm on the electrode was improved and electroactive bacterial cells were adapted to the e shuttle the sigma factor has promoted the extracellular e transfer and improved the electricity generation up to 27 3 Î¼a cm 2 74 these strategies of work demonstrated that gre is an effective approach to enhancing the electroactivity and stress tolerance capacity of exoelectrogens 76 such techniques would provide high efficiency for e generation and promote the practical application of mfcs the modulation of a promoter ribosome binding site and engineering of cell surface can enhance the flavins biosynthesis and boost the performance of extracellular e transfer rate 77 the manipulation of pyocyanin derivative produced by p aeruginosa has been performed to improve the eet of electroactive microbes to enhance the efficiency of mfc the overexpression of gene phzm in p aeruginosa and inoculated in mfc showed an enhanced power density up to 166 68 Î¼w cm 2 which was 4 folds increase in comparison with the original strain 73 several genetic engineering approaches have been developed for modifications of electroactive bacteria to enhance electricity generation table 3 the prospects associated with synthetic biology can be useful for commercialization production of bioenergy from biomass and removal of contaminants from wastewater 78 there is limited research conducted on the genetic manipulation of a microalgal cell for wastewater treatment in a study c reinhardtii was used for metal tolerance protein mtp and wastewater treatment over expression of cr mtp4 in c reinhardtii significantly increases cd accumulation and increased tolerance to cd toxicity the microalgae with a single engineering gene do have not that much capability to compete with naturally adapted strains that are likely to be mutagenic and part of oxidative stress tolerance 79 however studies on genetic manipulation of microalgae to enhance biomass productivity and wastewater treatment are limited therefore a strong conclusion regarding the application of synthetic biology in microalgae cannot be reached 6 1 omics approaches the omics strategies such as genomics proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics and lipidomics provide a deep understanding of metabolic responses gene regulation under stress conditions and functions of microalgal cells 80 the omics approaches have been applied to review the efficiency of cyanobacteria such as oscillatoria sp scenedesmus sp and arthrospira sp and microalgal species including c vulgaris and other chlorella sp for wastewater treatment chlorella sorokiniana bd09 c sorokiniana bd08 and chlorella sp showed appropriate stress tolerance capabilities in synthetic wastewater genome sequencing results showed genomic completeness 91 and genome annotation with high confidence gene models predicted 10 240 for bd08 9668 for bd09 and 9821 for dachan 81 these sequenced genomes provide insight into the molecular basis of stress tolerance in microalgal strains for wastewater treatment the stress tolerance of microalgal species provides a fundamental foundation for wastewater treatment in microalgal assisted mfcs the several organelles including plastid genomes and mitochondria have also been sequenced in microalgae for wastewater treatment and recovery of valued added products 64 the use of stress tolerance microalgal species would be more beneficial it can provide a high density of microalgal cells with complete utilization of biomass for biofuel generation several abiotic stress conditions such as an increase in salinity of culture medium phytohormones nutrient repletion depletion temperature increase in light intensity or providing dark light 6 18 cycles and uv radiation would be considered abiotic factors the omics approaches in microalgal cells consider an important role in understanding the metabolic pathways and stress tolerance mechanism in various microalgal species 79 the multi stress environmental conditions and optimization of metabolic pathways with multi omics approaches can be considered an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs table 4 in bacteria catabolic and extracellular e transfer pathways have also been studied such as g sulfurreducens pca shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and p aeruginosa these are highly electrochemically active bacteria due to their high adaptability to abiotic stress conditions and different capacities for producing phenazine derivatives to facilitate e transport 82 the use of next generation sequencing ngs has gained huge attention due to the understanding of various genes involved in metabolic responses particularly understanding of microalgal genomes the microalgal genome analysis revealed numerous responsive genes under nitrogen deprivation including 86 annotated as transcription factors which increases the accumulation of natural fats and oils triglycerides 83 the optimization of electroactive microorganisms using metagenomics approaches shotgun sequencing of whole metagenomes will be a suitable strategy to improve the potential of microalgal assisted mfc while for metabarcoding amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes ngss are also useful for marker gene based methods the mrna based sequencing approaches can be deployed to analyze gene expression in electroactive microorganisms although there are very limited studies focusing on the synthetic biology integrated into omics approaches of microalgae for wastewater treatment thus there is still a need for more research on genetic manipulation in microalgal cells to enhance the efficiency of microalgal assisted mfcs additionally transgenesis technologies and genetic modifications improve the characteristics of microalgae and bacteria which could further enhance the potential utilization of these microbes in mfcs fig 4 such spectacular progress in genetic engineering integrated with omics approaches can enhance the understanding of metabolic pathways in novel microalgal assisted mfc biotechnology 7 scenario towards scaling up and economic feasibility of microalgal assisted mfcs the microalgal assisted mfcs technology for power generation from an individual mfc unit is not suitable for many practical applications to enhance the efficiency of mfcs individual mfc units need to be implemented into large scale stacks and vertical cascades 84 the vertical cascades with the volume of 4500 ml are reported to enhance the electricity generation 55 43 wm 3 wastewater treatment cod tn tp removal 72 4 40 5 24 4 respectively and microalgal biomass productivity 465 10 g 3 with high lipidic content 38 17 85 there are various configurations for testing the productivity of microalgal assisted mfcs fig 5 although microalgal assisted mfc is a newly established technology so there are limited studies focused on large scale wastewater treatment till now recently microalgal assisted mfcs operated with polyethylene bags as an mfc chamber 10 l 86 c vulgaris at the cathode were used to provide o2 as an e acceptor and harvested biomass served as a lipid source for biodiesel production the microalgal assisted mfcs were performed for all parameters including microalgae productivity 0 09 kg m 3d 1 energy recovery 11 53 kwm 3 and cost of operation 11 225 86 in terms of large scale production a pilot mes system having a volume of 1500 l was operated outdoor in a municipal wastewater treatment plant this model obtained 91 cod removal and 64 n removal with a power output of 406 wm 3 87 in another study the highest power output of 101 mw m 2 was obtained in an 85 l mfc in batch mode 88 a 90 liter stackable pilot mfc was designed for brewery wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity harvested the produced electricity from mfcs operation was used to drive the overall system 84 the large scale reactors can achieve up to 90 cod removal 89 a study was tested for low cost mfc incorporated with brewery wastewater for almost one year and results revealed 98 cod removal 62 there are numerous studies have been published related to the scale up of mfcs technology to enhance the knowledge in this field table 5 the microalgal assisted mfcs technology is still a developing technique yet hence frequently has not been implemented for large scale production of electricity generation and wastewater treatment 7 1 techno economic feasibility of microalgal assisted mfcs the conventional approaches for wastewater treatment result in the production of waste activated sludge mainly activated sludge disposed of inside the land or treatment plant premises moreover these solutions are not economically feasible 90 the identification of new landfill sites and potential contamination risk to the environment are the major problems associated with conventional methods bes for contaminant removal and wastewater treatment are considered promising biotechnological approaches to producing renewable energy from wastewater microalgal assisted mfcs are the types of bes to produce electricity directly with simultaneous wastewater treatment and provide microalgal biomass for biofuel generation in near future microalgal assisted mfcs will become proficient and cost effective alternatives to treating wastewater the cost of microalgal assisted mfcs includes operational maintenance expenses initial capital investment and material and chemical consumption 91 for catalytic activities of electroactive bacteria graphite granules ggs and granular activated carbon gac are used the ggs are cost effective and provide higher conductivity while gacs have high micro porosity with efficient catalytic activity 92 the average cost of gac or gg electrodes ranges from 500 to 2500 us ton and the average cost of carbon material is 100 000 500 000 us m 2 93 the mfcs can theoretically generate a net normalized energy recovery ner of around 0 004 kw h kg 1 cod based on previously calculated energy balance analysis 91 however the obtained profit from the bes is still under debate because of the high cost and system operation the capital costs of microalgal assisted mfcs are still under debate due to the use of expensive separators that provide artificial light for the growth of microalgal cells the possible solution to replace the expensive membranes is the use of carbon felt as a membrane separator and the same material as an electrode to effectively reduce the overall cost of mfcs scale up for the integrated system the production costs for s obliquus biomass in indoor cultivation using nutrient medium and artificial illumination and finally outdoor cultivation with wastewater nutrients and sunlight were estimated to be 1420 82 and 37 77 39 89 respectively 90 the capital costs of an air cathode mfcs would still reach 3 kg 1 cod even with cheap materials this estimation is based on the mfcs configuration and treatment capability separator 1 m 2 a reactor of 5000 m 3 with a capacity of 25 kg cod m 3 d 1 an anode of 100 m 2 and cathode of 1500 m 2 for the large scale operation of mfcs the raw material cost includes carbon fiber 515 08 carbon fiber brushes 52 5 and titanium ti wire 378 8 for the treatment of electrodes the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe cost 10 of the total spend 170 25 the perforated plate with supporting separator layer and polyurethane sponge accounted for 15 1 of the total cost 205 8 41 16 2 4 respectively 87 there is still a need for further development in the configuration of microalgal assisted mfcs for commercialization replacement of expensive proton exchange membrane with carbon felt would be a possible solution for the commercialization of microalgal assisted mfcs integration of microalgae in mfc provides insightful application for wastewater treatment and easy harvesting of microalgal biomass for biofuel generation near future and ultimately helps to reduce the overall cost of the operational system 7 2 applications of microalgal assisted mfcs the microalgal assisted mfcs have been applied with wastewater for bioelectricity generation under laboratory conditions a wide range of applications can obtain by integrating microalgae with mfcs such as enhanced electricity generation wastewater treatment and harvesting of microalgae for biofuel generation the conventional methods for harvesting microalgae are energy intensive and contribute 30 to 35 of the total cost the use of bacteria with microalgae as synergistic metabolism in mfcs is a convenient way to promote microalgal productivity and further utilization of harvested biomass for biofuel generation this strategy will make the harvesting practice more proficient 90 the mfcs provide recovery of the valuable products and microalgal biomass for the generation of biofuels furthermore applications of microalgal assisted mfc technology in wastewater treatment and microalgal biorefinery integrated with value added products make this technology more feasible and extremely attractive fig 6 thus the cultivation of microalgae in mfcs is considered a profitable approach to enhance electricity generation wastewater treatment and biomass productivity 8 conclusions and future outlook in this review the critical assessment of current scenarios was discussed based on the recent publications 2017 2022 in microalgal assisted mfcs with a strategy of mono culturing and co culturing i e microalgal bacterial symbiosis the results of collected data emphasized that microalgae scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp in mfcs enhanced the power density with 90 pollutant removal cod tn and tp which makes them a potential candidate for microalgal assisted mfcs the recently developed genetic modification strategies with a combination of omics including genomics transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics under stress conditions can enhance the potential of microalgae and bacteria such spectacular progress in genetic engineering integrated with omics approaches would provide an in depth understanding of metabolic pathways the application of genetic engineering approaches to microalgal cells for wastewater treatment is still limited and needs improvement to make microalgal assisted mfc biotechnology more economically feasible herein several future outlooks for microalgal assisted mfcs itemized to achieve a better performance of the system it is vital to conduct further studies for a better understanding of e transfer mechanisms exerted between microalgae and bacteria which contribute to the diverse possibilities of coupling forms of microalgal assisted mfcs the optimization of process parameters in microalgal assisted mfcs for power generation with suitable membrane or membrane configuration needs more research the multi stress environments such as the addition of phytohormones salinity heat stress and light to the microalgae in the cathode chamber can be an effective strategy to enhance the photosynthesis process i e o2 generation of microalgae in mfcs and to obtain the high quality microalgal biofuels from harvested biomass additionally integrated systems such as anaerobic digestion coupled with mfcs should be promoted more to enhance the efficiency of processes credit authorship contribution statement monika sharma visualization investigation data curation

12807,recently a lot of research work has been performed on microalgal assisted microbial fuel cells mfcs for electricity generation wastewater treatment and biomass production however a comprehensive investigation on the insight of microalgal assisted mfcs along with a deep discussion on the application of molecular biology approaches has not been reviewed yet in this review the state of the art on efficient use of microalgae alive non alive biomass in mfcs based on the strategy of mono culturing co culturing and substrate microalgae and bacteria symbiosis has been discussed the major concerns in microalgal assisted mfcs such as microbial strains selection cultivation mode stress tolerance inoculum ratio and expensive separators with the potential solutions including replacement of expensive separators and optimization of process parameters have been emphasized the genetic modification strategies gene knock in and gene knock out combined with transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics under the stress conditions to enhance the potential of microalgal assisted mfcs for electricity generation and microalgal biomass production have been highlighted the recent studies where the scale up was applied for the commercialization of microalgal assisted mfcs technology and techno economic feasibility comparison of laboratory and scale up unit price have been elucidated this review addresses an outlook of the microalgal assisted mfcs biotechnology along with the symbiosis of microalgae bacteria in mfcs and could be useful to the key processes and practical applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microalgae microbial fuel cells microalgae bacteria symbiosis synthetic biology 1 introduction the foremost disquiet of modern society is energy crises and the maintenance of water quality 1 the discharge of wastewater in large quantities causes a threat to environmental and human health 2 wastewater contains a massive amount of toxic substances such as aromatic hydrocarbons phenolics insecticides pesticides heavy metals and antibiotics so the proper treatment of wastewater is necessary to allow its safe use 3 the biological treatments that occurred in wastewater treatment plants contribute to a satisfactory approach to wastewater treatment 4 a bioelectrochemical system bes is a potential technology for electricity generation and wastewater treatment the bes contains several broad classes such as sediment fuel cells wetland fuel cells microbial electrolysis cells microbial fuel cells mfc and photosynthetic fuel cells the mfcs have been frequently reported for pollutant removal coupled with wastewater treatment and electricity generation 5 the performance of the mfcs is limited by aeration cost in the cathode compartment which consumes almost 50 of the total cost to overcome some drawbacks microalgae are considered the appropriate oxygen o2 supplier improving the power generation and removal of the pollutants simultaneously microalgal assisted mfcs have captured consideration from researchers due to enhanced electricity generation wastewater treatment and biofuel generation from microalgal biomass table 1 the cultivation of microalgae in mfcs under various strategies would be a favorable approach for biofuel generation steered by bacteria microalgae synergistic metabolism fig 1 microalgal assisted mfcs are a promising technology to resolve the energy crises and the maintenance of water quality 6 microalgal assisted mfcs are considered an appropriate technology for electricity generation pollutants removal and simultaneous wastewater treatment table 1 microalgae have several advantages over other photosynthetic plants such as high growth rate no competition for food and cultivation on non arable land the energy conversion efficiency of other photosynthetic plants c3 c4 is 4 6 to 6 while microalgae showed a maximum output of up to 9 7 microalgae also have the capacity for superior co2 fixation remove nutrients from wastewater and have the potential to be bioengineered 2 all these properties of microalgae make them a prominent candidate for use in mfcs and can consider as potential biomass feedstock the integration of microalgae with mfcs has become interesting technology since microalgae will act as o2 generators and serve as electron e acceptors in the cathode chamber 8 recently many research works have been performed on microalgal assisted mfcs for wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity generation the collected data obtained from the literature last 5 years have been used to provide a comprehensive direction for the current scenario associated with microalgal assisted mfcs most of the previous reviews have been focused on the configuration such as single and double chambered microbial electrolysis cells which lacks advancements in wastewater treatment and mfc biotechnology thus the motivation of the present review is to 1 collect the published results on the application of microalgae in mfcs from the analysis of the collected data from 2017 to 2022 we found that the microalgae can be used in the cathode and anode in mfcs under various modes such as mono culturing co culturing and substrate the alive microalgal cells in anode are utilized as the e donors while in cathode alive microalgal cells provided as e acceptor 2 deliberate the main concerns of microalgal assisted mfcs such as selection of the strains cultivation mode stress tolerance and inoculum ratio for mono culturing and co culturing 3 discuss the effect of operational such as temperature ph light intensity and dissolved oxygen and other parameters on the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs 4 report the current scenario of the use of synthetic biologies global regulator engineering mutations and engineering of promoter integrated with multi omics approaches metagenomics transcriptomics metabolomics and proteomics to enhance the understanding of genome structure stress tolerance of strains and electrochemical biochemical activity of microbial species in mfcs and 5 cover the recent progress towards scale up for commercialization and techno economic feasibility of mfcs comparison of laboratory and scale up unit price 2 culturing of microalgae in mfc microalgal assisted mfcs is an advanced technology in the era of bes which uses microalgae as an oxygenator and reduces the operational cost since there is no need for external aeration culturing of microalgae in mfcs mainly consists of two ways including the addition of live microalgae and dead biomass as substrate the presence of live microalgae in the cathode can provide o2 as an e acceptor whereas in an anode dead microalgae or biomass as a substrate can ultimately promote the growth of electroactive bacteria under anaerobic conditions the e transport chain etc of microalgae initiates from chloroplast through water splitting in photosystem ps ii and by h and results in the formation of o2 and excited e 9 the principles of microalgal assisted mfc include microalgal biomass utilization as substrate photosynthesis process in anodic and cathodic chamber depending on the substrate used and utilization of o2 as e acceptor 10 the below subsection discusses the studies of the use of microalgae in mfcs 2 1 in the cathode compartment the microalgae in the cathode chamber mono culturing co culture but there are few drawbacks with co culture such as access production of o2 which can cause the inhibition of process follow the photosynthetic pathway and allow to use of co2 as a carbon source resulting in the production of o2 11 the o2 produced by microalgae will act as an e acceptor in the cathode compartment fig 2 microalgae based cathode supports the wastewater treatment through cathodic reduction sequestration of co2 to enhance biomass production which can further be used for biofuel generation other cathodic materials including potassium ferricyanide are widely used and not as costly but toxic to the environment and need to be replenished platinum pt is commonly used in mfcs as a catalyst but due to high expense not suitable for commercial scale production thus the use of pt in mfcs does not meet the expectation of economic feasibility 12 microalgal biocathode is less expensive and helps in the removal of contaminants with co2 sequestration to produce biomass the harvested microalgal biomass from the cathodic chamber can be further used for biofuel generation chlorella sp is the most widely used microalgae in biocathode due to its ease of availability and has more potential for wastewater remediation than other microalgal species 13 the utilization of microalgae in a cathode chamber under the strategy of mono and co culturing for wastewater treatment has been well documented table 2 the chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in a tubular photobioreactor which was used as a cathodic chamber and the final power output reached up to 21 4 mw m 2 14 recently mfcs integrated with scenedesmus quadricauda biofilm named algae biofilm microbial fuel cell abmfc to maximize nutrient removal and bioenergy production the maximum power density reached 62 93 mw m 2 which was enhanced than the mfc without biofilm 52 33 mw m 2 by 18 the abmfc removed cod tn and tp and 80 2 96 0 and 91 5 respectively 15 in microalgal aerobic biocathode iron and manganese act as e mediators and o2 act as an e acceptor there are several advantages of using microalgae in biocathode which include improving the sustainability of mfcs microalgal biomass in biocathode can be used for biofuel generation and removing contaminants n p and co2 from wastewater 2 2 in the anode compartment autotrophic microalgae in the anode mostly produce h and e light phase and act as e donors for the production of electricity fig 2 whereas heterotrophic microalgae can also be utilized as a substrate in the dark phase by utilization of o2 for energy generation 16 in the anode chamber of microalgal assisted mfcs microalgae can synthesize a biofilm on the electrode and acculturation a substrate for the generation of e the double chamber mfc used scenedesmus obliquus at the anode and the maximum power generation was reached up to 118 mw m 2 17 two models were constructed with no mediator and carbon graphite electrodes 18 the chlorella pyrenoidosa as live cells was grown at the anode chamber while potassium ferricyanide was used at the cathode resulting in 30 2 mw m 2 power density the increment in power density might be due to the cellular alterations caused by the addition of chemicals such as resveratrol and 2 4 dinitrophenol the presence of these chemicals would increase the proton and e leak from mitochondria which is attributed to the enhanced power density the c pyrenoidosa was added in both the anode and cathode under different growth conditions resulting in a lower power density of 2 16 mw m 2 the presence of high do beyond optimum could affect the e transfer rate to the anode electrode and decrease the electricity generation 18 the spirulina platensis was added to the anode chamber and the power generation in light conditions was 0 132 mw m 2 while in dark conditions highest power generation was 1 64 mw m 2 with the 390 mv voltage output 19 high microalgal density in the anode compartment can enhance the production of o2 which is toxic for eab and affect eet which ultimately limits the productivity of mfcs the utilization of microalgae in various anode chambers of mfcs under several modes of culturing has been studied well table 2 the mediators less exogenous electrochemically active microorganisms include pseudomonas sp rhodoferax sp geobacter sp arcobacter sp clostridium sp shewanella sp and ochrobactrum sp showed high electricity generation potential the phototrophic microorganisms associated with chlamydomonas reinhardtii chlorobium limicola rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodobacter sphaeroides and mixed microalgal culture have been reported with high efficiency in direct e transport 20 the e transfer process is extracellular in microalgae and bacteria in which e is generally moved from substrate to anode either directly or via cytochrome located in the cell membrane nanowires or through e shuttles in bacteria the catalytic activity of organic matter undergoes the krebs cycle with an aid of flavin adenosine dinucleotide fad and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad which are reduced to fadh2 and nadh resulting in the release of carbon dioxide co2 the fadh2 and nadh act as e carriers to promote the etc for energy generation 21 the e is produced through the metabolic activity of electroactive bacteria transfer directly to the anode electrode in a mediator less setup and copper wire or titanium wire works as a conductive material to transfer the e to the cathode electrode 22 in microalgae e is produced through water splitting in ps ii by h ended up the formation of o2 and excited e and in photosynthetic bacteria degradation of organic compounds produces e directly instead of h2o splitting 23 the anodes are sensitive to o2 thus a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of o2 towards the anode 24 three sets of the test aerated aerobic and anaerobic anode were performed by bacterial strain pseudomonas monteilii lzu 3 the voltage output in aerobic 150 mv and anaerobic 68 mv was lower than in aerated anode at 183 mv 25 the sensitivity of o2 towards anodic biofilm formation can influence the electricity production a study presented that the inner layer of aerobic anode biofilms performed electricity generation whereas the outer layer only consumed o2 the e donor diffusion through the outer layer became the limiting factor in electricity generation by the anode 24 the mixed microalgal culture in the anode compartment used in the membrane design mfc resulted in low power density 4 Î¼w m 2 due to competition among strains in the mixed culture and decrease e flow rate 26 thus it is still contradictory to predict the positive and negative influence of o2 on the anode chamber the performance of the anode might be affected by selections such as high do and distance of electrodes the optimum concentration of do in an anode chamber might contribute to high electricity generation further efforts should be made for the construction of high performance aerotolerant anodes to facilitate the applications of microalgal assisted mfcs in electricity generation and wastewater treatment 3 co culturing of microalgae and bacteria in mfcs the interactions among bacteria and microalgae are identified in the microbial consortium and most of the interactions are species specific the bacterial and microalgae based mfc can provide multiple benefits including 1 enhanced power generation 2 wastewater treatment 3 algal biomass cultivation for biofuel generation 4 co2 assimilation and 5 production of o2 the interaction mechanism of microalgae bacteria in wastewater treatment and maintenances of suitable ecological symbiotic relationships are less elucidated yet 27 thus a comprehensive understanding of the symbiotic relationships of microalgae and bacteria is essential in near future for better performance of microalgal assisted mfcs and the application of microalgal bacterial consortium in wastewater treatment 10 therefore this section includes the interaction mode and enormous significance of microorganisms in biotechnological processes the major interactions between microalgae and bacteria are the exchange of substrate horizontal gene transfer and interaction between cell to cell fig 3 the exchange of substrates includes a mutual relationship among microorganisms as microalgae provide organic substances and o2 for bacteria and bacteria produce inorganic substances and co2 for microalgal growth 28 the bacteria discharge phytohormones vitamin b12 thiamine derivatives and siderophores which enhance the growth and metabolism of microalgae 27 several benefits can be obtained due to the mutual interaction of co2 and o2 from bacteria and microalgae the major benefits include the cultivation of microalgae and oxygenation for bacteria for cellular reproduction 29 in oligotrophic environments macronutrients such as phosphorous carbon and nitrogen mediate the interactions between microalgal and bacterial strains the rhizobium sp facilitates nitrogen for the growth of microalgae and chlorella supplied organic carbon to bacteria 30 these interactions can be categorized as commensalism and promote the cultivation of microalgal cells in mfcs the nitrogen fixation bacteria such as pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp can provide nitrogen and co culturing of these strains with microalgae could enhance the productivity of microalgae recently a three chambered bes was developed to obtain electricity clean cultivation of c vulgaris and treatment of industrial potato juice organic wastewater the configuration of mfc consisted of an anodic microalgal cultivation chamber and cathodic chamber the results revealed that an increase in current generation simultaneously enhances biomass production 0 87 to 1 11 g l 1 and higher protein content in microalgae 320 8 to 552 1 mg protein g 1 biomass 31 such co culturing interactions exhibit the synergistic metabolism to enhance electricity generation and biomass productivity in microalgal assisted mfcs horizontal gene transfer includes the exchange of the stress tolerance gene from a similar habitat of microorganisms 32 genetically engineered microalgal and bacterial strains incorporate the bacterial gene into the microalgal genome deliberate an advantage to stress tolerance from a particular environment it is estimated that microalgal and bacterial hgt occurs at a relatively low frequency the cell to cell interaction mechanism within bacteria and microalgae includes autoinducing peptides aip and autoinducers ai 2 these signaling molecules significantly play a role in exhibiting various ecological functions such as gene expression and the physiological behavior of bacteria this type of interaction between cell to cells is called quorum sensing qs 33 the mediators of qs are not restricted to bacterial cell interaction but are also intricate in microalgal and bacterial cross talks 34 a comprehensive analysis of these communication signaling and mechanism can extend the understanding of the relevant ecosystem and biological mechanisms which may provide economic benefit for biotechnological applications as microalgae respond negatively or positively to the signals and have developed the ability to sense bacterial qs signals 4 biotic and abiotic factors that influence microalgal assisted mfc a few microalgal and bacterial species survive under particular environmental conditions ph temperature water light and soluble salts and can grow in different wastewaters domestic industrial agricultural and municipal wastewater mixtures 27 the biotic and abiotic factors influence the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs there are more efforts are required to achieve simultaneous microalgal biomass generation for biofuel production electricity generation and wastewater treatment the effect of process parameters on microalgal assisted mfcs is described in the subsections below 4 1 biotic factors the voltage output in microalgal assisted mfcs majorly relies on the selection of microbes such as bacteria and microalgae and inoculum size responsible for the electrogenesis the inoculum in anodic chambers of mfcs can be a pure bacteria or and microbial consortia from municipal wastewater anaerobic bioreactor effluent activated and anaerobic sludge 35 4 1 1 pure culture the inoculation of pure cultures is useful to clarify the e transfer mechanism and to understand the behavior of particular species in mfcs the shewanella and geobacter are the most commonly reported exoelectrogens that are responsible for higher power densities in mfcs 36 37 the inoculation of geobacter sulfurreducens kn400 in an anode chamber under anaerobic conditions and potassium ferricyanide in the cathode produced one of the highest known power densities of 3900 mw m 2 the addition of acetate as an external substrate in the anode chamber induced electricity generation 38 the dual chambered mfc separated by pem inoculated with shewanella putrefaciens in anode and potassium ferricyanide in cathode generated 4400 mw m 2 power density under ionic liquid polymer ilp modified electrode materials the current generation in mfc might be boosted by a hydrophilic and positively charged ilp on carbon cloth which increase the bacterial loading capacity due to the electrostatic interactions and improved the mediated extracellular e transfer 39 the escherichia coli is a non exoelectrogen however under genetically modified conditions it can be used for the generation of current 40 41 many other microbes such as bacillus subtilis and klebsiella aerogenes are identified as weak exoelectrogens due to poor quality of electricity generation and facilitate extracellular e transport 42 the c vulgaris is the most commonly found microalgae in the cathode chamber of microalgal assisted mfcs 14 43 the incorporation of chlorella sp in the cathode chamber of mfc exhibited a higher power density of 54 48 mw m 2 the power generation in microalgal assisted mfc depends on the o2 concentration at the cathode 44 other species of microalgae and cyanobacteria have also proven their usefulness in mfcs 35 thus the use of strong exoelectrogens as pure culture shewanella and geobacter in the anode chamber and the use of microalgae chlorella sp in the cathode chamber could enhance the power density in microalgal assisted mfcs 4 1 2 microbial consortium the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs depends upon the electroactivity metabolic interactions and competition among microorganisms in the microbial consortium the synergistic interaction between the microbes plays a key role in the e transport mechanism and degradation of the pollutants the microbial consortia in the anode chamber of mfcs can be obtained from municipal wastewater anaerobic bioreactor effluent anaerobic sludge and activated sludge 35 the inoculation of anaerobic effluent with sulfamethoxazole as a substrate in the anode chamber of mfc resulted in 587 mv voltage output the dominating microbial community thauera geobacter and methylophilus was enriched with exoelectrogens which attributed to the enhanced electricity generation 45 the anode of double chambered mfc was fed with acetate nitrate and sulfide as substrate with anaerobic sludge as microbial consortium exhibited 530 mv voltage output the addition of external substrates altered the e transfer rate and enriched the microbial community structure 46 the single chambered mfc was inoculated with poultry processing wastewater and tetracycline as substrate resulting in low voltage output the electrochemical activity and microbial community of acetate consumption bacteria were inhibited by tetracycline 47 thus the inoculation of activated sludge in the anode chamber of mfcs would be more effective to enhance electricity generation the mixed culture of microalgae in the cathode chamber under controlled do conditions can also enhance the efficiency of microalgal assisted mfcs 4 2 abiotic factors the abiotic factors such as temperature ph light intensity dissolved o2 and co2 transfer can affect the efficiency of microalgal assisted mfc these factors are responsible for the growth of bacteria and microalgae in the anode and cathode chamber respectively the variation in abiotic factors beyond optimum could slow down the microbial growth or can cause inhibition the effect of each abiotic factor on bacteria and microalgae are provided in the below subsections 4 2 1 temperature and ph temperature plays a main role in the degradation of substrates and activation of exoelectrogens 10 the operating temperature could affect electrode potential voltage output and internal resistance of mfcs the raise in temperature could also affect the conductivity of the proton exchange membrane pem the conductivity of the membrane was decreased at a higher temperature 60 c with a pem this study provides evidence that extreme temperature decreases the conductivity of the membrane 48 a two chamber mfc separated by a pem was investigated for the effect of temperature over a broad range from 10 c to 55 c the highest power density was achieved at 37 c which decreased by 21 when the temperature was raised to 43 c at the highest temperature 55 c no steady power generation was observed the high temperature of mfcs might increase the internal resistance of the cells which is attributed to the lower power generation in mfcs 49 an optimum operating temperature between 30 c to 35 c is reported with the majority of pollutant removal and maximum power density based on the behavior of microbes inside the chambers 50 in the cathode chamber a rise in the range of optimal temperature will exponentially increase the microalgal cell growth but a decrease in the temperature range beyond the optimal point even stops the activity of cells the reported optimum temperature for most microalgal species is 25 c to 30 c 51 the growth of electrogenic organisms and their activity occurs in an optimum initial ph range of 6 8 any imbalance in the concentration of ions leads to a ph gradient by disturbing the reactions within the cell and decreasing the electricity generation in an anode chamber of microalgal assisted mfcs generally neutral ph 7 is required which is considered optimal for the growth of exoelectrogen 10 although the metabolic activity of bacteria is strongly dependent on the initial ph of the media if the initial ph is 7 5 after a few days of mfc operation the ph will increase because proton exchange through the membrane has been slower than the proton production rate most of the microalgal species showed better growth in the initial ph range between 6 8 and 7 2 in synthetic media 52 the increased ph will increase the salinity of the culture media and extreme salinity can inhibit the growth of microalgal cells in the cathode chamber the possible solution includes the usage of stress tolerant microalgal species in mfcs which can tolerate salt ph and temperature stress conditions the microalgal assisted mfcs required mild reaction conditions for microalgae and bacteria such as ambient temperature ranging from 25 to 35 c and optimized initial ph ranging from 6 to 8 depending on the bacterial and microalgal species 4 2 2 dissolved oxygen the dissolved oxygen do is considered a crucial parameter for the proper functioning of mfcs due to its determined energy production a decrease in power density of 53 4 was reported when the do inside the cathode compartment increased from 7 8 to 9 5 mg l 1 the high do concentrations cause the back diffusion of o2 into the anode compartment and a decline in power density 53 the release of o2 e and h are simultaneous processes and o2 neutralizes e and h due to high electronegativity 3 5 in the cathode chamber do acts as a terminal e acceptor and scavenges all the reducing equivalents protons and e generated by the algal metabolism resulting in lower electrogenesis the generation of the reducing equivalents has a positive influence on the electrogenesis but simultaneous production of o2 can negatively influence the activity of microalgal assisted mfcs 26 the optimum do at the cathode has been highlighted to be a key parameter of cell performance 54 55 the do concentration at 6 8 mg l 1 maximizes the voltage output of 282 mv and the power density of 149 76 mw m 2 with total inorganic nitrogen removal of 91 71 in a double chambered mfc the high do concentration can receive more e and then increase the cathodic potential to generate more electricity the higher voltage output indicates more e generation which is further accepted by the nitrate nitrite in the cathode chamber 56 the do concentration of 6 6 to 6 8 mg l 1 is optimal in the cathode chamber of mfcs the high concentration of do could inhibit the growth of microalgae so it is necessary to optimize the concentration for high efficiency of microalgal assisted mfc 4 2 3 light intensity the light intensity is a critical factor in microalgal assisted mfcs in an anode or cathode chamber that can affect electricity generation by affecting the photosynthesis process the concentration of microalgal biomass increased with light intensity up to 3500 lx 10 000 lx higher light irradiance up to 10 000 and lower light intensity below 3500 lx can cause photoinhibition in microalgal cells 53 although the dark period plays an essential role for microalgae to maintain respiration and o2 consumption the c vulgaris showed a drop in electricity generation when the illumination period was reduced from 8 h 12 h 72 57 columbic efficiency 57 the excessive light intensity can affect the performance of microalgal assisted mfc by affecting the o2 evolution rate the effects of light intensities on desmodesmus sp in the cathode showed variation in electricity generation the total o2 generation increased with the increase in light intensities and a better performance of microalgal assisted mfc can be achieved at optimum range 36 the light intensity between 3500 and 6500 lx can be ascribed as an optimum range for c vulgaris as the maximum power generation of 126 mw m 3 with coulombic efficiency of 78 was achieved under this range the do in the electrode increased by an increase in the light intensity as it is an indicator for boosting photosynthetic rate and attributed to enhanced power densities 53 the optimum range of the light intensity ranged between 3500 lx to 10 000 lx which can be effectively enhanced the microalgal biomass production in microalgal assisted mfcs 4 2 4 co2 transfer the rising level of co2 has a great impact on human and environmental health the data obtained from recently published statistics indicated the increase in the proportion of co2 in the environment is from 320 to 390 ppmv parts per million volume 58 the data obtained in 2018 showed that the atmospheric concentration of co2 was 409 23 ppmv 59 and it is speculated that it might raise to 800 ppmv by the year 2100 60 in microalgal assisted mfcs the co2 transfer from the anodic to cathodic chamber plays a vital role in the growth of microalgae an increase was observed in the growth of microalgae from 1 to 3 6 mg l 1 h 1 when the concentration of co2 was increased up to 10 by volume 61 the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and microalgae shares mutualistic interaction co2 o2 3 furthermore research is required to establish the exchange of substrate in bacteria and microalgae to maximize the power density advancing the practical application of microalgae cultivation coupled with wastewater in mfcs technology can promote the microalgal bacterial synergism and enhance the techno economic feasibility of microalgal assisted mfcs 5 major concerns associated with microalgal assisted mfc the interaction between microalgae and bacteria is not species specific which makes it difficult to distinguish between species specific metabolites in an integrated system characterization and selection of microalgal strains with biochemical composition to estimate power generation potential with recovery value added products is a crucial step 62 the majority of electroactive microorganisms are uncultured yet therefore it is challenging to identify their metabolic pathways and nutrient cycling in the cathode chamber the high growth of microalgal cells can inhibit the penetration power of light and ultimately inhibit growth the metabolic shifts and dynamic interactions between bacteria and microalgae over a timescale would change the in situ parameters of culture 62 infrequently in co culturing microalgae raise the ph and salinity of culture media which can inhibit the growth of electroactive bacteria the incorporation of consortium in an anode chamber of mfc will be suggested as more beneficial the microbes present in mixed cultures are considered more advantageous due to their stress resistance and nutrient adaptability 63 the working of microalgal assisted mfcs is based on the mitochondrial reactions of microalgal cells an increase in photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae by genetic modifications can overcome the limitation related to microalgal cells 64 the stress tolerance ability of microalgae and bacteria in microalgal assisted mfc can ultimately enhance electricity output and biomass production for biofuel generation the use of ion exchange membranes or separators such as proton exchange membranes pem limits the practical application of microalgal assisted mfcs technology due to the high cost and increase in internal resistance a pem is the most frequently used separator in mfcs due to its moderately high conductivity to cations and low internal resistance compared to other separators 65 the pem membranes can be divided according to the materials or the pore size cation exchange membranes cem anion exchange membranes aem bipolar membranes bpm and microfiltration membranes mfm and ultrafiltration membranes ufm nafion and ultrex membranes are commonly used in mfcs systems due to superior proton selectivity the cations such as na k nh4 ca2 and mg2 can also be transported by pem membranes 66 the use of efficient membrane material at a low cost remains a challenge for scaling up mfcs a few studies focused on substituting the membranes with cheaper materials such as glass fiber or just removing the membrane to reduce the cost of mfcs 67 the low cost ceramic materials have been used to prepare different types of membranes the clayware has been used as a pem and the obtained maximum power density reached up to 16 8 w m 3 the ceramic material enhanced the thickness of biofilm and e transfer rate 68 the coconut shell explored its potential as a pem and exhibited higher water absorption which improve proton movement through water molecules to the cathodic side and enhanced power generation 69 a microalgae assisted mfc inoculated with s platensis was operated without a membrane the highest power density was recorded at 1 64 mw m 2 in the dark phase in comparison to the light phase at 0 132 mw m 2 the membraneless microalgal assisted mfc showed lower power density due to the lack of suitable material for e and proton transfer rate 19 the microalgal assisted mfcs also be operated under membrane less systems or by using low cost separators to enhance the power generation and efficiency of the system the state of the art of microalgal assisted mfc scale up should be focused on suitable membrane configurations or the use of low cost materials as separators selection of suitable strains and replacement of pem other efficient materials depending on the operational system the electrogenic microalgae such as desmodesmus sp and tetradesmus sp have the potential to generate electricity and use less energy via the photosynthetic process the genetic modifications and various molecular biology techniques integrated into omics approaches could be deployed to enhance the electrochemical activity of bacteria and the productivity of microalgae 6 genetic engineering integrated with omics approaches the genetic engineering approaches have been implemented on microbes to make them diverse for biotechnological applications see section 3 the mechanism of genetic engineering includes targeting the key metabolic pathways of microorganisms either by up or down regulation over expression of genes and silencing the key gene to alter the desired metabolite content without interfering with the physiological properties of microorganisms 70 the genetic engineering techniques for genetic modulation can enhance the electroactivity of electrogenic microorganisms and ultimately enhance electricity generation these modulations include mutation or deletion of genes for enhancement of biofilm formation on the electrodes 71 manipulation of genes participated in the qs system 72 genetic engineering or overexpression of genes that are responsible for e shuttle synthesis 73 and knockout of the native global regulators 74 a novel approach for the engineering of bacterial strain pseudomonas aeruginosa p3 a 11 has been deployed to enhance the electrochemical activity with global regulator engineering gre 75 the gre was implemented via error prone pcr mutagenesis and high throughput sequencing and mfc operation was comprised for further evaluation a total of 4 mutants with higher electroactivity were obtained among which the mutant 11 m2 59 showed the highest voltage output 408 mv and exhibited stronger salt tolerance capacity 75 in another study by knockout of gr sigma factor rpos in p aeruginosa pao1 the formation of biofilm on the electrode was improved and electroactive bacterial cells were adapted to the e shuttle the sigma factor has promoted the extracellular e transfer and improved the electricity generation up to 27 3 Î¼a cm 2 74 these strategies of work demonstrated that gre is an effective approach to enhancing the electroactivity and stress tolerance capacity of exoelectrogens 76 such techniques would provide high efficiency for e generation and promote the practical application of mfcs the modulation of a promoter ribosome binding site and engineering of cell surface can enhance the flavins biosynthesis and boost the performance of extracellular e transfer rate 77 the manipulation of pyocyanin derivative produced by p aeruginosa has been performed to improve the eet of electroactive microbes to enhance the efficiency of mfc the overexpression of gene phzm in p aeruginosa and inoculated in mfc showed an enhanced power density up to 166 68 Î¼w cm 2 which was 4 folds increase in comparison with the original strain 73 several genetic engineering approaches have been developed for modifications of electroactive bacteria to enhance electricity generation table 3 the prospects associated with synthetic biology can be useful for commercialization production of bioenergy from biomass and removal of contaminants from wastewater 78 there is limited research conducted on the genetic manipulation of a microalgal cell for wastewater treatment in a study c reinhardtii was used for metal tolerance protein mtp and wastewater treatment over expression of cr mtp4 in c reinhardtii significantly increases cd accumulation and increased tolerance to cd toxicity the microalgae with a single engineering gene do have not that much capability to compete with naturally adapted strains that are likely to be mutagenic and part of oxidative stress tolerance 79 however studies on genetic manipulation of microalgae to enhance biomass productivity and wastewater treatment are limited therefore a strong conclusion regarding the application of synthetic biology in microalgae cannot be reached 6 1 omics approaches the omics strategies such as genomics proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics and lipidomics provide a deep understanding of metabolic responses gene regulation under stress conditions and functions of microalgal cells 80 the omics approaches have been applied to review the efficiency of cyanobacteria such as oscillatoria sp scenedesmus sp and arthrospira sp and microalgal species including c vulgaris and other chlorella sp for wastewater treatment chlorella sorokiniana bd09 c sorokiniana bd08 and chlorella sp showed appropriate stress tolerance capabilities in synthetic wastewater genome sequencing results showed genomic completeness 91 and genome annotation with high confidence gene models predicted 10 240 for bd08 9668 for bd09 and 9821 for dachan 81 these sequenced genomes provide insight into the molecular basis of stress tolerance in microalgal strains for wastewater treatment the stress tolerance of microalgal species provides a fundamental foundation for wastewater treatment in microalgal assisted mfcs the several organelles including plastid genomes and mitochondria have also been sequenced in microalgae for wastewater treatment and recovery of valued added products 64 the use of stress tolerance microalgal species would be more beneficial it can provide a high density of microalgal cells with complete utilization of biomass for biofuel generation several abiotic stress conditions such as an increase in salinity of culture medium phytohormones nutrient repletion depletion temperature increase in light intensity or providing dark light 6 18 cycles and uv radiation would be considered abiotic factors the omics approaches in microalgal cells consider an important role in understanding the metabolic pathways and stress tolerance mechanism in various microalgal species 79 the multi stress environmental conditions and optimization of metabolic pathways with multi omics approaches can be considered an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of microalgal assisted mfcs table 4 in bacteria catabolic and extracellular e transfer pathways have also been studied such as g sulfurreducens pca shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and p aeruginosa these are highly electrochemically active bacteria due to their high adaptability to abiotic stress conditions and different capacities for producing phenazine derivatives to facilitate e transport 82 the use of next generation sequencing ngs has gained huge attention due to the understanding of various genes involved in metabolic responses particularly understanding of microalgal genomes the microalgal genome analysis revealed numerous responsive genes under nitrogen deprivation including 86 annotated as transcription factors which increases the accumulation of natural fats and oils triglycerides 83 the optimization of electroactive microorganisms using metagenomics approaches shotgun sequencing of whole metagenomes will be a suitable strategy to improve the potential of microalgal assisted mfc while for metabarcoding amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes ngss are also useful for marker gene based methods the mrna based sequencing approaches can be deployed to analyze gene expression in electroactive microorganisms although there are very limited studies focusing on the synthetic biology integrated into omics approaches of microalgae for wastewater treatment thus there is still a need for more research on genetic manipulation in microalgal cells to enhance the efficiency of microalgal assisted mfcs additionally transgenesis technologies and genetic modifications improve the characteristics of microalgae and bacteria which could further enhance the potential utilization of these microbes in mfcs fig 4 such spectacular progress in genetic engineering integrated with omics approaches can enhance the understanding of metabolic pathways in novel microalgal assisted mfc biotechnology 7 scenario towards scaling up and economic feasibility of microalgal assisted mfcs the microalgal assisted mfcs technology for power generation from an individual mfc unit is not suitable for many practical applications to enhance the efficiency of mfcs individual mfc units need to be implemented into large scale stacks and vertical cascades 84 the vertical cascades with the volume of 4500 ml are reported to enhance the electricity generation 55 43 wm 3 wastewater treatment cod tn tp removal 72 4 40 5 24 4 respectively and microalgal biomass productivity 465 10 g 3 with high lipidic content 38 17 85 there are various configurations for testing the productivity of microalgal assisted mfcs fig 5 although microalgal assisted mfc is a newly established technology so there are limited studies focused on large scale wastewater treatment till now recently microalgal assisted mfcs operated with polyethylene bags as an mfc chamber 10 l 86 c vulgaris at the cathode were used to provide o2 as an e acceptor and harvested biomass served as a lipid source for biodiesel production the microalgal assisted mfcs were performed for all parameters including microalgae productivity 0 09 kg m 3d 1 energy recovery 11 53 kwm 3 and cost of operation 11 225 86 in terms of large scale production a pilot mes system having a volume of 1500 l was operated outdoor in a municipal wastewater treatment plant this model obtained 91 cod removal and 64 n removal with a power output of 406 wm 3 87 in another study the highest power output of 101 mw m 2 was obtained in an 85 l mfc in batch mode 88 a 90 liter stackable pilot mfc was designed for brewery wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity harvested the produced electricity from mfcs operation was used to drive the overall system 84 the large scale reactors can achieve up to 90 cod removal 89 a study was tested for low cost mfc incorporated with brewery wastewater for almost one year and results revealed 98 cod removal 62 there are numerous studies have been published related to the scale up of mfcs technology to enhance the knowledge in this field table 5 the microalgal assisted mfcs technology is still a developing technique yet hence frequently has not been implemented for large scale production of electricity generation and wastewater treatment 7 1 techno economic feasibility of microalgal assisted mfcs the conventional approaches for wastewater treatment result in the production of waste activated sludge mainly activated sludge disposed of inside the land or treatment plant premises moreover these solutions are not economically feasible 90 the identification of new landfill sites and potential contamination risk to the environment are the major problems associated with conventional methods bes for contaminant removal and wastewater treatment are considered promising biotechnological approaches to producing renewable energy from wastewater microalgal assisted mfcs are the types of bes to produce electricity directly with simultaneous wastewater treatment and provide microalgal biomass for biofuel generation in near future microalgal assisted mfcs will become proficient and cost effective alternatives to treating wastewater the cost of microalgal assisted mfcs includes operational maintenance expenses initial capital investment and material and chemical consumption 91 for catalytic activities of electroactive bacteria graphite granules ggs and granular activated carbon gac are used the ggs are cost effective and provide higher conductivity while gacs have high micro porosity with efficient catalytic activity 92 the average cost of gac or gg electrodes ranges from 500 to 2500 us ton and the average cost of carbon material is 100 000 500 000 us m 2 93 the mfcs can theoretically generate a net normalized energy recovery ner of around 0 004 kw h kg 1 cod based on previously calculated energy balance analysis 91 however the obtained profit from the bes is still under debate because of the high cost and system operation the capital costs of microalgal assisted mfcs are still under debate due to the use of expensive separators that provide artificial light for the growth of microalgal cells the possible solution to replace the expensive membranes is the use of carbon felt as a membrane separator and the same material as an electrode to effectively reduce the overall cost of mfcs scale up for the integrated system the production costs for s obliquus biomass in indoor cultivation using nutrient medium and artificial illumination and finally outdoor cultivation with wastewater nutrients and sunlight were estimated to be 1420 82 and 37 77 39 89 respectively 90 the capital costs of an air cathode mfcs would still reach 3 kg 1 cod even with cheap materials this estimation is based on the mfcs configuration and treatment capability separator 1 m 2 a reactor of 5000 m 3 with a capacity of 25 kg cod m 3 d 1 an anode of 100 m 2 and cathode of 1500 m 2 for the large scale operation of mfcs the raw material cost includes carbon fiber 515 08 carbon fiber brushes 52 5 and titanium ti wire 378 8 for the treatment of electrodes the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe cost 10 of the total spend 170 25 the perforated plate with supporting separator layer and polyurethane sponge accounted for 15 1 of the total cost 205 8 41 16 2 4 respectively 87 there is still a need for further development in the configuration of microalgal assisted mfcs for commercialization replacement of expensive proton exchange membrane with carbon felt would be a possible solution for the commercialization of microalgal assisted mfcs integration of microalgae in mfc provides insightful application for wastewater treatment and easy harvesting of microalgal biomass for biofuel generation near future and ultimately helps to reduce the overall cost of the operational system 7 2 applications of microalgal assisted mfcs the microalgal assisted mfcs have been applied with wastewater for bioelectricity generation under laboratory conditions a wide range of applications can obtain by integrating microalgae with mfcs such as enhanced electricity generation wastewater treatment and harvesting of microalgae for biofuel generation the conventional methods for harvesting microalgae are energy intensive and contribute 30 to 35 of the total cost the use of bacteria with microalgae as synergistic metabolism in mfcs is a convenient way to promote microalgal productivity and further utilization of harvested biomass for biofuel generation this strategy will make the harvesting practice more proficient 90 the mfcs provide recovery of the valuable products and microalgal biomass for the generation of biofuels furthermore applications of microalgal assisted mfc technology in wastewater treatment and microalgal biorefinery integrated with value added products make this technology more feasible and extremely attractive fig 6 thus the cultivation of microalgae in mfcs is considered a profitable approach to enhance electricity generation wastewater treatment and biomass productivity 8 conclusions and future outlook in this review the critical assessment of current scenarios was discussed based on the recent publications 2017 2022 in microalgal assisted mfcs with a strategy of mono culturing and co culturing i e microalgal bacterial symbiosis the results of collected data emphasized that microalgae scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp in mfcs enhanced the power density with 90 pollutant removal cod tn and tp which makes them a potential candidate for microalgal assisted mfcs the recently developed genetic modification strategies with a combination of omics including genomics transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics under stress conditions can enhance the potential of microalgae and bacteria such spectacular progress in genetic engineering integrated with omics approaches would provide an in depth understanding of metabolic pathways the application of genetic engineering approaches to microalgal cells for wastewater treatment is still limited and needs improvement to make microalgal assisted mfc biotechnology more economically feasible herein several future outlooks for microalgal assisted mfcs itemized to achieve a better performance of the system it is vital to conduct further studies for a better understanding of e transfer mechanisms exerted between microalgae and bacteria which contribute to the diverse possibilities of coupling forms of microalgal assisted mfcs the optimization of process parameters in microalgal assisted mfcs for power generation with suitable membrane or membrane configuration needs more research the multi stress environments such as the addition of phytohormones salinity heat stress and light to the microalgae in the cathode chamber can be an effective strategy to enhance the photosynthesis process i e o2 generation of microalgae in mfcs and to obtain the high quality microalgal biofuels from harvested biomass additionally integrated systems such as anaerobic digestion coupled with mfcs should be promoted more to enhance the efficiency of processes credit authorship contribution statement monika sharma visualization investigation data curation

12808,adsorption technology is widely used to remove specific pollutants from wastewater including the very problematic group of phenolic compounds transition metal oxides are the preferred adsorbent for phenol removal this review analyzes the recent advances in the adsorptive removal of phenol using transition metal oxides here we review the synthesis and characterization of transition metal oxides with a particular focus on the effects of the synthesis method on the surface functionality and structural and textural properties of transition metal oxides moreover the effects of the adsorption parameters i e solution s ph and phenol s concentration on the adsorption process are discussed finally an in depth analysis of the adsorption kinetics and the mechanism is provided graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption phenol transition metal oxide adsorption kinetics adsorption mechanism data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 dangerous effects of phenol and methods of treatment of phenol water is one of the most precious natural resources available on our planet all life depends on it and it covers over two thirds of the earth s surface with a volume of about 1 4 billion km3 1 whereas its distribution on the earth s surface is highly unequal 97 of water resides in oceans and only 3 of this surface water is fresh almost 69 of this 3 of freshwater is locked up in glaciers and ice caps most of the remainder is groundwater which could be of difficult access for human use 1 of the world s fresh water is accessible for human use and is located in lakes rivers and swamps 2 humans should be aware of the tiny quantity of potable water accessible for their needs by discharging many toxic compounds from this potable water in this context the protection of natural water resources and the development of new technologies for water remediation have become significant challenges and critical environmental concerns of the 21st century 3 4 it is essential to remove organic and inorganic micropollutants from industrial effluents before their discharge into water bodies the biological and physicochemical treatment methods 5 such as flocculation activated sludge processes ozonation membrane filtration and advanced oxidative process are the most used ones to remove these pollutants however some of these treatment methods can t remove these micropollutants ultimately require expensive equipment and can generate secondary pollution fortunately adsorption is an attractive technique widely used for wastewater management due to its exceptional features such as ecofriendly cost effectiveness economic feasibility simplicity flexibility and high efficiency towards an extensive range of water pollutants 6 7 first the adsorption method was considered effective for isolating a wide range of dyes from industrial wastewater in addition in this technique pollutants are adsorbed to nanoparticles and after reaching equilibrium these nanoparticles could be separated or removed from the water until now various types of natural and synthetic adsorbents including activated carbon agricultural residues clay zeolite transition metal oxides etc have been tested for the discharge of pollutants from wastewater 8 13 however based on its drawbacks mainly their low adsorption capacity and regeneration rate nanostructured materials have emerged as the best adsorbents used for environmental remediation by offering higher adsorption capacities and having better binding affinities 14 15 nanomaterials based photocatalysts and absorbents have recently attracted tremendous attention in water remediation and wastewater treatment purification this is mainly due to their unique characteristics such as small size large specific surface area 16 high degree of functionalization via surface modification 17 and high reactivity therefore interesting research was carried out on synthesizing mesoporous photocatalysts and adsorbents mesoporous materials are generally functionalized to improve their activity selectivity and stability in addition mesoporous materials based adsorbents such as fe2o3 zno tio2 and nio are functionalized for the adsorption of metal ions and organic pollutants 8 9 12 13 phenol c6h5oh is derived from the aromatic hydrocarbons by replacing a hydrogen atom in the cycle with a hydroxyl group oh it is also known as hydroxyl benzene or phenic acid 16 the hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon of the aromatic cycle has sufficiently different properties than those of the same grouping attached to an aliphatic carbon phenolic compounds define a set of substances called tannin aromatic compounds coming from plants and are often very odoriferous constituents such as vanillin thymol eugenol and phenol 18 phenol is solid at ordinary temperature it is present as a crystalline mass of a colorless needle hygroscopic and has a particular odor while acrid and sweet acrid phenol is soluble in organic solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons alcohols ketones ethers acids and halogenated hydrocarbons it is partially soluble in water and becomes fully soluble in water above 68 c 17 19 phenol crystals melt more or less faster they are less volatile than the corresponding compounds are without hydroxyl groups in arenes and homologs phenols are colorless but they quickly become colored through air oxidation in that case the phenol c6h5oh becomes pink then red brown 20 phenolic compounds are more acidic than alcohol due to the electronic resonance a phenolate ion is more stable than an alkoxide ion indeed when the proton of the hydroxyl group was completely deprotonated the electron pair was shared between four carbons thus the charge was delocalized on many carbon atoms the ion is much more stable than on alkoxide where the negative amount would be too significant and would be left the appropriate proton immediately instead however this acidity is relatively weak presenting the phenolate ion as a conjugate base the pka of benzophenone is 10 which shows its acidic character it is less marked than that of acetic acid with a value of pka equal to 4 7 and much more marked than that of ethanol with a pka of 18 phenols are aromatic organic compounds of great environmental importance and their measurement has increased in recent years due to their toxicity phenolic compounds are usually derived from various manufacturing processes such as pharmaceuticals petroleum refineries coking plants and phenolic resin plants 21 25 they have an unpleasant odor and taste and are toxic to aquatic organisms plants and humans at a concentration of 5 Î¼g l 1 4 long term ingestion of phenols at concentrations between 10 and 240 mg l 1 can cause oral irritation blurred vision and diarrhea 5 therefore they are considered one of the priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency 26 the maximum allowable phenol concentration in drinking water is 1 Î¼g l 1 world health organization 21 therefore various studies have been conducted to remove phenolic compounds prior to their release into the receiving environment 9 11 13 several treatment methods are widely used to remove organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater these treatment methods are classified into biological chemical and physical methods various water treatment procedures are made by a combination of two or more methods of treatment to achieve a minimum content of the pollutant present in the wastewater these processes could be divided into primary secondary and tertiary wastewater treatments more stringent wastewater treatment includes the removal of specific pollutants and the control of nutrients natural systems are also used for wastewater treatment in land based applications for example a variety treated the sludge resulting from water contaminated with phenol treatment to decrease the organic matter and the volume of liquid making the sludge appropriate for final disposal biological wastewater treatment is generally the most economical alternative to other physical and chemical processes biodegradation methods such as fungal decolonization microbial degradation microbial biomass adsorption living or dead and bioremediation systems are generally used in industrial wastewater treatment because many microorganisms such as bacteria yeast algae and fungi can accumulate and decompose the polluting things however due to technical limitations their applications are often limited biological treatment requires a large land area and is limited by sensitivity to diurnal changes the toxicity of some chemicals and low flexibility in design and operation 27 30 current conventional biodegradation methods did not achieve satisfactory phenol removal through biological treatment in addition although many organic molecules are degraded many other molecules are tenacious due to their complex chemical structures and synthetic organic sources due to its high cost and problems with suitable disposal different conventional wastewater treatment methods have not been successfully utilized in the paper petroleum and textile industries 31 chemical methods include coagulation or flocculation combined with flotation and filtration fe ii ca oh 2 precipitation flocculation electroflotation electrochemical processes electrokinetic coagulation conventional oxidant ozone and radiation these chemical methods are usually dispendious in spite of phenols being removed the accumulation of concentrated sludge generates problems of disposal it is also possible to generate a secondary pollution problem due to the use of chemicals in excess recently advanced oxidation processes aops which rely on generating hydroxyl radicals which are powerful oxidizing species have been successfully utilized to degrade organic pollutants although these aops methods effectively treat waters contaminated with contaminants they are expensive and not commercially attractive 32 33 different physical treatment methods such as membrane filtration processes electrodialysis reverse osmosis nanofiltration etc are also widely employed the main disadvantage of membrane processes is their limited lifetime before the occurrence of membrane fouling therefore the cost of constant membrane replacement should be considered in the economic feasibility analysis at present there is no single process capable of adequate treatment mainly due to the complex nature of effluents loaded with organic and inorganic matter in practice a cheaper more efficient and simple treatment method is the most wanted method a literature survey shows that liquid phase adsorption is the most popular method for removing wastewater pollutants it is a widely used method to improve the degradation and recovery of phenols and to reduce sludge production 34 35 adsorption is an economically attractive method for treating wastewater because it is possible to employ low cost adsorbents in wastewater treatment in addition adsorption is a physicochemical equilibrium separation process that is highly effective for water treatment we are interested in the control of water pollution caused by phenolic discharges using metal oxide adsorbents on the one hand we developed a bibliographic study on the preparation techniques of the well known transition metal oxides more we showed the effect of the choice of methods not only on their structural textural and catalytic properties but also on their adsorption capacity of phenols we discussed also kinetic models of phenol adsorption in aqueous solution into metal oxides this is mainly due to the fact that several researches are progressing in the field of nanotechnology and find better combinations of nanoparticles that can definitely solve the complications of metal removal from water 2 synthesis techniques of transition metal oxides there are several techniques for the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles some of these approaches are particularly interested in synthesizing a stable form of nanomaterials under normal conditions each method affects the prepared metal oxide nanomaterial s structural and textural properties the most popular methods are classified into dry synthesis and wet synthesis in this work we are only interested in wet techniques which are simple fast and less expensive wet methods are mainly mentioned in the literature firstly the sol gel method corresponds to the process of transformation from a liquid system called sol to a colloidal state called gel the sol corresponds to the dispersion of an organometallic precursor or a salt in an organic solvent alcohol methanol ethanol etc the passage from sol to gel was carried out first by a series of hydrolysis reactions and inorganic polymerization to form a colloidal suspension and a second time by the process of aging finally the solid state is obtained by drying and calcination of the gel 8 36 secondly the microemulsion method allows the formation of micro reactors reverse micelles by dispersing a polar reaction medium water alcohol within an apolar phase oil n alkane the stabilization of the microemulsion was ensured by a surfactant which allows forming a barrier between these phases the size and shape of the particles depend mainly on the proportions of the dispersed phase and the surfactant in the continuous phase thirdly the precipitation method which yields to the formation of a solid phase from a liquid solution it is a rapid process consisting of adding an agent making the product insoluble or modifying the ph of the solution several parameters influence the preparation reaction of the metal oxides such as the temperature the ph the nature of the precursors and the solvent and the concentrations of the reagents however the most significant parameters is the ph and the ratio of h2o m 37 39 in fact an acid ph accelerates the hydrolysis and slows down the condensation contrary to the basic ph thus a strong rate of hydrolysis was reached with an acid ph which supports the growth of the networks and leads to a polymeric solution under acid catalysis a low rate of hydrolysis yielded with basic ph and favors the nucleation and leads to the formation of a colloidal solution and a controllable sized of the pores the formed gel is called colloidal gel and has a large pore structure consisted of clusters the temperature also has a certain importance on the kinetic control of the hydrolysis condensation reactions which get accelerated when the temperature increases 39 42 the influence of the h2o m ratio was considered among the most important parameters for the control of sol gel reactions the molar ratio between the added water and the precursor is logically the most important factor in hydrolytic sol gel processes the quantity of water and the way it is introduced is therefore a key element of the reaction it is easy to understand that on a very reactive precursor the sudden addition of water in large quantity will immediately generate undesirable precipitates and conversely an addition of water in too small quantity will not allow the hydrolysis of the whole precursor this is therefore also dependent on the reactivity of the starting precursor 42 45 finally the hydrothermal method was based on reactions that occur in the presence of an equilibrium between liquid water and vapor under high temperature t 100 c and pressure p 1 bar this allows the crystallization of ceramic materials with too slow a crystallization rate under standard conditions or to precipitate phases that are not stable under these conditions in addition it is a proven process for preparing tiny metal oxide particles smaller than 100 nm 9 12 18 literaturally speaking dry methods including ceramic and reactive milling methods 46 are the most classical preparation methods they weren t widely used in the industry in these methods the mixture was heated to very high calcination temperatures 1100 c to 1400 c for relatively long periods and require a lot of energy in order to allow the interdiffusion of ions inside the solid and to get an homogeneous body in fact the resulted particles are large and the specific area was very low it is well known that the specific surface plays an important role in the adsorption and removal of organic pollutants the ceramic method was often used when the specific surface of the prepared materials is not a crucial parameter this method consists in calcining the required quantities of the previously mixed oxide precursors at a temperature allowing the crystallization of the hexaaluminate phase 47 also reactive milling is a solid state synthesis method its based on applying intense mechanical shocks to a solid in order to produce a large variety of materials at the nanometric scale different types of materials have been successfully produced by reactive milling such as amorphous alloys metastable solid solutions metallic compounds and more recently nanocrystalline mixed oxides 48 the disadvantages of this process are the amount of energy required for thermal treatment at high temperatures over a long period of time as well as the poor resulted structural and textural properties by obtaining amorphous crystallinity and low specific surface are several works have been devoted to reporting the effect of the synthesis method choice on the structural textural properties catalytic and adsorptive properties of the prepared transition metal oxides ikram 49 has prepared zno nanoparticles by precipitation and sol gel methods they found that the preparation method choice strongly influenced the crystal structure size and morphology and efficiency from 90 to 99 of synthesized nanoparticles fig 1 reproduced with permission from 49 copyright 2017 acadÃ©mie des sciences paris thus the zno nanoparticles prepared by the sol gel method are more effective than those prepared by the precipitation method also vanessa et al 14 reported that adsorbents prepared using the co precipitation method have higher basicity than those designed by the sol gel process this increased basicity of the co precipitated catalysts mgal type oxide yields a higher activity still it is limited by the supposed formation of carbonates during the oxidation reaction of acetic acid fig 2 reproduced with permission from 14 copyright 2017 acadÃ©mie des sciences paris moreover the abderrahim research team 15 has studied the physicochemical properties of zno and tio2 oxides they concluded that the preparation method type strongly influences its physiochemical properties for example the catalytic activity is better for the oxides prepared by the sol gel method the research teams of xia 50 yang 17 wang 19 sabbatini 20 and g horanyi 51 have developed a comparison between physicochemical properties of iron oxide synthesized by the precipitation method they reported the significant resulting variation in structural and textural properties of iron oxide nanoparticles they ascribed this result to the used preparation method and other factors such as the reaction s precipitating agent precursors temperature and ph saleh 52 behnajady 53 and khaleed s research groups 54 have elaborated nickel oxide nanoparticles by different methods they deduced that the structural and textural properties of the metal oxide were influenced by the chosen synthesis method they deduced that the structural and textural properties of the oxide were influenced by the chosen synthesis method saleh and all 52 found an average particle diameter of 54 nm which was synthesized by the precipitation method with the following conditions nicl2 6h2o washing with distilled water and methanol drying in an oven at 90 c for 5 h calcination at 300 c for 6 h whereas behnajady and all 53 found an average size of 15 nm with a specific surface of 71 09 m2 g 1 with the same preparation method but under different conditions ni no3 2 6h2o washing with distilled water drying in an oven at 75 c for 20 h calcination at 300 c for 2 h finally khaleed and all 54 obtained 13 nm for the average particle size and a value of 32 95 m2 g 1 for its specific surface area for nickel oxide nanoparticles that were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal reflux process thus all these works highlight the importance of the synthesis method chosen for transition metal oxide materials as it has a crucial impact on its physicochemical properties 3 adsorption of phenol by oxides and critical kinetics transition metal oxides are generally derived from metal precursors in acetate chloride nitrate or sulfate forms they could be prepared by several methods such as precipitation sol gel and solid route the adsorption capacity of each metal oxide material depends on the chemical nature of the precursors the precipitating agent the temperature and the type of the synthesis process 55 56 several research groups are interested in using transition metal oxides to degrade phenol margaret 57 have reported a phenol degradation efficiency rate close to 85 using zinc oxide based adsorbent in the aqueous medium cherepivska 58 evaluated phenol photodegradation s specific activity using metal oxides their specific activity could be classified as follows Î± fe2o3 wo3 zno tio2 p25 tio2 phan 59 have reported the enhanced adsorption capacity of lafeo3 which leads to an increase in its catalytic activity and reaching a removal efficiency close to 94 with the use of 20 mg l 1 phenol 1 0 g l 1 of catalyst and 10 mm of h2o2 at a ph value of 5 despite the important reported results the disadvantages of photodegradation remain major in terms of its high energy consumption leading to increased treatment cost reusability and secondary byproducts of the reaction these drawbacks push researchers to treat phenol with adsorption as a recovery method of pollutants in aquatic systems the adsorption of phenols and their derivatives on various transition metal oxides have been extensively explored bekkouche 4 have studied adsorption isotherms for phenol from aqueous solutions on titanium dioxide in this work the adsorption capacity of phenol on metal oxide was 15 mg g the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 1 h and the adsorption kinetics originated from chemisorption in a monolayer and obeyed the langmuir model also the experimental survey has shown that there was an advantage to operating at high agitation speed and natural ph ultrasonic agitation results in a slight increase in the 5 amount of adsorbed phenol this agitation mode reduces the agglomeration phenomenon of the titanium oxide particles and thus increases the interfacial surface area adsorbent an 60 have synthesized sio2 based metal oxide adsorbent and tested its response to phenol treatment the obtained results show that this material has a strong adsorption capacity for phenol through hydrogen bonding main force action and electrostatic interaction the adsorption capacity of this solid depends significantly on the solution ph value compared to acid and base solutions the highest adsorption capacity was obtained in the neutral solution the adsorption kinetics of phenol by other prepared silica based materials were studied by an 61 they have concluded that pmaa sio2 has a very high adsorption capacity for phenol through the interaction of hydrogen bonds and the adsorption mechanism was satisfactorily explained with the introduction of hydrogen bonding in addition the adsorption capacity of pmaa sio2 for phenol is primarily related to both ph and temperature of the solution as much as both ph and temperature values were lower as much as the adsorption amount of phenol was higher this adsorption rate could reach 162 88 mg g 1 at a temperature of 293 k and a ph value of 6 this study shows that pmaa sio2 based adsorbent could remove acidic wastewater containing phenol in addition pmaa sio2 has an excellent reusability rate also the well detailed study developed by turki s research group 62 reported the preparation of anisotropic tio2 nanomaterials with different morphologies such as nanotubes nano tiles nanosheets nanospheres and nanoparticles then they evaluated its structural and textural properties adsorption rate and photocatalytic degradation of phenol under uv conditions this work shows that the kinetic study of phenol adsorption fits well to a quasi second order approach while the adsorption isotherms of phenol obey to langmuir model murcia and co workers 63 have studied the adsorption capacity of phenol and methyl orange on the surface of tio2 and pt tio2 based photocatalysts it was found that platinum plays an essential role in the phenol adsorption on the surface of tio2 the deposition of platinum onto tio2 64 has resulted in a modification in the phenol adsorbent interaction by providing new adsorption sites on the tio2 surface in this case phenol interacts primarily via the formation of adsorbed phenolate species the authors claimed phenol adsorption on tio2 and pt tio2 based adsorbents was mainly monitored by the formation of bidentate phenolate species istratie and collaborators 65 synthesized magnetic carbon nanocomposites containing fe3o4 using a simple solvothermal method the magnetic nanocomposites were utilized as adsorbents to remove phenol ph and dimethyl orange mo from aqueous effluents in this way a parametric study of the adsorbent dose ph contact time and initial pollutant concentration was performed it significantly increased the removal efficiency both for ph and mo adsorbates for adsorbents presenting higher carbon contents in addition the magnetic nanocomposites presented a higher capacity of adsorption towards mo uptake than ph due to the difficulty of removing this pollutant in aquatic environments it is worth noting the importance of researching more efficient adsorbents to eliminate phenols from marine systems there is a consensus on the sorption kinetics of mo and phenol which the pseudo second order model well described these kinetic results put a question of ambiguity on the role of saturation plateau in determining the kinetic model of adsorption several works have followed a pseudo first order model 66 69 the adsorption model was changed in the first minutes but after waiting for saturation plateau particularly in istratie study 65 four isothermal models have been studied langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and sips the langmuir isotherm for mo and phenol adsorption has been described in the equilibrium data on synthesizing adsorbents in single component adsorption another object in the study of the adsorption of phenol on titania and alumina in work patterson s group 70 has studied phenol adsorption on metal oxide powders by electron paramagnetic resonance epr this study reveals the formation of environmentally persistent free radicals epfr from phenol on alumina and titania using both powder and single crystal samples sridar and his co workers 51 have elaborated zinc oxide zno nanoparticles by wet chemical route they tested the synthesized zno nanoparticles to discharge phenol from synthetic and industrial wastewater in this published work the researchers show the influence of initial ph zno dosage contact time initial phenol concentration on the percentage of phenol removal it was noted that the langmuir isotherm fits well with phenol removal data compared to other isotherms and kinetic studies it was consequently deduced that the sorption follows the pseudo first order dong 71 prepared an iron oxide nanocomposite with biochar feybc this material was synthesized through a one step method using a solution of fecl3 and pomelo peel extract the iron oxide composite was utilized as an adsorbent for phenol and cr vi uptake from waters and the adsorbent exhibited a suitable adsorption capacity for both species phenol and cr vi sorption capacities were 16 37 and 18 63 mg g 1 respectively the possible proposed removal mechanisms could involve ion exchange and surface complexation and reduction for cr vi removal at one hand on the other hand electron donor acceptor complex and Ï€ Ï€ stacking were proposed for phenol uptake asmaly 72 have studied the phenol uptake from aqueous solution using aluminum oxide impregnated fly ash fa al2o3 a parametric adsorption study was carried out in this study by evaluating the effects of adsorption parameters such as stirring speed initial concentration initial ph adsorbent dosage contact time on phenol removal the results show that these mentioned parameters influenced the phenol uptake by fa al2o3 the best conditions were ph 7 200 rpm the adsorbent mass of 200 mg contact time of 2 h and 2 mgl 1 of initial phenol concentration in addition the authors concluded that the improvement in adsorption efficiency of fa al2o3 over fa could be assigned to an increase in specific surface area which was 11 9 m2 g for fa al2o3 and 7 1 m2 g for fa the ability of fe based oxides to adsorb phenol from dilute aqueous solution and in vapor state using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to evaluate the type of formed complex surface was reported by mcbride 73 the authors conclude that the adsorption from the solution was low at a ph of 5 5 the adsorption rate was inversely proportional to the pka of the phenols and the more acidic phenols adsorbed most strongly from the solution ftir spectra revealed that adsorption on goethite and amorphous fe oxide in the vapor state tended to disrupt the vibrational bands sensitive to the phenolic oh group depending on the level of adsorption both physically and chemically adsorbed phenols could be detected by ftir with chemisorption being more evident on iron oxide safwat 74 have investigated the ability of aluminum oxide and zinc oxide to remove phenol from wastewater by adsorption and compared their performances with titanium dioxide the highest removal efficiencies for aluminum oxide zinc oxide and titanium dioxide were 14 7 12 2 and 33 5 respectively equilibrium studies demonstrated the possibility of freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherms fitting the adsorption isotherms for aluminum oxide zinc oxide and titanium dioxide based adsorbents respectively titanium dioxide was the best candidate for phenol adsorption among the three adsorbents feng and his collaborators 75 show that sio2 zno supported adsorbents zsm 5 and mcm 22 exhibit significant capacity in phenol removal the solute transfer is generally characterized by external mass transfer boundary layer diffusion intra particle distribution for a solid liquid adsorption process the following three consecutive steps can describe the adsorption dynamics external diffusion of the liquid phase to the external surface of the adsorbent liquid phase extern liquid film transport of the adsorbent inside the pores by internal diffusion intraparticle diffusion adsorption on the active sites of the adsorbent on the internal surface of the pores 4 adsorption the adsorption rate is controlled by the slowest step i e the one which is kinetically determinant different adsorption kinetic models were employed for adsorption including pseudo first order pseudo second order the external diffusion model and the intraparticle diffusion model which are presented in eqs 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 1 dq dt k 1 q e q t 2 dq dt k 1 q e q t 2 3 d c t dt k a v c t c e 4 q t k id t 1 2 most of the reported phenol adsorption kinetics fit well with a pseudo second order model that he whether adsorbent and adsorbate and described by the pseudo second order model in few published works several researchers have explained this ambiguity by the effect of saturation plateau data on the fit of experimental data the choice of a linear or nonlinear model or the accumulation of errors ighalo s research group 76 has focused their interest on investigating the effect of pore size of zno and tio2 on the adsorption kinetics of methylene blue mb they adopted a new methodology by summarising empirical research results and analyzing them side by side for observations it was seen that as much as the pore diameter grows from mesopores to macropores the constant kinetic increases however for micropores the mb adsorption was significantly slower the decrease in the kinetic constant with micropores was due to the restricted diffusion of mb through microscopic pores of the adsorbate the mesopore range is the most preferred pore size for mb adsorption kinetics the pseudo second order pso model was the best model for all situations the pso is superior thanks to its capturing of active sites and considers the rate limiting step s phenol adsorption since the pore volume and specific surface area are limited the small magnitude of these characteristics resulted in total adsorption timeless than the constant rate constant lima and his research group 77 have emphasized that researchers avoid using linear models instead they have encouraged using the software by performing nonlinear fitting methods to obtain accurate physical parameters results they published that r2 and r2 adj of the linearized pso kinetic model are always close to 1 00 both implementations have significant adverse effects and lead users to draw wrong conclusions because the k2 value of the linear equation does not match the k2 value obtained by the nonlinear fit lima s staff uses linearized kinetic equations for all 225 kinetic experiments 100 r2 and r2 of the pseudo second order linear model to better fit the pseudo first order linear model however 122 of the 225 kinetic experiments 54 22 indicated that the best kinetic model is the pseudo first order model when nonlinear methods are used they concluded that the inefficient use of linearized phenomenological equations could lead to incorrect expression of the obtained physical parameters bujdÃ¡k and his group 78 are interested in the critical study of the adsorption kinetics of chemicals on clays and related materials it has been concluded that adsorption was governed by the so called pseudo second order pso mechanism the conclusions are mainly derived from the regression analysis of adsorption data using the simplified linearized form of the model the extensive analysis in bujdÃ¡k s 78 shows the inadequacy of the linearized function to assess the quality of the pso model for adsorption data this work exhibits more accurate ways to test adsorption data using original nonlinear models the results significantly impact the re evaluation of published interpretations of adsorption kinetics for clay based systems moreover simonin s research team 79 has claimed that it is not logical to use data close to or at equilibrium to determine the best kinetic formula however this approach only presents relevant results if linearization is considered when the nonlinear fitting is utilized every kinetics point is vital to establish adsorption kinetics revellame 80 have considered the pseudo second order a superior model representing many adsorption systems they have concluded that a critical evaluation of modeling techniques and practices indicates that its superiority may result from currently acceptable modeling standards which tend to support pseudo second order models in addition the discrepancies are caused by several modeling flaws that are often overlooked also commonly used model checking tools are generally utilized randomly and redundantly as a result they cannot provide sufficient certainty about the model s validity revellame et al 80 have proposed a new validation method to re examine previously published adsorption kinetics data to eliminate modeling bias in this way rodrigues 81 discussed using the pseudo first order kinetic allowing to lagergreen model they compared it with the linear kinetic model of glueckauf to obtain a linear adsorption equilibrium isotherm they revealed the relationship between the kinetic constants of both models which can show the temperature dependency regardless of the porous structure of the adsorbing particles so precautions should be taken when using abbreviated methods for pseudo first order expressions several mechanisms such as hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction could be involved in the adsorption of phenol 82 based on the nature of the interactions which hold the adsorbate to the surface of the adsorbent adsorption can be classified into two families 83 the first one is the physical adsorption or physisorption which involves weak van der waals force type bonds between the adsorbed chemical species and the adsorbent these bonds are similar to those involved in liquefaction however it occurs well before the gas reaches a pressure equal to its saturation vapour pressure at low temperatures close to the boiling point of the adsorbed phase it is generally reversible and the equilibrium was obtained when the adsorption and desorption rates are equal physical adsorption is favored by a decrease in temperature the second one is the chemical adsorption or chemisorption which involves significant binding energies such as covalent ionic or metallic bonds between the adsorbed chemical species and the adsorbent it is accompanied by a deep modification of the electronic charge distribution of the adsorbed molecules it is often irreversible or hardly reversible since it requires the formation of high energy and short distance interactions chemisorption yields the formation of a monomolecular layer three models have been proposed to interpret the mechanism of phenol adsorption on carbon 84 including the electron donor acceptor complex chemical adsorption Ï€ Ï€ dispersion interactions physical adsorption and solvent effects chemical adsorption the important noticed point in all the published works was the ambiguity in the mechanism that explains the adsorption phenomenon 85 in fact the phenomenon of adsorption involves different types of interactions at the solid liquid interface 22 86 89 which could be van der wales forces which is a dipole dipole attraction occurring between atoms or molecules due to weak electrical perturbations columbian forces which are electrostatic forces resulted between a charged surface and an oppositely charged species the surface charge can be the consequence of an isomorphic substitution or a protonation or deprotonation of the surface functional groups under the effect of the ph this kind of force exists essentially in the case of adsorption of inorganic ions and ionized organic molecules hydrogen bonds which are intermolecular bonds that occur between a hydrogen atom and an electronegatif atom hydrophobic interactions which are of major interest for non polar molecules the exact nature of the adsorption by this type of interaction remains unclear there are some researchers groups who propose that polar molecules occupy the hydrophobic sites of the surface without any competition with the water molecules others think that it is a simple participation the polar molecules tend to diffuse from the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic sites of the adsorbent surface many others are based on the crystal structure of transition metal oxides to further study the phenol adsorption mechanism using theoretical studies either by dft ab initio and monte carlo or advanced statistical physics 6 90 96 4 the comparison of phenol adsorption on transition metal oxides and other adsorbents the most important criteria influencing the use of an adsorbent are efficiency and cost for that reason a comparison of the adsorption capacity of phenol between synthesized and commercial oxides and other adsorbents has been conducted in this way table 1 lists the adsorption capacity for phenol discharge by commercial oxides and some adsorbents previously reported in the literature the reported data show that the maximum phenol adsorption of the synthesized oxides including other adsorbents is much higher than the commercial oxides and some other adsorbents furthermore iron oxide exhibits a higher capacity than the other two prepared oxides nio and zno this suggests its potential use for the practical removal of phenol from wastewaters 5 conclusion this work reviews different unconventional adsorbents for removing phenolic compounds from water cost effective available and more efficient adsorbent materials could be used as the best alternatives for removing phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions instead of commercial activated carbon adsorption has undoubtedly more advantages than other methods such as photodegradation to remove organic pollutants from wastewater several works show the effect of the synthesis method on the structural and textural properties of the prepared materials and the adsorption and removal capacity of the pollutants in particular we are interested in discussing the adsorption kinetics and its fitting models in this work despite the critical analysis of kinetic models the method of use and the form of the used model the kinetics results in all reported outcomes have an ambiguity that needs to be resolved further work will be required to predict the adsorption mechanism and type of adsorption to confirm the results of the adsorption kinetics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the reported work in this paper 
12808,adsorption technology is widely used to remove specific pollutants from wastewater including the very problematic group of phenolic compounds transition metal oxides are the preferred adsorbent for phenol removal this review analyzes the recent advances in the adsorptive removal of phenol using transition metal oxides here we review the synthesis and characterization of transition metal oxides with a particular focus on the effects of the synthesis method on the surface functionality and structural and textural properties of transition metal oxides moreover the effects of the adsorption parameters i e solution s ph and phenol s concentration on the adsorption process are discussed finally an in depth analysis of the adsorption kinetics and the mechanism is provided graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption phenol transition metal oxide adsorption kinetics adsorption mechanism data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 dangerous effects of phenol and methods of treatment of phenol water is one of the most precious natural resources available on our planet all life depends on it and it covers over two thirds of the earth s surface with a volume of about 1 4 billion km3 1 whereas its distribution on the earth s surface is highly unequal 97 of water resides in oceans and only 3 of this surface water is fresh almost 69 of this 3 of freshwater is locked up in glaciers and ice caps most of the remainder is groundwater which could be of difficult access for human use 1 of the world s fresh water is accessible for human use and is located in lakes rivers and swamps 2 humans should be aware of the tiny quantity of potable water accessible for their needs by discharging many toxic compounds from this potable water in this context the protection of natural water resources and the development of new technologies for water remediation have become significant challenges and critical environmental concerns of the 21st century 3 4 it is essential to remove organic and inorganic micropollutants from industrial effluents before their discharge into water bodies the biological and physicochemical treatment methods 5 such as flocculation activated sludge processes ozonation membrane filtration and advanced oxidative process are the most used ones to remove these pollutants however some of these treatment methods can t remove these micropollutants ultimately require expensive equipment and can generate secondary pollution fortunately adsorption is an attractive technique widely used for wastewater management due to its exceptional features such as ecofriendly cost effectiveness economic feasibility simplicity flexibility and high efficiency towards an extensive range of water pollutants 6 7 first the adsorption method was considered effective for isolating a wide range of dyes from industrial wastewater in addition in this technique pollutants are adsorbed to nanoparticles and after reaching equilibrium these nanoparticles could be separated or removed from the water until now various types of natural and synthetic adsorbents including activated carbon agricultural residues clay zeolite transition metal oxides etc have been tested for the discharge of pollutants from wastewater 8 13 however based on its drawbacks mainly their low adsorption capacity and regeneration rate nanostructured materials have emerged as the best adsorbents used for environmental remediation by offering higher adsorption capacities and having better binding affinities 14 15 nanomaterials based photocatalysts and absorbents have recently attracted tremendous attention in water remediation and wastewater treatment purification this is mainly due to their unique characteristics such as small size large specific surface area 16 high degree of functionalization via surface modification 17 and high reactivity therefore interesting research was carried out on synthesizing mesoporous photocatalysts and adsorbents mesoporous materials are generally functionalized to improve their activity selectivity and stability in addition mesoporous materials based adsorbents such as fe2o3 zno tio2 and nio are functionalized for the adsorption of metal ions and organic pollutants 8 9 12 13 phenol c6h5oh is derived from the aromatic hydrocarbons by replacing a hydrogen atom in the cycle with a hydroxyl group oh it is also known as hydroxyl benzene or phenic acid 16 the hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon of the aromatic cycle has sufficiently different properties than those of the same grouping attached to an aliphatic carbon phenolic compounds define a set of substances called tannin aromatic compounds coming from plants and are often very odoriferous constituents such as vanillin thymol eugenol and phenol 18 phenol is solid at ordinary temperature it is present as a crystalline mass of a colorless needle hygroscopic and has a particular odor while acrid and sweet acrid phenol is soluble in organic solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons alcohols ketones ethers acids and halogenated hydrocarbons it is partially soluble in water and becomes fully soluble in water above 68 c 17 19 phenol crystals melt more or less faster they are less volatile than the corresponding compounds are without hydroxyl groups in arenes and homologs phenols are colorless but they quickly become colored through air oxidation in that case the phenol c6h5oh becomes pink then red brown 20 phenolic compounds are more acidic than alcohol due to the electronic resonance a phenolate ion is more stable than an alkoxide ion indeed when the proton of the hydroxyl group was completely deprotonated the electron pair was shared between four carbons thus the charge was delocalized on many carbon atoms the ion is much more stable than on alkoxide where the negative amount would be too significant and would be left the appropriate proton immediately instead however this acidity is relatively weak presenting the phenolate ion as a conjugate base the pka of benzophenone is 10 which shows its acidic character it is less marked than that of acetic acid with a value of pka equal to 4 7 and much more marked than that of ethanol with a pka of 18 phenols are aromatic organic compounds of great environmental importance and their measurement has increased in recent years due to their toxicity phenolic compounds are usually derived from various manufacturing processes such as pharmaceuticals petroleum refineries coking plants and phenolic resin plants 21 25 they have an unpleasant odor and taste and are toxic to aquatic organisms plants and humans at a concentration of 5 Î¼g l 1 4 long term ingestion of phenols at concentrations between 10 and 240 mg l 1 can cause oral irritation blurred vision and diarrhea 5 therefore they are considered one of the priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency 26 the maximum allowable phenol concentration in drinking water is 1 Î¼g l 1 world health organization 21 therefore various studies have been conducted to remove phenolic compounds prior to their release into the receiving environment 9 11 13 several treatment methods are widely used to remove organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater these treatment methods are classified into biological chemical and physical methods various water treatment procedures are made by a combination of two or more methods of treatment to achieve a minimum content of the pollutant present in the wastewater these processes could be divided into primary secondary and tertiary wastewater treatments more stringent wastewater treatment includes the removal of specific pollutants and the control of nutrients natural systems are also used for wastewater treatment in land based applications for example a variety treated the sludge resulting from water contaminated with phenol treatment to decrease the organic matter and the volume of liquid making the sludge appropriate for final disposal biological wastewater treatment is generally the most economical alternative to other physical and chemical processes biodegradation methods such as fungal decolonization microbial degradation microbial biomass adsorption living or dead and bioremediation systems are generally used in industrial wastewater treatment because many microorganisms such as bacteria yeast algae and fungi can accumulate and decompose the polluting things however due to technical limitations their applications are often limited biological treatment requires a large land area and is limited by sensitivity to diurnal changes the toxicity of some chemicals and low flexibility in design and operation 27 30 current conventional biodegradation methods did not achieve satisfactory phenol removal through biological treatment in addition although many organic molecules are degraded many other molecules are tenacious due to their complex chemical structures and synthetic organic sources due to its high cost and problems with suitable disposal different conventional wastewater treatment methods have not been successfully utilized in the paper petroleum and textile industries 31 chemical methods include coagulation or flocculation combined with flotation and filtration fe ii ca oh 2 precipitation flocculation electroflotation electrochemical processes electrokinetic coagulation conventional oxidant ozone and radiation these chemical methods are usually dispendious in spite of phenols being removed the accumulation of concentrated sludge generates problems of disposal it is also possible to generate a secondary pollution problem due to the use of chemicals in excess recently advanced oxidation processes aops which rely on generating hydroxyl radicals which are powerful oxidizing species have been successfully utilized to degrade organic pollutants although these aops methods effectively treat waters contaminated with contaminants they are expensive and not commercially attractive 32 33 different physical treatment methods such as membrane filtration processes electrodialysis reverse osmosis nanofiltration etc are also widely employed the main disadvantage of membrane processes is their limited lifetime before the occurrence of membrane fouling therefore the cost of constant membrane replacement should be considered in the economic feasibility analysis at present there is no single process capable of adequate treatment mainly due to the complex nature of effluents loaded with organic and inorganic matter in practice a cheaper more efficient and simple treatment method is the most wanted method a literature survey shows that liquid phase adsorption is the most popular method for removing wastewater pollutants it is a widely used method to improve the degradation and recovery of phenols and to reduce sludge production 34 35 adsorption is an economically attractive method for treating wastewater because it is possible to employ low cost adsorbents in wastewater treatment in addition adsorption is a physicochemical equilibrium separation process that is highly effective for water treatment we are interested in the control of water pollution caused by phenolic discharges using metal oxide adsorbents on the one hand we developed a bibliographic study on the preparation techniques of the well known transition metal oxides more we showed the effect of the choice of methods not only on their structural textural and catalytic properties but also on their adsorption capacity of phenols we discussed also kinetic models of phenol adsorption in aqueous solution into metal oxides this is mainly due to the fact that several researches are progressing in the field of nanotechnology and find better combinations of nanoparticles that can definitely solve the complications of metal removal from water 2 synthesis techniques of transition metal oxides there are several techniques for the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles some of these approaches are particularly interested in synthesizing a stable form of nanomaterials under normal conditions each method affects the prepared metal oxide nanomaterial s structural and textural properties the most popular methods are classified into dry synthesis and wet synthesis in this work we are only interested in wet techniques which are simple fast and less expensive wet methods are mainly mentioned in the literature firstly the sol gel method corresponds to the process of transformation from a liquid system called sol to a colloidal state called gel the sol corresponds to the dispersion of an organometallic precursor or a salt in an organic solvent alcohol methanol ethanol etc the passage from sol to gel was carried out first by a series of hydrolysis reactions and inorganic polymerization to form a colloidal suspension and a second time by the process of aging finally the solid state is obtained by drying and calcination of the gel 8 36 secondly the microemulsion method allows the formation of micro reactors reverse micelles by dispersing a polar reaction medium water alcohol within an apolar phase oil n alkane the stabilization of the microemulsion was ensured by a surfactant which allows forming a barrier between these phases the size and shape of the particles depend mainly on the proportions of the dispersed phase and the surfactant in the continuous phase thirdly the precipitation method which yields to the formation of a solid phase from a liquid solution it is a rapid process consisting of adding an agent making the product insoluble or modifying the ph of the solution several parameters influence the preparation reaction of the metal oxides such as the temperature the ph the nature of the precursors and the solvent and the concentrations of the reagents however the most significant parameters is the ph and the ratio of h2o m 37 39 in fact an acid ph accelerates the hydrolysis and slows down the condensation contrary to the basic ph thus a strong rate of hydrolysis was reached with an acid ph which supports the growth of the networks and leads to a polymeric solution under acid catalysis a low rate of hydrolysis yielded with basic ph and favors the nucleation and leads to the formation of a colloidal solution and a controllable sized of the pores the formed gel is called colloidal gel and has a large pore structure consisted of clusters the temperature also has a certain importance on the kinetic control of the hydrolysis condensation reactions which get accelerated when the temperature increases 39 42 the influence of the h2o m ratio was considered among the most important parameters for the control of sol gel reactions the molar ratio between the added water and the precursor is logically the most important factor in hydrolytic sol gel processes the quantity of water and the way it is introduced is therefore a key element of the reaction it is easy to understand that on a very reactive precursor the sudden addition of water in large quantity will immediately generate undesirable precipitates and conversely an addition of water in too small quantity will not allow the hydrolysis of the whole precursor this is therefore also dependent on the reactivity of the starting precursor 42 45 finally the hydrothermal method was based on reactions that occur in the presence of an equilibrium between liquid water and vapor under high temperature t 100 c and pressure p 1 bar this allows the crystallization of ceramic materials with too slow a crystallization rate under standard conditions or to precipitate phases that are not stable under these conditions in addition it is a proven process for preparing tiny metal oxide particles smaller than 100 nm 9 12 18 literaturally speaking dry methods including ceramic and reactive milling methods 46 are the most classical preparation methods they weren t widely used in the industry in these methods the mixture was heated to very high calcination temperatures 1100 c to 1400 c for relatively long periods and require a lot of energy in order to allow the interdiffusion of ions inside the solid and to get an homogeneous body in fact the resulted particles are large and the specific area was very low it is well known that the specific surface plays an important role in the adsorption and removal of organic pollutants the ceramic method was often used when the specific surface of the prepared materials is not a crucial parameter this method consists in calcining the required quantities of the previously mixed oxide precursors at a temperature allowing the crystallization of the hexaaluminate phase 47 also reactive milling is a solid state synthesis method its based on applying intense mechanical shocks to a solid in order to produce a large variety of materials at the nanometric scale different types of materials have been successfully produced by reactive milling such as amorphous alloys metastable solid solutions metallic compounds and more recently nanocrystalline mixed oxides 48 the disadvantages of this process are the amount of energy required for thermal treatment at high temperatures over a long period of time as well as the poor resulted structural and textural properties by obtaining amorphous crystallinity and low specific surface are several works have been devoted to reporting the effect of the synthesis method choice on the structural textural properties catalytic and adsorptive properties of the prepared transition metal oxides ikram 49 has prepared zno nanoparticles by precipitation and sol gel methods they found that the preparation method choice strongly influenced the crystal structure size and morphology and efficiency from 90 to 99 of synthesized nanoparticles fig 1 reproduced with permission from 49 copyright 2017 acadÃ©mie des sciences paris thus the zno nanoparticles prepared by the sol gel method are more effective than those prepared by the precipitation method also vanessa et al 14 reported that adsorbents prepared using the co precipitation method have higher basicity than those designed by the sol gel process this increased basicity of the co precipitated catalysts mgal type oxide yields a higher activity still it is limited by the supposed formation of carbonates during the oxidation reaction of acetic acid fig 2 reproduced with permission from 14 copyright 2017 acadÃ©mie des sciences paris moreover the abderrahim research team 15 has studied the physicochemical properties of zno and tio2 oxides they concluded that the preparation method type strongly influences its physiochemical properties for example the catalytic activity is better for the oxides prepared by the sol gel method the research teams of xia 50 yang 17 wang 19 sabbatini 20 and g horanyi 51 have developed a comparison between physicochemical properties of iron oxide synthesized by the precipitation method they reported the significant resulting variation in structural and textural properties of iron oxide nanoparticles they ascribed this result to the used preparation method and other factors such as the reaction s precipitating agent precursors temperature and ph saleh 52 behnajady 53 and khaleed s research groups 54 have elaborated nickel oxide nanoparticles by different methods they deduced that the structural and textural properties of the metal oxide were influenced by the chosen synthesis method they deduced that the structural and textural properties of the oxide were influenced by the chosen synthesis method saleh and all 52 found an average particle diameter of 54 nm which was synthesized by the precipitation method with the following conditions nicl2 6h2o washing with distilled water and methanol drying in an oven at 90 c for 5 h calcination at 300 c for 6 h whereas behnajady and all 53 found an average size of 15 nm with a specific surface of 71 09 m2 g 1 with the same preparation method but under different conditions ni no3 2 6h2o washing with distilled water drying in an oven at 75 c for 20 h calcination at 300 c for 2 h finally khaleed and all 54 obtained 13 nm for the average particle size and a value of 32 95 m2 g 1 for its specific surface area for nickel oxide nanoparticles that were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal reflux process thus all these works highlight the importance of the synthesis method chosen for transition metal oxide materials as it has a crucial impact on its physicochemical properties 3 adsorption of phenol by oxides and critical kinetics transition metal oxides are generally derived from metal precursors in acetate chloride nitrate or sulfate forms they could be prepared by several methods such as precipitation sol gel and solid route the adsorption capacity of each metal oxide material depends on the chemical nature of the precursors the precipitating agent the temperature and the type of the synthesis process 55 56 several research groups are interested in using transition metal oxides to degrade phenol margaret 57 have reported a phenol degradation efficiency rate close to 85 using zinc oxide based adsorbent in the aqueous medium cherepivska 58 evaluated phenol photodegradation s specific activity using metal oxides their specific activity could be classified as follows Î± fe2o3 wo3 zno tio2 p25 tio2 phan 59 have reported the enhanced adsorption capacity of lafeo3 which leads to an increase in its catalytic activity and reaching a removal efficiency close to 94 with the use of 20 mg l 1 phenol 1 0 g l 1 of catalyst and 10 mm of h2o2 at a ph value of 5 despite the important reported results the disadvantages of photodegradation remain major in terms of its high energy consumption leading to increased treatment cost reusability and secondary byproducts of the reaction these drawbacks push researchers to treat phenol with adsorption as a recovery method of pollutants in aquatic systems the adsorption of phenols and their derivatives on various transition metal oxides have been extensively explored bekkouche 4 have studied adsorption isotherms for phenol from aqueous solutions on titanium dioxide in this work the adsorption capacity of phenol on metal oxide was 15 mg g the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 1 h and the adsorption kinetics originated from chemisorption in a monolayer and obeyed the langmuir model also the experimental survey has shown that there was an advantage to operating at high agitation speed and natural ph ultrasonic agitation results in a slight increase in the 5 amount of adsorbed phenol this agitation mode reduces the agglomeration phenomenon of the titanium oxide particles and thus increases the interfacial surface area adsorbent an 60 have synthesized sio2 based metal oxide adsorbent and tested its response to phenol treatment the obtained results show that this material has a strong adsorption capacity for phenol through hydrogen bonding main force action and electrostatic interaction the adsorption capacity of this solid depends significantly on the solution ph value compared to acid and base solutions the highest adsorption capacity was obtained in the neutral solution the adsorption kinetics of phenol by other prepared silica based materials were studied by an 61 they have concluded that pmaa sio2 has a very high adsorption capacity for phenol through the interaction of hydrogen bonds and the adsorption mechanism was satisfactorily explained with the introduction of hydrogen bonding in addition the adsorption capacity of pmaa sio2 for phenol is primarily related to both ph and temperature of the solution as much as both ph and temperature values were lower as much as the adsorption amount of phenol was higher this adsorption rate could reach 162 88 mg g 1 at a temperature of 293 k and a ph value of 6 this study shows that pmaa sio2 based adsorbent could remove acidic wastewater containing phenol in addition pmaa sio2 has an excellent reusability rate also the well detailed study developed by turki s research group 62 reported the preparation of anisotropic tio2 nanomaterials with different morphologies such as nanotubes nano tiles nanosheets nanospheres and nanoparticles then they evaluated its structural and textural properties adsorption rate and photocatalytic degradation of phenol under uv conditions this work shows that the kinetic study of phenol adsorption fits well to a quasi second order approach while the adsorption isotherms of phenol obey to langmuir model murcia and co workers 63 have studied the adsorption capacity of phenol and methyl orange on the surface of tio2 and pt tio2 based photocatalysts it was found that platinum plays an essential role in the phenol adsorption on the surface of tio2 the deposition of platinum onto tio2 64 has resulted in a modification in the phenol adsorbent interaction by providing new adsorption sites on the tio2 surface in this case phenol interacts primarily via the formation of adsorbed phenolate species the authors claimed phenol adsorption on tio2 and pt tio2 based adsorbents was mainly monitored by the formation of bidentate phenolate species istratie and collaborators 65 synthesized magnetic carbon nanocomposites containing fe3o4 using a simple solvothermal method the magnetic nanocomposites were utilized as adsorbents to remove phenol ph and dimethyl orange mo from aqueous effluents in this way a parametric study of the adsorbent dose ph contact time and initial pollutant concentration was performed it significantly increased the removal efficiency both for ph and mo adsorbates for adsorbents presenting higher carbon contents in addition the magnetic nanocomposites presented a higher capacity of adsorption towards mo uptake than ph due to the difficulty of removing this pollutant in aquatic environments it is worth noting the importance of researching more efficient adsorbents to eliminate phenols from marine systems there is a consensus on the sorption kinetics of mo and phenol which the pseudo second order model well described these kinetic results put a question of ambiguity on the role of saturation plateau in determining the kinetic model of adsorption several works have followed a pseudo first order model 66 69 the adsorption model was changed in the first minutes but after waiting for saturation plateau particularly in istratie study 65 four isothermal models have been studied langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and sips the langmuir isotherm for mo and phenol adsorption has been described in the equilibrium data on synthesizing adsorbents in single component adsorption another object in the study of the adsorption of phenol on titania and alumina in work patterson s group 70 has studied phenol adsorption on metal oxide powders by electron paramagnetic resonance epr this study reveals the formation of environmentally persistent free radicals epfr from phenol on alumina and titania using both powder and single crystal samples sridar and his co workers 51 have elaborated zinc oxide zno nanoparticles by wet chemical route they tested the synthesized zno nanoparticles to discharge phenol from synthetic and industrial wastewater in this published work the researchers show the influence of initial ph zno dosage contact time initial phenol concentration on the percentage of phenol removal it was noted that the langmuir isotherm fits well with phenol removal data compared to other isotherms and kinetic studies it was consequently deduced that the sorption follows the pseudo first order dong 71 prepared an iron oxide nanocomposite with biochar feybc this material was synthesized through a one step method using a solution of fecl3 and pomelo peel extract the iron oxide composite was utilized as an adsorbent for phenol and cr vi uptake from waters and the adsorbent exhibited a suitable adsorption capacity for both species phenol and cr vi sorption capacities were 16 37 and 18 63 mg g 1 respectively the possible proposed removal mechanisms could involve ion exchange and surface complexation and reduction for cr vi removal at one hand on the other hand electron donor acceptor complex and Ï€ Ï€ stacking were proposed for phenol uptake asmaly 72 have studied the phenol uptake from aqueous solution using aluminum oxide impregnated fly ash fa al2o3 a parametric adsorption study was carried out in this study by evaluating the effects of adsorption parameters such as stirring speed initial concentration initial ph adsorbent dosage contact time on phenol removal the results show that these mentioned parameters influenced the phenol uptake by fa al2o3 the best conditions were ph 7 200 rpm the adsorbent mass of 200 mg contact time of 2 h and 2 mgl 1 of initial phenol concentration in addition the authors concluded that the improvement in adsorption efficiency of fa al2o3 over fa could be assigned to an increase in specific surface area which was 11 9 m2 g for fa al2o3 and 7 1 m2 g for fa the ability of fe based oxides to adsorb phenol from dilute aqueous solution and in vapor state using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to evaluate the type of formed complex surface was reported by mcbride 73 the authors conclude that the adsorption from the solution was low at a ph of 5 5 the adsorption rate was inversely proportional to the pka of the phenols and the more acidic phenols adsorbed most strongly from the solution ftir spectra revealed that adsorption on goethite and amorphous fe oxide in the vapor state tended to disrupt the vibrational bands sensitive to the phenolic oh group depending on the level of adsorption both physically and chemically adsorbed phenols could be detected by ftir with chemisorption being more evident on iron oxide safwat 74 have investigated the ability of aluminum oxide and zinc oxide to remove phenol from wastewater by adsorption and compared their performances with titanium dioxide the highest removal efficiencies for aluminum oxide zinc oxide and titanium dioxide were 14 7 12 2 and 33 5 respectively equilibrium studies demonstrated the possibility of freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherms fitting the adsorption isotherms for aluminum oxide zinc oxide and titanium dioxide based adsorbents respectively titanium dioxide was the best candidate for phenol adsorption among the three adsorbents feng and his collaborators 75 show that sio2 zno supported adsorbents zsm 5 and mcm 22 exhibit significant capacity in phenol removal the solute transfer is generally characterized by external mass transfer boundary layer diffusion intra particle distribution for a solid liquid adsorption process the following three consecutive steps can describe the adsorption dynamics external diffusion of the liquid phase to the external surface of the adsorbent liquid phase extern liquid film transport of the adsorbent inside the pores by internal diffusion intraparticle diffusion adsorption on the active sites of the adsorbent on the internal surface of the pores 4 adsorption the adsorption rate is controlled by the slowest step i e the one which is kinetically determinant different adsorption kinetic models were employed for adsorption including pseudo first order pseudo second order the external diffusion model and the intraparticle diffusion model which are presented in eqs 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 1 dq dt k 1 q e q t 2 dq dt k 1 q e q t 2 3 d c t dt k a v c t c e 4 q t k id t 1 2 most of the reported phenol adsorption kinetics fit well with a pseudo second order model that he whether adsorbent and adsorbate and described by the pseudo second order model in few published works several researchers have explained this ambiguity by the effect of saturation plateau data on the fit of experimental data the choice of a linear or nonlinear model or the accumulation of errors ighalo s research group 76 has focused their interest on investigating the effect of pore size of zno and tio2 on the adsorption kinetics of methylene blue mb they adopted a new methodology by summarising empirical research results and analyzing them side by side for observations it was seen that as much as the pore diameter grows from mesopores to macropores the constant kinetic increases however for micropores the mb adsorption was significantly slower the decrease in the kinetic constant with micropores was due to the restricted diffusion of mb through microscopic pores of the adsorbate the mesopore range is the most preferred pore size for mb adsorption kinetics the pseudo second order pso model was the best model for all situations the pso is superior thanks to its capturing of active sites and considers the rate limiting step s phenol adsorption since the pore volume and specific surface area are limited the small magnitude of these characteristics resulted in total adsorption timeless than the constant rate constant lima and his research group 77 have emphasized that researchers avoid using linear models instead they have encouraged using the software by performing nonlinear fitting methods to obtain accurate physical parameters results they published that r2 and r2 adj of the linearized pso kinetic model are always close to 1 00 both implementations have significant adverse effects and lead users to draw wrong conclusions because the k2 value of the linear equation does not match the k2 value obtained by the nonlinear fit lima s staff uses linearized kinetic equations for all 225 kinetic experiments 100 r2 and r2 of the pseudo second order linear model to better fit the pseudo first order linear model however 122 of the 225 kinetic experiments 54 22 indicated that the best kinetic model is the pseudo first order model when nonlinear methods are used they concluded that the inefficient use of linearized phenomenological equations could lead to incorrect expression of the obtained physical parameters bujdÃ¡k and his group 78 are interested in the critical study of the adsorption kinetics of chemicals on clays and related materials it has been concluded that adsorption was governed by the so called pseudo second order pso mechanism the conclusions are mainly derived from the regression analysis of adsorption data using the simplified linearized form of the model the extensive analysis in bujdÃ¡k s 78 shows the inadequacy of the linearized function to assess the quality of the pso model for adsorption data this work exhibits more accurate ways to test adsorption data using original nonlinear models the results significantly impact the re evaluation of published interpretations of adsorption kinetics for clay based systems moreover simonin s research team 79 has claimed that it is not logical to use data close to or at equilibrium to determine the best kinetic formula however this approach only presents relevant results if linearization is considered when the nonlinear fitting is utilized every kinetics point is vital to establish adsorption kinetics revellame 80 have considered the pseudo second order a superior model representing many adsorption systems they have concluded that a critical evaluation of modeling techniques and practices indicates that its superiority may result from currently acceptable modeling standards which tend to support pseudo second order models in addition the discrepancies are caused by several modeling flaws that are often overlooked also commonly used model checking tools are generally utilized randomly and redundantly as a result they cannot provide sufficient certainty about the model s validity revellame et al 80 have proposed a new validation method to re examine previously published adsorption kinetics data to eliminate modeling bias in this way rodrigues 81 discussed using the pseudo first order kinetic allowing to lagergreen model they compared it with the linear kinetic model of glueckauf to obtain a linear adsorption equilibrium isotherm they revealed the relationship between the kinetic constants of both models which can show the temperature dependency regardless of the porous structure of the adsorbing particles so precautions should be taken when using abbreviated methods for pseudo first order expressions several mechanisms such as hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction could be involved in the adsorption of phenol 82 based on the nature of the interactions which hold the adsorbate to the surface of the adsorbent adsorption can be classified into two families 83 the first one is the physical adsorption or physisorption which involves weak van der waals force type bonds between the adsorbed chemical species and the adsorbent these bonds are similar to those involved in liquefaction however it occurs well before the gas reaches a pressure equal to its saturation vapour pressure at low temperatures close to the boiling point of the adsorbed phase it is generally reversible and the equilibrium was obtained when the adsorption and desorption rates are equal physical adsorption is favored by a decrease in temperature the second one is the chemical adsorption or chemisorption which involves significant binding energies such as covalent ionic or metallic bonds between the adsorbed chemical species and the adsorbent it is accompanied by a deep modification of the electronic charge distribution of the adsorbed molecules it is often irreversible or hardly reversible since it requires the formation of high energy and short distance interactions chemisorption yields the formation of a monomolecular layer three models have been proposed to interpret the mechanism of phenol adsorption on carbon 84 including the electron donor acceptor complex chemical adsorption Ï€ Ï€ dispersion interactions physical adsorption and solvent effects chemical adsorption the important noticed point in all the published works was the ambiguity in the mechanism that explains the adsorption phenomenon 85 in fact the phenomenon of adsorption involves different types of interactions at the solid liquid interface 22 86 89 which could be van der wales forces which is a dipole dipole attraction occurring between atoms or molecules due to weak electrical perturbations columbian forces which are electrostatic forces resulted between a charged surface and an oppositely charged species the surface charge can be the consequence of an isomorphic substitution or a protonation or deprotonation of the surface functional groups under the effect of the ph this kind of force exists essentially in the case of adsorption of inorganic ions and ionized organic molecules hydrogen bonds which are intermolecular bonds that occur between a hydrogen atom and an electronegatif atom hydrophobic interactions which are of major interest for non polar molecules the exact nature of the adsorption by this type of interaction remains unclear there are some researchers groups who propose that polar molecules occupy the hydrophobic sites of the surface without any competition with the water molecules others think that it is a simple participation the polar molecules tend to diffuse from the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic sites of the adsorbent surface many others are based on the crystal structure of transition metal oxides to further study the phenol adsorption mechanism using theoretical studies either by dft ab initio and monte carlo or advanced statistical physics 6 90 96 4 the comparison of phenol adsorption on transition metal oxides and other adsorbents the most important criteria influencing the use of an adsorbent are efficiency and cost for that reason a comparison of the adsorption capacity of phenol between synthesized and commercial oxides and other adsorbents has been conducted in this way table 1 lists the adsorption capacity for phenol discharge by commercial oxides and some adsorbents previously reported in the literature the reported data show that the maximum phenol adsorption of the synthesized oxides including other adsorbents is much higher than the commercial oxides and some other adsorbents furthermore iron oxide exhibits a higher capacity than the other two prepared oxides nio and zno this suggests its potential use for the practical removal of phenol from wastewaters 5 conclusion this work reviews different unconventional adsorbents for removing phenolic compounds from water cost effective available and more efficient adsorbent materials could be used as the best alternatives for removing phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions instead of commercial activated carbon adsorption has undoubtedly more advantages than other methods such as photodegradation to remove organic pollutants from wastewater several works show the effect of the synthesis method on the structural and textural properties of the prepared materials and the adsorption and removal capacity of the pollutants in particular we are interested in discussing the adsorption kinetics and its fitting models in this work despite the critical analysis of kinetic models the method of use and the form of the used model the kinetics results in all reported outcomes have an ambiguity that needs to be resolved further work will be required to predict the adsorption mechanism and type of adsorption to confirm the results of the adsorption kinetics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the reported work in this paper 
12809,the diclofenac dcf and ibuprofen ibu removal were assessed in an enlarged scale denitrifying fluidized bed reactor fbr fed with sanitary sewage plus ethanol 74 100 mg l 1 and nitrate 89 136 mg l 1 the experiment was sectioned into four phases in phase i the hydraulic retention time hrt was set in 18 3 h without dcf and ibu addition and the fbr shows a heterotrophic denitrifying behavior with 97 nitrate removal in phase ii the addition of pharmaceuticals did not change cod and nitrate removal in phase iii the hrt was decreased to 12 1 h which did not influence denitrification but decreased the efficiency of dcf 35 and ibu 40 removal in phases i ii and iii the removal of organic matter was limited by the concentration of influent nitrate the hrt was then increased in phase iv to 18 2 h and nitrate was not added to the feeding which led to denitrification no longer being the preferential route and replaced by acidogenic metabolism evidenced by the highest concentration and diversity of total volatile fatty acids vfa resulting in increased organic matter removal efficiency 56 dcf 53 ibu 56 and ethanol 99 7 in phase iv acidogenic bacteria were mainly responsible for dcf and ibu degradation by Ï‰ and Î² oxidation this study establishes that dcf and ibu biodegradation in fbr applied to sanitary sewage treatment in denitrifying condition is overcome by acidogenic metabolism in the absence of nitrate as an electron acceptor favoring the pharmaceuticals degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords micropollutants nitrate ethanol pharmaceuticals metataxonomic 1 introduction diclofenac dcf and ibuprofen ibu are non steroidal anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals recalcitrant 1 and widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases 2 after ingestion 40 of the parent compositions of metabolites and conjugates are excreted via urine which composes the sanitary sewage continuous exposure in non target organisms algae invertebrates and microorganisms can compromise ecosystem balance due to biological changes in metabolism such as inhibition of mobility and growth 3 thus there is an obvious need to evaluate and optimize the degradation of these pharmaceuticals in biological reactors in order to minimize their release into the environment 4 in structural terms dcf is a chlorinated aromatic and ibu consists of an aromatic ring linked to acetate and alkyl groups which complicates its degradation 5 however the addition of co substrates such as ethanol can facilitate this process and favor populations of the microbial consortium for degrading the target compounds 6 9 the co substrate may also energetically favor the degradation of recalcitrant compounds via induction of extracellular enzyme production and atp supply 10 11 the application of denitrifying bacteria is an attractive alternative for the removal of pharmaceuticals as it is indicated in the degradation of various organic pollutants and complex structures such as anionic surfactants 12 petroleum derived compounds such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex 13 and industrial additives 14 15 thus the use of denitrifying biomass is a favorable alternative for degrading diclofenac and ibuprofen diclofenac consists of aromatic chains and an amine group while ibuprofen is an aromatic compound that can be metabolized with ethanol via nitrate removal 5 16 nitrate reducing microorganisms such as pseudomonas can use the aniline group of the dcf molecule 17 while dechloromonas can catabolize the aromatic rings of ibu and dcf molecules as carbon and energy source 7 18 furthermore acidogenic genera acinetobacter and arthrobacter were identified and isolated with greater relative abundance in the degradation of the recalcitrant compound p nitrophenol while citrobacter was identified and isolated from sewage treatment plant reactors and associated with the degradation of a series of recalcitrant compounds converting the phenolic compound into mono and dichlorophenols 19 20 granatto et al 7 evaluated the removal of diclofenac ibuprofen propranolol and triclosan in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor on enlarged scale 69 l fed with sanitary sewage affluent from sÃ£o carlos sp brazil based on this study denitrifying bacteria were identified such as pseudomonas and members similar to caldisericum smithella blvii28 wastewater sludge group and bacteroides in the operational phase of greater removal of dcf 42 10 for 107 26 Î¼g l 1 influent ibu 50 15 for 164 47 Î¼g l 1 influent and triclosan tcs 85 15 for 185 148 Î¼g l 1 influent patroescu et al 21 compared the development of denitrifying bacteria based on nitrate removal in a fluidized fixed bed the authors obtained denitrification rates 2 5 times higher in a fluidized bed than in a fixed bed bioreactor which may be related to greater substrate transfer caused by the recirculation and bed movement thus corroborating the present study it can be inferred that the fluidized condition contributed to the denitrification adaptation via nitrate removal and possibly to the biofilm maturation in the presence of diclofenac and ibuprofen in the operational phases among the biological reactors studied the configuration of the fluidized bed reactor fbr is an alternative for the treatment of recalcitrant compounds mostly because of the dilution of the toxic compound due to the effluent recirculation in addition to the immobilization of microorganisms in a support medium favoring the contact of biomass with the substrate which contributes to greater mass transfer and degradation of organic compounds thus treatment efficiency is related to biofilm formation and development influent flow and the characteristics of the support medium 22 therefore the main objective of this research was to study the biodegradation of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac and ibuprofen in fbr on an increased scale fed with sanitary sewage supplemented with ethanol and or nitrate furthermore through the relationship between the physicochemical data of the reactor and the sequencing of the 16s rrna gene illumina from the biomass of the different operational phases the metataxonomic characterization and inference of the metabolic profile of the microbial community involved in the drug biodegradation was carried out it should be noted that this approach has not been carried out in previous studies and that the results described here may support future research on the removal of recalcitrant compounds in wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals

sand received acid treatment in a 10 hydrofluoric acid solution to increase particle surface roughness and porosity this procedure was recommended to facilitate the biomass adhesion the reactor was installed at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the municipality of sÃ£o carlos sÃ£o paulo brazil and kept at room temperature the fbr was inoculated with 30 l of sludge from activated sludge

chromatography uplc coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms ms waters acquity uplc according to campanha et al 31 the uplc ms ms was operated with electrospray ionization source esi in both negative h and positive h modes and quantification was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode the dcf and ibu adsorbed on the sand was determined via mass spectrometry coupled ultra performance chromatography uplc ms ms with an acquity uplc beh c18 reversed phase column flow of 0 45 ml min 1 temperature of 40 c and detection limit of 0 08 ng l 1 therefore at the end of each operational phase a homogeneous sample was collected from the reactor sand bed followed by the extraction described by gago ferrero 32 2 4 diclofenac and ibuprofen mass balance the drug mass balance was evaluated in the phases with the best nitrate removal phase iii and the best drug removal phase iv thus the total mass of dcf and ibu added during the period of each phase was considered the total mass added to the influent minus the residual effluent and the mass adsorbed in the bed resulted in the degraded mass according to eqs s1 to s4 the supplementary material shows more details on the adsorption of dcf and ibu 2 5 taxonomic characterization genomic dna extraction and sequencing were performed on samples collected at the end of the fbr phases phase i iii and iv the biofilm samples

following the manufacturer s recommendations the sequences were assembled and filtered qphred 33 to remove sequences containing low quality bases in addition to detecting and removing chimeras using

taxonomic classification of otus was performed using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu the sequences were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under accession number prjna759422 the potential metabolic pathways involved in the pharmaceuticals degradation process diclofenac and ibuprofen were defined based on the study of granatto et al 34 the prediction of potential genes encoding enzymes involved in such pathways using the tax4fun2 v 1 1 6 35 in r language based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg 97 identity cutoff and on the comprehensive enzyme information system brenda database https www brenda enzymes org 2 6 statistical analysis the removal of diclofenac and ibuprofen was evaluated using a parametric kolmogorov smirnov model for normality testing followed by analysis of variance anova means were compared using tukey s test at 95 confidence level p 0 05 all statistical tests were performed using origin 2018 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the fbr was monitored for 258 days with influent organic matter of 378 1 78 1 mg cod l 1 for all operation phases the operating conditions and main results founded are shown in fig 1 the predominant metabolism in phase i was the dissimilative reduction of nitrate to nitrogen via heterotrophic denitrification since the removal of nitrate and organic matter was 97 2 3 7 and 60 0 11 6 respectively table 2 ethanol was the main electron donor to support denitrification this is seen by considering the theoretical cod of ethanol of 2 09 mg l 1 given by the stoichiometry of the oxidation reaction eq 1 thus the influent cod of phase i related to 74 7 35 5 mg l 1 of ethanol was 156 mg cod l 1 and represented 50 of the total cod 310 54 mg l 1 5 6 0 5 mg l 1 of ethanol were verified in the effluent which corresponded to 11 6 mg cod l 1 and represented 9 6 of the total cod effluent 122 37 mg l 1 the ethanol percentage variation cod equivalent from 50 influent to 9 6 effluent reinforces that this substrate was a preferential electron donor for denitrification furthermore the high nitrate removal efficiency associated with the occurrence of residual effluent cod 122 37 mg l 1 means that nitrate limited the removal of organic matter 1 c 2 h 3 o 3 o 2 2 c o 2 3 h 2 o the heterotrophic denitrification established in phase i is also verified by the difference of total alkalinity from 196 29 mg caco3 l 1 in the influent and 279 70 mg caco3 l 1 in the effluent and ph from 7 3 to 7 9 respectively probably the higher effluent alkalinity is related to heterotrophic denitrification which has the conversion of nitrate into nitrogen gas and bicarbonate eq 2 36 37 in stoichiometric terms for 1 0 mg of nitrate reduced to n2 3 6 mg of bicarbonate is produced this results in an increase in ph as seen in this study 2 ch 3 ooh 1 6 no 3 0 8 h 2 o 0 8 n 2 2 h 2 co 3 1 6 oh there were no significant changes in the removal of organic matter 51 0 10 5 and nitrate 93 4 6 5 with dcf 120 0 25 Î¼g l 1 and ibu 167 7 35 Î¼g l 1 in phase ii this phase showed that heterotrophic denitrification was also predominant and similar to the previous phase these conditions showed lower removal of dcf and ibu that is 27 6 12 and 30 3 22 respectively ethanol 92 3 8 0 an easily metabolized substrate as an electron donor in anoxic respiration was probably used 38 phase iii for hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 1 h showed that organic matter removal efficiency decreased to 37 0 8 8 which was significantly lower than phases i 60 0 11 6 and phase ii 51 10 5 however in relation to nitrate removal 93 2 2 6 no change was observed for removal efficiency in relation to the other phases in addition there was greater removal of dcf 35 2 19 and ibu 39 6 2 4 this behavior may have probably occurred due to the reduction in ethanol removal 70 5 2 3 this may have favored the use of other substrates as electron donors for denitrification these conditions showed that at lower hrt there was almost complete nitrate removal phase iv for hrt of 18 2 h the concentration of influent nitrate from sanitary sewage was 13 2 mg l 1 resulting in a ratio of organic matter and nitrate cod no3 of 33 7 much higher than that applied in phase i cod no3 2 28 phase ii cod no3 4 09 and phase iii cod no3 3 60 this phase iv condition provided lower nitrate removal of 32 6 16 2 consequently nitrate was not the preferred electron acceptor probably the concentration of influent nitrate 13 2 mg l 1 was insufficient to support denitrification as the preferential route possibly related to the imbalance of the system and favoring acidogenic populations due to the absence of nitrate as the main acceptor of electrons from anoxic respiration this phase showed the highest concentration and diversity of total volatile fatty acids vfa 226 23 mg l 1 fig 2 compared to the other phases this metabolic change from heterotrophic denitrification to acidogenesis resulted in increased organic matter removal efficiency 56 3 7 9 dcf 52 9 11 4 ibu 55 8 11 4 and ethanol 99 7 1 2 in relation to the other phases such as phase iii with 37 0 8 8 35 2 19 39 6 2 4 respectively kennes veiga et al 39 also evaluated the removal of several pharmaceuticals including dcf and ibu in an activated sludge system the sludge used as inoculum came from a sewage treatment plant and sodium acetate 200 mg cod l 1 and ammonium chloride 20 mg l 1 were added the authors reported removal efficiency of 5 for dcf 10 Î¼g l 1 influent and 20 for ibu 10 Î¼g l 1 influent with lower dcf concentration values than those observed in this work 66 4 14 3 Î¼g l 1 both in the predominantly denitrifying phases and in the acidogenic phase therefore based on these results greater removal of pharmaceuticals was observed under acidogenic conditions which is probably the most recommended metabolism since the removal efficiency of dcf and ibu in phase iv was higher compared to the other phases under mostly denitrifying conditions phases i ii and iii similar results from other studies can be seen the table 3 in addition to the pharmaceuticals sulfonated linear alkylbenzene las one of the most used surfactants in the world was also evaluated 42 which is part of the sanitary sewage composition due to the characteristic surface tension reduction surfactants increase the solubility of the compounds in the medium and can favor the degradation of the target compounds 43 however the typical concentration variation of the sanitary sewage can inhibit the bioprocess in phases i and ii influent las was observed at 1 47 0 96 mg l 1 to 4 52 2 99 mg l 1 respectively and with no alteration of heterotrophic denitrification since nitrate removal efficiency was higher than 90 20 in the phases in which this metabolism was predominant phases i ii and iii the maximum removal of las in the phases with nitrate addition phases i ii and iii and with predominantly denitrifying metabolism was 56 5 24 7 phase ii even with decrease in hrt to 12 1 h in phase iii there was no significant change in las removal efficiency 53 0 7 3 this may evidence that las was used as electron donor for denitrification since the reduction of tdh did not change the parameters las and nitrate removal in phase iv without nitrate added to the feeding the las removal efficiency increased to 63 3 18 7 for influent of 3 5 0 9 mg l 1 this behavior may have happened due to the non addition of nitrate to the feed which suppressed the denitrifying consortium due to the lack of the electron acceptor no3 leading them to be succeeded by an acidogenic population 42 43 44 the degradation of micropollutants via acidogenesis has been increasingly evidenced in different studies that include compounds such as the commercial surfactant tween 80 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoollate 44 tetrabromobisphenol a 8 las 45 ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole 46 47 carneiro et al 46 evaluated the degradation of 21 micropollutants in hydrolytic and acidogenic reactors and found that acidogenesis was the key step for the degradation of target compounds the micropollutants selected by the authors included four antibiotics sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim erythromycin and roxithromycin three musk fragrances galaxolide tonalide and celestolide three anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac four neurodrugs fluoxetine carbamazepine diazepam and citalopram four endocrine disruptors from household products bisphenol a triclosan 4 octylphenol and 4 nonylphenol and three estrogens estrone 17Î² estradiol e2 and 17Î± ethinylestradiol thus it can be inferred that acidogenesis may be the key factor for degrading dcf and ibu in sanitary sewage as well as the las surfactant 3 2 microbial characterization the microbial community was characterized so as to obtain information about its composition in the different phases of fbr operation inoculum phase i phase iii phase iv regarding the taxonomic classification for the bacteria domain representatives of seven phyla in different relative abundances were identified fig s2 regarding the inoculum sample there was a higher relative abundance of the phyla proteobacteria 65 55 verrumicrobiota 15 55 bacteroidetes 12 49 actinobacteria 2 36 and firmicutes 0 86 granatto et al 34 reported higher relative abundance of proteobacteria in batch reactors containing dcf and ibu similar to the present study the aforementioned authors used ethanol as a metabolic co substrate 200 mg cod l 1 however under methanogenic fermentative conditions the highest abundance 65 55 for the phylum proteobacteria whose members have large diversity and metabolic capacity may be related to the reactional and nutritional configuration of the activated sludge system also commonly identified in the biomass of anoxic reactors 48 49 the phyla proteobacteria 30 17 thermotogota 14 75 bacteroidetes 14 46 and firmicutes 9 97 were identified in phase i the phyla proteobacteria 24 42 campylobacteria 21 40 bacteroidetes 17 13 desulfobacteria 11 65 and chloroflexi 6 05 were identified in phase iii in the absence of nitrate and in hrt of 18 2 h the phyla desulfobacteria 35 21 spirochaeta 29 28 bacteroidetes 19 78 firmicutes 5 13 and thermotogota 3 55 were identified in phase iv thus the greatest differences between the identified phyla are related to proteobacteria due to their decreasing relative abundance both in relation to the inoculum and in relation to the biomass of the different reactor operation phases from 65 5 in the inoculum to 0 10 in phase iv based on this fact it is possible to infer that the operational characteristics of the fbr used in the present study were not favorable to the bacteria of this phylum since in this reaction configuration there is high turbulence of the liquid mass recirculation and microbial growth in the form of biofilm adhered to the support material furthermore during phase iv nitrate electron acceptor was removed from the fbr feed which may have directly interfered with other metabolic possibilities thus influencing changes in populations especially those related to this phylum on the other hand the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased in relation to the inoculum and that of phase iv from 12 49 to 19 78 respectively some characteristics of the organisms of this phylum are their potential to degrade high molecular weight compounds such as proteins and carbohydrates 50 furthermore it has been reported in previous research that this phylum is related to the degradation of pharmaceuticals including ibu in hospital wastewater containing 10 Î¼g ibu l 1 51 52 according to gallardo altamirano et al 51 the degradation of active pharmaceutical compounds can occur by members of this phylum both under anaerobic and anoxic conditions which may justify the consistency of their relative abundance throughout the fbr operation both in the phases containing no3 phases i and iii or without no3 phase iv it can also be inferred that the operational conditions applied in the fbr were favorable to desulfobacterota since its relative abundance increased from 0 01 in the inoculum to 29 28 in phase iv members of this phylum perform sulfate reduction and degradation of aromatic compounds 53 according to granatto et al 54 who monitored for 12 h the composition of the same domestic sewage used in the present study from the wwtp in sÃ£o carlos sp brazil the sulfate concentration was 82 0 56 5 mg l 1 thus it can be inferred that the feed of the fbr reactor in phase i favored the establishment of bacteria of this phylum due to sulfate in addition to the pharmaceuticals that were part of the feed of the later phases phases ii and iii 55 which favored greater relative abundance also regarding the change in the relative abundance of the different phyla identified there was low relative abundance of chloroflexi 0 02 0 84 respectively both in the inoculum and in phase i however phase iii exhibited substantial increase 6 05 possibly due to the addition of ibu and dcf at this stage since organisms of this phylum can participate in the degradation of halogenated compounds and have affinity with the chlorine atoms that compose the dcf molecule 34 56 some of the steps needed to degrade dcf and ibu such as cleavage of aromatic compounds and reductive dechlorination may be related to representatives of the geobacteraceae family 57 greater degradation of dcf and ibu was observed in phase iv possibly related to the predominant relative abundance of both this family 28 85 and spirochaetaceae with 27 9 in phase iv 2 8 in phase iii 1 6 in phase i according to medina et al 57 such families are composed of bacteria with acidogenic metabolism therefore with the increase in vfa concentration in the fbr effluent in phase iv 226 23 mg hac l 1 it can be inferred that this pathway was favored in the absence of nitrate in addition to a higher total concentration of vfa in phase iv there was also greater difference in the composition of organic acids in which acetic propionic isobutyric butyric isovaleric valeric caproic and n butanol acids were observed while in the other phases there was a predominance of acetic acid table 2 a total of 19 genera were represented fig 3 and each genus was among the 5 most abundant in at least one of the samples in the nitrate feeding phases phase i ii and iii denitrifying genera were identified in the fluidized bed reactor such as rhodanobacter 25 33 acidovorax 9 38 caldisericum 6 55 desulfovibrio 3 62 dechloromonas 2 78 thauera 2 20 zoogloea 0 46 acinetobacter 0 36 and pseudomonas 0 11 the occurrence of these denitrifying genera probably favored nitrate removal which reached 98 in phases i and iii as mentioned earlier the dissimilative reduction of nitrate to nitrogen was possibly predominant in phase i as nitrate removal was 97 2 3 7 thus it can be inferred that ethanol was the main electron donor in this stage of heterotrophic denitrification similarly in phase iii the observed nitrate removal was 93 2 2 6 it is worth mentioning that in addition to denitrifying it is known that some of these genera may be involved in the degradation of pharmaceuticals such as rhodanobacter acidovorax 58 and desulfovibrio 59 60 rhodanobacter the genus identified in greater relative abundance in the inoculum 25 33 was also identified in samples from the other phases at 0 01 thus it is possible to infer that the operational conditions applied in the fbr were not favorable to these bacteria rhodanobacter is a common genus in activated sludge systems and this result is consistent with the characteristics of the inoculum used in the present study however according to navrozidou et al 58 such bacteria may be related to the degradation of anti inflammatory and non steroidal pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac and ibuprofen acidovorax identified in greater relative abundance in phases i and iii 9 38 and 2 38 respectively are chemoorganotrophic bacteria that metabolize organic acids amino acids and carbohydrates as substrates in addition to nitrate as an electron acceptor via heterotrophic denitrification 59 in addition acidovorax are commonly identified in sewage treatment plant reactors and reported to participate in the degradation of anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals 58 and antibiotics and also usually related to the degradation of aromatic compounds 59 therefore it can be inferred that the addition of nitrate had a positive effect on the prevalence of these organisms similarly zhou et al 61 observed a positive relationship between the prevalence of this genus with the presence of nitrate and the removal of total nitrogen in sequential batch reactors with sanitary sewage plus 1 5 mg l 1 of influent ibu phase i nitrate 136 59 mg l 1 ethanol 74 7 9 2 mg l 1 in hrt 18 3 h phase iii nitrate 100 10 mg l 1 ethanol 98 0 16 8 mg l 1 in hrt 12 1 h phase iv ethanol 89 6 39 2 mg l 1 in hrt 18 2 h n i unidentified genus bacteria of the genus caldisericum are strict anaerobes and chemoorganotrophs which consume carbohydrates and produce short chain fatty acids by reducing sulfur compounds this genus was identified in greater relative abundance in the biomass of phase i members of this genus are related to the degradation of phenolic compounds 62 the genera thauera geobacter and desulfovibrio have been widely reported to have drug degrading potential 5 54 63 64 desulfovibrio are anaerobic sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria capable of degrading carbohydrates amino acids aromatic compounds in addition to performing desulfonation 59 60 thauera has been widely recognized for its denitrifying capacity and for degrading phenolic compounds 65 geobacter was identified in greater relative abundance in phase iv 28 85 in the absence of influent nitrate since these microorganisms are strict anaerobes and iron reducers the absence of nitrate may have favored the increase in the relative abundance of this genus according to the monitoring of domestic sewage carried out by granatto et al 54 wwtp of sÃ£o carlos sp brazil the total iron concentration was between 0 005 and 2 2 mg l 1 in contrast zoogloea was identified in greater relative abundance in phase i 0 46 and phase iii 0 20 and in both phases nitrate was added to the fbr feed 136 59 and 100 10 mg l 1 respectively this genus has been recognized for its ability to degrade aromatic compounds 59 and recalcitrant compounds such as oils and greases 66 delforno et al 67 okada et al 68 and andrade et al 48 related this genus to the removal of aromatic compounds in laundry wastewater as reported by the aforementioned authors the relative abundance of zoogloea was 0 1 15 8 and 22 14 in biomass from egsb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and fbr reactors respectively in addition to the bacteria mentioned other denitrifying bacteria were identified in smaller proportions such as acinetobacter especially in phase i 0 36 bacteria of this genus have highly versatile metabolism and have been reported in biological systems due to their degradation potential and tolerance to recalcitrant compounds 69 71 similarly to the present study granatto et al 7 performed the taxonomic characterization of the egsb biomass on an increased scale fed with sanitary sewage wwtp of sÃ£o carlos sp brazil plus 200 mg cod l 1 of co substrate ethanol ethanol methanol or fumarate in addition to the dcf and ibu according to the authors ethanol was the co substrate that most favored drug removal and the main genera identified under such conditions were syntrophobacter smithella macellibacteroides syntrophus blvii28 wastewater sludge group bacteroides and caldisericum these microorganisms were also identified in the present study and related to the degradation of dcf and ibu in the presence of ethanol as a co substrate gusmÃ£o et al 72 identified bacteroides in a horizontal fixed bed reactor operated in a plug flow system for the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons btex in the nitrate phase as an electron acceptor for denitrifying bacteria the formation of an anaerobic zone favored by the plug flow system can occur in this system providing minimum conditions for the bacteria of this genus the main genera of the desulfobacterota phylum identified in phase iv were desulfovibrio 3 62 geobacter 3 16 and desulfobulbus 2 21 usually described as gram negative anaerobes and sulfate reducers promoting the incomplete oxidation of lactate to acetate 59 representatives of these genera are fundamental in the desulfonation and degradation of sulfonated aromatic compounds such as las anionic surfactant 48 54 73 thus their importance for the degradation of dcf can be inferred as this compound has aromatic rings in its molecular conformation in addition the sulfate from the domestic sewage composition used to feed the reactor may have favored such organisms the predominant genera identified in phase i with addition of nitrate and ethanol and hrt of 18 3 h were the bacteria similar to fervidobacterium 14 71 acidovorax 9 38 tepidiphilus 7 89 caldisericum 6 55 in addition to comamonadaceae hydrogenedensaceae streptococcus and dechloromonas with relative abundance 4 0 organisms of the genus fervidobacterium are strict anaerobes and fermenters of a wide variety of carbohydrates including glucose starch lactose and sucrose and do not use vfa and alcohols for growth 2 the highest abundance of this genus was 14 71 and occurred in phase i while in phase iii this value reduced to 0 17 in phase iii dcf and ibu were added to the reactor feed however the presence of the pharmaceuticals may not have been the cause of the reduction in the relative abundance since there was a slight increase of this genus in phase iv 3 55 which also had the pharmaceuticals thus the reduction in relative abundance in phase iii was probably caused by the reduction of hrt to 12 1 h while in phase i and iv it was 18 3 h and 18 2 h respectively the reduction of hrt implies in increasing the applied organic load leading to changes in microbial composition 74 and this fact was probably determining for the variation of fervidobacterium abundance tepidiphilus of the class betaproteobacteria are producers of catalases and oxidases and important in reducing nitrate these organisms are chemoorganotrophs and use organic acids as the only carbon source 75 in this study this genus was identified in relative abundance of 7 89 in phase i and 10 66 in phase iii the affluent nitrate probably favored this genus in phase iii at the end of phase iii hrt 12 1 h bacteria similar to arcobacter 19 89 were identified in greater relative abundance in the biofilm adhered to the sand microorganisms of this genus are facultative aerobes and chemoorganotrophs and use organic acids and carbohydrates as carbon source in addition to assimilating nitrate as electron acceptor 76 frÃ³es et al 77 identified prevalence 90 of this genus in samples of hospital effluent from rio de janeiro rj brazil with the same organic matter concentration 397 mg cod l 1 obtained in this study for phase iii of the fbr 400 mg cod l 1 on the other hand this genus was not identified in phase iv hrt 18 2 h possibly due to the selective pressure of higher hrt even in the presence of pharmaceuticals and domestic sewage in phase iv of the reactor there were higher proportions of geobacteraceae 28 85 spirochaetaceae 27 98 blvii28 wastewater sludge group 12 62 and s50 wastewater sludge group 6 41 in addition to desulfomicrobium 4 39 fervidobacterium 3 55 peptococcaceae 3 44 and anaerolineaceae 1 61 bacteria similar to blvii28 wastewater sludge group perform Î² Ï‰ oxidation and participate in the degradation of aromatic rings similar to that observed in the present study wang et al 78 reported a positive correlation of the relative abundance of the genus blvii28 wastewater sludge group 5 01 with removal efficiency of organic matter and recalcitrant compounds in petrochemical wastewater possibly due to its tolerance to toxic compounds and versatility for degrading aromatic constituents the increase in hrt in phase iv 18 2 h in addition to the suppression of influent nitrate resulted in a higher cod no3 ratio 33 7 when compared to the other phases 2 28 4 09 and 3 60 respectively negatively affecting the heterotrophic denitrification since nitrate is no longer the preferred electron acceptor with removal from 93 2 2 6 to 32 6 16 2 and higher ethanol consumption from 70 5 2 3 to 99 7 1 2 thus it may be inferred that the influent nitrate concentration in phase iv led to the imbalance of denitrifying populations in the fbr hence favoring acidogenic populations due to the absence of nitrate as the main electron acceptor of anoxic respiration 37 3 3 functional profile inference after metabolic inference via tax4fun2 the plausible kos related to the analyzed samples were observed totaling 7116 ko for the inoculum sample 7304 for the phase i sample 7310 for phase iii and 4543 for phase iv which allowed to calculate their percentage in the metabolic pathways of interest it is worth mentioning that the tool applied for predicting genes encoding of the possible enzymes involved in the process infers the functional content of microbial genes based on the information related to the genome of organisms taxonomically closest to those identified in the samples based on the rrna 16s prokaryotic sequencing data 35 metabolic levels related to both drug degradation and ethanol and nitrate removal were filtered according to categories of the kegg database fig s3 the level with the highest proportions was the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in the inoculum sample 0 9 phase i 0 8 and phase iii 1 1 possibly due to the significant Î² oxidation 34 67 79 in the degradation of pharmaceuticals in addition to the facultative anaerobic potential of the biomass involved in the process it is noteworthy that the aerobic biotransformation steps of ibu hydroxylation carboxylation decarboxylation can occur even under anaerobic conditions 34 additionally in relation to the pathways directly involved in the degradation of pharmaceuticals the degradation of aromatic compounds 0 3 0 6 and the degradation of benzoate 0 1 0 8 are also emphasized with the conversion of the benzoyl coa molecule into acetyl coa and or acetaldehyde and pyruvate furthermore similar proportions were observed for the glycolytic pathway in all analyzed samples 0 9 in which this pathway is extremely important for the assimilation of ethanol through its conversion into acetaldehyde eq 3 which can then be metabolized to acetate eq 4 and or acetyl coa eq 5 3 ethanol na d acetaldehyde nadh h 4 acetaldehyde na d h 2 o acetate nadh h 5 acetaldehyde coa na d acetylcoa nadh h the biodegradation of dcf and ibu begins after their transport from the extracellular medium to the interior of the cell by the action of abc type xenobiotic transporters 7 6 2 2 the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme requires an atp molecule to transport the xenobiotic as described in eq 6 6 atp h 2 o xenobiotic side 1 adp phosphate xenobiotic side 2 since both dcf c14h11cl2no2 and ibu c13h18o2 compounds with more than ten carbons besides containing aromatic rings can be used as substrate for the enzyme alpha methylacyl coa racemase ibuprofenoyl coa epimerase 5 1 99 4 furthermore the importance of catalase is worth mentioning 1 11 1 6 which acts as a pseudoperoxidase with affinity for ethanol as hydrogen donor and forming acetaldehyde through this reaction it is important to add ethanol as a co substrate in this process since under anaerobic or facultative anaerobic conditions the genera smithella desulfovibrio and desulfobulbus can use this alcohol as electron donor thus maintaining sufficient atp in the system through the addition of co substrates will favor the phosphorylation of such pharmaceuticals 34 67 80 regarding dcf it is noteworthy that due to the chlorine atoms in its molecular structure organisms from the phylum chloroflexi may be involved in its degradation and dehalogenation 34 because of the cytochrome p450 dependent pathway 81 in the present study chloroflexi was identified in greater relative abundance in phase iii 6 05 in relation to the other stages in the first step of carbazole degradation one of the intermediate compounds formed during the degradation of dcf and later for phenylacetate a common intermediate in the degradation of ibu 60 is catalyzed by the enzyme carbazole 1 9 Î± dioxygenase 1 14 12 22 eq 7 7 9 h carbazole nad p h h o 2 2 aminobiphenyl 2 3 diol nad p furthermore the degradation of dcf can occur through its reduction and removal of chlorine atoms followed by the decarboxylation of phenylacetate via Î² oxidation as well as benzoyl coa with the formation of acetate from acetyl coa 82 where these same compounds are intermediates in the cleavage of the aromatic rings of ibu 3 34 the addition of coenzyme a during the degradation of ibu and dcf occurs due to the action of the enzyme long chain fatty acid coa ligase 6 2 1 3 through the oxidation of an octane such as phenylacetate c8h8o2 which can occur by the reactions described in eqs 8 and 9 8 atp long chain fatty acid coa amp diphosphate acyl coa 9 atp r ibuprofen coa amp diphosphate r ibuprofenoyl coa it is worth noting that nitrate a compound added in the present study as nitrogen source is one of the main electron acceptors in the denitrification process where benzoyl coa is also generated as a common intermediate in the degradation of the pharmaceuticals studied 83 the degradation of dcf under denitrifying conditions can culminate in the formation of the intermediate nitrodiclofenac no dcf with subsequent formation of no2 dcf 1 several genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of organic acids and or alcohols were inferred in the analyzed samples fig s4 especially k04072 adhe involved in the expression of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase 1 1 1 1 responsible by the reaction described in eq 3 the interconversion between a primary alcohol into an aldehyde with concomitant reduction of an nad molecule higher proportions of this enzyme were inferred in phase iv 0 07 in relation to the other samples 0 03 0 04 probably due to the higher concentrations of acetic acid influent in this stage 53 6 mg l 1 when compared to the other phases 9 8 20 5 mg l 1 in addition to the total consumption of ethanol 100 mg l 1 in addition to adhe ko k00169 0 02 k00170 0 03 k00171 0 02 k00172 and k00700 0 02 were inferred in greater proportions in phase iv and these enzymes are related to different subunits of the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase family which decarboxylate different 2 oxoacids forming their coa derivatives from different substrates another highlight is that the mentioned ko were inferred in proportions 0 001 in the inoculum allowing to suppose that the conditions applied in the fbr both in relation to pharmaceuticals and in relation to ethanol and nitrate were favorable to the microorganisms that express such genes with the exception of k05349 bglx a Î² glucosidase involved in the hydrolysis of different complex carbon sources xylose galactose arabinose inferred in greater proportion in the inoculum biomass 0 04 and in lower concentrations in all fbr samples 0 01 possibly due to the absence of such carbohydrates in the reactor since the degradation of recalcitrant compounds depends on the presence of microorganisms containing the enzymatic apparatus required for their degradation the syntrophy between such organisms are extremely important in the microbial consortium used as inoculum the metabolic pathways involved in the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals ibu and dcf from ethanol and nitrate are summarized in fig 4 as well as the main genera identified and potentially related to each step 4 conclusion the operational conditions of the fbr both denitrifying and acidogenic favored the pharmaceuticals degradation under acidogenic conditions greater degradation of dcf and ibu was achieved in relation to heterotrophic denitrification with the highest efficiency obtained in phase iv acidogenic which showed greater removal efficiency of dcf 52 9 11 4 ibu 55 8 11 4 ethanol 99 7 1 2 and las 63 3 18 7 in the phases with predominantly heterotrophic denitrification i ii and iii nitrate removal was 93 and the main electron donor was ethanol for the varying hrt the reduction from 18 2 h to 12 1 h did not influence denitrification however there was a reduction in the efficiency of drug removal ethanol consumption and organic matter removal the fbr sludge consisted of bacteria related to denitrification acidovorax caldisericum dechloromonas zoogloea acinetobacter pseudomonas and anaerolineaceae while in the acidogenic phase the families geobacteraceae and spirochaetaceae were identified followed by the genera blvii28 wastewater sludge group and s50 wastewater sludge group both from the phylum bacteroidota in addition to denitrification it is known that some of these organisms may be involved in the degradation of pharmaceuticals such as rhodanobacter acidovorax and desulfovibrio phases i iii as well as geobacteraceae and spirochaetaceae in the acidogenic phase phase iv by inferring the functional profiles the metabolic potential related to the degradation of dcf and ibu were Ï‰ and Î² oxidation desulfonation aromatic ring cleavage and reductive

12809,the diclofenac dcf and ibuprofen ibu removal were assessed in an enlarged scale denitrifying fluidized bed reactor fbr fed with sanitary sewage plus ethanol 74 100 mg l 1 and nitrate 89 136 mg l 1 the experiment was sectioned into four phases in phase i the hydraulic retention time hrt was set in 18 3 h without dcf and ibu addition and the fbr shows a heterotrophic denitrifying behavior with 97 nitrate removal in phase ii the addition of pharmaceuticals did not change cod and nitrate removal in phase iii the hrt was decreased to 12 1 h which did not influence denitrification but decreased the efficiency of dcf 35 and ibu 40 removal in phases i ii and iii the removal of organic matter was limited by the concentration of influent nitrate the hrt was then increased in phase iv to 18 2 h and nitrate was not added to the feeding which led to denitrification no longer being the preferential route and replaced by acidogenic metabolism evidenced by the highest concentration and diversity of total volatile fatty acids vfa resulting in increased organic matter removal efficiency 56 dcf 53 ibu 56 and ethanol 99 7 in phase iv acidogenic bacteria were mainly responsible for dcf and ibu degradation by Ï‰ and Î² oxidation this study establishes that dcf and ibu biodegradation in fbr applied to sanitary sewage treatment in denitrifying condition is overcome by acidogenic metabolism in the absence of nitrate as an electron acceptor favoring the pharmaceuticals degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords micropollutants nitrate ethanol pharmaceuticals metataxonomic 1 introduction diclofenac dcf and ibuprofen ibu are non steroidal anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals recalcitrant 1 and widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases 2 after ingestion 40 of the parent compositions of metabolites and conjugates are excreted via urine which composes the sanitary sewage continuous exposure in non target organisms algae invertebrates and microorganisms can compromise ecosystem balance due to biological changes in metabolism such as inhibition of mobility and growth 3 thus there is an obvious need to evaluate and optimize the degradation of these pharmaceuticals in biological reactors in order to minimize their release into the environment 4 in structural terms dcf is a chlorinated aromatic and ibu consists of an aromatic ring linked to acetate and alkyl groups which complicates its degradation 5 however the addition of co substrates such as ethanol can facilitate this process and favor populations of the microbial consortium for degrading the target compounds 6 9 the co substrate may also energetically favor the degradation of recalcitrant compounds via induction of extracellular enzyme production and atp supply 10 11 the application of denitrifying bacteria is an attractive alternative for the removal of pharmaceuticals as it is indicated in the degradation of various organic pollutants and complex structures such as anionic surfactants 12 petroleum derived compounds such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex 13 and industrial additives 14 15 thus the use of denitrifying biomass is a favorable alternative for degrading diclofenac and ibuprofen diclofenac consists of aromatic chains and an amine group while ibuprofen is an aromatic compound that can be metabolized with ethanol via nitrate removal 5 16 nitrate reducing microorganisms such as pseudomonas can use the aniline group of the dcf molecule 17 while dechloromonas can catabolize the aromatic rings of ibu and dcf molecules as carbon and energy source 7 18 furthermore acidogenic genera acinetobacter and arthrobacter were identified and isolated with greater relative abundance in the degradation of the recalcitrant compound p nitrophenol while citrobacter was identified and isolated from sewage treatment plant reactors and associated with the degradation of a series of recalcitrant compounds converting the phenolic compound into mono and dichlorophenols 19 20 granatto et al 7 evaluated the removal of diclofenac ibuprofen propranolol and triclosan in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor on enlarged scale 69 l fed with sanitary sewage affluent from sÃ£o carlos sp brazil based on this study denitrifying bacteria were identified such as pseudomonas and members similar to caldisericum smithella blvii28 wastewater sludge group and bacteroides in the operational phase of greater removal of dcf 42 10 for 107 26 Î¼g l 1 influent ibu 50 15 for 164 47 Î¼g l 1 influent and triclosan tcs 85 15 for 185 148 Î¼g l 1 influent patroescu et al 21 compared the development of denitrifying bacteria based on nitrate removal in a fluidized fixed bed the authors obtained denitrification rates 2 5 times higher in a fluidized bed than in a fixed bed bioreactor which may be related to greater substrate transfer caused by the recirculation and bed movement thus corroborating the present study it can be inferred that the fluidized condition contributed to the denitrification adaptation via nitrate removal and possibly to the biofilm maturation in the presence of diclofenac and ibuprofen in the operational phases among the biological reactors studied the configuration of the fluidized bed reactor fbr is an alternative for the treatment of recalcitrant compounds mostly because of the dilution of the toxic compound due to the effluent recirculation in addition to the immobilization of microorganisms in a support medium favoring the contact of biomass with the substrate which contributes to greater mass transfer and degradation of organic compounds thus treatment efficiency is related to biofilm formation and development influent flow and the characteristics of the support medium 22 therefore the main objective of this research was to study the biodegradation of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac and ibuprofen in fbr on an increased scale fed with sanitary sewage supplemented with ethanol and or nitrate furthermore through the relationship between the physicochemical data of the reactor and the sequencing of the 16s rrna gene illumina from the biomass of the different operational phases the metataxonomic characterization and inference of the metabolic profile of the microbial community involved in the drug biodegradation was carried out it should be noted that this approach has not been carried out in previous studies and that the results described here may support future research on the removal of recalcitrant compounds in wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals and reagents diclofenac and ibuprofen were purchased from a compounding pharmacy with a degree of purity for human consumption table s1 shows the physicochemical properties of these compounds high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol and acetone were purchased from j t baker ecapetec mexico and mallinkrodt phillipsburg usa respectively formic acid 98 and ammonium hydroxide both used for hplc grade adsorption assays were purchased from sigma aldrich schweiz switzerland 2 2 reactor setup the fbr was built in polyvinyl chloride pvc and acrylic diameter of 0 20 m height of 4 m and a volume of 0 128 m3 the ascent velocity applied was 1 2 cm s 1 and 27 kg of sand 1 41 1 68 mm in diameter were used as support medium for the adhesion of microorganisms 23 before inoculation the sand received acid treatment in a 10 hydrofluoric acid solution to increase particle surface roughness and porosity this procedure was recommended to facilitate the biomass adhesion the reactor was installed at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the municipality of sÃ£o carlos sÃ£o paulo brazil and kept at room temperature the fbr was inoculated with 30 l of sludge from activated sludge system with 12 g l 1 of total volatile solids tvs and kept in a closed circuit for 30 days with sanitary sewage collected after preliminary treatment thick and fine grating and desander of the wwtp in sÃ£o carlos sp brazil the nitrate 150 0 25 5 mg l 1 and ethanol 100 0 38 0 mg l 1 were added to reaction volume 150 l and chemical oxygen demand cod was 400 52 mg l 1 the table 1 shows details of running conditions of each phase the microbial consortium of the activated sludge system includes protozoa heterotrophic aerobic bacteria facultative bacteria nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria moreover has proved greatest efficient in removal of carbon and nitrogen compounds 24 27 2 3 physicochemical and chromatographic analyses fbr influent and effluent samples were analyzed daily for ph nitrate chemical oxygen demand cod suspended volatile solids ssv according to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 27 partial and intermediate alkalinity was determined according to ripley et al 28 and the concentration of volatile organic acids voa and solvents was determined via gas chromatography with flame ionization detector gc fid with liquid liquid extraction lle according to adorno et al 29 the determination of the surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonated las was performed via high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a fluorescence detector hplc flc according to duarte et al 30 the determination of diclofenac and ibuprofen included treating the samples utilizing solid phase extraction cartridges spe and analyzed in ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms ms waters acquity uplc according to campanha et al 31 the uplc ms ms was operated with electrospray ionization source esi in both negative h and positive h modes and quantification was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode the dcf and ibu adsorbed on the sand was determined via mass spectrometry coupled ultra performance chromatography uplc ms ms with an acquity uplc beh c18 reversed phase column flow of 0 45 ml min 1 temperature of 40 c and detection limit of 0 08 ng l 1 therefore at the end of each operational phase a homogeneous sample was collected from the reactor sand bed followed by the extraction described by gago ferrero 32 2 4 diclofenac and ibuprofen mass balance the drug mass balance was evaluated in the phases with the best nitrate removal phase iii and the best drug removal phase iv thus the total mass of dcf and ibu added during the period of each phase was considered the total mass added to the influent minus the residual effluent and the mass adsorbed in the bed resulted in the degraded mass according to eqs s1 to s4 the supplementary material shows more details on the adsorption of dcf and ibu 2 5 taxonomic characterization genomic dna extraction and sequencing were performed on samples collected at the end of the fbr phases phase i iii and iv the biofilm samples were detached from the sand centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and the liquid phase was discarded next washing with 10 ml of phosphate buffer saline solution pbs 8 nacl 0 2 kcl 1 44 na2hpo4 0 24 kh2po4 was performed 33 centrifuged and stored at 4 c dna concentration and purity were evaluated using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington usa the absorbance ratio a260 a280 was in the range of 1 8 2 0 indicating the purity of the nucleic acids the size of the dna fragment 10 000 bp was verified by 0 8 agarose gel electrophoresis the sequencing of the variable region v3 v4 of the 16s rrna gene was performed by the facility ngs genomic solutions piracicaba sp brazil and the polymerase chain reaction pcr was performed using the 341f 806r primer set bacteria domain using the phusion high fidelity pcr master mix new england biolabs sequencing libraries were generated using the ultranbnext kit for illumina dna library new england biolabs ipswich usa following the manufacturer s recommendations the sequences were assembled and filtered qphred 33 to remove sequences containing low quality bases in addition to detecting and removing chimeras using the uchime algorithm sequence analysis was performed using uparse v7 0 101 software http drive5 com uparse whose 97 similarity sequences were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otu the taxonomic classification of otus was performed using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu the sequences were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under accession number prjna759422 the potential metabolic pathways involved in the pharmaceuticals degradation process diclofenac and ibuprofen were defined based on the study of granatto et al 34 the prediction of potential genes encoding enzymes involved in such pathways using the tax4fun2 v 1 1 6 35 in r language based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg 97 identity cutoff and on the comprehensive enzyme information system brenda database https www brenda enzymes org 2 6 statistical analysis the removal of diclofenac and ibuprofen was evaluated using a parametric kolmogorov smirnov model for normality testing followed by analysis of variance anova means were compared using tukey s test at 95 confidence level p 0 05 all statistical tests were performed using origin 2018 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the fbr was monitored for 258 days with influent organic matter of 378 1 78 1 mg cod l 1 for all operation phases the operating conditions and main results founded are shown in fig 1 the predominant metabolism in phase i was the dissimilative reduction of nitrate to nitrogen via heterotrophic denitrification since the removal of nitrate and organic matter was 97 2 3 7 and 60 0 11 6 respectively table 2 ethanol was the main electron donor to support denitrification this is seen by considering the theoretical cod of ethanol of 2 09 mg l 1 given by the stoichiometry of the oxidation reaction eq 1 thus the influent cod of phase i related to 74 7 35 5 mg l 1 of ethanol was 156 mg cod l 1 and represented 50 of the total cod 310 54 mg l 1 5 6 0 5 mg l 1 of ethanol were verified in the effluent which corresponded to 11 6 mg cod l 1 and represented 9 6 of the total cod effluent 122 37 mg l 1 the ethanol percentage variation cod equivalent from 50 influent to 9 6 effluent reinforces that this substrate was a preferential electron donor for denitrification furthermore the high nitrate removal efficiency associated with the occurrence of residual effluent cod 122 37 mg l 1 means that nitrate limited the removal of organic matter 1 c 2 h 3 o 3 o 2 2 c o 2 3 h 2 o the heterotrophic denitrification established in phase i is also verified by the difference of total alkalinity from 196 29 mg caco3 l 1 in the influent and 279 70 mg caco3 l 1 in the effluent and ph from 7 3 to 7 9 respectively probably the higher effluent alkalinity is related to heterotrophic denitrification which has the conversion of nitrate into nitrogen gas and bicarbonate eq 2 36 37 in stoichiometric terms for 1 0 mg of nitrate reduced to n2 3 6 mg of bicarbonate is produced this results in an increase in ph as seen in this study 2 ch 3 ooh 1 6 no 3 0 8 h 2 o 0 8 n 2 2 h 2 co 3 1 6 oh there were no significant changes in the removal of organic matter 51 0 10 5 and nitrate 93 4 6 5 with dcf 120 0 25 Î¼g l 1 and ibu 167 7 35 Î¼g l 1 in phase ii this phase showed that heterotrophic denitrification was also predominant and similar to the previous phase these conditions showed lower removal of dcf and ibu that is 27 6 12 and 30 3 22 respectively ethanol 92 3 8 0 an easily metabolized substrate as an electron donor in anoxic respiration was probably used 38 phase iii for hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 1 h showed that organic matter removal efficiency decreased to 37 0 8 8 which was significantly lower than phases i 60 0 11 6 and phase ii 51 10 5 however in relation to nitrate removal 93 2 2 6 no change was observed for removal efficiency in relation to the other phases in addition there was greater removal of dcf 35 2 19 and ibu 39 6 2 4 this behavior may have probably occurred due to the reduction in ethanol removal 70 5 2 3 this may have favored the use of other substrates as electron donors for denitrification these conditions showed that at lower hrt there was almost complete nitrate removal phase iv for hrt of 18 2 h the concentration of influent nitrate from sanitary sewage was 13 2 mg l 1 resulting in a ratio of organic matter and nitrate cod no3 of 33 7 much higher than that applied in phase i cod no3 2 28 phase ii cod no3 4 09 and phase iii cod no3 3 60 this phase iv condition provided lower nitrate removal of 32 6 16 2 consequently nitrate was not the preferred electron acceptor probably the concentration of influent nitrate 13 2 mg l 1 was insufficient to support denitrification as the preferential route possibly related to the imbalance of the system and favoring acidogenic populations due to the absence of nitrate as the main acceptor of electrons from anoxic respiration this phase showed the highest concentration and diversity of total volatile fatty acids vfa 226 23 mg l 1 fig 2 compared to the other phases this metabolic change from heterotrophic denitrification to acidogenesis resulted in increased organic matter removal efficiency 56 3 7 9 dcf 52 9 11 4 ibu 55 8 11 4 and ethanol 99 7 1 2 in relation to the other phases such as phase iii with 37 0 8 8 35 2 19 39 6 2 4 respectively kennes veiga et al 39 also evaluated the removal of several pharmaceuticals including dcf and ibu in an activated sludge system the sludge used as inoculum came from a sewage treatment plant and sodium acetate 200 mg cod l 1 and ammonium chloride 20 mg l 1 were added the authors reported removal efficiency of 5 for dcf 10 Î¼g l 1 influent and 20 for ibu 10 Î¼g l 1 influent with lower dcf concentration values than those observed in this work 66 4 14 3 Î¼g l 1 both in the predominantly denitrifying phases and in the acidogenic phase therefore based on these results greater removal of pharmaceuticals was observed under acidogenic conditions which is probably the most recommended metabolism since the removal efficiency of dcf and ibu in phase iv was higher compared to the other phases under mostly denitrifying conditions phases i ii and iii similar results from other studies can be seen the table 3 in addition to the pharmaceuticals sulfonated linear alkylbenzene las one of the most used surfactants in the world was also evaluated 42 which is part of the sanitary sewage composition due to the characteristic surface tension reduction surfactants increase the solubility of the compounds in the medium and can favor the degradation of the target compounds 43 however the typical concentration variation of the sanitary sewage can inhibit the bioprocess in phases i and ii influent las was observed at 1 47 0 96 mg l 1 to 4 52 2 99 mg l 1 respectively and with no alteration of heterotrophic denitrification since nitrate removal efficiency was higher than 90 20 in the phases in which this metabolism was predominant phases i ii and iii the maximum removal of las in the phases with nitrate addition phases i ii and iii and with predominantly denitrifying metabolism was 56 5 24 7 phase ii even with decrease in hrt to 12 1 h in phase iii there was no significant change in las removal efficiency 53 0 7 3 this may evidence that las was used as electron donor for denitrification since the reduction of tdh did not change the parameters las and nitrate removal in phase iv without nitrate added to the feeding the las removal efficiency increased to 63 3 18 7 for influent of 3 5 0 9 mg l 1 this behavior may have happened due to the non addition of nitrate to the feed which suppressed the denitrifying consortium due to the lack of the electron acceptor no3 leading them to be succeeded by an acidogenic population 42 43 44 the degradation of micropollutants via acidogenesis has been increasingly evidenced in different studies that include compounds such as the commercial surfactant tween 80 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoollate 44 tetrabromobisphenol a 8 las 45 ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole 46 47 carneiro et al 46 evaluated the degradation of 21 micropollutants in hydrolytic and acidogenic reactors and found that acidogenesis was the key step for the degradation of target compounds the micropollutants selected by the authors included four antibiotics sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim erythromycin and roxithromycin three musk fragrances galaxolide tonalide and celestolide three anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac four neurodrugs fluoxetine carbamazepine diazepam and citalopram four endocrine disruptors from household products bisphenol a triclosan 4 octylphenol and 4 nonylphenol and three estrogens estrone 17Î² estradiol e2 and 17Î± ethinylestradiol thus it can be inferred that acidogenesis may be the key factor for degrading dcf and ibu in sanitary sewage as well as the las surfactant 3 2 microbial characterization the microbial community was characterized so as to obtain information about its composition in the different phases of fbr operation inoculum phase i phase iii phase iv regarding the taxonomic classification for the bacteria domain representatives of seven phyla in different relative abundances were identified fig s2 regarding the inoculum sample there was a higher relative abundance of the phyla proteobacteria 65 55 verrumicrobiota 15 55 bacteroidetes 12 49 actinobacteria 2 36 and firmicutes 0 86 granatto et al 34 reported higher relative abundance of proteobacteria in batch reactors containing dcf and ibu similar to the present study the aforementioned authors used ethanol as a metabolic co substrate 200 mg cod l 1 however under methanogenic fermentative conditions the highest abundance 65 55 for the phylum proteobacteria whose members have large diversity and metabolic capacity may be related to the reactional and nutritional configuration of the activated sludge system also commonly identified in the biomass of anoxic reactors 48 49 the phyla proteobacteria 30 17 thermotogota 14 75 bacteroidetes 14 46 and firmicutes 9 97 were identified in phase i the phyla proteobacteria 24 42 campylobacteria 21 40 bacteroidetes 17 13 desulfobacteria 11 65 and chloroflexi 6 05 were identified in phase iii in the absence of nitrate and in hrt of 18 2 h the phyla desulfobacteria 35 21 spirochaeta 29 28 bacteroidetes 19 78 firmicutes 5 13 and thermotogota 3 55 were identified in phase iv thus the greatest differences between the identified phyla are related to proteobacteria due to their decreasing relative abundance both in relation to the inoculum and in relation to the biomass of the different reactor operation phases from 65 5 in the inoculum to 0 10 in phase iv based on this fact it is possible to infer that the operational characteristics of the fbr used in the present study were not favorable to the bacteria of this phylum since in this reaction configuration there is high turbulence of the liquid mass recirculation and microbial growth in the form of biofilm adhered to the support material furthermore during phase iv nitrate electron acceptor was removed from the fbr feed which may have directly interfered with other metabolic possibilities thus influencing changes in populations especially those related to this phylum on the other hand the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased in relation to the inoculum and that of phase iv from 12 49 to 19 78 respectively some characteristics of the organisms of this phylum are their potential to degrade high molecular weight compounds such as proteins and carbohydrates 50 furthermore it has been reported in previous research that this phylum is related to the degradation of pharmaceuticals including ibu in hospital wastewater containing 10 Î¼g ibu l 1 51 52 according to gallardo altamirano et al 51 the degradation of active pharmaceutical compounds can occur by members of this phylum both under anaerobic and anoxic conditions which may justify the consistency of their relative abundance throughout the fbr operation both in the phases containing no3 phases i and iii or without no3 phase iv it can also be inferred that the operational conditions applied in the fbr were favorable to desulfobacterota since its relative abundance increased from 0 01 in the inoculum to 29 28 in phase iv members of this phylum perform sulfate reduction and degradation of aromatic compounds 53 according to granatto et al 54 who monitored for 12 h the composition of the same domestic sewage used in the present study from the wwtp in sÃ£o carlos sp brazil the sulfate concentration was 82 0 56 5 mg l 1 thus it can be inferred that the feed of the fbr reactor in phase i favored the establishment of bacteria of this phylum due to sulfate in addition to the pharmaceuticals that were part of the feed of the later phases phases ii and iii 55 which favored greater relative abundance also regarding the change in the relative abundance of the different phyla identified there was low relative abundance of chloroflexi 0 02 0 84 respectively both in the inoculum and in phase i however phase iii exhibited substantial increase 6 05 possibly due to the addition of ibu and dcf at this stage since organisms of this phylum can participate in the degradation of halogenated compounds and have affinity with the chlorine atoms that compose the dcf molecule 34 56 some of the steps needed to degrade dcf and ibu such as cleavage of aromatic compounds and reductive dechlorination may be related to representatives of the geobacteraceae family 57 greater degradation of dcf and ibu was observed in phase iv possibly related to the predominant relative abundance of both this family 28 85 and spirochaetaceae with 27 9 in phase iv 2 8 in phase iii 1 6 in phase i according to medina et al 57 such families are composed of bacteria with acidogenic metabolism therefore with the increase in vfa concentration in the fbr effluent in phase iv 226 23 mg hac l 1 it can be inferred that this pathway was favored in the absence of nitrate in addition to a higher total concentration of vfa in phase iv there was also greater difference in the composition of organic acids in which acetic propionic isobutyric butyric isovaleric valeric caproic and n butanol acids were observed while in the other phases there was a predominance of acetic acid table 2 a total of 19 genera were represented fig 3 and each genus was among the 5 most abundant in at least one of the samples in the nitrate feeding phases phase i ii and iii denitrifying genera were identified in the fluidized bed reactor such as rhodanobacter 25 33 acidovorax 9 38 caldisericum 6 55 desulfovibrio 3 62 dechloromonas 2 78 thauera 2 20 zoogloea 0 46 acinetobacter 0 36 and pseudomonas 0 11 the occurrence of these denitrifying genera probably favored nitrate removal which reached 98 in phases i and iii as mentioned earlier the dissimilative reduction of nitrate to nitrogen was possibly predominant in phase i as nitrate removal was 97 2 3 7 thus it can be inferred that ethanol was the main electron donor in this stage of heterotrophic denitrification similarly in phase iii the observed nitrate removal was 93 2 2 6 it is worth mentioning that in addition to denitrifying it is known that some of these genera may be involved in the degradation of pharmaceuticals such as rhodanobacter acidovorax 58 and desulfovibrio 59 60 rhodanobacter the genus identified in greater relative abundance in the inoculum 25 33 was also identified in samples from the other phases at 0 01 thus it is possible to infer that the operational conditions applied in the fbr were not favorable to these bacteria rhodanobacter is a common genus in activated sludge systems and this result is consistent with the characteristics of the inoculum used in the present study however according to navrozidou et al 58 such bacteria may be related to the degradation of anti inflammatory and non steroidal pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac and ibuprofen acidovorax identified in greater relative abundance in phases i and iii 9 38 and 2 38 respectively are chemoorganotrophic bacteria that metabolize organic acids amino acids and carbohydrates as substrates in addition to nitrate as an electron acceptor via heterotrophic denitrification 59 in addition acidovorax are commonly identified in sewage treatment plant reactors and reported to participate in the degradation of anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals 58 and antibiotics and also usually related to the degradation of aromatic compounds 59 therefore it can be inferred that the addition of nitrate had a positive effect on the prevalence of these organisms similarly zhou et al 61 observed a positive relationship between the prevalence of this genus with the presence of nitrate and the removal of total nitrogen in sequential batch reactors with sanitary sewage plus 1 5 mg l 1 of influent ibu phase i nitrate 136 59 mg l 1 ethanol 74 7 9 2 mg l 1 in hrt 18 3 h phase iii nitrate 100 10 mg l 1 ethanol 98 0 16 8 mg l 1 in hrt 12 1 h phase iv ethanol 89 6 39 2 mg l 1 in hrt 18 2 h n i unidentified genus bacteria of the genus caldisericum are strict anaerobes and chemoorganotrophs which consume carbohydrates and produce short chain fatty acids by reducing sulfur compounds this genus was identified in greater relative abundance in the biomass of phase i members of this genus are related to the degradation of phenolic compounds 62 the genera thauera geobacter and desulfovibrio have been widely reported to have drug degrading potential 5 54 63 64 desulfovibrio are anaerobic sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria capable of degrading carbohydrates amino acids aromatic compounds in addition to performing desulfonation 59 60 thauera has been widely recognized for its denitrifying capacity and for degrading phenolic compounds 65 geobacter was identified in greater relative abundance in phase iv 28 85 in the absence of influent nitrate since these microorganisms are strict anaerobes and iron reducers the absence of nitrate may have favored the increase in the relative abundance of this genus according to the monitoring of domestic sewage carried out by granatto et al 54 wwtp of sÃ£o carlos sp brazil the total iron concentration was between 0 005 and 2 2 mg l 1 in contrast zoogloea was identified in greater relative abundance in phase i 0 46 and phase iii 0 20 and in both phases nitrate was added to the fbr feed 136 59 and 100 10 mg l 1 respectively this genus has been recognized for its ability to degrade aromatic compounds 59 and recalcitrant compounds such as oils and greases 66 delforno et al 67 okada et al 68 and andrade et al 48 related this genus to the removal of aromatic compounds in laundry wastewater as reported by the aforementioned authors the relative abundance of zoogloea was 0 1 15 8 and 22 14 in biomass from egsb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and fbr reactors respectively in addition to the bacteria mentioned other denitrifying bacteria were identified in smaller proportions such as acinetobacter especially in phase i 0 36 bacteria of this genus have highly versatile metabolism and have been reported in biological systems due to their degradation potential and tolerance to recalcitrant compounds 69 71 similarly to the present study granatto et al 7 performed the taxonomic characterization of the egsb biomass on an increased scale fed with sanitary sewage wwtp of sÃ£o carlos sp brazil plus 200 mg cod l 1 of co substrate ethanol ethanol methanol or fumarate in addition to the dcf and ibu according to the authors ethanol was the co substrate that most favored drug removal and the main genera identified under such conditions were syntrophobacter smithella macellibacteroides syntrophus blvii28 wastewater sludge group bacteroides and caldisericum these microorganisms were also identified in the present study and related to the degradation of dcf and ibu in the presence of ethanol as a co substrate gusmÃ£o et al 72 identified bacteroides in a horizontal fixed bed reactor operated in a plug flow system for the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons btex in the nitrate phase as an electron acceptor for denitrifying bacteria the formation of an anaerobic zone favored by the plug flow system can occur in this system providing minimum conditions for the bacteria of this genus the main genera of the desulfobacterota phylum identified in phase iv were desulfovibrio 3 62 geobacter 3 16 and desulfobulbus 2 21 usually described as gram negative anaerobes and sulfate reducers promoting the incomplete oxidation of lactate to acetate 59 representatives of these genera are fundamental in the desulfonation and degradation of sulfonated aromatic compounds such as las anionic surfactant 48 54 73 thus their importance for the degradation of dcf can be inferred as this compound has aromatic rings in its molecular conformation in addition the sulfate from the domestic sewage composition used to feed the reactor may have favored such organisms the predominant genera identified in phase i with addition of nitrate and ethanol and hrt of 18 3 h were the bacteria similar to fervidobacterium 14 71 acidovorax 9 38 tepidiphilus 7 89 caldisericum 6 55 in addition to comamonadaceae hydrogenedensaceae streptococcus and dechloromonas with relative abundance 4 0 organisms of the genus fervidobacterium are strict anaerobes and fermenters of a wide variety of carbohydrates including glucose starch lactose and sucrose and do not use vfa and alcohols for growth 2 the highest abundance of this genus was 14 71 and occurred in phase i while in phase iii this value reduced to 0 17 in phase iii dcf and ibu were added to the reactor feed however the presence of the pharmaceuticals may not have been the cause of the reduction in the relative abundance since there was a slight increase of this genus in phase iv 3 55 which also had the pharmaceuticals thus the reduction in relative abundance in phase iii was probably caused by the reduction of hrt to 12 1 h while in phase i and iv it was 18 3 h and 18 2 h respectively the reduction of hrt implies in increasing the applied organic load leading to changes in microbial composition 74 and this fact was probably determining for the variation of fervidobacterium abundance tepidiphilus of the class betaproteobacteria are producers of catalases and oxidases and important in reducing nitrate these organisms are chemoorganotrophs and use organic acids as the only carbon source 75 in this study this genus was identified in relative abundance of 7 89 in phase i and 10 66 in phase iii the affluent nitrate probably favored this genus in phase iii at the end of phase iii hrt 12 1 h bacteria similar to arcobacter 19 89 were identified in greater relative abundance in the biofilm adhered to the sand microorganisms of this genus are facultative aerobes and chemoorganotrophs and use organic acids and carbohydrates as carbon source in addition to assimilating nitrate as electron acceptor 76 frÃ³es et al 77 identified prevalence 90 of this genus in samples of hospital effluent from rio de janeiro rj brazil with the same organic matter concentration 397 mg cod l 1 obtained in this study for phase iii of the fbr 400 mg cod l 1 on the other hand this genus was not identified in phase iv hrt 18 2 h possibly due to the selective pressure of higher hrt even in the presence of pharmaceuticals and domestic sewage in phase iv of the reactor there were higher proportions of geobacteraceae 28 85 spirochaetaceae 27 98 blvii28 wastewater sludge group 12 62 and s50 wastewater sludge group 6 41 in addition to desulfomicrobium 4 39 fervidobacterium 3 55 peptococcaceae 3 44 and anaerolineaceae 1 61 bacteria similar to blvii28 wastewater sludge group perform Î² Ï‰ oxidation and participate in the degradation of aromatic rings similar to that observed in the present study wang et al 78 reported a positive correlation of the relative abundance of the genus blvii28 wastewater sludge group 5 01 with removal efficiency of organic matter and recalcitrant compounds in petrochemical wastewater possibly due to its tolerance to toxic compounds and versatility for degrading aromatic constituents the increase in hrt in phase iv 18 2 h in addition to the suppression of influent nitrate resulted in a higher cod no3 ratio 33 7 when compared to the other phases 2 28 4 09 and 3 60 respectively negatively affecting the heterotrophic denitrification since nitrate is no longer the preferred electron acceptor with removal from 93 2 2 6 to 32 6 16 2 and higher ethanol consumption from 70 5 2 3 to 99 7 1 2 thus it may be inferred that the influent nitrate concentration in phase iv led to the imbalance of denitrifying populations in the fbr hence favoring acidogenic populations due to the absence of nitrate as the main electron acceptor of anoxic respiration 37 3 3 functional profile inference after metabolic inference via tax4fun2 the plausible kos related to the analyzed samples were observed totaling 7116 ko for the inoculum sample 7304 for the phase i sample 7310 for phase iii and 4543 for phase iv which allowed to calculate their percentage in the metabolic pathways of interest it is worth mentioning that the tool applied for predicting genes encoding of the possible enzymes involved in the process infers the functional content of microbial genes based on the information related to the genome of organisms taxonomically closest to those identified in the samples based on the rrna 16s prokaryotic sequencing data 35 metabolic levels related to both drug degradation and ethanol and nitrate removal were filtered according to categories of the kegg database fig s3 the level with the highest proportions was the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in the inoculum sample 0 9 phase i 0 8 and phase iii 1 1 possibly due to the significant Î² oxidation 34 67 79 in the degradation of pharmaceuticals in addition to the facultative anaerobic potential of the biomass involved in the process it is noteworthy that the aerobic biotransformation steps of ibu hydroxylation carboxylation decarboxylation can occur even under anaerobic conditions 34 additionally in relation to the pathways directly involved in the degradation of pharmaceuticals the degradation of aromatic compounds 0 3 0 6 and the degradation of benzoate 0 1 0 8 are also emphasized with the conversion of the benzoyl coa molecule into acetyl coa and or acetaldehyde and pyruvate furthermore similar proportions were observed for the glycolytic pathway in all analyzed samples 0 9 in which this pathway is extremely important for the assimilation of ethanol through its conversion into acetaldehyde eq 3 which can then be metabolized to acetate eq 4 and or acetyl coa eq 5 3 ethanol na d acetaldehyde nadh h 4 acetaldehyde na d h 2 o acetate nadh h 5 acetaldehyde coa na d acetylcoa nadh h the biodegradation of dcf and ibu begins after their transport from the extracellular medium to the interior of the cell by the action of abc type xenobiotic transporters 7 6 2 2 the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme requires an atp molecule to transport the xenobiotic as described in eq 6 6 atp h 2 o xenobiotic side 1 adp phosphate xenobiotic side 2 since both dcf c14h11cl2no2 and ibu c13h18o2 compounds with more than ten carbons besides containing aromatic rings can be used as substrate for the enzyme alpha methylacyl coa racemase ibuprofenoyl coa epimerase 5 1 99 4 furthermore the importance of catalase is worth mentioning 1 11 1 6 which acts as a pseudoperoxidase with affinity for ethanol as hydrogen donor and forming acetaldehyde through this reaction it is important to add ethanol as a co substrate in this process since under anaerobic or facultative anaerobic conditions the genera smithella desulfovibrio and desulfobulbus can use this alcohol as electron donor thus maintaining sufficient atp in the system through the addition of co substrates will favor the phosphorylation of such pharmaceuticals 34 67 80 regarding dcf it is noteworthy that due to the chlorine atoms in its molecular structure organisms from the phylum chloroflexi may be involved in its degradation and dehalogenation 34 because of the cytochrome p450 dependent pathway 81 in the present study chloroflexi was identified in greater relative abundance in phase iii 6 05 in relation to the other stages in the first step of carbazole degradation one of the intermediate compounds formed during the degradation of dcf and later for phenylacetate a common intermediate in the degradation of ibu 60 is catalyzed by the enzyme carbazole 1 9 Î± dioxygenase 1 14 12 22 eq 7 7 9 h carbazole nad p h h o 2 2 aminobiphenyl 2 3 diol nad p furthermore the degradation of dcf can occur through its reduction and removal of chlorine atoms followed by the decarboxylation of phenylacetate via Î² oxidation as well as benzoyl coa with the formation of acetate from acetyl coa 82 where these same compounds are intermediates in the cleavage of the aromatic rings of ibu 3 34 the addition of coenzyme a during the degradation of ibu and dcf occurs due to the action of the enzyme long chain fatty acid coa ligase 6 2 1 3 through the oxidation of an octane such as phenylacetate c8h8o2 which can occur by the reactions described in eqs 8 and 9 8 atp long chain fatty acid coa amp diphosphate acyl coa 9 atp r ibuprofen coa amp diphosphate r ibuprofenoyl coa it is worth noting that nitrate a compound added in the present study as nitrogen source is one of the main electron acceptors in the denitrification process where benzoyl coa is also generated as a common intermediate in the degradation of the pharmaceuticals studied 83 the degradation of dcf under denitrifying conditions can culminate in the formation of the intermediate nitrodiclofenac no dcf with subsequent formation of no2 dcf 1 several genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of organic acids and or alcohols were inferred in the analyzed samples fig s4 especially k04072 adhe involved in the expression of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase 1 1 1 1 responsible by the reaction described in eq 3 the interconversion between a primary alcohol into an aldehyde with concomitant reduction of an nad molecule higher proportions of this enzyme were inferred in phase iv 0 07 in relation to the other samples 0 03 0 04 probably due to the higher concentrations of acetic acid influent in this stage 53 6 mg l 1 when compared to the other phases 9 8 20 5 mg l 1 in addition to the total consumption of ethanol 100 mg l 1 in addition to adhe ko k00169 0 02 k00170 0 03 k00171 0 02 k00172 and k00700 0 02 were inferred in greater proportions in phase iv and these enzymes are related to different subunits of the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase family which decarboxylate different 2 oxoacids forming their coa derivatives from different substrates another highlight is that the mentioned ko were inferred in proportions 0 001 in the inoculum allowing to suppose that the conditions applied in the fbr both in relation to pharmaceuticals and in relation to ethanol and nitrate were favorable to the microorganisms that express such genes with the exception of k05349 bglx a Î² glucosidase involved in the hydrolysis of different complex carbon sources xylose galactose arabinose inferred in greater proportion in the inoculum biomass 0 04 and in lower concentrations in all fbr samples 0 01 possibly due to the absence of such carbohydrates in the reactor since the degradation of recalcitrant compounds depends on the presence of microorganisms containing the enzymatic apparatus required for their degradation the syntrophy between such organisms are extremely important in the microbial consortium used as inoculum the metabolic pathways involved in the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals ibu and dcf from ethanol and nitrate are summarized in fig 4 as well as the main genera identified and potentially related to each step 4 conclusion the operational conditions of the fbr both denitrifying and acidogenic favored the pharmaceuticals degradation under acidogenic conditions greater degradation of dcf and ibu was achieved in relation to heterotrophic denitrification with the highest efficiency obtained in phase iv acidogenic which showed greater removal efficiency of dcf 52 9 11 4 ibu 55 8 11 4 ethanol 99 7 1 2 and las 63 3 18 7 in the phases with predominantly heterotrophic denitrification i ii and iii nitrate removal was 93 and the main electron donor was ethanol for the varying hrt the reduction from 18 2 h to 12 1 h did not influence denitrification however there was a reduction in the efficiency of drug removal ethanol consumption and organic matter removal the fbr sludge consisted of bacteria related to denitrification acidovorax caldisericum dechloromonas zoogloea acinetobacter pseudomonas and anaerolineaceae while in the acidogenic phase the families geobacteraceae and spirochaetaceae were identified followed by the genera blvii28 wastewater sludge group and s50 wastewater sludge group both from the phylum bacteroidota in addition to denitrification it is known that some of these organisms may be involved in the degradation of pharmaceuticals such as rhodanobacter acidovorax and desulfovibrio phases i iii as well as geobacteraceae and spirochaetaceae in the acidogenic phase phase iv by inferring the functional profiles the metabolic potential related to the degradation of dcf and ibu were Ï‰ and Î² oxidation desulfonation aromatic ring cleavage and reductive dechlorination the main genes potentially involved were those encoding the enzymes Î± methylacyl coa racemase ibuprofenoyl coa epimerase and carbazole 1 9 Î± dioxygenase declaration of competing
