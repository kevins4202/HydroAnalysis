their adverse impacts on environment a three year 2019 2021 field trials of watermelon was conducted to evaluate the effects of if on yields and irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency of watermelon in a plastic greenhouse the soil moisture was monitored with sensors fdr in the field in real time and interconnected with the computing devices embedded in the internet of things iot to automatically control the irrigation and fertilization the lower upper limit of irrigation and the wetting soil depth were controlled accordingly to the crop stage the fertilization rates were allocated based on the nutrient uptake characteristics of watermelon at different growth stages the results showed the dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 k2o uptakes of watermelon were fitted well with the s logistic growth function the average proportions of dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 and k2o uptakes during the fruit expanding stage to the whole growth stage were 79 0 67 9 72 4 and 71 8 respectively if significantly reduced the application rates of irrigation water n p2o5 and k2o by 33 46 72 and 57 respectively without compromising watermelon yield and fruit quality the irrigation water use efficiency partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency in three years were increased significantly the mechanism of if treatment could be explained by tailoring the water and nutrient needs of crop by increasing root characteristics of watermelon to the water and nutrient uptake and translocation capacity of the root system intelligent drip fertigation is an efficient way to realize water and fertilizer space time coupling and improve water and nutrient use efficiency keywords drip irrigation nutrient uptake fruit quality root morphology water and nutrient use efficiency data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction watermelon citrullus lanatus thunb matsum nakai is an important cash crop worldwide yavuz et al 2020 miller et al 2014 watermelon plants have an indeterminate growth habit and develop new branches flowers and fruits until environmental conditions prevent further growth tanemura et al 2008 cabello et al 2011 balancing the vegetative and reproductive growth is important for the yield and quality of watermelon strong vegetative growth or early reproductive growth will affect fruit yields due to delaying the fruit setting or inhibiting the vegetative growth ma et al 2015 therefore maintaining a proper balance of vegetative growth and reproductive growth is key to maximize fruit yield and quality of watermelon water is an important factor affecting balance of vegetative growth and reproductive growth of plant abdelkhalik et al 2019 erdem and yuksel 2003 steduto et al 2012 watermelon yield is highest when the irrigation rate is at 100 evapotranspiration et abdelkhalik et al 2019 leskovar et al 2004 rouphael et al 2008 however too much water reduced the fruit quality of watermelon li et al 2018 watermelon is more sensitive to water stress at the flowering and fruit setting stages than at the fruit expanding or vine stretching stages and less sensitive to water stress at the maturing stage erdem and yuksel 2003 ma and tian 2016 moderate water stress during the flowering and fruit setting stages has less effect on watermelon yield gonzález et al 2009 nutrient is another factor affecting the balance of vegetative and reproductive growth of plant tegen et al 2021 filho et al 2015 thus irrigation and fertilization based on the characteristics of water and nutrient requirements of watermelon at different growth stages are the prerequisite for balancing its vegetative and reproductive growth china is the largest producer of watermelon with 1 41 million ha planted aera and 60 25 million tons yield in 2020 accounting for 46 1 and 59 3 of the world total planted area and yield respectively fao 2022 approximately 57 8 of watermelon in china is produced under protected greenhouse cultivation bie et al 2019 due to the absence of precipitation under greenhouse cultivation irrigation is critical to better control water and nutrients in production drip fertigation is widely used in protected greenhouse cultivation azad et al 2018 nayebloie et al 2022 judicious drip fertigation can make the fertilizer use efficiency in the current season reach more than 70 which is the most effective technology to reduce the fertilizer rate increase fertilizer use efficiency and conserve water resources hu et al 2021 however the excessive fertilization and irrigation in watermelon cultivation is still very common in china due to chinese farmers have poor scientific knowledge of reasonable irrigation and fertilization for example the basal fertilizer proportion is usually too high guo et al 2020 hong et al 2022 it results in a series of problems such as low yield and fruit quality pests and diseases hong et al 2021 soil salinization high accumulation of nitrate in soil bai et al 2020 lv et al 2019 azad et al 2020 hence it is necessary to establish the fertilization and irrigation management schedule suitable for drip fertigation systems and integrated with the local climate soil characteristics and cultivation methods the evapotranspiration is key parameter to determine irrigation rates and schedule abdelkhalik et al 2019 leskovar et al 2004 rouphael et al 2008 however this is difficult time consuming and especially is affected by many factors such as climate cultivation season and cultivation method in addition the irrigation scheme obtained from one trial may be not suitable for other areas or seasons and is more difficult to be implemented by the small hold farmers with poor knowledge soil moisture status is a more stable indicator to determine the irrigation starting point and irrigation rate zhang et al 2021 in recent years soil moisture sensors wireless communication and data platforms have made significant technological advances and have reduced costs khelifa et al 2015 coates et al 2013 haule and michael 2014 mafuta et al 2012 mason et al 2019 they can interconnect with computer devices by embedding them in daily objects and connecting them to the internet of things iot the intelligent drip fertigation system makes it possible for scientifically determining the scheduling irrigation through real time data on soil moisture conditions in the field from wireless sensor networks and combines the nutrient requirements of crops at different growth stages to achieve automatic irrigation and fertilization this has become a valuable tool in modern agriculture especially in the greenhouse cultivation nayebloie et al 2022 azad et al 2019 therefore the objectives of this study are i to determine the nutrient uptake characteristics of watermelon at different growth stages ii to compare the growth and nutrient uptake of watermelon under intelligent drip fertigation if and conventional drip fertigation cf and iii to evaluate the if s water and fertilizer saving effect and optimize the watermelon intelligent drip fertigation mode 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted

at the different periods of intelligent drip fertigation of our study had met the water and nutrient requirements of watermelon throughout the growth period therefore it ensured the watermelon yield and quality obviously if is an efficient way to increase irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency without yield penalty while reducing the adverse environmental impacts of excessive irrigation and fertilization however compared to the nutrient uptakes by crops the applied nutrients were still high indicating there is still space to reduce the fertilizer rates compared to fp treatment the if treatment has saved the 46 72 of the fertilizers and 29 37 of irrigation water it indicates that the over use of water and nutrients is very severe in watermelon production in the study region our recent study at the national scale also found that the average fertilizer rates of n p2o5 and k2o of watermelon by farmers in different regions of china were respectively 1 3 3 0 1 9 5 5 and 0 3 2 5 times compared with the recommended rate the reduction potential of chemical fertilizers n p2o5 and k2o were 22 7 66 5 47 8 81 7 and 187 1 59 4 respectively with an average of 43 0 68 7 and 12 2 respectively bao et al 2022 it is also the situation in other intensive agricultural systems in china such as orchards and solar greenhouses bai et al 2020 gao et al 2021 the reasons for the over use of water and nutrients in china are a complicated issue the growers are usually the elderly and have limited knowledge on water and nutrient management especially on the drip fertigation growing watermelon and other horticultural crops provides a high income to the farmers in relative to cereals therefore to secure their income they usually add high rates of water and fertilizers to solve the problem except for further studying to provide sound fertilization recommendation for farmers establishing the adequate extension services is also important the experiences of western countries to impose the strict regulations to limit the nutrient inputs in agriculture since late 1980 s indicate that fertilization and nutrient management is also an institutional issue de vries et al 2022 however as the largest country in consuming and producing inorganic fertilizers in the world china is still in its early stage to develop such policies although intelligent fertigation is an efficient way to increase irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency without yield penalty the high cost is still an obstacle to limit its use in most of farmers greenhouses in china at this stage however with the increasing labor cost and more attention to save water and fertilizer resources intelligent fertigation is considered as the direction of agricultural development in china in the future 4 2 the mechanism of intelligent drip fertigation increased irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency our results found that the average proportions of dry matter accumulation n p2o5 and k2o uptake in the fruit expanding stage to the whole growth stage were 79 68 72 and 72 respectively table 3 indicating that the fruit expanding stage is key stage for water and nutrient management this is consistent to other studies chen et al 2016 kang et al 2018 compared to fp treatment the if treatment reduced the fertilizer rates and high proportions of n p2o5 and k2o were added at the fruit setting and fruit expanding stages which met the nutrient demand of watermelon at the key growth stages additionally the irrigation was controlled by the fdr sensors with different lower upper limit of irrigation and the wetting soil depth at the different periods of watermelon which met the water requirement of plant this is the main mechanism for intelligent drip fertigation increasing water and nutrient use efficiency without compromising watermelon yields the root system is the main organ for water and nutrient uptake by plants roots 2 mm in diameter are classified as fine roots where 0 1 mm roots have a large absorption surface area and high physiological activity and their main role is to absorb water and nutrients from the soil mccormack et al 2015 in contrast 1 2 mm roots have well developed xylem ducts and are usually responsible for transporting water and nutrients to larger diameter classes of roots roots 2 mm in diameter are classified as coarse roots which are mainly responsible for transporting water and nutrients to the aboveground parts and had transport and storage functions freschet and roumet 2017 the high rates of water and fertilizer under mulch fertigation was found hindering the respiration of fine roots 2 mm the physiological function and root morphological indices root biomass root length and root tips wang et al 2021 grasso et al 2020 our results showed that if treatment significantly increased the root number of 0 1 mm roots root tips and significantly increased the root length root surface area and root volume of 0 4 mm roots compared to fp and there was no significant difference among treatments in the 4 mm roots there were significantly positive correlations among irrigation water use efficiency and n p2o5 k2o use efficiency and root parameters fig 9 indicating that the intelligent fertigation system regulated watermelon root morphology through precise irrigation and fertilization and consequently increased the root s ability to absorb and translocate water and nutrients to improve irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency this may be another physiological mechanism for intelligent drip fertigation increasing water and nutrient use efficiency without compromising watermelon yields 5 conclusion the dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 k2o uptakes of watermelon were fitted well with the s logistic growth function the fruit expanding stage is key stage for dry matter accumulation n p2o5 and k2o uptake and the average proportions of dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 and k2o nutrient uptake in this stage to the whole growth stage were 79 0 67 9 72 4 and 71 8 respectively if significantly reduced the application rates of irrigation water n p2o5 and k2o by 33 1 46 72 and 57 respectively without compromising watermelon yield and fruit quality and significantly increased the iwue nutrient use efficiency the mechanism of if treatment could be explained by increasing root characteristics of watermelon to the water and nutrient uptake and translocation capacity of the root system therefore intelligent drip fertigation is a sustainable solution for protected agriculture to save water

their adverse impacts on environment a three year 2019 2021 field trials of watermelon was conducted to evaluate the effects of if on yields and irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency of watermelon in a plastic greenhouse the soil moisture was monitored with sensors fdr in the field in real time and interconnected with the computing devices embedded in the internet of things iot to automatically control the irrigation and fertilization the lower upper limit of irrigation and the wetting soil depth were controlled accordingly to the crop stage the fertilization rates were allocated based on the nutrient uptake characteristics of watermelon at different growth stages the results showed the dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 k2o uptakes of watermelon were fitted well with the s logistic growth function the average proportions of dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 and k2o uptakes during the fruit expanding stage to the whole growth stage were 79 0 67 9 72 4 and 71 8 respectively if significantly reduced the application rates of irrigation water n p2o5 and k2o by 33 46 72 and 57 respectively without compromising watermelon yield and fruit quality the irrigation water use efficiency partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency in three years were increased significantly the mechanism of if treatment could be explained by tailoring the water and nutrient needs of crop by increasing root characteristics of watermelon to the water and nutrient uptake and translocation capacity of the root system intelligent drip fertigation is an efficient way

efficiency data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction watermelon citrullus lanatus thunb matsum nakai is an important cash crop worldwide yavuz et al 2020 miller et al 2014 watermelon plants have an indeterminate growth habit and develop new branches flowers and fruits until environmental conditions prevent further growth tanemura et al 2008 cabello et al 2011 balancing the vegetative and reproductive growth is important for the yield and quality of watermelon strong vegetative growth or early reproductive growth will affect fruit yields due to delaying the fruit setting or inhibiting the vegetative growth ma et al 2015 therefore maintaining a proper balance of vegetative growth and reproductive growth is key to maximize fruit yield and quality of watermelon water is an important factor affecting balance of vegetative growth and reproductive growth of plant abdelkhalik et al 2019 erdem and yuksel 2003 steduto et al 2012 watermelon yield is highest when the irrigation rate is at 100 evapotranspiration et abdelkhalik et al 2019 leskovar et al 2004 rouphael et al 2008 however too much water reduced the fruit quality of watermelon li et al 2018 watermelon is more sensitive to water stress at the flowering and fruit setting stages than at the fruit expanding or vine stretching stages and less sensitive to water stress at the maturing stage erdem and yuksel 2003 ma and tian 2016 moderate water stress during the flowering and fruit setting stages has less effect on watermelon yield gonzález et al 2009 nutrient is another factor affecting the balance of vegetative and reproductive growth of plant tegen et al 2021 filho et al 2015 thus irrigation and fertilization based on the characteristics of water and nutrient requirements of watermelon at different growth stages are the prerequisite for balancing its vegetative and reproductive growth china is the largest producer of watermelon with 1 41 million ha planted aera and 60 25 million tons yield in 2020 accounting for 46 1 and 59 3 of the world total planted area and yield respectively fao 2022 approximately 57 8 of watermelon in china is produced under protected greenhouse cultivation bie et al 2019 due to the absence of precipitation under greenhouse cultivation irrigation is critical to better control water and nutrients in production drip fertigation is widely used in protected greenhouse cultivation azad et al 2018 nayebloie et al 2022 judicious drip fertigation can make the fertilizer use efficiency in the current season reach more than 70 which is the most effective technology to reduce the fertilizer rate increase fertilizer use efficiency and conserve water resources hu et al 2021 however the excessive fertilization and irrigation in watermelon cultivation is still very common in china due to chinese farmers have poor scientific knowledge of reasonable irrigation and fertilization for example the basal fertilizer proportion is usually too high guo et al 2020 hong et al 2022 it results in a series of problems such as low yield and fruit quality pests and diseases hong et al 2021 soil salinization high accumulation of nitrate in soil bai et al 2020 lv et al 2019 azad et al 2020 hence it is necessary to establish the fertilization and irrigation management schedule suitable for drip fertigation systems and integrated with the local climate soil characteristics and cultivation methods the evapotranspiration is key parameter to determine irrigation rates and schedule abdelkhalik et al 2019 leskovar et al 2004 rouphael et al 2008 however this is difficult time consuming and especially is affected by many factors such as climate cultivation season and cultivation method in addition the irrigation scheme obtained from one trial may be not suitable for other areas or seasons and is more difficult to be implemented by the small hold farmers with poor knowledge soil moisture status is a more stable indicator to determine the irrigation starting point and irrigation rate zhang et al 2021 in recent years soil moisture sensors wireless communication and data platforms have made significant technological advances and have reduced costs khelifa et al 2015 coates et al 2013 haule and michael 2014 mafuta et al 2012 mason et al 2019 they can interconnect with computer devices by embedding them in daily objects and connecting them to the internet of things iot the intelligent drip fertigation system makes it possible for scientifically determining the scheduling irrigation through real time data on soil moisture conditions in the field from wireless sensor networks and combines the nutrient requirements of crops at different growth stages to achieve automatic irrigation and fertilization this has become a valuable tool in modern agriculture especially in the greenhouse cultivation nayebloie et al 2022 azad et al 2019 therefore the objectives of this study are i to determine the nutrient uptake characteristics of watermelon at different growth stages ii to compare the growth and nutrient uptake of watermelon under intelligent drip fertigation if and conventional drip fertigation cf and iii to evaluate the if s water and fertilizer saving effect and optimize the watermelon intelligent drip fertigation mode 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted

9 of the total root length root surface area and root tips respectively table 4 the root volume was more evenly distributed among all root diameter levels in the if treatment fig 8d the root volume was mainly dominated by 4 5 mm diameter roots in the fp and ck treatments accounting for 32 3 and 41 9 of the total root volume respectively table 4 the total root length root surface area root tips and root volume of watermelon in the if treatment were significantly greater than those in fp and ck treatments compared with fp the if treatment increased root length root surface area root tips and root volume by 195 232 137 and 149 respectively while the difference between the fp and ck treatments was not significant fig 8 root length at all levels of 0 3 mm roots in if was significantly greater than fp and ck and the difference in root length of 3 mm roots was not significant root surface area and volume at all levels of 0 4 mm roots in if were significantly higher than fp and ck treatments and the difference in root surface area and volume of 4 mm roots was not significant root tips at all levels of 0 1 mm roots in if were significantly greater than fp and ck treatments and the difference in root tips between the two treatments was not significant at all levels of 1 mm roots table 4 3 5 fruit quality of watermelon in different treatments the differences of all quality indicators determined between treatments were not significant in 2019 table 5 in 2020 soluble sugar content in watermelon in the fertilized treatments if and fp was significantly higher than in the ck while the differences in other indicators among treatments were not significant in 2021 soluble sugar soluble solids central sugar content vc and sugar acid ratio in the fertilized treatments were significantly higher than in the ck and titratable acid was significantly lower than in the ck the soluble solids content in the if treatment was significantly higher than that in the fp treatment and the differences between the if and fp treatments were not significant for the other indices 3 6 fruit yield irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency and nutrient uptakes to produce 1000 kg watermelon economic yield the fruit yield of the if treatment was the highest table 6 and the ck treatment was the lowest compared to the fp treatment the yield of the if treatment in 2019 2020 and 2021increased by 5 99 22 1 and 9 42 respectively there was no significant difference in yields among the three treatments in 2019 the differences of yields among the three treatments reached a significant difference in 2020 the yields of the fertilized treatments if and fp were significantly higher than those of the ck in 2021 and the difference between the if and fp treatments was not significant the irrigation water use efficiency iwue of the if treatment was significantly higher than that of the fp and ck treatments and there was no significant difference between the fp and ck treatments compared to the fp treatment the iwuf of the if treatment in 2019 2020 and 2021 was increased by 67 7 73 3 and 61 4 respectively the n p2o5 and k2o use efficiencies of if treatment in the three years were significantly higher than those of the fp treatment p 0 05 so did the partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency the n p2o5 and k2o uptakes to produce 1000 kg watermelon economic yield were 1 62 2 05 kg 0 68 1 02 kg 2 82 3 94 kg with an average of 1 79 0 88 and 3 49 kg respectively in three years 3 7 correlation between watermelon root indices and yield irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency the watermelon yield was significantly positively correlated with root length root surface area root volume root tips nutrient use efficiency p 0 05 and irrigation water use efficiency p 0 01 had no significant correlation with root dry weight and root to shoot ratio p 0 05 fig 9 there was a significant positive correlation among root indices such as root dry weight root shoot ratio root length root surface area root volume and root tips there was also a significant positive correlation among irrigation water use efficiency nutrient use efficiency and root indices 3 8 soil physicochemical properties the contents of ec organic matter total nitrogen mineral nitrogen olsen p and available k of the fertilized treatments in 2021 were increased in relative to the beginning of the experiment and those parameters of the ck were decreased after three consecutive cropping seasons however the soil ph showed the opposite trend table 7 compared to the ck the ec organic matter total nitrogen mineral nitrogen olsen p and available k contents of fertilized treatments were significantly increased and the ph content was significantly decreased in 0 20 and 20 40 soil layers the differences between the two fertilized treatments were not significant the ec content of three treatments showed fp if ck in two soil layers and the difference among three treatments was significant 4 discussion 4 1 intelligent drip fertigation increased water and nutrient use efficiency without compromising watermelon yields our three year trials results showed that although the if treatment reduced the n p2o5 and k2o rates by 46 72 and 57 respectively and irrigation water by 29 37 in relative to the fp treatment it did not reduced the fruit yield and quality and n p2o5 and k2o uptakes of watermelon and significantly increased the iwue nutrient use efficiency partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency table 6 the iwue nutrient use efficiency of the if treatment in our study were higher than the results of the others li et al 2018 2019 for example the n p2o5 and k2o partial factor productivity 545 1307 and 594 kg kg 1 and agronomic efficiency 139 332 and 157 kg kg 1 of if treatment were higher than the results of li et al 2019 by meta analysis of annual fruit crops in china mainly watermelon and melon where the averages of n p2o5 and k2o partial factor productivity were 129 469 and 136 kg kg 1 and the agronomic efficiency were 50 3 174 5 and 47 6 kg kg 1 it indicates that the parameters the lower upper limit of irrigation and the wetting soil depth at the different periods of intelligent drip fertigation of our study had met the water and nutrient requirements of watermelon throughout the growth period therefore it ensured the watermelon yield and quality obviously if is an efficient way to increase irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency without yield penalty while reducing the adverse environmental impacts of excessive irrigation and fertilization however compared to the nutrient uptakes by crops the applied nutrients were still high indicating there is still space to reduce the fertilizer rates compared to fp treatment the if treatment has saved the 46 72 of the fertilizers and 29 37 of irrigation water it indicates that the over use of water and nutrients is very severe in watermelon production in the study region our recent study at the national scale also found that the average fertilizer rates of n p2o5 and k2o of watermelon by farmers in different regions of china were respectively 1 3 3 0 1 9 5 5 and 0 3 2 5 times compared with the recommended rate the reduction potential of chemical fertilizers n p2o5 and k2o were 22 7 66 5 47 8 81 7 and 187 1 59 4 respectively with an average of 43 0 68 7 and 12 2 respectively bao et al 2022 it is also the situation in other intensive agricultural systems in china such as orchards and solar greenhouses bai et al 2020 gao et al 2021 the reasons for the over use of water and nutrients in china are a complicated issue the growers are usually the elderly and have limited knowledge on water and nutrient management especially on the drip fertigation growing watermelon and other horticultural crops provides a high income to the farmers in relative to cereals therefore to secure their income they usually add high rates of water and fertilizers to solve the problem except for further studying to provide sound fertilization recommendation for farmers establishing the adequate extension services is also important the experiences of western countries to impose the strict regulations to limit the nutrient inputs in agriculture since late 1980 s indicate that fertilization and nutrient management is also an institutional issue de vries et al 2022 however as the largest country in consuming and producing inorganic fertilizers in the world china is still in its early stage to develop such policies although intelligent fertigation is an efficient way to increase irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency without yield penalty the high cost is still an obstacle to limit its use in most of farmers greenhouses in china at this stage however with the increasing labor cost and more attention to save water and fertilizer resources intelligent fertigation is considered as the direction of agricultural development in china in the future 4 2 the mechanism of intelligent drip fertigation increased irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency our results found that the average proportions of dry matter accumulation n p2o5 and k2o uptake in the fruit expanding stage to the whole growth stage were 79 68 72 and 72 respectively table 3 indicating that the fruit expanding stage is key stage for water and nutrient management this is consistent to other studies chen et al 2016 kang et al 2018 compared to fp treatment the if treatment reduced the fertilizer rates and high proportions of n p2o5 and k2o were added at the fruit setting and fruit expanding stages which met the nutrient demand of watermelon at the key growth stages additionally the irrigation was controlled by the fdr sensors with different lower upper limit of irrigation and the wetting soil depth at the different periods of watermelon which met the water requirement of plant this is the main mechanism for intelligent drip fertigation increasing water and nutrient use efficiency without compromising watermelon yields the root system is the main organ for water and nutrient uptake by plants roots 2 mm in diameter are classified as fine roots where 0 1 mm roots have a large absorption surface area and high physiological activity and their main role is to absorb water and nutrients from the soil mccormack et al 2015 in contrast 1 2 mm roots have well developed xylem ducts and are usually responsible for transporting water and nutrients to larger diameter classes of roots roots 2 mm in diameter are classified as coarse roots which are mainly responsible for transporting water and nutrients to the aboveground parts and had transport and storage functions freschet and roumet 2017 the high rates of water and fertilizer under mulch fertigation was found hindering the respiration of fine roots 2 mm the physiological function and root morphological indices root biomass root length and root tips wang et al 2021 grasso et al 2020 our results showed that if treatment significantly increased the root number of 0 1 mm roots root tips and significantly increased the root length root surface area and root volume of 0 4 mm roots compared to fp and there was no significant difference among treatments in the 4 mm roots there were significantly positive correlations among irrigation water use efficiency and n p2o5 k2o use efficiency and root parameters fig 9 indicating that the intelligent fertigation system regulated watermelon root morphology through precise irrigation and fertilization and consequently increased the root s ability to absorb and translocate water and nutrients to improve irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency this may be another physiological mechanism for intelligent drip fertigation increasing water and nutrient use efficiency without compromising watermelon yields 5 conclusion the dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 k2o uptakes of watermelon were fitted well with the s logistic growth function the fruit expanding stage is key stage for dry matter accumulation n p2o5 and k2o uptake and the average proportions of dry matter accumulation and n p2o5 and k2o nutrient uptake in this stage to the whole growth stage were 79 0 67 9 72 4 and 71 8 respectively if significantly reduced the application rates of irrigation water n p2o5 and k2o by 33 1 46 72 and 57 respectively without compromising watermelon yield and fruit quality and significantly increased the iwue nutrient use efficiency the mechanism of if treatment could be explained by increasing root characteristics of watermelon to the water and nutrient uptake and translocation capacity of the root system therefore intelligent drip fertigation is a sustainable solution for protected agriculture to save water

8976,super absorbent polymer sap is well recognized to be one of the potential technologies for improving crop yields and water productivity wp however the effects of sap on crop yields and wp remain inconsistent and vary with environment and application conditions in this work we conducted a meta analysis of 1504 paired data points from 310 papers published before july 2022 to evaluate the effect of sap on crop yield and wp considering sap attributes initial soil properties and experimental conditions the sap addition to soil resulted in average increases of 12 8 and 17 2 on yield and wp respectively increases in yield and wp after sap application were the highest in tuber crops while the greatest economic benefits were observed in vegetable crops the increase in wp was higher in rainfed conditions 18 3 than in irrigated conditions 14 8 the highest improvement in wp was observed in the sap with organic inorganic hybrid compound types the banding hole application method and the fine grained structure in addition the effectiveness of wp response to sap significantly positively correlated with the initial soil ph and the soil bulk density and was negatively correlated with n fertilizer rates water supply initial soil organic matter som and total nitrogen the improvement in wp was closely related to the increased in water stable aggregates wsa soil porosity som available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium after sap application these results suggest that the effects of sap application on crop yield and wp are dependent on soil properties by integrating the impacts of environmental conditions our findings can help to tailor make sap application measures for different environmental conditions to fully achieve the benefits of sap application keywords evapotranspiration nitrogen fertilizer rates super absorbent polymer properties soil physicochemical properties water supply data availability i have shared the my data at the attach file step 1 introduction the world is simultaneously facing the tremendous challenge of ensuring food security while preserving freshwater resources recent studies have shown the large potential to improve crop yields to better meet future human demand mueller et al 2012 davis et al 2017 however the solutions proposed would necessitate a large increase in the exploitation of water resources in addition increasing the water resource usage efficiency in agriculture would still not be sufficient to meet the growing human demand wada et al 2012 davis et al 2016 it is therefore crucial to utilize new and existing approaches to improve crop water productivity wp which is defined as the amount of grain yield produced per unit of water used in order to ensure water availability and satisfy the increasing global food demands this is especially true in china due to its large population scarce water resources and lack of arable land gu et al 2020 super absorbent polymer sap application to soils is considered an effective practical method to increase yield and wp because of the special water absorption and water retention properties of the polymer feng et al 2020 sap have a much higher density of hydrophilic and cation binding groups such as carbonyls hydroxyls and quaternary ammonium salts and have no aromatic moieties hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 and can absorb more than a thousand times of its own weight in water they are insoluble materials that form three dimensional networks expand in water and retain a large amount of water due to their cross bonds hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 when incorporated into the soil they can quickly absorb water from rainfall or irrigation and act as a water reservoir that releases water to plants once the soil at the root level starts to dry al jabari et al 2019 abdallah et al 2021 sap can also act as a carrier and regulator of nutrient release minimizing undesired fertilizer losses and sustaining considerable plant growth mikkelsen 1994 a number of previous studies reported that sap addition could improve crop yield by maximizing the efficient use of fertilizer and improving soil physical and chemical properties egrinya eneji et al 2013 hou et al 2018 however given the variable results reported in scientific literature the effects of sap applications on crop yield are debatable yang et al 2020 reported positive effects of sap on crop yield due to the increase in soil surface temperature other studies reported that the application of sap did not increase crop yield or decreased yield under excessive irrigation or unsuitable irrigation conditions wang et al 2012 fallahi et al 2015 reported that yield responses to sap vary depending on crop water management and sap application rate these mixed results indicate that more information about crop yield responses to sap is needed to evaluate the strategic feasibility of broad scale sap use wp is a function of yield and evapotranspiration et therefore any factor influencing yield or et could contribute to the contrasting wp responses to sap application previous studies have attempted to relate this variability to climatic conditions soil environment sap properties and agricultural management practices islam et al 2011 fallahi et al 2015 hou et al 2018 for example a number of studies reported the positive effects of sap application on wp during prolonged deficit water conditions in many crop types fallahi et al 2015 el asmar et al 2017 while applying sap under well watered conditions was less effective yang et al 2017 a different study observed that wp increase is higher for clay soil than for sandy clay loam el asmar et al 2017 the magnitude of the effects on wp varied substantially among different experiments and environmental conditions the factors responsible for crop response and their corresponding importance to evaluating the use of sap have not been thoroughly assessed previous meta analyses have focused on the effects of sap on crop wp zheng et al 2020 and previous studies simply estimated the variations of sap effects on irrigated maize without evaluating the effects on wp under different experimental conditions and management measures numerous field and laboratory experiments have reported that soil physicochemical properties such as soil total porosity ph 0 25 mm water stable aggregates wsa soil organic matter som total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium contents are strongly affected by sap islam et al 2011 egrinya eneji et al 2013 fan et al 2015 cao et al 2017 changes in soil properties affect the soil productivity which will inevitably affect crop yield and wp el asmar et al 2017 hou et al 2018 to understand how sap affects crop yield and wp we must understand how the soil physicochemical properties respond to sap understanding the interaction mechanisms is crucial to reliably predicting under what conditions sap will improve crop yield and wp despite the importance in understanding how sap affects crop yield and wp we must understand how the soil physicochemical properties respond to sap the effects of sap on crop yield and wp under various environmental conditions has not been well studied to fill this gap we aim to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze the effects of sap application on yield and wp the specific objectives of this meta analysis are to 1 estimate the effects of sap on crop yield et and wp 2 estimate the effects of sap on the soil physicochemical properties 3 identify how crop yield and wp change under different environment factors including climate soil properties and management measures under sap application compared to no sap and 4 identify the cause effect relationships between the soil properties and yield as well as wp after sap application our results provide useful insights into how to plan sound sap management strategies to save water and maximize crop production benefits this study also lays the foundation for science based policy making on the popularization and application of sap 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection datasets on yield in maize wheat oil crops cotton tuber crops and vegetable production published in peer reviewed articles from 1980 to 2022 were collected by searching online databases web of science china national knowledge infrastructure and google scholar using combinations of keywords maize or corn and wheat and potato and vegetable and oat and soybean peanut and sunflower sweet potato and cotton and yield or water productivity or water use efficiency and water retaining agent or super absorbent polymer or polymer all data were either directly obtained from tables or indirectly from graphs using the getdata graph digitizer shcherbak et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 this search produced a large database from which the data were extracted and compiled based on the following criteria all data were gathered from field experiments laboratory experiments pot experiments experiments under rainproof shelters as well as data obtained from model simulations were excluded at least two treatments sap no sap were tested crop yield or wp were documented only experiments that reported at least three replicates of each treatment were considered the data resulting from the replicates of each treatment were then averaged this resulted in 1504 paired field observations maize n 446 wheat n 402 cotton n 70 oat n 16 tuber crop n 314 vegetable n 156 oil crop n 99 from 353 site years and 310 published

our analysis we considered eight response soil variables wsa total soil porosity som ph total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium associated with soil properties to examine the underlying causes of yield and wp variations under sap see supplementary datasets in this meta analysis the categorical and continuous metadata table 1 from each study were used as possible explanatory factors of sap related changes in yield et and wp the crops were categorized into six types maize wheat cotton oat oil crop soybean peanut and sunflower tuber crop potato and sweet potato and vegetables tomato pepper cabbage sugar beet cucumber eggplant carrot etc the water management was classified as rainfed or irrigated the sap types were divided into three categories according to the source of the material synthetic polymerization sp natural polymer modification npm and organic inorganic hybrid compounds oihc the sap application rate was categorized in 45 kg ha 1 45 90 kg ha 1 and 90 kg ha 1 the sap application method was organized into six categories furrow application hole banding application mix application seed coating or soaking spraying application and sprinkle application the sap forms considered were fine grained and large grained the sap duration was grouped into one year or two years other measurements included water supply the sum of seasonal irrigation amounts and precipitation initial som initial ph initial soil bulk density initial total nitrogen and nitrogen application rates table 1 2 2 data analyses 2 2 1 meta analyses the effects of sap on different variables x were assessed in the form of natural log of the response ratio rrs and the equation was lnrrs ln xt xc hedges et al 1999 zheng et al 2019 kuang et al 2021 where xt and xc are the means respectively of the sap treatment group and the no sap group for a given indicator variable x the result was reported as the percentage change rrs 1 100 under treatment effects hedges et al 1999 zheng et al 2019 kuang et al 2021 in this meta analysis observed effect sizes were weighed by the inverse of the sampling variances benitez lopez et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 in cases for which standard deviations sd or standard error se were not available we used the bracken1992 approach to impute sd bracken 1992 if standard errors se were given instead of sd we converted se to sd as sd se n where n is the number of total replicates wang et al 2020 the meta analysis was performed using the rma mv function of the metafor package wang et al 2020 in r version 3 61 our analyses were separated in two steps random effects meta analysis and mixed effects meta analysis models first we used a random effects meta analysis model to assess the mean weighted effect sizes and 95 confidence intervals cis of independent variable yield et wp wsa soil porosity som ph total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in sap and no sap groups if the cis value of the mean effect size did not superimpose on zero this was taken as indication that the differences were significant for these analyses we assessed heterogeneity by formal cochran s q test tests qt which test whether the variability in the observed effect sizes or outcomes is larger than would be expected based on sampling variability alone viechtbauer 2007 after analyzing heterogeneity there were significant residual heterogeneity in the random effects meta analysis for the yield dataset total heterogeneity qt 1685073 p 0 0001 the et dataset qt 78961830 p 0 0001 the wp dataset qt 1048925

the independent variable and explanatory variables categorical and continuous moderators models with categorical factors were also run without the intercept to obtain the parameter estimates mean effect sizes for each level the qt of each variable in the categorical groups was partitioned into the explained heterogeneity by the moderator qm and the unknown factors residual heterogeneity qw and p values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using bonferroni corrections p 0 05 of qm indicated the mean effect sizes which showed a significant difference amongst different levels in each category variables kuang et al 2021 for each of the continuous moderators water supply initial som initial ph initial soil bulk density initial total nitrogen and nitrogen application rates qw qm intercept distance slope and p values were calculated from statistical analyses and the relationships were considered significant at p 0 05 however in this study we mainly focused on analyzing the effect of sap on yield et and wp under different environmental conditions and did not evaluate the effect of sap on soil properties through different explanatory variables we assessed publication bias with funnel plots and egger tests by including precision 1 se as the covariate in the rma mv function and using meta analytic residuals benitez lopez et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 rosenberg s fail safe

robust if nfs 5 k 10 k the number of sizes 2 2 2 other statistical analyses a single linear regression was used to estimate the relationship between different soil properties wsa soil porosity som ph total n available n available phosphorus and available potassium and yield wp and et ordinary least squares ols regression analysis was employed to compare significant correlations between response ratios crop yield wp and explanatory variable by using the r package splines 2 2 3 sap related economic benefit calculation the economic benefits were associated with sap inputs sap prices and grain production which were calculated as follows economic benefits increased yield yield price sap inputs sap sprice where the increased grain yield kg ha 1 was based on the difference between yields with sap treatment and yields with no sap yield price was the average price of crops us ha 1 the average crop price was calculated based on the price data from 2010 to 2020 provided by the national compilation of agricultural product cost benefit data the sap s price us ha 1 was calculated by averaging the price data provided in the reported literature and the average sap inputs kg ha 1 of every crop was also calculated by data collected from previous studies 3 results 3 1 overview of studies included in the meta analysis the 310 published studies included in the meta analysis cover the period from 1980 to 2022 see supplementary datasets a summary of the feedstocks used to produce the sap sap application methods rates and sap forms for the various studies considered is provided in table 1 3 2 overall effects of sap on soil physical and chemical properties crop water use yield and wp sap significantly increased wsa and total soil porosity by 18 9 cis 16 0 21 9 and 18 0 cis 12 4

obvious modification in the soil ph mean 0 1 cis from 0 7 to 0 9 fig 2 the sap treatments decreased et during the crop growing season by 2 8 compared to no sap treatments which likely indicates that sap reduces soil water supply the change in stored soil water between planting and harvest compared to no sap fig s3 taking wheat as an example we observed how the effect of sap on water use varied at different growth stages the reduction in water usage after sap application was 21 6 cis 38 1 to 5 2 from the jointing to the filling stage and 21 3 cis 37 9 to 4 6 from the sowing to jointing stage in contrast the application of sap significantly increased water usage by 36 9 cis 6 2 67 7 during the filling to the harvest stage fig 2 these results suggest that the decreased et after sap application can be mainly attributed to the lower water usage in the early growth period compared to no sap sap significantly increased crop yield and wp by 12 8 cis 12 1 13 4 qt 1685073 2 p 0 01 and 17 2 cis 15

p 0 01 achieved with sap application varied significantly for different types of crops yields were increased for each of the six categories of crops considered with the effect size ranging between 9 3 18 3 the highest increase in yield was observed in vegetables 18 3 followed by tuber crops 17 7 oil crops 15 2 oat 11 5 wheat 10 4 maize 9 6 and cotton 9 3 the highest wp was observed for tuber crops 27 1 because of their lower et 4 8 while the lowest wp was observed in cotton 12 2 wp was intermediate in vegetables 24 3 oil crops 22 4 oat 19 8 maize 13 8 and wheat 13 4 fig 3 funnel plots and egger

about the reliability of our estimates fig s2 and tables s1 there was a small potential publication bias for yield p 0 0019 0 05 and wp p 0 0103 0 05 however the nfs of yield and wp for the database were 39497621772 p 0 01 and 228345081 p 0 01 respectively both of which were higher than the threshold of 7230 and 2810 5 k 10 needed to consider the mean effect size robust thus the results of our meta analysis are highly reliable and a considerable number of unpublished relationships would be required to disprove the effects we have identified as significant fig s1 s2 and tables s1 3 3 effects of sap variations on crop yield and wp the categorical group analysis indicated that sap feedstocks types significantly affected yield and wp yield p 0 0014 wp p 0 01 compared to untreated conditions the yield significantly increased by 7 8 cis 4 4 11 1 when natural polymer modification sap was applied by 14 8 cis 12 6 17 1 for organic inorganic hybrid compound sap application and by 13 7 cis 12 7

sap forms fine grained sap showed a positive effect on yield 18 4 which was significantly higher than the one observed for large grained sap 9 6 the wp of the fine grained sap 20 1 was lower than the one for the large grained sap 22 3 due to higher et in fine grained sap conditions 3 2 no differences were evident between two solid forms of sap fig 4 sap application significantly increased yield and wp in all application methods but the effects varied among application methods fig 4 yield p 0 0006 wp p 0 01 the highest yield 16 3 and wp 26 6 were achieved by adding sap with the method of hole applying while the smallest response was found following seed coating or soaking in addition the highest increases in yield associated with sap application in terms of duration time of the treatment was observed for one year long applications mean 10 2 cis 5 6 14 9 compared to applications lasting longer than two years mean 8 05 cis 3 8 12 4 the increases in wp was similar in the two groups because of the lower et 7 5 when the experiment duration time was one year mean 18 50 cis 12 3 24 7 compared to when it was two years or more mean 11 19 cis 5 1 17 3 however the differences in effects between the sap application duration times groups did not reach statistical significance yield p 0 5022 wp p 0 1011 the sap application rate did not significantly affect yield p 0 4774 increased yields were at the highest when the sap application rate was 45 90 kg ha 1 13 3 cis 12 1 14 6 lowest when the sap rates was 90 kg ha 1 11 6 cis 9 1 14 2 and intermediate when the sap rates was 45 kg ha 1 12 7 cis 11 7 13 7 to the contrary the sap application rates significantly affected crop wp p 0 0316 and the highest wp was found for sap rates 45 90 kg ha 1 19 4 cis 17 1 21 7 which was attributed to the lowest et 4 9 cis 6 0 to 3 9 the lowest wp 16 9 cis 11 0 22 9 was found for sap rates were 90 kg ha 1 which is a result of the highest et 2 32 cis 5 0 to 0 3 fig 4 3 4 effects of sap on crop yield and wp under different management measures and soil properties water management also significantly affected the rrs of yield p 0 0013 and wp p 0 0094 after applying sap the application of sap in rainfed systems significantly increased crop yield by an average of 13 9 cis 12 6 15 1 while it increased by 11 1 cis 9 9 12 2 in irrigated systems the increase in wp was also higher for rainfed conditions 18 3 than under irrigated conditions 14 8 due to lower et values under rainfed conditions fig 4 table s3 these results suggested that sap was more effective in improving yield and wp under rainfed conditions the continuous randomized effects model analysis showed that the effect sizes of sap on yield and wp after applying sap negatively correlated to n fertilizer rates yield p 0 0067 wp p 0 0042 and water supply figs 5 7 yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0021 however the effect size of et was positively correlated with water supply p 0 0004 and approached zero at a water supply of over 550 mm suggesting that the use of sap is more likely to decease the et at low water supply level than high input of water supply and the sap could not reduce the water consumption when the water supply is higher than 550 mm fig 6 in addition both the effect sizes of yield and wp negatively correlated to the initial som yield p 0 0012 wp p 0 01 and total nitrogen yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0363 and approached zero at initial som of over 30 g kg 1 suggesting that the use of sap is more likely to increase the yield and wp at low initial total nitrogen and som levels both rrs of the yield and wp were affected by the initial ph yield p 0 01 wp p 0 01 and the rrs of yield and wp were significantly positive when the initial soil ph were 4 8 7 and 6 5 8 7 respectively but the rrs of et were negatively correlated with the initial ph fig 6 table s5 initial soil bulk density was positively correlated with the rrs of wp after applying sap p 0 0039 but it showed no statistical significance for the effect size of yield p 0 1424 figs 5 7 table s4 and s5 3 5 relationships among the soil physicochemical properties and crop yield and wp under sap application we conducted regression analyses to examine correlations between the rrs of yield wp and the rrs of soil physicochemical properties figs 8 9 both the rrs of yield and wp after sap application were positively and significantly correlated to the rrs of som yield p 0 0007 wp p 0 0148 wsa yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0392 available nitrogen yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0017 available phosphorus yield p 0 0104 wp p 0 0207 and available potassium yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0012 the rrs of total soil porosity p 0 0188 after sap application was significantly positively correlated with the rrs of wp but not with rrs of yield these results suggested that the yield or wp could be enhanced by increasing the soil nutrient pool or improving soil physicochemical properties unexpectedly the linear regression analysis showed that the rrs of soil ph was negatively correlated with the rrs of yield p 0 0075 after applying sap but showed no significant relationships with the rrs of wp p 0 3247 after applying sap the rrs of total nitrogen were negatively correlated with wp p 0 0311 but not with yield p 0 3481 3 6 economic benefits of sap the net returns in us of sap applications were 23 0 for maize 346 3 for cotton 613 0 for peanuts 1002 7 for soybeans 579 47 for potatoes 2300 7 for tomatoes 4298 1 for cucumbers and 1357 9 for peppers table 2 in the case of wheat despite the enhanced wheat yield 10 4 following sap application the economic return was not sufficient to offset the increased economic investments due to the cost of sap application and showed a net decrease of 12 5 ha 1 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 sap amendment improving soil physicochemical properties sap could retain large quantities of nutrients and improve soil physicochemical properties egrinya eneji et al 2013 in our study sap significantly increased wsa 18 94 and porosity 18 0 fig 2 previous studies reported that sap could improve soil porosity and soil aggregate by affecting the degree of agglutination with soil particles and the process of shrinking swelling yang et al 2011 2018 the use of sap materials as a carrier and regulator of nutrient release was helpful in reducing undesired fertilizer losses zheng et al 2009 and increased soil nutrient content soils with more large macro aggregates have more stable structure with better storage of nutrients under sap application conditions xu et al 2015 it was also reported that sap application could increase soil total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium which would be helpful to satisfy the nutrient demand during the plant growth phase cao et al 2017 yaseen et al 2020 the high accumulation of som which may be attributed to increased wsa by sap improves the soil structure and enhances its stability thus facilitating the physical protection of organic carbon yang et al 2021 previous studies reported that sap has the potential benefit of helping superfluous som aggregate in the soil layer so as to prevent it being immediately decomposed or lost goebel et al 2005 moreover sap can also promote the metabolism of soil microorganisms by maintaining the ambient temperature and control water release thereby promoting an increase in microbial population and conversion efficiency of exogenous fresh organic matter eg organic fertilizer or biological bacterial fertilizer or straw returning or biochar and so on returned to the soil zhang et al 2018 soil microbial biomass carbon was significantly positively correlated with som and sap could affect soil microbial biomass carbon by increasing soil microorganism populations li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 it was found that soil organic carbon microbial biomass carbon microbial biomass nitrogen and soil microorganisms were improved through applying sap supplementary figures 4 it should be noted that soil physicochemical properties did not solely depends on whether sap was applied but also on other factors including initial soil properties sap application rate weather conditions and field management measures bai et al 2010 cao et al 2017 hou et al 2018 mazen et al 2015 4 2 general effect of sap application response to yield wp water use and economic benefits our meta analysis revealed that yield is significantly higher 12 8 under sap application systems fig 3 sap application has the potential for the soil to retain more water from irrigation or rainfall and reduce the frequency of irrigation resulting in reduced water usage and increased wp singh et al 2007 verma et al 2019 similar meta analysis results were also reported in maize production zheng et al 2020 sap could also hold plant nutrients and release them slowly to support crop growth islam et al 2011 both the yield and wp were significantly increased in response to sap application via the improvements in the soil micro environment similar results have been reported in potato and maize hou et al 2018 xu et al 2015 el asmar et al 2017 sap can significantly decrease et through reducing soil evaporation islam et al 2011 the water usage in the early growth period after sap application is significantly lower than with no sap which could be attributed to sap decreasing the soil water ineffective evaporation for the sap application the water usage was significantly higher during the late growth period likely because sap can release water when there is a shortage of water in the soil or when the crop water demand is at its peak stage so that crops can more effectively use water sap has potential economic benefits and can be considered as an economically viable technology to enhance farm income the higher net return of cotton oil crops vegetable crops and tuber crops were mainly due to the higher yields many studies have already reported higher net returns after sap application hou et al 2018 however we calculated a negative net return for wheat and a low net return for maize mainly due to a lower yield and the lower unit price of maize and wheat which nullifies the advantages of sap these results indicate that sap application may not be suitable for grain crops 4 3 conditions under which sap application is more conductive to improve yield and wp sap showed significant positive effects on yield and wp for different crops indicating the wide applicability of sap however the positive effects of sap varies with the crop type perhaps as a result of different water demand patterns and the functional characteristics of sap for instance potatoes and vegetables are said to be more sensitive to irrigation deficits than wheat and maize van 1981 adu et al 2018 sap is known to be beneficial for drought sensitive plants as it allows them to manage with water stress islam et al 2011 abdallah et al 2021 the increases in yield and wp are significantly higher in rainfed systems than in irrigated systems which suggest that the use of sap is very important to achieve high yields and high wps in dryland the reason for this phenomenon may be related to the fact that sap can store more water in the soil and therefore increases the soil water content providing a relief from drought stress under water deficit conditions yang et al 2017 at the same time sap can significantly reduce surface runoff and soil erosion cao et al 2017 it prevents soil surface crust and improves rainfall efficiency and the soil infiltration rate of rainfall ultimately increasing yield and wp similar both yield and wp are negatively correlated with water supply yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0021 figs 5 7 suggesting that the use of sap is more likely to increase yield and wp when the water supply is limited compared to when it s abundant sap reduced et under insufficient water supply conditions compared to well watered conditions fig 6 previous studies have found the response of yield and wp to sap levels in the 40 etc treatments were higher than 80 etc treatments rostampour et al 2013 the same study also showed that a sufficient water supply defies the beneficial effects of sap treatments both in terms of crop yield and wp dehkordi 2017 the larger effect of sap application on both yield and wp has been observed in soil where n input is low strongly suggesting that sap application in barren soil is especially conducive to increase yield and wp mikkelsen et al 1993 our results confirmed the benefits of sap applications are at their highest on infertile soils low total nitrogen and som figs 5 and 7 the beneficial effects of sap applications in these conditions is due to sap and fertilizer forming hydrated polymers while mixing with water these polymers are able to absorb large amounts of nutrients into their structure which are then released slowly the slow release of nutrients helps reduce fertilizer loss and increase the efficiency of nitrogen usage both factors that contribute to improving yield wang et al 2021 previous research has reported that sap application increases yield by 44 at medium fertilizer levels and 80 3 at low fertilizer levels and that by combining sap with only half the conventional rate of fertilizer minimized nitrate leaching and enhanced uptake without reducing yield egrinya eneji et al 2013 in our study we found that there was a significantly positive relationship between the rrs of yield and wp and the initial ph after sap application suggesting that sap is more likely to increase yield and wp in soils with higher initial ph than in soils with lower initial ph previous studies reported that ammonia volatilization in alkaline soils is likely to be higher than in other types of soil and sap was found to increase the efficiency of soil nitrogen uptake by reducing the volatilization of soil ammonia du et al 2007 carrijo et al 2017 thus resulting in higher yield and wp besides it is prone to reduce the availability of soil phosphorus potassium and calcium in alkaline soils resulting in soil microelement loss however sap can improve the availability of soil microelement by increasing soil som thus improving yield and wp kuppusamy et al 2018 the effect size of wp after sap application was positively correlated with initial soil bulk density meaning that applying sap was more likely to increase the effect sizes of wp in soils in where the initial soil bulk density is higher than lower it is postulated that this could be attributed to sap significantly improving the water conservation capacity of the soil by decreasing soil bulk density thereby promoting crop growth abrisham et al 2018 hou et al 2018 in addition it is important to consider that soil bulk density has a dramatic influence on the process of water infiltration with permeability decreasing where bulk density is high this can make soil erosion easier leading to lower wp dong et al 2021 sap can prevent soil erosion by absorbing more than a thousand times its original weight in water cao et al 2017 4 4 sap properties effect on crop yield and wp differences in crop yield and wp after sap application are due to sap feedstocks types sap form and sap application method fig 4 amongst the three feedstock types considered organic and inorganic compound saps appear to be the most effective to increase crops yield and wp while natural polymer sap is the least beneficial the reason may be attributed to the fact that organic and inorganic compound saps contain a large amount of mineral nutrients so that it not only stores large quantities of water available for crop absorption but also increases the supply of nutrients li et al 2015 despite this natural polymer sap has a lower water absorbency ratio and poor gel strength which may decrease its water absorption capacity wang et al 2021 previous studies have reported that both organic and inorganic compound saps could significantly improve soil physical properties when compared to single natural polymer or natural polymer saps xu et al 2015 the use of fine grained sap achieves higher yield and wp than the large grained sap the reason has been attributed to the fact that fine grained sap has a higher water holding capacity and available water capacity than the large grained sap abdallah 2019 as a result fine particles sap is more effective at alleviating the inhibition of plant growth caused by drought stress several other studies also reported that larger particles release less water into the soil due the smaller area of contact with the dry soil particles making the water stored in the fine particles more readily available for extraction by the plant roots abdallah 2019 hüttermann et al 2010 sap application methods varied significantly in their capacity to increase crop yield and wp fig 4 amongst the six methods of applications considered the highest increase in yield and wp was observed when sap was applied by banding or hole applications previous studies have suggested that banding application sap could result in higher wp and yield than mix application a possible explanation for this is that banding or hole application methods create a water reservoir within the root zone of the plant ensuring that sap is spread in a uniform continuous layer rather than being dispersed as individual granules so that it can better withstand the pressure of the soil load el asmar et al 2017 higher wp was found in mixed applications of sap compared to furrow applications the primary reason was that the mixed application method can provide a more even distribution in the soil compared to furrow application this is more conducive to absorption of soil water by the crop and reduces the et by inhibiting deep soil water pecolation and evaporation bai et al 2010 4 5 linking crop yield and wp with underlying drivers of soil physicochemical functioning higher soil quality generally resulted in higher crop yield and wp in our study we found that some soil physicochemical properties were significantly correlated with yield and wp both the rrs of yield and wp after sap application were positively correlated to the rrs of available nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium som contents and wsa figs 7 and 8 which suggest that yield and wp can be improved by increasing available nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium som contents and wsa the higher yield and wp following sap application have been mainly attributed to the larger retention of soil nutrients available nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium contents wu and liu 2007 cao et al 2017 in addition previous studies have suggested that the yield increase after sap application is due to increased wsa or som contents xu et al 2015 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2021 som in soil has been shown to have a significant influence on soil water retention capabilities rawls et al 2003 increased som after sap application reduces water transpiration ankenbauer and loheide 2017 thus an organically rich soil benefits from increased wp the unique medium structure of soil aggregates regulates water and nutrient circulations and consequently affects wp assi et al 2019 the rrs of yield values significantly decrease with the increase rrs of soil ph fig 8 which may be due to sap preventing the excessive rise of soil ph for alkaline soil and eventually leading to better plant growth and nutrient uptake by the crops du et al 2007 fan et al 2015 in contrast soil ph had no significant relationships with the rrs of wp fig 9 which may be attributed to an increased ph after sap application which induced an increase in water consumption the rrs of wp after sap application decreased with the increase of total nitrogen rrs values indicating that the accumulation of n may lead to high et in turn decreasing wp 4 6 limitations and potential for future study direction this study suggests that not only does sap application have the potential to increase availability of food due to higher yield of crops and to save water but sap applications also have a substantial and specific agro ecological effect in poor soils considering the economic feasibility of its production technologies and their adoption as well as a positive policy environment sap application appears to have the potential to make a substantial contribution to global food production however the cost of sap is still relatively high hou et al 2018 and in some cases such as for wheat production it may not be economically beneficial representing instead a net cost table 2 in addition although sap feedstocks types significantly affected yield and wp fig 4 most sap eg synthetic polymerization are composed of an acrylamide monomer which has been linked to cancer wilson et al 2010 some studies have reported that acrylamide monomers could translocate into crops from hydrogel mroczek et al 2014 which may pose a risk to human health however previous studies suggested that there was no translocation of the acrylamide monomer into crops castle et al 1991 suresh et al 2018 besides saps tend to degrade slowly in the environment but some studies have reported that sap could effectively increase nitrogen use efficiency by minimizing leaching and enhancing water and nitrate retention in the soil egrinya eneji et al 2013 obviously the health and environmental risks of sap are still under debate zhang et al 2007 more research is are therefore needed to evaluate the economic viability environmental toxicity and safety of food products of sap treated crops before sap can be widely applied to soil distribution of sample points were unbalanced in this study given there was a large variation in climate soil properties and management practice among different countries or within the same countries more effort is needed in evaluating how the sap effects crop wp and yield in other countries to minimize the current large uncertainties in the future in addition it is essential to take into consideration how management practices have interactive effects that greatly influence the choice of the best practices to mitigate water consumption ensure food provision and improve the properties of the soil many studies have evaluated the effects of combined management practices applied in combination fallahi et al 2015 yang et al 2017 feng et al 2020 yaseen et al 2020 and have found that interactive effects on yield wp and soil properties between the management practices can be additive synergistic or antagonistic yue et al 2019 shang et al 2021 the interactive effects of sap applications and other management strategies on crop yield wp and soil properties have yet to be investigated more work needs to be done to fully understand the interactive effects of multiple management practices on crop yield wp and soil properties we recognize that experimental durations might lead to a gap between our results and the ideal situation most experiments from which we collected the dataset considered in this study only lasted one growing season and most of the durations were shorter than one year the long term application of sap is beneficial in that it increases the content of organic carbon and improves soil structure and its stability yang et al 2021 we believe that well designed long term studies are required to report the longevity of the effects of sap application hou et al 2018 further studies should also focus on the economic sustainability of sap application over the long term and on the environmental impacts of this technology on the ecosystem after harvest besides the standard error standard deviation or sufficient information to calculate them are often missing from the available data making it necessary to rely on estimations made through statistical methods any sort of gap filling introduces uncertainty into a dataset emde et al 2021 thus we strongly recommend that the standard error of experimental results should be recorded in more detail in the future 5 conclusion we assessed the integrated effects of sap application on wp crop yield and its economic benefits on different crops in china the results of our meta analysis showed that the yield and wp effects of sap application vary depending on soil conditions field management practices and sap properties fig 10 within a certain range of each environmental interpretation factor sap application was shown to be more suitable for tuber crops and vegetables especially in rainfed conditions poor water supply lower n fertilizer rates and lower initial som higher initial ph and higher initial soil bulk density as these were the optimal conditions giving the largest increase in yield and wp sap produced from organic inorganic hybrid compounds and in fine gained form has the strongest effect on crop yield and wp the banding hole application was more effective than other methods to increase wp sap significantly increased yield and wp through increased soil nutrients and improved soil physical properties sap was found to be an economically viable system due to high net return in most crops especially vegetables tubers and cotton sap was found to be a sustainable agricultural technology to offset water shortages and droughts with key economic benefits and great potential for optimization of yield and wp however future efforts should investigate the health and environmental risks that sap may bring credit authorship contribution statement z l c designed and conceived the

8976,super absorbent polymer sap is well recognized to be one of the potential technologies for improving crop yields and water productivity wp however the effects of sap on crop yields and wp remain inconsistent and vary with environment and application conditions in this work we conducted a meta analysis of 1504 paired data points from 310 papers published before july 2022 to evaluate the effect of sap on crop yield and wp considering sap attributes initial soil properties and experimental conditions the sap addition to soil resulted in average increases of 12 8 and 17 2 on yield and wp respectively increases in yield and wp after sap application were the highest in tuber crops while the greatest economic benefits were observed in vegetable crops the increase in wp was higher in rainfed conditions 18 3 than in irrigated conditions 14 8 the highest improvement in wp was observed in the sap with organic inorganic hybrid compound types the banding hole application method and the fine grained structure in addition the effectiveness of wp response to sap significantly positively correlated with the initial soil ph and the soil bulk density and was negatively correlated with n fertilizer rates water supply initial soil organic matter som and total nitrogen the improvement in wp was closely related to the increased in water stable aggregates wsa soil porosity som available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium after sap application these results suggest that the effects of sap application on crop yield and wp are dependent on soil properties by integrating the impacts of environmental conditions our findings can help to tailor make sap application measures for different environmental conditions to fully achieve the benefits of sap application keywords evapotranspiration nitrogen fertilizer rates super absorbent polymer properties soil physicochemical properties water supply data availability i have shared the my data at the attach file step 1 introduction the world is simultaneously facing the tremendous challenge of ensuring food security while preserving freshwater resources recent studies have shown the large potential to improve crop yields to better meet future human demand mueller et al 2012 davis et al 2017 however the solutions proposed would necessitate a large increase in the exploitation of water resources in addition increasing the water resource usage efficiency in agriculture would still not be sufficient to meet the growing human demand wada et al 2012 davis et al 2016 it is therefore crucial to utilize new and existing approaches to improve crop water productivity wp which is defined as the amount of grain yield produced per unit of water used in order to ensure water availability and satisfy the increasing global food demands this is especially true in china due to its large population scarce water resources and lack of arable land gu et al 2020 super absorbent polymer sap application to soils is considered an effective practical method to increase yield and wp because of the special water absorption and water retention properties of the polymer feng et al 2020 sap have a much higher density of hydrophilic and cation binding groups such as carbonyls hydroxyls and quaternary ammonium salts and have no aromatic moieties hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 and can absorb more than a thousand times of its own weight in water they are insoluble materials that form three dimensional networks expand in water and retain a large amount of water due to their cross bonds hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 when incorporated into the soil they can quickly absorb water from rainfall or irrigation and act as a water reservoir that releases water to plants once the soil at the root level starts to dry al jabari et al 2019 abdallah et al 2021 sap can also act as a carrier and regulator of nutrient release minimizing undesired fertilizer losses and sustaining considerable plant growth mikkelsen 1994 a number of previous studies reported that sap addition could improve crop yield by maximizing the efficient use of fertilizer and improving soil physical and chemical properties egrinya eneji et al 2013 hou et al 2018 however given the variable results reported in scientific literature the effects of sap applications on crop yield are debatable yang et al 2020 reported positive effects of sap on crop yield due to the increase in soil surface temperature other studies reported that the application of sap did not increase crop yield or decreased yield under excessive irrigation or unsuitable irrigation conditions wang et al 2012 fallahi et al 2015 reported that yield responses to sap vary depending on crop water management and sap application rate these mixed results indicate that more information about crop yield responses to sap is needed to evaluate the strategic feasibility of broad scale sap use wp is a function of yield and evapotranspiration et therefore any factor influencing yield or et could contribute to the contrasting wp responses to sap application previous studies have attempted to relate this variability to climatic conditions soil environment sap properties and agricultural management practices islam et al 2011 fallahi et al 2015 hou et al 2018 for example a number of studies reported the positive effects of sap application on wp during prolonged deficit water conditions in many crop types fallahi et al 2015 el asmar et al 2017 while applying sap under well watered conditions was less effective yang et al 2017 a different study observed that wp increase is higher for clay soil than for sandy clay loam el asmar et al 2017 the magnitude of the effects on wp varied substantially among different experiments and environmental conditions the factors responsible for crop response and their corresponding importance to evaluating the use of sap have not been thoroughly assessed previous meta analyses have focused on the effects of sap on crop wp zheng et al 2020 and previous studies simply estimated the variations of sap effects on irrigated maize without evaluating the effects on wp under different experimental conditions and management measures numerous field and laboratory experiments have reported that soil physicochemical properties such as soil total porosity ph 0 25 mm water stable aggregates wsa soil organic matter som total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium contents are strongly affected by sap islam et al 2011 egrinya eneji et al 2013 fan et al 2015 cao et al 2017 changes in soil properties affect the soil productivity which will inevitably affect crop yield and wp el asmar et al 2017 hou et al 2018 to understand how sap affects crop yield and wp we must understand how the soil physicochemical properties respond to sap understanding the interaction mechanisms is crucial to reliably predicting under what conditions sap will improve crop yield and wp despite the importance in understanding how sap affects crop yield and wp we must understand how the soil physicochemical properties respond to sap the effects of sap on crop yield and wp under various environmental conditions has not been well studied to fill this gap we aim to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze the effects of sap application on yield and wp the specific objectives of this meta analysis are to 1 estimate the effects of sap on crop yield et and wp 2 estimate the effects of sap on the soil physicochemical properties 3 identify how crop yield and wp change under different environment factors including climate soil properties and management measures under sap application compared to no sap and 4 identify the cause effect relationships between the soil properties and yield as well as wp after sap application our results provide useful insights into how to plan sound sap management strategies to save water and maximize crop production benefits this study also lays the foundation for science based policy making on the popularization and application of sap 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection datasets on yield in maize wheat oil crops cotton tuber crops and vegetable production published in peer reviewed articles from 1980 to 2022 were collected by searching online databases web of science china national knowledge infrastructure and google scholar using combinations of keywords maize or corn and wheat and potato and vegetable and oat and soybean peanut and sunflower sweet potato and cotton and yield or water productivity or water use efficiency and water retaining agent or super absorbent polymer or polymer all data were either directly obtained from tables or indirectly from graphs using the getdata graph digitizer shcherbak et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 this search produced a large database from which the data were extracted and compiled based on the following criteria all data were gathered from field experiments laboratory experiments pot experiments experiments under rainproof shelters as well as data obtained from model simulations were excluded at least two treatments sap no sap were tested crop yield or wp were documented only experiments that reported at least three replicates of each treatment were considered the data resulting from the replicates of each treatment

our analysis we considered eight response soil variables wsa total soil porosity som ph total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium associated with soil properties to examine the underlying causes of yield and wp variations under sap see supplementary datasets in this meta analysis the categorical and continuous metadata table 1 from each study were used as possible explanatory factors of sap related changes in yield et and wp the crops were categorized into six types maize wheat cotton oat oil crop soybean peanut and sunflower tuber crop potato and sweet potato and vegetables tomato pepper cabbage sugar beet cucumber eggplant carrot etc the water management was classified as rainfed or irrigated the sap types were divided into three categories

standard deviations sd or standard error se were not available we used the bracken1992 approach to impute sd bracken 1992 if standard errors se were given instead of sd we converted se to sd as sd se n where n is the number of total replicates wang et al 2020 the meta analysis was performed using the rma mv function of the metafor package wang et al 2020 in r version 3 61 our analyses were separated in two steps random effects meta analysis and mixed effects meta analysis models first we used a random effects meta analysis model to assess the mean weighted effect sizes and 95 confidence intervals cis of independent variable yield et wp wsa soil porosity som ph total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in sap and no sap groups if the cis value of the mean effect size did not superimpose on zero this was taken as indication that the differences were significant for these analyses we assessed heterogeneity by formal cochran s q test tests qt which test whether the variability in the observed effect sizes or outcomes is larger than would be expected based on sampling variability alone viechtbauer 2007 after analyzing heterogeneity there were significant residual heterogeneity in the random effects meta analysis for the yield dataset total heterogeneity qt 1685073 p 0 0001 the et dataset qt 78961830 p 0 0001 the wp dataset qt 1048925 p 0 0001 the wsa qt 2096 p 0 0001 the soil porosity qt 651131 p 0 0001 the som qt 7485 p 0 0001 the ph qt 18034 p 0 0001 the total nitrogen qt 758 p 0 0001 the available nitrogen qt 40208 p 0 0001 the available phosphorus qt 423757 p 0 0001 and the available potassium qt 254103 p 0 0001 table s2 hence we ran mixed effects meta analysis models the second step to investigate the relationship between the independent variable and explanatory variables categorical and continuous moderators models with categorical factors were also run without the intercept to obtain the parameter estimates mean effect sizes for each level the qt of each variable in the categorical groups was partitioned into the explained heterogeneity by the moderator qm and the unknown factors residual heterogeneity qw and p values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using bonferroni corrections p 0 05 of qm indicated the mean effect sizes which showed a significant difference amongst different levels in each category variables kuang et al 2021 for each of the continuous moderators water supply initial som initial ph initial soil bulk density initial total nitrogen and nitrogen application rates qw qm intercept distance slope and p values were calculated from statistical analyses and the relationships were considered significant at p 0 05 however in this study we mainly focused on analyzing the effect of sap on yield et and wp under different environmental conditions and did not evaluate the effect of sap on soil properties through different explanatory variables we assessed publication bias with funnel plots and egger tests by including precision 1 se as the covariate in the rma mv function and using meta analytic residuals benitez lopez et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 rosenberg s fail safe

robust if nfs 5 k 10 k the number of sizes 2 2 2 other statistical analyses a single linear regression was used to estimate the relationship between different soil properties wsa soil porosity som ph total n available n available phosphorus and available potassium and yield wp and et ordinary least squares ols regression analysis was employed to compare significant correlations between response ratios crop yield wp and explanatory variable by using the r package splines 2 2 3 sap related economic benefit calculation the economic benefits were associated with sap inputs sap prices and grain production which were calculated as follows economic benefits increased yield yield price sap inputs sap sprice where the increased grain yield kg ha 1 was based on the difference between yields with sap treatment and yields with no sap yield price was the average price of crops us ha 1 the average crop price was calculated based on the price data from 2010 to 2020 provided by the national compilation of agricultural product cost benefit data the sap s price us ha 1 was calculated by averaging the price data provided in the reported literature and the average sap inputs kg ha 1 of every crop was also calculated by data collected from previous studies 3 results 3 1 overview of studies included in the meta analysis the 310 published studies included in the meta analysis cover the period from 1980 to 2022 see supplementary datasets a summary of the feedstocks used to produce the sap sap application methods rates and sap forms for the various studies considered is provided in table 1 3 2 overall effects of sap on soil physical and chemical properties crop water use yield and wp sap significantly increased wsa and total soil porosity by 18 9 cis 16 0 21 9 and 18 0 cis 12 4

phosphorus by 7 3 cis from 0 4 to 14 3 available potassium by 5 4 cis from 2 7 to 8 0 and total nitrogen contents by 8 73 cis from 3 4 to 14 1 compared with no sap application data there was no obvious modification in the soil ph mean 0 1 cis from 0 7 to 0 9 fig 2 the sap treatments decreased et during the crop growing season by 2 8 compared to no sap treatments which likely indicates that sap reduces soil water supply the change in stored soil water between planting and harvest compared to no sap fig s3 taking wheat as an example we observed how the effect of sap on water use varied at different growth stages the reduction in water usage after sap application was 21 6 cis 38 1 to 5 2 from the jointing to the filling stage and 21 3 cis 37 9 to 4 6 from the sowing to jointing stage in contrast the application of sap significantly increased water usage by 36 9 cis 6 2 67 7 during the filling to the harvest stage fig 2 these results suggest that the decreased et after sap application can be mainly attributed to the lower water usage in the early growth period compared to no sap sap significantly increased crop yield and wp by 12 8 cis 12 1 13 4 qt 1685073 2 p 0 01 and 17 2 cis 15 9 18 4 qt 1048924 6 p 0 01 respectively in all observations fig 3 the higher production and lower et directly cause the higher wp values under sap conditions fig 2 the increase in yield p 0 01 and wp p 0 01 achieved with sap application varied significantly for different types of crops yields were increased for each of the six categories of crops considered with the effect size ranging between 9 3 18 3 the highest increase in yield was observed in vegetables 18 3 followed by tuber crops 17 7 oil crops 15 2 oat 11 5 wheat 10 4 maize 9 6 and cotton 9 3 the highest wp was observed for tuber crops 27 1 because of their lower et 4 8 while the lowest wp was observed in cotton 12 2 wp was intermediate in vegetables 24 3 oil crops 22 4 oat 19 8 maize 13 8 and wheat 13 4 fig 3 funnel plots and egger tests suggest that the overall rr for et p 0 50 0 05 wsa p 0 082 0 05 porosity p 0 306 0 05 som p 0 2999 0 05 available phosphorus p 0 0485 0 05 available potassium p 0 6315 0 05 total nitrogen p 0 5057 0 05 available nitrogen p 0 9320 0 05 and ph p 0 0636 0 05 have no potential bias and the nfs were large enough for et 1770225011 p 0 01 wsa 126380 p 0 01 total soil porosity 9709284 p 0 01 som

about the reliability of our estimates fig s2 and tables s1 there was a small potential publication bias for yield p 0 0019 0 05 and wp p 0 0103 0 05 however the nfs of yield and wp for the database were 39497621772 p 0 01 and 228345081 p 0 01 respectively both of which were higher than the threshold of 7230 and 2810 5 k 10 needed to consider the mean effect size robust thus the results of our meta analysis are highly reliable and a considerable number of unpublished relationships would be required to disprove the effects we have identified as significant fig s1 s2 and tables s1 3 3 effects of sap variations on crop yield and wp the categorical group analysis indicated that sap feedstocks types significantly affected yield and wp yield p 0 0014 wp p 0 01 compared to untreated conditions the yield significantly increased by 7 8 cis 4 4 11 1 when natural polymer modification sap was applied by 14 8 cis 12 6 17 1 for organic inorganic hybrid compound sap application and by 13 7 cis 12 7 14 8 for synthetic polymerization sap application the highest wp was observed with organic inorganic hybrid compound applications 28 7 cis 25 4 32 1 and resulted in the lowest et mean 8 4 cis 10 0 to 6 9 the lowest wp was found in natural polymer modification mean 5 5 cis 0 3 to 11 3 due to the lowest yield and an intermediate one for synthetic polymerization mean 17 4 cis 15 8 18 9 in terms of sap forms fine grained sap showed a positive effect on yield 18 4 which was significantly higher than the one observed for large grained sap 9 6 the wp of the fine grained sap 20 1 was lower than the one for the large grained sap 22 3 due to higher et in fine grained sap conditions 3 2 no differences were evident between two solid forms of sap fig 4 sap application significantly increased yield and wp in all application methods but the effects varied among application methods fig 4 yield p 0 0006 wp p 0 01 the highest yield 16 3 and wp 26 6 were achieved by adding sap with the method of hole applying while the smallest response was found following seed coating or soaking in addition the highest increases in yield associated with sap application in terms of duration time of the treatment was observed for one year long applications mean 10 2 cis 5 6 14 9 compared to applications lasting longer than two years mean 8 05 cis 3 8 12 4 the increases in wp was similar in the two groups because of the lower et 7 5 when the experiment duration time was one year mean 18 50 cis 12 3 24 7 compared to when it was two years or more mean 11 19 cis 5 1 17 3 however the differences in effects between the sap application duration times groups did not reach statistical significance yield p 0 5022 wp p 0 1011 the sap application rate did not significantly affect yield p 0 4774 increased yields were at the highest when the sap application rate was 45 90 kg ha 1 13 3 cis 12 1 14 6 lowest when the sap rates was 90 kg ha 1 11 6 cis 9 1 14 2 and intermediate when the sap rates was 45 kg ha 1 12 7 cis 11 7 13 7 to the contrary the sap application rates significantly affected crop wp p 0 0316 and the highest wp was found for sap rates 45 90 kg ha 1 19 4 cis 17 1 21 7 which was attributed to the lowest et 4 9 cis 6 0 to 3 9 the lowest wp 16 9 cis 11 0 22 9 was found for sap rates were 90 kg ha 1 which is a result of the highest et 2 32 cis 5 0 to 0 3 fig 4 3 4 effects of sap on crop yield and wp under different management measures and soil properties water management also significantly affected the rrs of yield p 0 0013 and wp p 0 0094 after applying sap the application of sap in rainfed systems significantly increased crop yield by an average of 13 9 cis 12 6 15 1 while it increased by 11 1 cis 9 9 12 2 in irrigated systems the increase in wp was also higher for rainfed conditions 18 3 than under irrigated conditions 14 8 due to lower et values under rainfed conditions fig 4 table s3 these results suggested that sap was more effective in improving yield and wp under rainfed conditions the continuous randomized effects model analysis showed that the effect sizes of sap on yield and wp after applying sap negatively correlated to n fertilizer rates yield p 0 0067 wp p 0 0042 and water supply figs 5 7 yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0021 however the effect size of et was positively correlated with water supply p 0 0004 and approached zero at a water supply of over 550 mm suggesting that the use of sap is more likely to decease the et at low water supply level than high input of water supply and the sap could not reduce the water consumption when the water supply is higher than 550 mm fig 6 in addition both the effect sizes of yield and wp negatively correlated to the initial som yield p 0 0012 wp p 0 01 and total nitrogen yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0363 and approached zero at initial som of over 30 g kg 1 suggesting that the use of sap is more likely to increase the yield and wp at low initial total nitrogen and som levels both rrs of the yield and wp were affected by the initial ph yield p 0 01 wp p 0 01 and the rrs of yield and wp were significantly positive when the initial soil ph were 4 8 7 and 6 5 8 7 respectively but the rrs of et were negatively correlated with the initial ph fig 6 table s5 initial soil bulk density was positively correlated with the rrs of wp after applying sap p 0 0039 but it showed no statistical significance for the effect size of yield p 0 1424 figs 5 7 table s4 and s5 3 5 relationships among the soil physicochemical properties and crop yield and wp under sap application we conducted regression analyses to examine correlations between the rrs of yield wp and the rrs of soil physicochemical properties figs 8 9 both the rrs of yield and wp after sap application were positively and significantly correlated to the rrs of som yield p 0 0007 wp p 0 0148 wsa yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0392 available nitrogen yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0017 available phosphorus yield p 0 0104 wp p 0 0207 and available potassium yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0012 the rrs of total soil porosity p 0 0188 after sap application was significantly positively correlated with the rrs of wp but not with rrs of yield these results suggested that the yield or wp could be enhanced by increasing the soil nutrient pool or improving soil physicochemical properties unexpectedly the linear regression analysis showed that the rrs of soil ph was negatively correlated with the rrs of yield p 0 0075 after applying sap but showed no significant relationships with the rrs of wp p 0 3247 after applying sap the rrs of total nitrogen were negatively correlated with wp p 0 0311 but not with yield p 0 3481 3 6 economic benefits of sap the net returns in us of sap applications were 23 0 for maize 346 3 for cotton 613 0 for peanuts 1002 7 for soybeans 579 47 for potatoes 2300 7 for tomatoes 4298 1 for cucumbers and 1357 9 for peppers table 2 in the case of wheat despite the enhanced wheat yield 10 4 following sap application the economic return was not sufficient to offset the increased economic investments due to the cost of sap application and showed a net decrease of 12 5 ha 1 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 sap amendment improving soil physicochemical properties sap could retain large quantities of nutrients and improve soil physicochemical properties egrinya eneji et al 2013 in our study sap significantly increased wsa 18 94 and porosity 18 0 fig 2 previous studies reported that sap could improve soil porosity and soil aggregate by affecting the degree of agglutination with soil particles and the process of shrinking swelling yang et al 2011 2018 the use of sap materials as a carrier and regulator of nutrient release was helpful in reducing undesired fertilizer losses zheng et al 2009 and increased soil nutrient content soils with more large macro aggregates have more stable structure with better storage of nutrients under sap application conditions xu et al 2015 it was also reported that sap application could increase soil total nitrogen available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium which would be helpful to satisfy the nutrient demand during the plant growth phase cao et al 2017 yaseen et al 2020 the high accumulation of som which may be attributed to increased wsa by sap improves the soil structure and enhances its stability thus facilitating the physical protection of organic carbon yang et al 2021 previous studies reported that sap has the potential benefit of helping superfluous som aggregate in the soil layer so as to prevent it being immediately decomposed or lost goebel et al 2005 moreover sap can also promote the metabolism of soil microorganisms by maintaining the ambient temperature and control water release thereby promoting an increase in microbial population and conversion efficiency of exogenous fresh organic matter eg organic fertilizer or biological bacterial fertilizer or straw returning or biochar and so on returned to the soil zhang et al 2018 soil microbial biomass carbon was significantly positively correlated with som and sap could affect soil microbial biomass carbon by increasing soil microorganism populations li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 it was found that soil organic carbon microbial biomass carbon microbial biomass nitrogen and soil microorganisms were improved through applying sap supplementary figures 4 it should be noted that soil physicochemical properties did not solely depends on whether sap was applied but also on other factors including initial soil properties sap application rate weather conditions and field management measures bai et al 2010 cao et al 2017 hou et al 2018 mazen et al 2015 4 2 general effect of sap application response to yield wp water use and economic benefits our meta analysis revealed that yield is significantly higher 12 8 under sap application systems fig 3 sap application has the potential for the soil to retain more water from irrigation or rainfall and reduce the frequency of irrigation resulting in reduced water usage and increased wp singh et al 2007 verma et al 2019 similar meta analysis results were also reported in maize production zheng et al 2020 sap could also hold plant nutrients and release them slowly to support crop growth islam et al 2011 both the yield and wp were significantly increased in response to sap application via the improvements in the soil micro environment similar results have been reported in potato and maize hou et al 2018 xu et al 2015 el asmar et al 2017 sap can significantly decrease et through reducing soil evaporation islam et al 2011 the water usage in the early growth period after sap application is significantly lower than with no sap which could be attributed to sap decreasing the soil water ineffective evaporation for the sap application the water usage was significantly higher during the late growth period likely because sap can release water when there is a shortage of water in the soil or when the crop water demand is at its peak stage so that crops can more effectively use water sap has potential economic benefits and can be considered as an economically viable technology to enhance farm income the higher net return of cotton oil crops vegetable crops and tuber crops were mainly due to the higher yields many studies have already reported higher net returns after sap application hou et al 2018 however we calculated a negative net return for wheat and a low net return for maize mainly due to a lower yield and the lower unit price of maize and wheat which nullifies the advantages of sap these results indicate that sap application may not be suitable for grain crops 4 3 conditions under which sap application is more conductive to improve yield and wp sap showed significant positive effects on yield and wp for different crops indicating the wide applicability of sap however the positive effects of sap varies with the crop type perhaps as a result of different water demand patterns and the functional characteristics of sap for instance potatoes and vegetables are said to be more sensitive to irrigation deficits than wheat and maize van 1981 adu et al 2018 sap is known to be beneficial for drought sensitive plants as it allows them to manage with water stress islam et al 2011 abdallah et al 2021 the increases in yield and wp are significantly higher in rainfed systems than in irrigated systems which suggest that the use of sap is very important to achieve high yields and high wps in dryland the reason for this phenomenon may be related to the fact that sap can store more water in the soil and therefore increases the soil water content providing a relief from drought stress under water deficit conditions yang et al 2017 at the same time sap can significantly reduce surface runoff and soil erosion cao et al 2017 it prevents soil surface crust and improves rainfall efficiency and the soil infiltration rate of rainfall ultimately increasing yield and wp similar both yield and wp are negatively correlated with water supply yield p 0 01 wp p 0 0021 figs 5 7 suggesting that the use of sap is more likely to increase yield and wp when the water supply is limited compared to when it s abundant sap reduced et under insufficient water supply conditions compared to well watered conditions fig 6 previous studies have found the response of yield and wp to sap levels in the 40 etc treatments were higher than 80 etc treatments rostampour et al 2013 the same study also showed that a sufficient water supply defies the beneficial effects of sap treatments both in terms of crop yield and wp dehkordi 2017 the larger effect of sap application on both yield and wp has been observed in soil where n input is low strongly suggesting that sap application in barren soil is especially conducive to increase yield and wp mikkelsen et al 1993 our results confirmed the benefits of sap applications are at their highest on infertile soils low total nitrogen and som figs 5 and 7 the beneficial effects of sap applications in these conditions is due to sap and fertilizer forming hydrated polymers while mixing with water these polymers are able to absorb large amounts of nutrients into their structure which are then released slowly the slow release of nutrients helps reduce fertilizer loss and increase the efficiency of nitrogen usage both factors that contribute to improving yield wang et al 2021 previous research has reported that sap application increases yield by 44 at medium fertilizer levels and 80 3 at low fertilizer levels and that by combining sap with only half the conventional rate of fertilizer minimized nitrate leaching and enhanced uptake without reducing yield egrinya eneji et al 2013 in our study we found that there was a significantly positive relationship between the rrs of yield and wp and the initial ph after sap application suggesting that sap is more likely to increase yield and wp in soils with higher initial ph than in soils with lower initial ph previous studies reported that ammonia volatilization in alkaline soils is likely to be higher than in other types of soil and sap was found to increase the efficiency of soil nitrogen uptake by reducing the volatilization of soil ammonia du et al 2007 carrijo et al 2017 thus resulting in higher yield and wp besides it is prone to reduce the availability of soil phosphorus potassium and calcium in alkaline soils resulting in soil microelement loss however sap can improve the availability of soil microelement by increasing soil som thus improving yield and wp kuppusamy et al 2018 the effect size of wp after sap application was positively correlated with initial soil bulk density meaning that applying sap was more likely to increase the effect sizes of wp in soils in where the initial soil bulk density is higher than lower it is postulated that this could be attributed to sap significantly improving the water conservation capacity of the soil by decreasing soil bulk density thereby promoting crop growth abrisham et al 2018 hou et al 2018 in addition it is important to consider that soil bulk density has a dramatic influence on the process of water infiltration with permeability decreasing where bulk density is high this can make soil erosion easier leading to lower wp dong et al 2021 sap can prevent soil erosion by absorbing more than a thousand times its original weight in water cao et al 2017 4 4 sap properties effect on crop yield and wp differences in crop yield and wp after sap application are due to sap feedstocks types sap form and sap application method fig 4 amongst the three feedstock types considered organic and inorganic compound saps appear to be the most effective to increase crops yield and wp while natural polymer sap is the least beneficial the reason may be attributed to the fact that organic and inorganic compound saps contain a large amount of mineral nutrients so that it not only stores large quantities of water available for crop absorption but also increases the supply of nutrients li et al 2015 despite this natural polymer sap has a lower water absorbency ratio and poor gel strength which may decrease its water absorption capacity wang et al 2021 previous studies have reported that both organic and inorganic compound saps could significantly improve soil physical properties when compared to single natural polymer or natural polymer saps xu et al 2015 the use of fine grained sap achieves higher yield and wp than the large grained sap the reason has been attributed to the fact that fine grained sap has a higher water holding capacity and available water capacity than the large grained sap abdallah 2019 as a result fine particles sap is more effective at alleviating the inhibition of plant growth caused by drought stress several other studies also reported that larger particles release less water into the soil due the smaller area of contact with the dry soil particles making the water stored in the fine particles more readily available for extraction by the plant roots abdallah 2019 hüttermann et al 2010 sap application methods varied significantly in their capacity to increase crop yield and wp fig 4 amongst the six methods of applications considered the highest increase in yield and wp was observed when sap was applied by banding or hole applications previous studies have suggested that banding application sap could result in higher wp and yield than mix application a possible explanation for this is that banding or hole application methods create a water reservoir within the root zone of the plant ensuring that sap is spread in a uniform continuous layer rather than being dispersed as individual granules so that it can better withstand the pressure of the soil load el asmar et al 2017 higher wp was found in mixed applications of sap compared to furrow applications the primary reason was that the mixed application method can provide a more even distribution in the soil compared to furrow application this is more conducive to absorption of soil water by the crop and reduces the et by inhibiting deep soil water pecolation and evaporation bai et al 2010 4 5 linking crop yield and wp with underlying drivers of soil physicochemical functioning higher soil quality generally resulted in higher crop yield and wp in our study we found that some soil physicochemical properties were significantly correlated with yield and wp both the rrs of yield and wp after sap application were positively correlated to the rrs of available nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium som contents and wsa figs 7 and 8 which suggest that yield and wp can be improved by increasing available nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium som contents and wsa the higher yield and wp following sap application have been mainly attributed to the larger retention of soil nutrients available nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium contents wu and liu 2007 cao et al 2017 in addition previous studies have suggested that the yield increase after sap application is due to increased wsa or som contents xu et al 2015 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2021 som in soil has been shown to have a significant influence on soil water retention capabilities rawls et al 2003 increased som after sap application reduces water transpiration ankenbauer and loheide 2017 thus an organically rich soil benefits from increased wp the unique medium structure of soil aggregates regulates water and nutrient circulations and consequently affects wp assi et al 2019 the rrs of yield values significantly decrease with the increase rrs of soil ph fig 8 which may be due to sap preventing the excessive rise of soil ph for alkaline soil and eventually leading to better plant growth and nutrient uptake by the crops du et al 2007 fan et al 2015 in contrast soil ph had no significant relationships with the rrs of wp fig 9 which may be attributed to an increased ph after sap application which induced an increase in water consumption the rrs of wp after sap application decreased with the increase of total nitrogen rrs values indicating that the accumulation of n may lead to high et in turn decreasing wp 4 6 limitations and potential for future study direction this study suggests that not only does sap application have the potential to increase availability of food due to higher yield of crops and to save water but sap applications also have a substantial and specific agro ecological effect in poor soils considering the economic feasibility of its production technologies and their adoption as well as a positive policy environment sap application appears to have the potential to make a substantial contribution to global food production however the cost of sap is still relatively high hou et al 2018 and in some cases such as for wheat production it may not be economically beneficial representing instead a net cost table 2 in addition although sap feedstocks types significantly affected yield and wp fig 4 most sap eg synthetic polymerization are composed of an acrylamide monomer which has been linked to cancer wilson et al 2010 some studies have reported that acrylamide monomers could translocate into crops from hydrogel mroczek et al 2014 which may pose a risk to human health however previous studies suggested that there was no translocation of the acrylamide monomer into crops castle et al 1991 suresh et al 2018 besides saps tend to degrade slowly in the environment but some studies have reported that sap could effectively increase nitrogen use efficiency by minimizing leaching and enhancing water and nitrate retention in the soil egrinya eneji et al 2013 obviously the health and environmental risks of sap are still under debate zhang et al 2007 more research is are therefore needed to evaluate the economic viability environmental toxicity and safety of food products of sap treated crops before sap can be widely applied to soil distribution of sample points were unbalanced in this study given there was a large variation in climate soil properties and management practice among different countries or within the same countries more effort is needed in evaluating how the sap effects crop wp and yield in other countries to minimize the current large uncertainties in the future in addition it is essential to take into consideration how management practices have interactive effects that greatly influence the choice of the best practices to mitigate water consumption ensure food provision and improve the properties of the soil many studies have evaluated the effects of combined management practices applied in combination fallahi et al 2015 yang et al 2017 feng et al 2020 yaseen et al 2020 and have found that interactive effects on yield wp and soil properties between the management practices can be additive synergistic or antagonistic yue et al 2019 shang et al 2021 the interactive effects of sap applications and other management strategies on crop yield wp and soil properties have yet to be investigated more work needs to be done to fully understand the interactive effects of multiple management practices on crop yield wp and soil properties we recognize that experimental durations might lead to a gap between our results and the ideal situation most experiments from which we collected the dataset considered in this study only lasted one growing season and most of the durations were shorter than one year the long term application of sap is beneficial in that it increases the content of organic carbon and improves soil structure and its stability yang et al 2021 we believe that well designed long term studies are required to report the longevity of the effects of sap application hou et al 2018 further studies should also focus on the economic sustainability of sap application over the long term and on the environmental impacts of this technology on the ecosystem after harvest besides the standard error standard deviation or sufficient information to calculate them are often missing from the available data making it necessary to rely on estimations made through statistical methods any sort of gap filling introduces uncertainty into a dataset emde et al 2021 thus we strongly recommend that the standard error of experimental results should be recorded in more detail in the future 5 conclusion we assessed the integrated effects of sap application on wp crop yield and its economic benefits on different crops in china the results of our meta analysis showed that the yield and wp effects of sap application vary depending on soil conditions field management practices and sap properties fig 10 within a certain range of each environmental interpretation factor sap application was shown to be more suitable for tuber crops and vegetables especially in rainfed conditions poor water supply lower n fertilizer rates and lower initial som higher initial ph and higher initial soil bulk density as these were the optimal conditions giving the largest increase in yield and wp sap produced from organic inorganic hybrid compounds and in fine gained form has the strongest effect on crop yield and wp the banding hole application was more effective than other methods to

8977,the soil vulnerability index svi classifies vulnerability to cropland pollutant transport by surface runoff and leaching helping to categorize areas with a high contribution of pollutant loads this study aims to 1 adopt the svi classification scheme in south korea and 2 suggest a modified svi classification scheme for surface runoff to anticipate climate change impacts the precipitation amount was considered in an original scheme to make a modified scheme the results with an original svi classification scheme predicted that the svi surface runoff vulnerability was relatively greater in areas with a steep slope than in those with a plain topography and a high level of the svi leaching vulnerability was frequently observed in plain areas when a modified svi classification scheme was applied high vulnerability class increased from 44 0 to 57 4 and the greater increase rate was observed in the regions susceptible to heavy precipitation defined as a day with more than 80 mm precipitation when compared with observational suspended solids the results with a modified svi classification scheme were more consistent with observations than those with an original svi classification scheme relative to the baseline period the svi surface runoff vulnerability of high class increased by 47 1 88 7 during the climate change period when the number of vulnerability classes was increased the differences on very extremely high class between the baseline and projection periods were clear with the increase rate of 16 4 343 the results with an original svi classification scheme matched well with the topographic characteristics and a modified svi classification scheme captured the impacts of regional precipitation patterns and climate change impacts as a first approach to adopting the svi classification system to south korea increasing the number of classifications in regions with excessive rainfall amounts can improve identifying those most vulnerable areas keywords soil vulnerability index svi pollutant loads precipitation amount a modified svi classification scheme data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pollution from non point source nps is known as a major global challenge and increased attention is focusing on water quality degradation albiac et al 2012 emili and greene 2013 sun et al 2012 pollution from nps originates from diffuse sources including agriculture urban areas roads and mining wang et al 2018 in particular excessive loads of agricultural nps pollution are of great importance non point pollution is a critical environmental issue in south korea agricultural lands account for only 16 of the total area but a considerable amount of nutrients from agricultural activities deteriorate water quality of south korea krei 2020 in particular nps pollutants from agricultural lands are known to be key drivers of eutrophication outbreaks in surface water bodies park et al 2010 the us department of agriculture usda natural resources and conservation service nrcs developed the soil vulnerability index svi to assess areas with inherent vulnerability to agricultural pollutants via surface runoff and leaching thompson et al 2020 this index was designed for water resource managers to easily identify the critical contributing areas of pollutant loads without complex model simulations chan et al 2017 the svi has been explored in various ways including validating the svi classification results with water quality models such as soil and water assessment tool lee et al 2018 and annualized agricultural non point source yasarer et al 2020 it was concluded that the svi classification scheme was useful for detecting the locations of critical areas exporting nps pollutants across the landscape lee et al 2018 yasarer et al 2020 the use of the svi classification scheme as input data for predicting water quality variables was found to be acceptable at the watershed level lohani et al 2020b there is a need to test the svi classification scheme in different countries thompson et al 2020 the svi classification scheme has the advantage of identifying vulnerable areas using a simplified approach compared to process based or statistical modeling approaches however the svi classification scheme excludes climatic factors to make vulnerability classifications based on inherent land surface characteristics potentially limiting the exploration of how climate change affects vulnerability to nps pollutant loads vulnerability classification approaches frequently include climatic factors as input variables to rank vulnerable areas jiang et al 2021 liu and miao 2018 thus the svi classification scheme might not be appropriate for assessing the impacts of climate change or areas where nps pollutants are strongly affected by precipitation events modified precipitation caused by climate change is expected to exacerbate water quality degradation mainly because of the excessive transport of nps pollutants from agricultural lands whitehead et al 2009 most future projections anticipate that climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events delivering increased amounts of pollutants from soils to nearby water bodies corada fernández et al 2017 myhre et al 2019 park et al 2010 such detrimental effects can be particularly severe in regions such as south korea where precipitation events occur mostly during specific seasons kim et al 2001 ockenden et al 2017 the national institute of meteorological research has predicted that climate change could lead to warmer conditions and an increased frequency of heavy precipitation known as a day with more than 80 mm precipitation according to a heavy rainfall defined by korea meteorological administration kma in south korea in response to such potential changes the export of nps pollutants to streams in south korea is projected to increase ahn et al 2014 han et al 2017 jang and kim 2017 the objective of this study aimed to 1 apply the svi classification scheme in south korea to classify croplands vulnerable to pollutant loads via surface runoff and leaching and 2 modify an original svi classification scheme by including precipitation amount as a variable and 3 project the areas vulnerable to pollutant loads under climate change conditions using a modified svi classification scheme a modified svi classification scheme coupled with precipitation data was evaluated under baseline 1981 2010 and two projection periods near 2031 2060 and far 2071 2100 future precipitation data were projected using five global circulation models gcms to depict climate change conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area south korea is geographically located in east asia at 35 50 n and 127 00 e fig 1a due to its geographical location south korea has four distinctive seasons spring march to may summer june to august fall september to november and winter december to february the winter and spring seasons tend to be dry due to the siberian high pressure and migratory anticyclones respectively while the summer season is wet and humid due to north pacific high pressure choi et al 2017 according to the kma over the past 30 years summer precipitation june august accounts for on average 54 6 of annual precipitation table 1 although agricultural lands are covered by plants during summer seasons in korea heavy precipitation leads to substantial loads of pollutants from lands to nearby water bodies the condition of agricultural lands during the winter seasons is bare soils susceptible to surface runoff but the winter seasons are dominated by drought conditions with a small amount of precipitation and thus rarely experience serious pollutant loads south korea is divided into four major watersheds fig 1a the han river hr nakdong river nr gum river gr and yeongsan sumjin river ysr only the portion of the hr geographically included in south korea was investigated in this study fig 1a the svi classification results were compared for the country and four watershed levels according to a land use map from the environmental geographic information service egis https egis me go kr agricultural land occupies approximately 20 of the country fig 1b non agricultural lands are dominated by forested lands the svi classes were only computed for agricultural lands further descriptions of four major watersheds are illustrated in the table s1 and fig s1 of the supplementary material in this study 60 automated surface observing system asos stations of the kma were used to determine the availability of precipitation for both baseline and climate change conditions fig 1b 2 2 study diagram the overall diagram of this study is shown in fig 2 the methods of original and modified svi classification schemes are described in the sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 respectively then the basic input data for the svi classification scheme are illustrated in the section 2 2 3 lastly the climate change data used for a modified svi classification scheme are explained in the section 2 2 4 2 2 1 an original svi classification scheme the two original svi classification schemes for surface runoff and leaching are explained in tables 2 and 3 respectively the svi surface runoff vulnerability is categorized into four classes from low to high based on the combinations of hydrologic soil group hsg data soil erosion factor k factor and slope table 2 when ranking the svi leaching vulnerability four datasets i e k factor slope hsg data and organic soil were compiled to categorize the four vulnerability classes table 3 the svi vulnerability was assessed based on the relative proportion of both high and moderately high to the total area 2 2 2 a modified svi classification scheme this study applied precipitation data to an original svi classification scheme for surface runoff alone the loads of pollutants vulnerable to surface runoff tend to be proportional to precipitation amount johnson et al 2018 compared with those for leaching whereas pollutant loads via leaching are complicated by multiple factors including precipitation bieroza et al 2019 jiao et al 2004 to consider heavy precipitation events we analyzed the interpolated precipitation days during the summer seasons june july and august for 30 years 1981 2010 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was used because it is the most used method for precipitation jo et al 2018 song et al 2021 the idw method predicts unknown points among known points with values by applying a weighted average of the values at known points as a function of the distance robinson and metternicht 2006 we counted the number of pixels with more than 80 mm daily precipitation and found that the pixels with 30 50 heavy precipitation days were dominant fig 3 accordingly we assumed that if the number of heavy precipitation days during the summer seasons for 30 years i e the baseline and two climate change conditions is 40 and between 20 and 39 the vulnerability increases by two and one class respectively fig 4 we focused on the summer season because heavy precipitation events are frequently observed during this period in south korea kim et al 2001 for example low svi surface runoff vulnerability class 1 increases to moderately high when the number of summertime heavy precipitation days with equal or greater than 40 days and 2 increases to moderate when the number of summertime heavy precipitation days with greater than 20 days but not 40 days the class increase by the precipitation amount could lead to a great proportion of high class since one and two class increases at most reach to high class fig 4 thus a modified svi classification scheme further classified four classes into six classes by splitting high class into three classes very extremely high extremely high and high the high class results with an original svi classification scheme increases to extremely high or very extremely high when the increases of one or two class are made respectively to compare two svi classification schemes i e original and modified and assess the svi leaching vulnerability observational suspended solids ss and nitrate nitrogen of the four watersheds were investigated respectively we selected the ss and nitrate nitrogen since the transports of ss and nitrate nitrogen are mostly driven by surface runoff and leaching on the land surface respectively the available observations for ss nitrate nitrogen during summer seasons from 2011 to 2020 were downloaded from 156 320 92 259 59 189 and 57 126 monitoring stations for the hr nr gr and ysr respectively this study includes all available ss and nitrate nitrogen observations during summer seasons to see the differences on observational ss and nitrate nitrogen among four watersheds we conducted analysis of variance anova with 5 significance level this statistical result could justify the necessity of comparing svi classification results with the observed water quality variables among four watersheds to assess the validity of the svi classification schemes the monitoring station locations are shown in the fig s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 3 data description and preparation first the spatial boundary of agricultural lands across south korea was identified using a land use map from the egis this study used the soil data provided by the national institute of agricultural sciences of the korean rural development administration krda where the soil data included the hydrologic soil group hsg and k factor fig 5ab soil organic data were collected from approximately 606 000 sites in major crop fields from 2009 to 2011 through a project of krda jeon et al 2012 after pre processing 486 462 sampling points were selected for this study and these points were interpolated to gridded data with 5 meter resolution using kriging long et al 2020 to match with dem carbon data were set to have 5 m resolution kriging is a geostatistical interpolation approach that predicts unknown points using distance and covariance robinson and metternicht 2006 and it was shown to be suitable interpolation method for soil organic matter long et al 2020 the interpolation process was conducted using the spatial analysis tool arcmap version 10 7 after interpolating organic soil data areas with a proportion of soil organic material lower than 15 were assessed as non organic soils and the other areas were regarded as organic soils based on the organic soil guideline huang et al 2009 a high resolution digital elevation model dem with 5 meter resolution was obtained from the national spatial data infrastructure portal nsdi http www nsdi go kr as a fine resolution dem could better discretize svi classes lohani et al 2020a the slope dataset was calculated from the dem using the arcmap spatial analysis tool version 10 7 daily precipitation data between 1981 and 2010 were obtained from 60 asos stations operated by the kma and interpolated precipitation data taken at weather stations to make 1 km gridded data using the idw in asos station the tipping bucket type rain gauge is used to measure rain depth kim et al 2012 it should be noted that the tipping bucket rain gauge often shows underestimation errors for the rainfall depth with greater than 50 mm h humphrey et al 1997 because precipitation pattern was less variable across the landscape this study set up 1 km resolution for precipitation regarding previous studies conducted in south korea hong et al 2022 kim et al 2021b kim et al 2021a topographic factors were set at 5 m resolution since a high resolution has been suggested for topographic factors to make more accurate svi classes chan et al 2017 heavy precipitation events were identified by counting the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation over the summer season for the individual grids gridded precipitation data were superimposed on the svi surface runoff vulnerability map to reflect the precipitation amount in an original svi classification scheme table 4 2 2 4 climate change data future projections of daily precipitation over 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 were developed from five gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 the five cmip6 gcms used in the study are listed in table 5 each gcm was combined with shared socio economic pathways ssp representative concentration pathway ssp rcp scenarios the ssp are scenarios describing alternative socioeconomic developments from 2015 to 2100 which were introduced in the 6th assessment report on climate change which was recently published by the ipcc ipcc 2021 the descriptions of the four ssp rcp scenarios coupled with each gcm are presented in table s2 of the supplementary material this study used five gcms under ssp with the greatest potential for extreme climatic conditions i e ssp585 in south korea the management of extreme climate conditions is increasingly important since the actual extreme conditions exceed the projected conditions which needs adaptation strategies in response to the worst case kim et al 2021b kim et al 2021a thus this study chose the extreme scenario with multiple cgms the coarse spatial scale of the gcm raw data was first interpolated to the resolution of the 60 asos station spacing approximately 45 km based on idw systematic bias existing in each gcm dataset was corrected using a standard quantile mapping thrasher et al 2012 approach so that the systematic biases between the observed and gcm data were removed future precipitation data were converted to gridded format data with 1 km resolution using idw similar to the baseline precipitation data the gcm precipitation data were placed on top of the svi classification results to estimate the svi surface runoff vulnerability under climate change the five svi surface runoff vulnerability results were analyzed for four major individual watersheds and then the areas of individual classes for the five svi results were computed the individual classes for the five svi surface runoff vulnerability results were averaged for the four major watersheds for comparison with the baseline period using the average results a comparative analysis of the svi surface runoff vulnerability under the baseline 1981 2010 and two climate change conditions near projection 2031 2060 and far projection 2071 2100 was conducted we compared the relative proportion of svi classes between the baseline and projection periods using interpolated precipitation data the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation for individual grids was mapped in fig 6 regarding the overall average of heavy precipitation days the far projection period had 27 heavy precipitation days greater than the near projection period table 6 among the four watersheds the greatest number of the heavy precipitation days was shown on the hr followed by the gr ysr and nr overall the projected data from the access model showed the greatest number of heavy precipitation days followed by kace gfdl mri and ipsl the increase rate of heavy precipitation days between the near and far projection periods was 45 gfdl 44 kace 27 access 21 ipsl and 3 mri the greatest increase rate was observed at the gr with gfdl 78 while the nr with mri represented the decrease rate of 9 between the near and far projection periods 3 results and discussion first the svi surface runoff and leaching vulnerability results with an original svi classification scheme were explored under the baseline period section 3 1 the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with original and modified classification schemes were compared under the baseline period section 3 2 finally climate change impacts on the svi surface runoff vulnerability were assessed using a modified svi classification scheme section 3 3 3 1 svi surface runoff and leaching vulnerability for the baseline period the vulnerability of cropland areas to pollutant loads by surface runoff and leaching was categorized using an original svi classification scheme for the baseline period fig 7 the svi surface runoff vulnerability with an original svi classification scheme consists on average of 43 8 high 5 9 moderately high 8 5 moderate and 41 8 low for four major watersheds fig 7a and table 7 the proportion of high runoff vulnerability class was greatest in the hr with 47 2 followed by the ysr 45 2 nr 44 7 and gr 39 0 this result is likely due to the prevalence of steep areas in the hr leading to a steeper slope relative to the other three watersheds fig 5d the areal proportions with slopes 6 are 66 3 hr 56 5 nr 42 1 gr and 48 5 ysr in contrast the greatest proportion of low and moderate runoff vulnerability class was found in gr where areas with low slope values are relatively larger than in the other three watersheds the majority coverage of the four watersheds belongs to high and low runoff vulnerability classes and these two classes were observed at the areas with slope 6 hsg b or c type or 4 hsg d type and the areas with slope 4 hsg b type or 2 hsg c or d type respectively the svi leaching vulnerability results indicated a greater proportion of high leaching vulnerability classes for the nr 73 7 than for the other three watersheds hr 62 1 gr 60 9 and ysr 70 3 the low and moderate classes were most prevalent in the gr mainly due to a greater proportion of soils with the attributes of hsg c type and non organic relative to other watersheds fig 7c and table 7 overall the svi classification results from this study were consistent with those of previous studies regarding strong impacts of landscape characteristics on vulnerability lee et al 2018 lohani et al 2020a for example in the northeastern us where the svi surface runoff vulnerability is low it is mainly due to low slope values lee et al 2018 a study that tested the svi classification scheme across 13 watersheds also found that slope was a primary factor affecting vulnerability lohani et al 2020a observational ss and nitrate nitrogen of four watersheds were summarized in fig 8 the observational values among four watersheds significantly differed p value 0 00 from one way anova indicating that the svi classification schemes could be validated by comparing with observations the svi surface runoff vulnerability with an original svi classification scheme showed that the gr was less vulnerable to surface runoff than the other three watersheds and according to the proportion of high class the vulnerability order was hr ysr nr gr observed concentration of ss was the highest at the gr followed by the ysr hr and nr fig 8a the svi surface runoff vulnerability was not in agreement with observational ss this discrepancy was also observed between the svi leaching vulnerability and observational nitrate nitrogen the nr was expected to have the highest svi leaching vulnerability table 7 but the hr indicated the highest concentration of nitrate nitrogen fig 8b the difference between the svi results and observational data may be due in part to disregarding site specific information such as soil layers slope length etc thompson et al 2020 3 2 svi surface runoff vulnerability with a modified svi classification scheme for the baseline period the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with a modified svi classification scheme represented an overall increase in vulnerability relative to the classification results with an original svi classification scheme for the baseline period fig 7b and table 7 regarding the average classification results the proportion of high class increased from 43 8 to 55 4 and the largest increase was from 5 9 to 27 7 for the moderately high class while the largest decrease was shown in the low class from 5 9 to 27 7 the greatest increase rate of high class between an original and a modified svi classification results was found at the gr and the lowest was at the nr the varying increased rates of high class in four watersheds are likely due to climatic characteristics south korea is affected by typhoons during the summer season and typhoons normally pass through the country from west to east yang et al 2016 in addition typhoons that enter the west side of south korea tend to dump a considerable amount of precipitation compared with those entering the east ahn et al 2008 regarding typhoon characteristics the geographic location of the hr gr and ysr are susceptible to heavy precipitation leading to substantial increases of high class in contrast nr on the eastern side of the country might be less influenced by heavy precipitation causing the smallest increase in high class comparing with observational ss a modified svi classification scheme did not fully agree with observational ss fig 8a however a modified svi classification scheme the vulnerability order based on the proportion of high class hr ysr gr nr indicated a slightly better fit with observations relative to an original svi classification scheme regarding that the nr had the lowest runoff vulnerability and the observed ss was also lowest among the four major watersheds the nr on the eastern side could be less affected by typhoons which might lead to the lowest observational ss and the lowest vulnerability in the nr when the vulnerability was represented by six classes the differences in the svi surface runoff vulnerability were well shown fig 9 and table 7 as expected the hr showed the highest proportion of very extremely high while the nr had the lowest proportion of very extremely high table 7 this result was likely due to the topographic and climatic conditions discussed above the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with an increased number of classes fig 9 provided clear vulnerability differences among watersheds relative to the results with four classes fig 7b 3 3 climate change impacts the svi surface runoff vulnerability with a modified svi classification scheme was assessed for two climate change projection periods near projection period 2031 2060 and far projection period 2071 2100 using five gcm results access gfdl ipsl kace and mri fig 10 and table 8 compared to the baseline period fig 7a and table 7 the svi surface runoff vulnerability of high class increased by 47 1 88 7 under climate change projections periods this was because the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation during summer seasons over 30 years under climate change conditions fig 6 averaged 6 16 days greater than under the baseline period fig s2 of the supplementary material the increase rate was the greatest at the nr 78 6 88 7 and the lowest at the hr 47 1 49 4 when the proportion of high class under the baseline period was greatest and lowest the increase rate was lowest and greatest respectively the svi surface runoff vulnerability results were almost identical between the near and far projection periods the average difference on the proportion of high class was less than 1 small differences in the svi surface runoff vulnerability classes among the near and far projection periods are likely attributable to the vulnerability class threshold the vulnerability class was assumed to increase when the area had at least more than 20 heavy precipitation days during the summer seasons over 30 years as shown in fig 10 the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation in this time frame was substantially greater during the far projection periods than during the near projection periods in the case of the gfdl and kace results the average number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation in the far projection periods increased by 44 45 relative to the near projection periods table 6 but the vulnerability classes were similar between the two projection periods the predicted precipitation patterns could indicate increased vulnerability to pollutant loads by surface runoff during the far projection periods relative to that during the near projection periods we further discretized svi surface runoff vulnerability classes from four to six classes to make comparisons fig 11 and table 8 overall the near and far projection periods indicated similar proportion of very extremely high svi surface runoff vulnerability classes for the hr gr and ysr except for the hr with ipsl 13 because the days with more than 80 mm during summer seasons over 30 years were similar fig 11 in the case of nr with two gcms ipsl and kace the proportion of very extremely high between the near and far projection periods increased by 6 5 and 17 3 respectively the svi surface runoff vulnerability results represented by six classes more clearly showed the regional discrepancy of the svi surface runoff vulnerability between the baseline and projection periods figs 9 and 11 the increased proportion of very extremely high ranged from 26 1 to 39 8 on average the greatest increase rate of very extremely high between the baseline and projection periods was found with gfdl while the smallest increase rate was with ipsl the three watersheds on the western shore hr gr and ysr showed a slightly greater proportion of very extremely high 62 7 59 9 and 69 7 respectively than the nr on the eastern shore 58 under the projection periods these results could inform that a heavy precipitation event would be frequently observed on the western side the average increase rate of very extremely high between the baseline and projection periods was greatest on the nr 122 343 followed by gr 159 169 ysr 138 146 and hr 16 4 55 8 the watershed with the lower proportion of very extreme high class during the baseline period showed greater increased rate overall the svi surface runoff vulnerability substantially increased under the projection periods and thus suitable adaptation strategies would be needed to reduce pollutant loads 4 implications and limitation the svi classification scheme was developed to categorize soil vulnerability classes for us croplands accordingly the issue of whether the svi is suited to south korea could arise a soil index designed for croplands in south korea has scarcely been developed as a test this study applied an svi classification scheme into south korea and suggested a modified svi classification scheme regarding the climatic characteristic when comparing observed water quality data the classification results with a modified svi classification scheme better agreed with observations than those with an original one however a modified svi classification scheme also failed to fully reflect the patterns shown in observations the svi leaching vulnerability was also different from observational nitrate nitrogen a similar result was also reported in a previous study lohani et al 2020a the svi was known as a preliminary tool to identify the vulnerability based on the inherent soil and topography supporting the development of conservation plans lohani et al 2020a when site specific information e g soil layers slope length etc is included the reliability of the svi classification scheme could increase thompson et al 2020 future studies would need to validate the svi classification schemes at an agricultural watershed with site specific information to generate a more suitable classification scheme for south korea when the number of the svi surface runoff vulnerability classes increased from four to six the differences of the svi surface runoff vulnerability between the baseline and projection periods were more clearly represented especially the vulnerability differences among the major watersheds were well observed which could help to prioritize the areas vulnerable to climate change a class based approach often has this issue owing to upper and lower limits when climate change impacts are considered using any index modifications of index structures would be needed to clarify any changes organic soil carbon classification data was prepared using kriging according to previous studies zhang et al 2020 due to the inherent uncertainty of the interpolated data the soil carbon data may include some level of uncertainty the interpolation of observed soil organic carbon with topographical characteristics has been reported to provide a more accurate spatial distribution of soil organic carbon than analyses lacking this interpolation li et al 2020 in addition different interpolation methods showed varying prediction accuracies of soil organic matter long et al 2020 mapping soil organic carbon distribution using available topographic data and different interpolation methods e g machine learning would be compared to help generate reliable svi input data for future studies leading to more reliable classification results this study proposes a modified svi classification scheme to consider the impacts of climate change on vulnerability the precipitation threshold 80 mm days 40 or 20 39 and seasonal constraints only summer may not be fully appropriate for south korea and other regions however as a first approach to adopting the svi classification system to south korea results from this study indicate that increasing the number of classifications in regions with excessive rainfall amounts can improve identifying those most vulnerable areas to accurately reflect precipitation data in the svi surface runoff classification scheme local experts in different areas should be involved in determining thresholds days seasons and other regional factors 5 conclusions our study applied the svi classification scheme developed by the usda in south korea to classify the cropland vulnerability to surface runoff and leaching we suggested a modified svi classification scheme to include precipitation amount enabling projections of climate change impacts on soil runoff vulnerability based on differences in precipitation amount we found that the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with an original svi classification scheme showed that surface runoff vulnerability tends to be high in areas with steep topography while plains areas show high leaching vulnerability the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with a modified svi classification scheme showed that an increased level of soil runoff vulnerability via precipitation amount was greater in areas on the typhoon pathway and the areas less susceptible to typhoon influences showed only a small increase in vulnerability class the vulnerability difference between the baseline and climate change projection periods were better represented when a modified svi classification scheme was applied and the number of vulnerability classification increased the svi classification scheme

8977,the soil vulnerability index svi classifies vulnerability to cropland pollutant transport by surface runoff and leaching helping to categorize areas with a high contribution of pollutant loads this study aims to 1 adopt the svi classification scheme in south korea and 2 suggest a modified svi classification scheme for surface runoff to anticipate climate change impacts the precipitation amount was considered in an original scheme to make a modified scheme the results with an original svi classification scheme predicted that the svi surface runoff vulnerability was relatively greater in areas with a steep slope than in those with a plain topography and a high level of the svi leaching vulnerability was frequently observed in plain areas when a modified svi classification scheme was applied high vulnerability class increased from 44 0 to 57 4 and the greater increase rate was observed in the regions susceptible to heavy precipitation defined as a day with more than 80 mm precipitation when compared with observational suspended solids the results with a modified svi classification scheme were more consistent with observations than those with an original svi classification scheme relative to the baseline period the svi surface runoff vulnerability of high class increased by 47 1 88 7 during the climate change period when the number of vulnerability classes was increased the differences on very extremely high class between the baseline and projection periods were clear with the increase rate of 16 4 343 the results with an original svi classification scheme matched well with the topographic characteristics and a modified svi classification scheme captured the impacts of regional precipitation patterns and climate change impacts as a

pollutants across the landscape lee et al 2018 yasarer et al 2020 the use of the svi classification scheme as input data for predicting water quality variables was found to be acceptable at the watershed level lohani et al 2020b there is a need to test the svi classification scheme in different countries thompson et al 2020 the svi classification scheme has the advantage of identifying vulnerable areas using a simplified approach compared to process based or statistical modeling approaches however the svi classification scheme excludes climatic factors to make vulnerability classifications based on inherent land surface characteristics potentially limiting the exploration of how climate change affects vulnerability to nps pollutant loads vulnerability classification approaches frequently include climatic factors as input variables to rank vulnerable areas jiang et al 2021 liu and miao 2018 thus the svi classification scheme might not be appropriate for assessing the impacts of climate change or areas where nps pollutants are strongly affected by precipitation events modified precipitation caused by climate change is expected to exacerbate water quality degradation mainly because of the excessive transport of nps pollutants from agricultural lands whitehead et al 2009 most future projections anticipate that climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events delivering increased amounts of pollutants from soils to nearby water bodies corada fernández et al 2017 myhre et al 2019 park et al 2010 such detrimental effects can be particularly severe in regions such as south korea where precipitation events occur mostly during specific seasons kim et al 2001 ockenden et al 2017 the national institute of meteorological research has predicted that climate change could lead to warmer conditions and an increased frequency of heavy precipitation known as a day with more than 80 mm precipitation according to a heavy rainfall defined by korea meteorological administration kma in south korea in response to such potential changes the export of nps pollutants to streams in south korea is projected to increase ahn et al 2014 han et al 2017 jang and kim 2017 the objective of this study aimed to 1 apply the svi classification scheme in south korea to classify croplands vulnerable to pollutant loads via surface runoff and leaching and 2 modify an original svi classification scheme by including precipitation amount as a variable and 3 project the areas vulnerable to pollutant loads under climate change conditions using a modified svi classification scheme a modified svi classification scheme coupled with precipitation data was evaluated under baseline 1981 2010 and two projection periods near 2031 2060 and far 2071 2100 future precipitation data were projected using five global circulation models gcms to depict climate change conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area south korea is geographically located in east asia at 35 50 n and 127 00 e fig 1a due to its geographical location south korea has four distinctive seasons spring march to may summer june to august fall september to november and winter december to february the winter and spring seasons tend to be dry due to the siberian high pressure and migratory anticyclones respectively while the summer season is wet and humid due to north pacific high pressure choi et al 2017 according to the kma over the past 30 years summer precipitation june august accounts for on average 54 6 of annual precipitation table 1 although agricultural lands are covered by plants during summer seasons in korea heavy precipitation leads to substantial loads of pollutants from lands to nearby water bodies the condition of agricultural lands during the winter seasons is bare soils susceptible to surface runoff but the winter seasons are dominated by drought conditions with a small amount of precipitation and thus rarely experience serious pollutant loads south korea is divided into four major watersheds fig 1a the han river hr nakdong river nr gum river gr and yeongsan sumjin river ysr only the portion of the hr geographically included in south korea was investigated in this study fig 1a the svi classification results were compared for the country and four watershed levels according to a land use map from the environmental geographic information service egis https egis me go kr agricultural land occupies approximately 20 of the country fig 1b non agricultural lands are dominated by forested lands the svi classes were only computed for agricultural lands further descriptions of four major watersheds are illustrated in the table s1 and fig s1 of the supplementary material in this study 60 automated surface observing system asos stations of the kma were used to determine the availability of precipitation for both baseline and climate change conditions fig 1b 2 2 study diagram the overall diagram of this study is shown in fig 2 the methods of original and modified svi classification schemes are described in the sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 respectively then the basic input data for the svi classification scheme are illustrated in the section 2 2 3 lastly the climate change data used for a modified svi classification scheme are explained in the section 2 2 4 2 2 1 an original svi classification scheme the two original svi classification schemes for surface runoff and leaching are explained in tables 2 and 3 respectively the svi surface runoff vulnerability is categorized into four classes from low to high based on the combinations of hydrologic soil group hsg data soil erosion factor k factor and slope table 2 when ranking the svi leaching vulnerability four datasets i e k factor slope hsg data and organic soil were compiled to categorize the four vulnerability classes table 3 the svi vulnerability was assessed based on the relative proportion of both high and moderately high to the total area 2 2 2 a modified svi classification scheme this study applied precipitation data to an original svi classification scheme for surface runoff alone the loads of pollutants vulnerable to surface runoff tend to be proportional to precipitation amount johnson et al 2018 compared with those for leaching whereas pollutant loads via leaching are complicated by multiple factors including precipitation bieroza et al 2019 jiao et al 2004 to consider heavy precipitation events we analyzed the interpolated precipitation days during the summer seasons june july and august for 30 years 1981 2010 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was used because it is the most used method for precipitation jo et al 2018 song et al 2021 the idw method predicts unknown points among known points with values by applying a weighted average of the values at known points as a function of the distance robinson and metternicht 2006 we counted the number of pixels with more than 80 mm daily precipitation and found that the pixels with 30 50 heavy precipitation days were dominant fig 3 accordingly we assumed that if the number of heavy precipitation days during the summer seasons for 30 years i e the baseline and two climate change conditions is 40 and between 20 and 39 the vulnerability increases by two and one class respectively fig 4 we focused on the summer season because heavy precipitation events are frequently observed during this period in south korea kim et al 2001 for example low svi surface runoff vulnerability class 1 increases to moderately high when the number of summertime heavy precipitation days with equal or greater than 40 days and 2 increases to moderate when the number of summertime heavy precipitation days with greater than 20 days but not 40 days the class increase by the precipitation amount could lead to a great proportion of high class since one and two class increases at most reach to high class fig 4 thus a modified svi classification scheme further classified four classes into six classes by splitting high class into three classes very extremely high extremely high and high the high class results with an original svi classification scheme increases to extremely high or very extremely high when the increases of one or two class are made respectively to compare two svi classification schemes i e original and modified and assess the svi leaching vulnerability observational suspended solids ss and nitrate nitrogen of the four watersheds were investigated respectively we selected the ss and nitrate nitrogen since the transports of ss and nitrate nitrogen are mostly driven by surface runoff and leaching on the land surface respectively the available observations for ss nitrate nitrogen during summer seasons from 2011 to 2020 were downloaded from 156 320 92 259 59 189 and 57 126 monitoring stations for the hr nr gr and ysr respectively this study includes all available ss and nitrate nitrogen observations during summer seasons to see the differences on observational ss and nitrate nitrogen among four watersheds we conducted analysis of variance anova with 5 significance level this statistical result could justify the necessity of comparing svi classification results with the observed water quality variables among four watersheds to assess the validity of the svi classification schemes the monitoring station locations are shown in the fig s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 3 data description and preparation first the spatial boundary of agricultural lands across south korea was identified using a land use map from the egis this study used the soil data provided by the national institute of agricultural sciences of the korean rural development administration krda where the soil data included the hydrologic soil group hsg and k factor fig 5ab soil organic data were collected from approximately 606 000 sites in major crop fields from 2009 to 2011 through a project of krda jeon et al 2012 after pre processing 486 462 sampling points were selected for this study and these points were interpolated to gridded data with 5 meter resolution using kriging long et al 2020 to match with dem carbon data were set to have 5 m resolution kriging is a geostatistical interpolation approach that predicts unknown points using distance and covariance robinson and metternicht 2006 and it was shown to be suitable interpolation method for soil organic matter long et al 2020 the interpolation process was conducted using the spatial analysis tool arcmap version 10 7 after interpolating organic soil data areas with a proportion of soil organic material lower than 15 were assessed as non organic soils and the other areas were regarded as organic soils based on the organic soil guideline huang et al 2009 a high resolution digital elevation model dem with 5 meter resolution was obtained from the national spatial data infrastructure portal nsdi http www nsdi go kr as a fine resolution dem could better discretize svi classes lohani et al 2020a the slope dataset was calculated from the dem using the arcmap spatial analysis tool version 10 7 daily precipitation data between 1981 and 2010 were obtained from 60 asos stations operated by the kma and interpolated precipitation data taken at weather stations to make 1 km gridded data using the idw in asos station the tipping bucket type rain gauge is used to measure rain depth kim et al 2012 it should be noted that the tipping bucket rain gauge often shows underestimation errors for the rainfall depth with greater than 50 mm h humphrey et al 1997 because precipitation pattern was less variable across the landscape this study set up 1 km resolution for precipitation regarding previous studies conducted in south korea hong et al 2022 kim et al 2021b kim et al 2021a topographic factors were set at 5 m resolution since a high resolution has been suggested for topographic factors to make more accurate svi classes chan et al 2017 heavy precipitation events were identified by counting the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation over the summer season for the individual grids gridded precipitation data were superimposed on the svi surface runoff vulnerability map to reflect the precipitation amount in an original svi classification scheme table 4 2 2 4 climate change data future projections of daily precipitation over 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 were developed from five gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 the five cmip6 gcms used in the study are listed in table 5 each gcm was combined with shared socio economic pathways ssp representative concentration pathway ssp rcp scenarios the ssp are scenarios describing alternative socioeconomic developments from 2015 to 2100 which were introduced in the 6th assessment report on climate change which was recently published by the ipcc ipcc 2021 the descriptions of the four ssp rcp scenarios coupled with each gcm are presented in table s2 of the supplementary material this study used five gcms under ssp with the greatest potential for extreme climatic conditions i e ssp585 in south korea the management of extreme climate conditions is increasingly important since the actual extreme conditions exceed the projected conditions which needs adaptation strategies in response to the worst case kim et al 2021b kim et al 2021a thus this study chose the extreme scenario with multiple cgms the coarse spatial scale of the gcm raw data was first interpolated to the resolution of the 60 asos station spacing approximately 45 km based on idw systematic bias existing in each gcm dataset was corrected using a standard quantile mapping thrasher et al 2012 approach so that the systematic biases between the observed and gcm data were removed future precipitation data were converted to gridded format data with 1 km resolution using idw similar to the baseline precipitation data the gcm precipitation data were placed on top of the svi classification results to estimate the svi surface runoff vulnerability under climate change the five svi surface runoff vulnerability results were analyzed for four major individual watersheds and then the areas of individual classes for the five svi results were computed the individual classes for the five svi surface runoff vulnerability results were averaged for the four major watersheds for comparison with the baseline period using the average results a comparative analysis of the svi surface runoff vulnerability under the baseline 1981 2010 and two climate change conditions near projection 2031 2060 and far projection 2071 2100 was conducted we compared the relative proportion of svi classes between the baseline and projection periods using interpolated precipitation data the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation for individual grids was mapped in fig 6 regarding the overall average of heavy precipitation days the far projection period had 27 heavy precipitation days greater than the near projection period table 6 among the four watersheds the greatest number of the heavy precipitation days was shown on the hr followed by the gr ysr and nr overall the projected data from the access model showed the greatest number of heavy precipitation days followed by kace gfdl mri and ipsl the increase rate of heavy precipitation days between the near and far projection periods was 45 gfdl 44 kace 27 access 21 ipsl and 3 mri the greatest increase rate was observed at the gr with gfdl 78 while the nr with mri represented the decrease rate of 9 between the near and far projection periods 3 results and discussion first the svi surface runoff and leaching vulnerability results with an original svi classification scheme were explored under the baseline period section 3 1 the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with original and modified classification schemes were compared under the baseline period section 3 2 finally climate change impacts on the svi surface runoff vulnerability were assessed using a modified svi classification scheme section 3 3 3 1 svi surface runoff and leaching vulnerability for the baseline period the vulnerability of cropland areas to pollutant loads by surface runoff and leaching was categorized using an original svi classification scheme for the baseline period fig 7 the svi surface runoff vulnerability with an original svi classification scheme consists on average of 43 8 high 5 9 moderately high 8 5 moderate and 41 8 low for four major watersheds fig 7a and table 7 the proportion of high runoff vulnerability class was greatest in the hr with 47 2 followed by the ysr 45 2 nr 44 7 and gr 39 0 this result is likely due to the prevalence of steep areas in the hr leading to a steeper slope relative to the other three watersheds fig 5d the areal proportions with slopes 6 are 66 3 hr 56 5 nr 42 1 gr and 48 5 ysr in contrast the greatest proportion of low and moderate runoff vulnerability class was found in gr where areas with low slope values are relatively larger than in the other three watersheds the majority coverage of the four watersheds belongs to high and low runoff vulnerability classes and these two classes were observed at the areas with slope 6 hsg b or c type or 4 hsg d type and the areas with slope 4 hsg b type or 2 hsg c or d type respectively the svi leaching vulnerability results indicated a greater proportion of high leaching vulnerability classes for the nr 73 7 than for the other three watersheds hr 62 1 gr 60 9 and ysr 70 3 the low and moderate classes were most prevalent in the gr mainly due to a greater proportion of soils with the attributes of hsg c type and non organic relative to other watersheds fig 7c and table 7 overall the svi classification results from this study were consistent with those of previous studies regarding strong impacts of landscape characteristics on vulnerability lee et al 2018 lohani et al 2020a for example in the northeastern us where the svi surface runoff vulnerability is low it is mainly due to low slope values lee et al 2018 a study that tested the svi classification scheme across 13 watersheds also found that slope was a primary factor affecting vulnerability lohani et al 2020a observational ss and nitrate nitrogen of four watersheds were summarized in fig 8 the observational values among four watersheds significantly differed p value 0 00 from one way anova indicating that the svi classification schemes could be validated by comparing with observations the svi surface runoff vulnerability with an original svi classification scheme showed that the gr was less vulnerable to surface runoff than the other three watersheds and according to the proportion of high class the vulnerability order was hr ysr nr gr observed concentration of ss was the highest at the gr followed by the ysr hr and nr fig 8a the svi surface runoff vulnerability was not in agreement with observational ss this discrepancy was also observed between the svi leaching vulnerability and observational nitrate nitrogen the nr was expected to have the highest svi leaching vulnerability table 7 but the hr indicated the highest concentration of nitrate nitrogen fig 8b the difference between the svi results and observational data may be due in part to disregarding site specific information such as soil layers slope length etc thompson et al 2020 3 2 svi surface runoff vulnerability with a modified svi classification scheme for the baseline period the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with a modified svi classification scheme represented an overall increase in vulnerability relative to the classification results with an original svi classification scheme for the baseline period fig 7b and table 7 regarding the average classification results the proportion of high class increased from 43 8 to 55 4 and the largest increase was from 5 9 to 27 7 for the moderately high class while the largest decrease was shown in the low class from 5 9 to 27 7 the greatest increase rate of high class between an original and a modified svi classification results was found at the gr and the lowest was at the nr the varying increased rates of high class in four watersheds are likely due to climatic characteristics south korea is affected by typhoons during the summer season and typhoons normally pass through the country from west to east yang et al 2016 in addition typhoons that enter the west side of south korea tend to dump a considerable amount of precipitation compared with those entering the east ahn et al 2008 regarding typhoon characteristics the geographic location of the hr gr and ysr are susceptible to heavy precipitation leading to substantial increases of high class in contrast nr on the eastern side of the country might be less influenced by heavy precipitation causing the smallest increase in high class comparing with observational ss a modified svi classification scheme did not fully agree with observational ss fig 8a however a modified svi classification scheme the vulnerability order based on the proportion of high class hr ysr gr nr indicated a slightly better fit with observations relative to an original svi classification scheme regarding that the nr had the lowest runoff vulnerability and the observed ss was also lowest among the four major watersheds the nr on the eastern side could be less affected by typhoons which might lead to the lowest observational ss and the lowest vulnerability in the nr when the vulnerability was represented by six classes the differences in the svi surface runoff vulnerability were well shown fig 9 and table 7 as expected the hr showed the highest proportion of very extremely high while the nr had the lowest proportion of very extremely high table 7 this result was likely due to the topographic and climatic conditions discussed above the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with an increased number of classes fig 9 provided clear vulnerability differences among watersheds relative to the results with four classes fig 7b 3 3 climate change impacts the svi surface runoff vulnerability with a modified svi classification scheme was assessed for two climate change projection periods near projection period 2031 2060 and far projection period 2071 2100 using five gcm results access gfdl ipsl kace and mri fig 10 and table 8 compared to the baseline period fig 7a and table 7 the svi surface runoff vulnerability of high class increased by 47 1 88 7 under climate change projections periods this was because the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation during summer seasons over 30 years under climate change conditions fig 6 averaged 6 16 days greater than under the baseline period fig s2 of the supplementary material the increase rate was the greatest at the nr 78 6 88 7 and the lowest at the hr 47 1 49 4 when the proportion of high class under the baseline period was greatest and lowest the increase rate was lowest and greatest respectively the svi surface runoff vulnerability results were almost identical between the near and far projection periods the average difference on the proportion of high class was less than 1 small differences in the svi surface runoff vulnerability classes among the near and far projection periods are likely attributable to the vulnerability class threshold the vulnerability class was assumed to increase when the area had at least more than 20 heavy precipitation days during the summer seasons over 30 years as shown in fig 10 the number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation in this time frame was substantially greater during the far projection periods than during the near projection periods in the case of the gfdl and kace results the average number of days with more than 80 mm precipitation in the far projection periods increased by 44 45 relative to the near projection periods table 6 but the vulnerability classes were similar between the two projection periods the predicted precipitation patterns could indicate increased vulnerability to pollutant loads by surface runoff during the far projection periods relative to that during the near projection periods we further discretized svi surface runoff vulnerability classes from four to six classes to make comparisons fig 11 and table 8 overall the near and far projection periods indicated similar proportion of very extremely high svi surface runoff vulnerability classes for the hr gr and ysr except for the hr with ipsl 13 because the days with more than 80 mm during summer seasons over 30 years were similar fig 11 in the case of nr with two gcms ipsl and kace the proportion of very extremely high between the near and far projection periods increased by 6 5 and 17 3 respectively the svi surface runoff vulnerability results represented by six classes more clearly showed the regional discrepancy of the svi surface runoff vulnerability between the baseline and projection periods figs 9 and 11 the increased proportion of very extremely high ranged from 26 1 to 39 8 on average the greatest increase rate of very extremely high between the baseline and projection periods was found with gfdl while the smallest increase rate was with ipsl the three watersheds on the western shore hr gr and ysr showed a slightly greater proportion of very extremely high 62 7 59 9 and 69 7 respectively than the nr on the eastern shore 58 under the projection periods these results could inform that a heavy precipitation event would be frequently observed on the western side the average increase rate of very extremely high between the baseline and projection periods was greatest on the nr 122 343 followed by gr 159 169 ysr 138 146 and hr 16 4 55 8 the watershed with the lower proportion of very extreme high class during the baseline period showed greater increased rate overall the svi surface runoff vulnerability substantially increased under the projection periods and thus suitable adaptation strategies would be needed to reduce pollutant loads 4 implications and limitation the svi classification scheme was developed to categorize soil vulnerability classes for us croplands accordingly the issue of whether the svi is suited to south korea could arise a soil index designed for croplands in south korea has scarcely been developed as a test this study applied an svi classification scheme into south korea and suggested a modified svi classification scheme regarding the climatic characteristic when comparing observed water quality data the classification results with a modified svi classification scheme better agreed with observations than those with an original one however a modified svi classification scheme also failed to fully reflect the patterns shown in observations the svi leaching vulnerability was also different from observational nitrate nitrogen a similar result was also reported in a previous study lohani et al 2020a the svi was known as a preliminary tool to identify the vulnerability based on the inherent soil and topography supporting the development of conservation plans lohani et al 2020a when site specific information e g soil layers slope length etc is included the reliability of the svi classification scheme could increase thompson et al 2020 future studies would need to validate the svi classification schemes at an agricultural watershed with site specific information to generate a more suitable classification scheme for south korea when the number of the svi surface runoff vulnerability classes increased from four to six the differences of the svi surface runoff vulnerability between the baseline and projection periods were more clearly represented especially the vulnerability differences among the major watersheds were well observed which could help to prioritize the areas vulnerable to climate change a class based approach often has this issue owing to upper and lower limits when climate change impacts are considered using any index modifications of index structures would be needed to clarify any changes organic soil carbon classification data was prepared using kriging according to previous studies zhang et al 2020 due to the inherent uncertainty of the interpolated data the soil carbon data may include some level of uncertainty the interpolation of observed soil organic carbon with topographical characteristics has been reported to provide a more accurate spatial distribution of soil organic carbon than analyses lacking this interpolation li et al 2020 in addition different interpolation methods showed varying prediction accuracies of soil organic matter long et al 2020 mapping soil organic carbon distribution using available topographic data and different interpolation methods e g machine learning would be compared to help generate reliable svi input data for future studies leading to more reliable classification results this study proposes a modified svi classification scheme to consider the impacts of climate change on vulnerability the precipitation threshold 80 mm days 40 or 20 39 and seasonal constraints only summer may not be fully appropriate for south korea and other regions however as a first approach to adopting the svi classification system to south korea results from this study indicate that increasing the number of classifications in regions with excessive rainfall amounts can improve identifying those most vulnerable areas to accurately reflect precipitation data in the svi surface runoff classification scheme local experts in different areas should be involved in determining thresholds days seasons and other regional factors 5 conclusions our study applied the svi classification scheme developed by the usda in south korea to classify the cropland vulnerability to surface runoff and leaching we suggested a modified svi classification scheme to include precipitation amount enabling projections of climate change impacts on soil runoff vulnerability based on differences in precipitation amount we found that the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with an original svi classification scheme showed that surface runoff vulnerability tends to be high in areas with steep topography while plains areas show high leaching vulnerability the svi surface runoff vulnerability results with a modified svi classification scheme showed that an increased level of soil runoff vulnerability via precipitation amount was greater in areas on the typhoon pathway and the areas less susceptible to typhoon influences showed only a small increase in vulnerability class the vulnerability difference between the baseline and climate change projection periods were better represented when a modified svi classification scheme was applied and the number of vulnerability classification increased the svi classification scheme suggested in this study well categorized soil vulnerability in south korea contributing to identifying vulnerability in the regions with frequent heavy rainfall events declaration of competing

emissions of ghg from rice paddies the safe awd irrigation was introduced into south china previous studies demonstrated that the safe awd irrigation effectively reduced irrigation water input and ghg emission in double rice cropping system at south china liang et al 2017 mid season drainage was a typical practice at south china in this practice about 2 weeks drainage was imposed at the late tillering stage the mid season drainage was effective in suppressing unproductive tillers and promoting root activity and root growth through increasing soil oxygen supply moreover mid season drainage substantially reduced ch4 emission relative to permanent flooding zou et al 2005 itoh et al 2011 liang et al 2016 based on the beneficial characteristics of the mid season drainage irrigation a modified awd irrigation technology mawd was developed in current study in this regime the mid season drainage was integrated into the safe awd irrigation furthermore optimized n management was

was removed filed water depth of each plot was recorded daily field water management under different irrigation regimes was shown in the supplementary fig s1 in farmers irrigation practice the water layer maintained at 2 5 cm after the transplantation when rice tiller number reaches 80 of the projected final panicle number mid season drainage was imposed field was re flooded when the 2nd top leaf appeared during the heading stage water layer was kept at 2 5 cm in order to prevent the sterility of spikelet after heading field water layer was irrigated to a depth of 2 3 cm above soil surface when the visible water layer disappeared terminal drainage was done one week before harvest in the awd irrigation regime water layer kept at a depth of 2 5 cm at the first 10 dat for recovering of the seedlings then field was allowed to dry and timing and amount of irrigation depended on the water level in the tube when the ponded water disappeared in the bottom 15 cm under the surface of soil field water layer was irrigated to 5 cm depth at beginning of heading field was re flooded for one week to prevent spikelet sterility and hereafter awd cycles repeated in the mawd irrigation regime field was flooded at the first 10 dat and hereafter awd cycles commenced the field soil was allowed to dry and irrigation was applied when water layer reach the threshold at 15 cm under soil surface a mid season drainage was imposed when the number of tiller reaches 80 of the projected final number of panicle when the 2nd top leaf appear field was re flooded and awd cycle repeated at the beginning of heading field was flooded for a week hereafter awd cycle was repeated until the final drainage 2 3 measurement of yield yield components crop n uptake and nitrogen use efficiency grain yield was measured taking 5 m2 plant samples at maturity excluding the border plants from each plot grain yield was adjusted to a standard moisture content of a 0 14 kg h2o kg 1 fresh grain weight twelve hills of rice plants adjacent to the harvest area were sampled in each plot to determine yield components percent of filled spikelets density of panicle thousand grain weight and the number of spikelets per panicle twelve rice plants were randomly selected to determine the biomass and the n uptake at the stage of mt pi hd and maturity ma from each plot the growth rate of crop cgr was determined as cgr w2 w1 t2 t1 w1 and w2 are the aboveground dry weight at times of t1 and t2 the n content of the crop tissue was measured by the method of kjeldahl digestion and distillation bremner and mulvaney 1982 the difference of the total aboveground plant n between sampling times of t1 and t2 was used to evaluated the n uptake rates for a specific interval peng and cassman 1998 the various indicators of n use

data in field was recorded from a rain gauge hobo event onset computer massachusetts usa the water productivity of crop wpt was evaluated by dividing the yield by the total water consumption 2 5 measurement of environmental n losses through runoff leaching and ammonia volatilization water samples of surface runoff were taken during each event of runoff loss a plastic bucket of 20 l was set beside the plots in order to collect the samples from runoff water via pipes system xue et al 2014 other runoff water entered the drainage ditch via a runoff collection pipe set at the water outlet of the plot the height of the drainage outlet in local farmer s field was generally set at 3 5 cm so the hole of the water inlet of the runoff collection pipe was set at 5 cm above soil surface while the hole of the water outlet of the pipe was set at 20 cm below the soil surface runoff water discharged into the drainage ditch through water outlet of the pipe automatically due to the gravity caused by the height difference a flow meter was equipped at the water outlet of the pipe at the lower end to measure the volume of runoff water total n content tn in water sample was measured by the method of alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation ultra spectrophotometry the runoff n loss was determined by multiplying the tn of water sample by the runoff volume recorded by the collection bucket and flow meter n loss via leaching and ammonia volatilization av were evaluated at 1 3 5 7 and 11 d after each n application and then at one week interval n leaching sample of percolation water was collected by a lysimeter made of porous pvc pipe with length and inner diameter of 70 cm and 16 cm respectively the lysimeter is sealed in the bottom the lower end of the lysimeter has 200 pores to allow the infiltration of leaching water to avoid the sediment flowing into the pipe each lysimeter was surrounded with nylon net and quartz sand li et al 2008 ye et al 2015 the lysimeter was inserted into soil at 50 cm depth before sampling the leaching water was pumped out from the lysimeter and the leaching water volume was recorded the soil volume contributing leaching water to lysimeter was determined by the method described by li et al 2008 leaching volume per soil volume was extrapolated to calculate the leaching volume per hectare n leaching loss was determined by multiplying the tn of water sample by the leaching volume n loss from av was measured by the static chamber method xue et al 2014 liang et al 2017 sample was collected by sponge soaked in phosphoglycerol to absorb ammonia in an ammonia trapping chamber the chamber was made by transparent pvc pipe with length of 25 cm diameter of 20 cm samples collected by the sponge were extracted by kcl solution 1 0 mol l 1 of 300 ml the tn

drainage period in optn mawd was increased by 10 15 days relative to early seasons awd cycles number under optn awd and optn mawd was increased by 2 3 times in late seasons due to lower rainfall the total water input irrigation water input and irrigation frequency were significantly reduced in optn awd and optn mawd relative to those of fp and optn table 3 relative to optn the input of irrigation water was reduced by 40 9 91 8 in optn mawd compared with optn awd the average irrigation water input under optn mawd was reduced by 19 0 the water productivity was increased by 2 8 19 6 in optn awd and 1 5 25 7 in optn mawd compared with optn overall the wpt was not significant different between optn awd and optn mawd except in early season of 2020 while the wpt of optn mawd was significantly increased by 6 25 compared with optn awd 3 2 crop growth rice variety tianyou3618 was used in 2017 2018 cropping seasons rice variety huanghuazhan was used in 2019 2020 cropping seasons the cgr n uptake rate and n accumulation of rice plant were significantly affected by n management overall the n uptake rate and n accumulation were highest in fp for both rice varieties in mt pi period fig 3 while in pi hd period the cgr n uptake rate and n accumulation in optn optn awd and optn mawd were higher than those in the fp for both rice varieties during 2017 2018 cropping seasons the average cgr of tianyou3618 in optn optn awd and optn mawd was 9 4 16 9 and 16 0 higher than that of fp respectively the average n uptake rate of tianyou3618 in optn optn awd and optn mawd was increased by 105 7 95 4 and 117 1 respectively similar result was observed in the value of n accumulation during 2019 2020 cropping seasons the average cgr of huanghuazhan in optn optn awd and optn mawd in pi hd period were increased by 32 4 38 5 and 34 4 respectively compared with fp the n uptake rate and n accumulation of huanghuazhan in optn optn awd and optn mawd were increased by 173 9 203 9 respectively for most period there were no significant difference on cgr n uptake rate and n accumulation of crop among optn optn awd and optn mawd for both rice varieties p 0 05 3 3 grain yield yield components and n use efficiency grain yield was lowest in n0 treatment varying from 4181 7 to 5066 6 kg ha 1 table 1 the panicle number spikelets per panicle and thousand grain weight were lowest in n0 treatment the yield averaged 6413 7 kg ha 1 for fp varying from 5807 5 to 7064 4 kg ha 1 relative to fp the 3 season average yield of tianyou3618 in optn optn awd and optn mawd was increased by 12 8 13 8 and 15 4 respectively the 3 season average grain yield of huanghuazhan in optn optn awd and optn mawd was 11 4 11 6 and 11 5 higher than that of fp overall there were no significant differences in seed setting rate and panicle number per unit area among fp optn optn awd and optn mawd p 0 05 relative to fp the grain weight in optn optn awd and optn mawd was slightly increased but the differences did not reach statistical significance p 0 05 while the number of spikelets per panicle in optn optn awd and optn mawd was 4 4 9 0 higher than that of fp therefore higher yield in optn optn awd and optn mawd generally resulted from the greater number of spikelets per panicle the number of spikelets per panicle panicles per unit area seed setting rate thousand grain weight and yield was not significantly different among optn optn awd and optn mawd p 0 05 indicating that irrigation did not have detectable effects on grain yield relative to fp crop n uptake in optn was significantly increased by 15 9 44 5 no significant difference of crop n uptake was observed among optn optn awd and optn mawd in all the cropping seasons during 2017 2020 table 2 except for ien the pfpn are and ae under optn optn awd and optn mawd were significantly higher than fp p 0 05 no significant differences were observed between optn optn awd and optn mawd for n use efficiencies indices ien ae are and pfpn during 2017 2020 cropping seasons p 0 05 indicating that irrigation did not have significant effect on n use efficiencies under the same fertilization treatment 3 4 environmental n losses and n surplus analysis the n losses loading by av in different treatments accounted for 52 6 62 6 of the total environmental n loss the environmental n loss via av was mainly occurred within the first month after transplanting fig 4 a b relative to fp n loss loading from av was decreased by 26 1 38 8 under optn optn awd and optn mawd no significant difference of av loss loading was found between optn optn awd and optn mawd the n loss loading from surface runoff in different treatments accounted for 14 6 23 8 of the total environmental n loss the runoff event was greater in the early cropping season than that of the late cropping season for fp and optn treatments the runoff loss loading in early cropping season was 34 8 and 59 5 higher than that in late cropping season the water management had significant effect on the n runoff loading relative to optn the n runoff loading in optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 50 4 and 49 1 in the early season and 48 3 and 36 8 in the late season respectively p 0 05 the n loss loading by leaching in different treatments accounted for 22 3 23 7 of the total environmental n loss n leaching loss mainly occurred in the stage from mt to pi after transplanting in fp fig 4 e f compared with fp n leaching loss loading in optn was significantly reduced by 16 9 in early cropping season and 27 3 in late cropping season relative to optn n leaching loss loading under optn awd and optn mawd was respectively reduced by 17 5 and 23 6 in early cropping season and 18 7 and 25 4 in late cropping season table 3 the total n losses loading from av surface runoff and leaching in fp optn optn awd and optn mawd was averaged for 75 1 54 3 45 2 and 43 1 kg n ha 1 respectively across the early and late cropping seasons table 4 compared with fp the seasonal n losses loading under optn optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 23 6 44 4 table 4 compared with optn the total n losses loading under optn awd and optn mawd was significantly reduced by 16 8 and 20 5 respectively p 0 05 the total n losses loading was not significantly different between the treatments of optn awd and optn mawd p 0 05 compared with fp seasonal fertilizer n input of optn optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 14 3 16 7 reversely the crop n output in optn optn awd and optn mawd was 15 0 30 1 higher than fp the n surplus of fp were 86 8 kg n ha 1 and 122 5 kg n ha 1 respectively for early and late season seasonal n surplus in different treatment averaged from 22 5 kg ha 1 to 122 6 kg ha 1 table 4 compared with fp n surplus in optn optn awd and optn mawd was significantly decrease by 55 0 74 1 the n surplus and n balance were not significantly different between optn optn awd and optn mawd p 0 05 regression analysis indicated that total n losses was linearly increased with increasing n surplus and irrigation water input fig 5 a d and decreased with increasing crop n uptake and are fig 5 b c a reduction of 100 kg n ha 1 of n surplus leads to reduction of 67 1 kg n ha 1 of total n losses from rice paddies fig 5 c indicated the environmental n pollution was decreased in optn optn awd and optn mawd as more fertilizer n was absorbed by crops and less n was lost to environment or remained in paddy soil 3 5 ch4 and n2o emissions and the global warming potential ch4 emission was significantly influenced by irrigation in early cropping season ch4 fluxes under fp and optn showed an increasing trend and then suppressed by mid season drainage while when the paddy re flooded the ch4 re emission commenced and resumed to a high level fig 6 a at late season the ch4 fluxes generally maintained at low rate at heading stage due to the descending temperature the ch4 fluxes under optn awd and optn mawd were substantially reduced by the mid season drainage and awd cycles and were kept at a low level the ch4 emissions was not significantly different between fp and optn when averaged across the six cropping seasons during 2017 2020 ch4 emission under optn awd was 19 8 lower than that of optn the average ch4 emission in optn mawd was further reduced by 16 0 than that of optn awd n2o emission was significantly influenced by n fertilization and irrigation the large amount of basal and tillering n significantly promoted n2o ﬂuxes at seedling stage especially for fp fig 6 b the n2o emission in optn was 25 3 51 1 lower than that of fp relative to optn the 6 season average n2o emission increased by 25 9 in optn awd and 33 0 in optn mawd while compared with fp the n2o emission was decreased by 18 1 in optn awd and 13 4 in optn mawd respectively seasonal net gwp under fp optn optn awd and optn mawd was 9110 1 8416 7 6988 1 and 6033 3 kg co2 eq ha 1 respectively no significant difference exists between fp and optn with respect to the net gwp while lower ghgi was obtained in optn which can be predominantly attributed to the higher grain yield in optn the gwp of ch4 accounted for 86 3 92 7 of the net gwp among various treatments indicated that ch4 was consistently the dominant factor of gwp from rice paddies the ghgi in fp optn optn awd and optn mawd averaged for 1 42 1 18 0 96 and 0 84 kg co2 eq kg 1 grain yield respectively compared with optn awd the gwp and ghgi in optn mawd was decreased by 13 9 and 13 4 respectively correlation analysis using pooled data across different management practices revealed that net gwp and ghgi were positively correlated with irrigation water input and were negatively correlated with the wpt fig 7 a b d and e the ghgi was negatively correlated with grain yield fig 7 f indicating that lower greenhouse gas intensity was linked to increased water productivity and grain yield with reduced water input for fp and optn adopting the mid season drainage there was statistically a highly positive relationship between net gwp and yield while in optn awd and optn mawd using the water saving irrigation no correlation was found between the net gwp and the grain yield fig 7 c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of optimized crop management on grain yield and utilization of water and n fertilizer grain yield n uptake nue and wpt in optn optn awd and optn mawd were substantially greater than those of fp the reduction of the basal and tiller n application under optn had no effect on the final effective panicles number higher yields in optn optn awd and optn mawd were predominantly attributed to the increased spikelets per panicle panicle n topdressing has greater n recovery efficiency than basal and tiller n fertilizer sui et al 2013 postponing n application and increasing the panicle n helps to prevent excessive growth of tillers and avoid waste of n nutrient by unnecessary vegetative growth zhong et al 2010 huang et al 2017 while the biomass accumulation in grain filling period increased xu et al 2015b zhou et al 2022 when more than 30 of fertilizer n was applied at pi and hd the cgr n uptake rate and plant n accumulation during the spikelet differentiation and grain filling stage were substantially increased in optimized n management fig 3 this helps to increase the differentiated spikelet number and prevent spikelet retrogression therefore the increased panicle n ratio with reduced basal and tiller n ratio is responsible for the improved grain yield and nue the 4 year field study demonstrated that the optn awd and optn mawd remarkably reduced the irrigation water input without yield loss in comparison with fp and optn grain yield and nue were not significantly different between optn awd and optn mawd literature so far does not reach a consensus on the effect of the awd irrigation on grain yields several studies reported yield reduction under awd lagomarsino et al 2016 feng et al 2021 whereas others reported that awd saved water without yield loss or even increased yield carrijo et al 2018 setyanto et al 2018 ullah et al 2018 the discrepancy could be attributed to the factors such as the specification of the awd variety weather soil types and hydrological conditions of the study site the safe awd irrigation has been proposed as a cost effective method to save irrigation water in several asian countries bouman and tuong 2001 chu et al 2014 it is reported that rice can extract the water in the root zone easily if the groundwater level did not drop to 15 cm underground carrijo et al 2017 in current study optn awd saved irrigation water without yield loss as compared with optn and the results were consistent across the six cropping seasons indicating that the threshold of water level 15 cm could be proposed for maintaining the rice yield at south china to further improve the wpt a severe awd were evaluated in previous study for severe awd the irrigation management followed the same procedure as safe awd except that field was re irrigated when groundwater level dropped to 30 cm below soil surface although the severe awd saved water by 12 8 29 7 as compared with the mid season drainage and safe awd but the yield was decreased by 3 07 9 82 liang et al 2016 therefore irrigation threshold of 30 cm below soil surface may not suitable for many rice varieties or soil types in south china study also revealed that a water depth 20 cm below soil surface was safe for rice thus possibility exist to further reduce the irrigation water use without compromising yield in clay loam soil condition liang et al 2016 this is in accordance with other observations suggested that the re irrigating threshold of soil water potential at 10 kpa at 15 to 20 cm soil depth could meet of the water demand of rice even at the panicle and flowering stages which are sensitive to water stress ishfaq et al 2020 due to the different sensitivity of rice plant to water stress at different stages the irrigation thresholds can be adapted to a specific period numerous studies reported that rice plants in late tillering stage were less sensitive to water deficit while mid season drainage in this period increased yields mainly due to prevention of the root rot the controlling of unproductive tillers and reduced lodging because of better root anchorage and removal of anaerobic toxins bouman and tuong 2001 wang et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 fu et al 2021 reported that the sink size panicle number and grain yield are highly associated with the cgr and n uptake in the stages of pi and hd in double rice system in current study the cgr and n uptake rate under mawd were comparable to those of optn and optn awd in pi hd and hd ma stages no significant differences were observed in cgr and crop n accumulation between optn optn awd and optn mawd when mid season drainage was imposed the irrigation water input in optn mawd was 3 68 26 0 lower and the 6 season average wpt was 3 1 higher than that of optn awd while the grain yield and crop n accumulation were not significant different between optn awd and optn mawd therefore in comparison with awd mawd could further reduce water input without negative impact on rice growth and grain yield 4 2 effects of integrated irrigation and n management on n surplus and environmental n losses n surplus benchmark are widely used indicators to evaluated the environmental performance for fertilization within a specified boundary at various level e g smallholder farms national regional and global scale annual n surplus for rice system in the region of yangtze river was 225 kg n ha 1 y 1 under farmers conventional n practice zhang et al 2019 in current study seasonal n surplus in south china was 86 8 122 6 kg n ha 1 under farmers conventional fertilization and irrigation practice relative to fp n surplus was substantially reduced by optimized fertilization and water saving irrigation in optn awd and optn mawd superﬂuous n rate results in a greater n surplus that can remain in soil or move to the environment by the paths of gaseous emission leaching and surface runoff n losses in the first 30 dat averaged 46 9 kg n ha 1 in fp accounted for 87 4 of seasonal n loss therefore environmental n losses mainly occurred at early growth stage excess basal and tiller n fertilizer not only increases the unproductive tillers but also increase the n surplus as most of n fertilizer was lost to environment owing to the imperfect root system at early stage lin et al 2014 reported that merely 14 5 of base and tillering n was absorbed by crops while 26 of the panicle n was taken up by crops wu et al 2021 suggested that basal fertilizer proportion should be reduced and the n topdressing should be postponed for rice in the region of middle reaches of yangtze river for the treatment of optn the total n rate was reduced by 14 3 23 8 and the basal and tiller n was reduced by up to 40 relative to fp in current study the total n losses loading in optn at the first 30 dat was 28 0 kg n ha 1 being 59 6 lower than that of fp therefore reducing the n ratios in the early stage can reduce environmental n loss as the plant roots in early stage uptake limited n when suitable n ratio was postponed to the pi stage n accumulation at reproductive growth stage could be substantially increased as the developed root systems at late growth stage give the rice plants a greater opportunity to compete against environmental n loss it is worth notice that optimized n management substantially increased ae are pfpn and crop n uptake under treatments of optn optn awd and optn mawd but did not enhance the ien therefore the increases of grain yield were not higher than the increases of n uptake by plants in optimized n management with delayed n topdressing to further improve the nue optimized n management should aim to increase the yield per unit of absorbed n n runoff loss in south china was probably four times than that in north china hou et al 2016 2018 irrigation significantly influenced the surface runoff and leaching loss in current study the total n losses loading depict a significant and negative correlation with irrigation water input fig 5 d relative to optn runoff volume in optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 56 7 61 0 and 46 8 69 1 while runoff loss of n was reduced by 48 3 50 4 and 36 8 49 1 respectively intermittent irrigation enhanced the storage capacity of rice field because the dried paddy soil may act as buffer to reduce surface runoff induced by extreme precipitation liu et al 2021 therefore the increased drainage intensity in awd and mawd not only enhanced the storage capacity of rainfall water to save irrigation water but also reduce the n runoff loss as the height of the runoff collection pipe was set at 5 cm for all treatments in this study runoff event still occurred in awd and mawd when ponding water layer in field exceed 5 cm under heavy rainfall to further reduced the environmental n losses through the path of surface runoff in awd and mawd it would be necessary to avoid fertilizing or increase the height of drainage outlet reasonably before the arrival of heavy rainfall it is reported that 25 85 of the irrigation water was lost via leaching while leaching water volume was influenced by soil condition and irrigation pattern hafeez et al 2014 moallim et al 2018 in current study leaching loss of n in mawd was reduced by 17 5 and 23 6 compared with fp and optn reduced irrigation water input and percolation volume could be the critical factors for lowering the leaching loads in optn awd and optn mawd works done so far did not reach a consensus on the effects of water management on the amount of n loss via av several studies suggested that av was greater in intermittent irrigation as less water input resulted in shallow water layer and higher ammonium concentration win et al 2009 while others reported that intermittent irrigation reduced av loss as the amount of ammonium binding in the soil was increased zhu et al 1988 results from this study suggesting that irrigation did not have detectable effects on av this is possibly due to the fact that water layer between treatments was not remarkably different within 3 5 days after the application of fertilizer n as the field was irrigated before fertilization for all treatments by reducing the n losses from av leaching and surface runoff the environmental n losses was substantially reduced by 40 8 44 4 under optn mawd in comparison to fp therefore our study demonstrated that the combination of optimized n management and mawd was effective to improve nue and to reduce n loss thus reducing agricultural pollution 4 3 effects of integrated water and n management on greenhouse gas emission the ch4 was dominant contributor to gwp in double rice cropping system which contributed more than 80 of total gwp across different treatments table 5 it is reported that seasonal ch4 emissions under farmers practice in middle of the yangtze river region was 90 7 238 4 kg ch4 ha 1 li et al 2018 yang et al 2019 seasonal ch4 emissions under fp ranged between 226 2 and 404 6 kg ch4 ha 1 in current study the greater ch4 emissions under rice paddies of south china could associated with high temperature and frequent rain events in this region before mid season drainage rice paddies were generally under flooding condition for seedling growth and promoting tillering during rice growth root incorporation and stubble retained in soil increased the amount of carbon pool in the soil and provided methanogens with an abundant carbon substrate therefore the abundant carbon substrate and anaerobic condition before mid season drainage favored the growth of methanogens in paddy soil leading to a high ch4 emission although the ch4 emission was reduced during mid season drainage in fp and optn but obvious re emission of ch4 was observed after mid season drainage fig 6 accumulation of the substrate and microbial biomass before mid season drainage could promote methane production under re flooding condition at later growth stage intermittent drainage is a practical option to mitigate the emission of ch4 li et al 2002 liao et al 2020 toma et al 2021 in current study seasonal ch4 emissions averaged 249 5 kg ha 1 for optn awd being 20 2 lower than that of optn relative to optn awd the seasonal ch4 emission under optn mawd was further reduced by 16 0 we suggested that combination of mid season drainage and awd cycles in mawd irrigation helped to inhibit the activity of methanogen and reduced the ch4 emissions seasonal n2o emission averaged 3 07 kg n2o ha 1 in fp while relative to fp n2o emission was reduced by 34 9 in optn an exponential relationship was found between fertilizer n rate and n2o emission in current study which can be quantitatively described as y 0 945 e 0 0053x r2 0 297 p 0 01 indicated that emission of n2o was significantly affected by the n rate it has been proven that excess n fertilizer in soil leads to great amount of inorganic n and overgrowth of nitrification and denitrification related microbes while the lower soil moisture during intermittent drainage periods encouraged overproduction of n2o hu et al 2015 xia et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 excess n fertilizer applied in the earlier growth stage in the practice of fp lead to great amount of n surplus at soil while greater soil n induced overproduction of n2o during drainage episode reducing n rate was proven to be practical to reduce the emission of n2o zou et al 2005 lan et al 2020 kong et al 2021 relative to fp the basal and tiller n rate under optn optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 30 60 while the n2o emissions was reduced by 13 3 34 9 we suggested that beside the reduction of n fertilizers inputs reducing n ratio at early growth period while increasing the panicle n ratio also helped to decrease n2o emissions seasonal n2o emission was significantly influenced by water inputs table 5 relative to optn n2o emissions in awd and mawd was increased by 25 9 and 33 2 respectively indicating that wet dry cycles in awd and mawd impose a trade off between emissions of n2o and ch4 compared with constant aerobic or anaerobic conditions the anaerobic and aerobic cycling normally promotes n2o emissions through nitrification and denitrification dang hoa et al 2018 fertitta roberts et al 2019 therefore it is still a main task to mitigate n2o emissions under water saving irrigation regime the gwp in fp and optn were positively correlated with grain yield we hypothesize that higher yield with greater shoot and root biomass may increase carbon products as greater carbon products released from root system in anaerobic condition could enhanced root exudation and the substrate utilized by methanogens which eventually elicit greater ch4 emission das et al 2008 relative to optn awd the combination of mid season drainage and awd cycles in mawd increased the n2o emission however mawd further reduced the gwp and ghgi as the mitigation of ch4 emissions outweighed the increase of the n2o emission both gwp and ghgi had positive correlation with the total water input and negative correlation with wpt average gwp and ghgi ranged from high to low were in the order fp optn optn awd and optn mawd in optn awd and optn mawd the net gwp showed minimal response to the increasing of grain yield fig 7 c suggesting that improving wpt by awd and mawd irrigation effectively mitigate gwp in double rice cropping systems while maintaining grain yield relative to farmers practice of irrigation and fertilization integration of optimized n management and mawd irrigation significantly increased the grain yield and reduced the net ghg emission and ghgi the results were consistent across the six cropping seasons therefore we suggested that integrating mawd with optimized n fertilization can synergistically improve the rice yield and reduced the gwp in rice paddies it worth notice that water management and n application rate could interact with each other to produce coupling effect therefore the interaction effect of different water management and n rate on ghg emissions should be explored in future 5 conclusion optimized n management with reduced total n input and increased panicle n application optn was effective to reduce environmental n losses and n2o emissions while improving grain yield and nue compared with fp optn mawd significantly increases n and water use efficiencies and reduced n surplus environmental n losses and gwp relative to optn awd the irrigation water input ch4 emission and gwp in optn mawd was reduced by 19 0 16 0 and 13 7 respectively yield and crop n accumulation in optn mawd were comparable with those of optn awd integration of optimized n management and mawd can be a practical

emissions of ghg from rice paddies the safe awd irrigation was introduced into south china previous studies demonstrated that the safe awd irrigation effectively reduced irrigation water input and ghg emission in double rice cropping system at south china liang et al 2017 mid season drainage was a typical practice at south china in this practice about 2 weeks drainage was imposed at the late tillering stage the mid season drainage was effective in suppressing unproductive tillers and promoting root activity and root growth through increasing soil oxygen supply moreover mid season drainage substantially reduced ch4 emission relative to permanent flooding zou et al 2005 itoh et al 2011 liang et al 2016 based on the beneficial characteristics of the mid season drainage irrigation a modified awd irrigation technology mawd was developed in current study in this regime the mid season drainage was integrated into the safe awd irrigation furthermore optimized n management was

measurement of environmental n losses through runoff leaching and ammonia volatilization water samples of surface runoff were taken during each event of runoff loss a plastic bucket of 20 l was set beside the plots in order to collect the samples from runoff water via pipes system xue et al 2014 other runoff water entered the drainage ditch via a runoff collection pipe set at the water outlet of the plot the height of the drainage outlet in local farmer s field was generally set at 3 5 cm so the hole of the water inlet of the runoff collection pipe was set at 5 cm above soil surface while the hole of the water outlet of the pipe was set at 20 cm below the soil surface runoff water discharged into the drainage ditch through water outlet of the pipe automatically due to the gravity caused by the height difference a flow meter was equipped at the water outlet of the pipe at the lower end to measure the volume of runoff water total n content tn in water sample was measured by the method of alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation ultra spectrophotometry the runoff n loss was determined by multiplying the tn of water sample by the runoff volume recorded by the collection bucket and flow meter n loss via leaching and ammonia volatilization av were evaluated at 1 3 5 7 and 11 d after each n application and then at one week interval n leaching sample of percolation water was collected by a lysimeter made of porous pvc pipe with length and inner diameter of 70 cm and 16 cm respectively the lysimeter is sealed in the bottom the lower end of the lysimeter has 200 pores to allow the infiltration of leaching water to avoid the sediment flowing into the pipe each lysimeter was surrounded with nylon net and quartz sand li et al 2008 ye et al 2015 the lysimeter was inserted into soil at 50 cm depth before sampling the leaching water was pumped out from the lysimeter and the leaching water volume was recorded the soil volume contributing leaching water to lysimeter was determined by the method described by li et al 2008 leaching volume per soil volume was extrapolated to calculate the leaching volume per hectare n leaching loss was determined by multiplying the tn of water sample by the leaching volume n loss from av was measured by the static chamber method xue et al 2014 liang et al 2017 sample was collected by sponge soaked in phosphoglycerol to absorb ammonia in an ammonia trapping chamber the chamber was made by transparent pvc pipe with length of 25 cm diameter of 20 cm samples collected by the sponge were extracted by kcl solution 1 0 mol l 1 of 300 ml the tn

f compared with fp n leaching loss loading in optn was significantly reduced by 16 9 in early cropping season and 27 3 in late cropping season relative to optn n leaching loss loading under optn awd and optn mawd was respectively reduced by 17 5 and 23 6 in early cropping season and 18 7 and 25 4 in late cropping season table 3 the total n losses loading from av surface runoff and leaching in fp optn optn awd and optn mawd was averaged for 75 1 54 3 45 2 and 43 1 kg n ha 1 respectively across the early and late cropping seasons table 4 compared with fp the seasonal n losses loading under optn optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 23 6 44 4 table 4 compared with optn the total n losses loading under optn awd and optn mawd was significantly reduced by 16 8 and 20 5 respectively p 0 05 the total n losses loading was not significantly different between the treatments of optn awd and optn mawd p 0 05 compared with fp seasonal fertilizer n input of optn optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 14 3 16 7 reversely the crop n output in optn optn awd and optn mawd was 15 0 30 1 higher than fp the n surplus of fp were 86 8 kg n ha 1 and 122 5 kg n ha 1 respectively for early and late season seasonal n surplus in different treatment averaged from 22 5 kg ha 1 to 122 6 kg ha 1 table 4 compared with fp n surplus in optn optn awd and optn mawd was significantly decrease by 55 0 74 1 the n surplus and n balance were not significantly different between optn optn awd and optn mawd p 0 05 regression analysis indicated that total n losses was linearly increased with increasing n surplus and irrigation water input fig 5 a d and decreased with increasing crop n uptake and are fig 5 b c a reduction of 100 kg n ha 1 of n surplus leads to reduction of 67 1 kg n ha 1 of total n losses from rice paddies fig 5 c indicated the environmental n pollution was decreased in optn optn awd and optn mawd as more fertilizer n was absorbed by crops and less n was lost to environment or remained in paddy soil 3 5 ch4 and n2o emissions and the global warming potential ch4 emission was significantly influenced by irrigation in early cropping season ch4 fluxes under fp and optn showed an increasing trend and then suppressed by mid season drainage while when the paddy re flooded the ch4 re emission commenced and resumed to a high level fig 6 a at late season the ch4 fluxes generally maintained at low rate at heading stage due to the descending temperature the ch4 fluxes under optn awd and optn mawd were substantially reduced by the mid season drainage and awd cycles and were kept at a low level the ch4 emissions was not significantly different between fp and optn when averaged across the six cropping seasons during 2017 2020 ch4 emission under optn awd was 19 8 lower than that of optn the average ch4 emission in optn mawd was further reduced by 16 0 than that of optn awd n2o emission was significantly influenced by n fertilization and irrigation the large amount of basal and tillering n significantly promoted n2o ﬂuxes at seedling stage especially for fp fig 6 b the n2o emission in optn was 25 3 51 1 lower than that of fp relative to optn the 6 season average n2o emission increased by 25 9 in optn awd and 33 0 in optn mawd while compared with fp the n2o emission was decreased by 18 1 in optn awd and 13 4 in optn mawd respectively seasonal net gwp under fp optn optn awd and optn mawd was 9110 1 8416 7 6988 1 and 6033 3 kg co2 eq ha 1 respectively no significant difference exists between fp and optn with respect to the net gwp while lower ghgi was obtained in optn which can be predominantly attributed to the higher grain yield in optn the gwp of ch4 accounted for 86 3 92 7 of the net gwp among various treatments indicated that ch4 was consistently the dominant factor of gwp from rice paddies the ghgi in fp optn optn awd and optn mawd averaged for 1 42 1 18 0 96 and 0 84 kg co2 eq kg 1 grain yield respectively compared with optn awd the gwp and ghgi in optn mawd was decreased by 13 9 and 13 4 respectively correlation analysis using pooled data across different management practices revealed that net gwp and ghgi were positively correlated with irrigation water input and were negatively correlated with the wpt fig 7 a b d and e the ghgi was negatively correlated with grain yield fig 7 f indicating that lower greenhouse gas intensity was linked to increased water productivity and grain yield with reduced water input for fp and optn adopting the mid season drainage there was statistically a highly positive relationship between net gwp and yield while in optn awd and optn mawd using the water saving irrigation no correlation was found between the net gwp and the grain yield fig 7 c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of optimized crop management on grain yield and utilization of water and n fertilizer grain yield n uptake nue and wpt in optn optn awd and optn mawd were substantially greater than those of fp the reduction of the basal and tiller n application under optn had no effect on the final effective panicles number higher yields in optn optn awd and optn mawd were predominantly attributed to the increased spikelets per panicle panicle n topdressing has greater n recovery efficiency than basal and tiller n fertilizer sui et al 2013 postponing n application and increasing the panicle n helps to prevent excessive growth of tillers and avoid waste of n nutrient by unnecessary vegetative growth zhong et al 2010 huang et al 2017 while the biomass accumulation in grain filling period increased xu et al 2015b zhou et al 2022 when more than 30 of fertilizer n was applied at pi and hd the cgr n uptake rate and plant n accumulation during the spikelet differentiation and grain filling stage were substantially increased in optimized n management fig 3 this helps to increase the differentiated spikelet number and prevent spikelet retrogression therefore the increased panicle n ratio with reduced basal and tiller n ratio is responsible for the improved grain yield and nue the 4 year field study demonstrated that the optn awd and optn mawd remarkably reduced the irrigation water input without yield loss in comparison with fp and optn grain yield and nue were not significantly different between optn awd and optn mawd literature so far does not reach a consensus on the effect of the awd irrigation on grain yields several studies reported yield reduction under awd lagomarsino et al 2016 feng et al 2021 whereas others reported that awd saved water without yield loss or even increased yield carrijo et al 2018 setyanto et al 2018 ullah et al 2018 the discrepancy could be attributed to the factors such as the specification of the awd variety weather soil types and hydrological conditions of the study site the safe awd irrigation has been proposed as a cost effective method to save irrigation water in several asian countries bouman and tuong 2001 chu et al 2014 it is reported that rice can extract the water in the root zone easily if the groundwater level did not drop to 15 cm underground carrijo et al 2017 in current study optn awd saved irrigation water without yield loss as compared with optn and the results were consistent across the six cropping seasons indicating that the threshold of water level 15 cm could be proposed for maintaining the rice yield at south china to further improve the wpt a severe awd were evaluated in previous study for severe awd the irrigation management followed the same procedure as safe awd except that field was re irrigated when groundwater level dropped to 30 cm below soil surface although the severe awd saved water by 12 8 29 7 as compared with the mid season drainage and safe awd but the yield was decreased by 3 07 9 82 liang et al 2016 therefore irrigation threshold of 30 cm below soil surface may not suitable for many rice varieties or soil types in south china study also revealed that a water depth 20 cm below soil surface was safe for rice thus possibility exist to further reduce the irrigation water use without compromising yield in clay loam soil condition liang et al 2016 this is in accordance with other observations suggested that the re irrigating threshold of soil water potential at 10 kpa at 15 to 20 cm soil depth could meet of the water demand of rice even at the panicle and flowering stages which are sensitive to water stress ishfaq et al 2020 due to the different sensitivity of rice plant to water stress at different stages the irrigation thresholds can be adapted to a specific period numerous studies reported that rice plants in late tillering stage were less sensitive to water deficit while mid season drainage in this period increased yields mainly due to prevention of the root rot the controlling of unproductive tillers and reduced lodging because of better root anchorage and removal of anaerobic toxins bouman and tuong 2001 wang et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 fu et al 2021 reported that the sink size panicle number and grain yield are highly associated with the cgr and n uptake in the stages of pi and hd in double rice system in current study the cgr and n uptake rate under mawd were comparable to those of optn and optn awd in pi hd and hd ma stages no significant differences were observed in cgr and crop n accumulation between optn optn awd and optn mawd when mid season drainage was imposed the irrigation water input in optn mawd was 3 68 26 0 lower and the 6 season average wpt was 3 1 higher than that of optn awd while the grain yield and crop n accumulation were not significant different between optn awd and optn mawd therefore in comparison with awd mawd could further reduce water input without negative impact on rice growth and grain yield 4 2 effects of integrated irrigation and n management on n surplus and environmental n losses n surplus benchmark are widely used indicators to evaluated the environmental performance for fertilization within a specified boundary at various level e g smallholder farms national regional and global scale annual n surplus for rice system in the region of yangtze river was 225 kg n ha 1 y 1 under farmers conventional n practice zhang et al 2019 in current study seasonal n surplus in south china was 86 8 122 6 kg n ha 1 under farmers conventional fertilization and irrigation practice relative to fp n surplus was substantially reduced by optimized fertilization and water saving irrigation in optn awd and optn mawd superﬂuous n rate results in a greater n surplus that can remain in soil or move to the environment by the paths of gaseous emission leaching and surface runoff n losses in the first 30 dat averaged 46 9 kg n ha 1 in fp accounted for 87 4 of seasonal n loss therefore environmental n losses mainly occurred at early growth stage excess basal and tiller n fertilizer not only increases the unproductive tillers but also increase the n surplus as most of n fertilizer was lost to environment owing to the imperfect root system at early stage lin et al 2014 reported that merely 14 5 of base and tillering n was absorbed by crops while 26 of the panicle n was taken up by crops wu et al 2021 suggested that basal fertilizer proportion should be reduced and the n topdressing should be postponed for rice in the region of middle reaches of yangtze river for the treatment of optn the total n rate was reduced by 14 3 23 8 and the basal and tiller n was reduced by up to 40 relative to fp in current study the total n losses loading in optn at the first 30 dat was 28 0 kg n ha 1 being 59 6 lower than that of fp therefore reducing the n ratios in the early stage can reduce environmental n loss as the plant roots in early stage uptake limited n when suitable n ratio was postponed to the pi stage n accumulation at reproductive growth stage could be substantially increased as the developed root systems at late growth stage give the rice plants a greater opportunity to compete against environmental n loss it is worth notice that optimized n management substantially increased ae are pfpn and crop n uptake under treatments of optn optn awd and optn mawd but did not enhance the ien therefore the increases of grain yield were not higher than the increases of n uptake by plants in optimized n management with delayed n topdressing to further improve the nue optimized n management should aim to increase the yield per unit of absorbed n n runoff loss in south china was probably four times than that in north china hou et al 2016 2018 irrigation significantly influenced the surface runoff and leaching loss in current study the total n losses loading depict a significant and negative correlation with irrigation water input fig 5 d relative to optn runoff volume in optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 56 7 61 0 and 46 8 69 1 while runoff loss of n was reduced by 48 3 50 4 and 36 8 49 1 respectively intermittent irrigation enhanced the storage capacity of rice field because the dried paddy soil may act as buffer to reduce surface runoff induced by extreme precipitation liu et al 2021 therefore the increased drainage intensity in awd and mawd not only enhanced the storage capacity of rainfall water to save irrigation water but also reduce the n runoff loss as the height of the runoff collection pipe was set at 5 cm for all treatments in this study runoff event still occurred in awd and mawd when ponding water layer in field exceed 5 cm under heavy rainfall to further reduced the environmental n losses through the path of surface runoff in awd and mawd it would be necessary to avoid fertilizing or increase the height of drainage outlet reasonably before the arrival of heavy rainfall it is reported that 25 85 of the irrigation water was lost via leaching while leaching water volume was influenced by soil condition and irrigation pattern hafeez et al 2014 moallim et al 2018 in current study leaching loss of n in mawd was reduced by 17 5 and 23 6 compared with fp and optn reduced irrigation water input and percolation volume could be the critical factors for lowering the leaching loads in optn awd and optn mawd works done so far did not reach a consensus on the effects of water management on the amount of n loss via av several studies suggested that av was greater in intermittent irrigation as less water input resulted in shallow water layer and higher ammonium concentration win et al 2009 while others reported that intermittent irrigation reduced av loss as the amount of ammonium binding in the soil was increased zhu et al 1988 results from this study suggesting that irrigation did not have detectable effects on av this is possibly due to the fact that water layer between treatments was not remarkably different within 3 5 days after the application of fertilizer n as the field was irrigated before fertilization for all treatments by reducing the n losses from av leaching and surface runoff the environmental n losses was substantially reduced by 40 8 44 4 under optn mawd in comparison to fp therefore our study demonstrated that the combination of optimized n management and mawd was effective to improve nue and to reduce n loss thus reducing agricultural pollution 4 3 effects of integrated water and n management on greenhouse gas emission the ch4 was dominant contributor to gwp in double rice cropping system which contributed more than 80 of total gwp across different treatments table 5 it is reported that seasonal ch4 emissions under farmers practice in middle of the yangtze river region was 90 7 238 4 kg ch4 ha 1 li et al 2018 yang et al 2019 seasonal ch4 emissions under fp ranged between 226 2 and 404 6 kg ch4 ha 1 in current study the greater ch4 emissions under rice paddies of south china could associated with high temperature and frequent rain events in this region before mid season drainage rice paddies were generally under flooding condition for seedling growth and promoting tillering during rice growth root incorporation and stubble retained in soil increased the amount of carbon pool in the soil and provided methanogens with an abundant carbon substrate therefore the abundant carbon substrate and anaerobic condition before mid season drainage favored the growth of methanogens in paddy soil leading to a high ch4 emission although the ch4 emission was reduced during mid season drainage in fp and optn but obvious re emission of ch4 was observed after mid season drainage fig 6 accumulation of the substrate and microbial biomass before mid season drainage could promote methane production under re flooding condition at later growth stage intermittent drainage is a practical option to mitigate the emission of ch4 li et al 2002 liao et al 2020 toma et al 2021 in current study seasonal ch4 emissions averaged 249 5 kg ha 1 for optn awd being 20 2 lower than that of optn relative to optn awd the seasonal ch4 emission under optn mawd was further reduced by 16 0 we suggested that combination of mid season drainage and awd cycles in mawd irrigation helped to inhibit the activity of methanogen and reduced the ch4 emissions seasonal n2o emission averaged 3 07 kg n2o ha 1 in fp while relative to fp n2o emission was reduced by 34 9 in optn an exponential relationship was found between fertilizer n rate and n2o emission in current study which can be quantitatively described as y 0 945 e 0 0053x r2 0 297 p 0 01 indicated that emission of n2o was significantly affected by the n rate it has been proven that excess n fertilizer in soil leads to great amount of inorganic n and overgrowth of nitrification and denitrification related microbes while the lower soil moisture during intermittent drainage periods encouraged overproduction of n2o hu et al 2015 xia et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 excess n fertilizer applied in the earlier growth stage in the practice of fp lead to great amount of n surplus at soil while greater soil n induced overproduction of n2o during drainage episode reducing n rate was proven to be practical to reduce the emission of n2o zou et al 2005 lan et al 2020 kong et al 2021 relative to fp the basal and tiller n rate under optn optn awd and optn mawd was reduced by 30 60 while the n2o emissions was reduced by 13 3 34 9 we suggested that beside the reduction of n fertilizers inputs reducing n ratio at early growth period while increasing the panicle n ratio also helped to decrease n2o emissions seasonal n2o emission was significantly influenced by water inputs table 5 relative to optn n2o emissions in awd and mawd was increased by 25 9 and 33 2 respectively indicating that wet dry cycles in awd and mawd impose a trade off between emissions of n2o and ch4 compared with constant aerobic or anaerobic conditions the anaerobic and aerobic cycling normally promotes n2o emissions through nitrification and denitrification dang hoa et al 2018 fertitta roberts et al 2019 therefore it is still a main task to mitigate n2o emissions under water saving irrigation regime the gwp in fp and optn were positively correlated with grain yield we hypothesize that higher yield with greater shoot and root biomass may increase carbon products as greater carbon products released from root system in anaerobic condition could enhanced root exudation and the substrate utilized by methanogens which eventually elicit greater ch4 emission das et al 2008 relative to optn awd the combination of mid season drainage and awd cycles in mawd increased the n2o emission however mawd further reduced the gwp and ghgi as the mitigation of ch4 emissions outweighed the increase of the n2o emission both gwp and ghgi had positive correlation with the total water input and negative correlation with wpt average gwp and ghgi ranged from high to low were in the order fp optn optn awd and optn mawd in optn awd and optn mawd the net gwp showed minimal response to the increasing of grain yield fig 7 c suggesting that improving wpt by awd and mawd irrigation effectively mitigate gwp in double rice cropping systems while maintaining grain yield relative to farmers practice of irrigation and fertilization integration of optimized n management and mawd irrigation significantly increased the grain yield and reduced the net ghg emission and ghgi the results were consistent across the six cropping seasons therefore we suggested that integrating mawd with optimized n fertilization can synergistically improve the rice yield and reduced the gwp in rice paddies it worth notice that water management and n application rate could interact with each other to produce coupling effect therefore the interaction effect of different water management and n rate on ghg emissions should be explored in future 5 conclusion optimized n management with reduced total n input and increased panicle n application optn was effective to reduce environmental n losses and n2o emissions while improving grain yield and nue compared with fp optn mawd significantly increases n and water use efficiencies and reduced n surplus environmental n losses and gwp relative to optn awd the irrigation water input ch4 emission and gwp in optn mawd was reduced by 19 0 16 0 and 13 7 respectively yield and crop n accumulation in optn mawd were comparable with those of optn awd integration of optimized n management and mawd can be a practical

8979,this paper analyses the impacts and water policy implications of an increase of perennial crops on irrigation water requirements and on the vulnerability of the agricultural system to climatic events in the case of the guadalquivir river basin as indicated by the eu water framework directive wfd the characterisation of a river basin requires information on the major economic drivers and pressures at river basin scale guadalquivir river basin southern spain can be considered a representative mediterranean case study that has faced basin closure and continues the trend towards increased crop intensification and greater water use efficiency our result shows an increased vulnerability to drought and water scarcity in the basin due to the expansion of irrigated perennial crops and a decrease of ris relative irrigation supply from 0 70 to 0 56 in the period 2000 2021 thereby forcing farmers to adopt deficit irrigation techniques the potential increase in the frequency of droughts and the growth of irrigation water requirements iwr due to higher temperatures raise the vulnerability of the system to extreme climate events such findings can be employed to support the efficient allocation of water resources in order to improve water policy through its adaptation to increasing risks related to droughts and water scarcity keywords irrigation water requirements basin closure deficit irrigation ris drought vulnerability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction models of climate change predict significant changes in precipitation patterns and increased temperatures which will exacerbate water scarcity in the mediterranean region as well as in other parts of the world giorgi and lionello 2008 iglesias et al 2011a iglesias et al 2011b grasso and feola 2012 iglesias and garrote 2015 average temperatures are due to increase by 1 5 degrees centigrade compared to pre industrial levels according to a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 fader et al 2016 state that in a business as usual scenario this has caused an increase in gross irrigation requirements of between 4 and 18 the mediterranean region is one of the areas most affected by these impacts this area is characterised by its economic dynamism with special emphasis on agricultural activity and high population density which increases over the summer period and this region suffers from severe water resource constraints giorgi and lionello 2008 giannakopoulos et al 2009 garcía ruiz et al 2011 fader et al 2016 although the climatic conditions of the mediterranean area are suitable for the maintenance and survival of a wide range of crops irrigated agriculture has become an essential activity for the maintenance of agricultural yields and the income of its inhabitants daccache et al 2014 irrigated agriculture in the mediterranean represents approximately 30 of cropland and is by far the largest consumer of freshwater in the region at between 70 and 80 of available resources fao 2016 this increased water scarcity in already closed basins defined as those where all their water resources are fully allocated raises the risk of the overexploitation of water resources degrading the quality of the resource and forcing farmers not only to change their cropping patterns but also to implement new techniques that are more efficient in the use of the resource such as the modernisation of systems and the application of deficit irrigation practices pisinaras et al 2010 berahmani et al 2012 several studies recommend the improvement of irrigation efficiency as the most appropriate adaptation strategy to enhance sustainability in water management especially in the mediterranean region daccache et al 2014 fader et al 2016 in spain public and private investments for irrigation modernisation have been substantial in recent decades especially in the southern and eastern part of the country espinosa tasón et al 2020 these investments have sought to save water in the irrigation sector while maximising crop yields maintaining agricultural incomes and increasing the resilience of the sector on the other hand changes in irrigation technology drip irrigation on demand systems have supported an increase both in perennial and high value horticultural crops as an adaptation to both increasing scarcity and decreasing profitability of commodities e g cotton maize in california mall and herman 2019 reveal similar results from their analysis of the risks associated with increasing water scarcity due to the progressive expansion of perennial crops in the case of the california central valley expósito and berbel 2017 2019 analyse the evolution of water productivity in the process of closure of the guadalquivir river basin grb southern spain and conclude that the process of irrigation modernisation together with the expansion of irrigated area and changes in cropping patterns towards perennial crops have created greater pressure on the resources available in the basin in this respect the work of pedraza et al 2012 and that of argüelles et al 2012 have already highlighted the risks associated with changes in irrigated cropping patterns in the guadalquivir basin in the case of australia this same phenomenon has been analysed in various studies loch and adamson 2015 adamson et al 2017 adamson and loch 2018 whereby the increase of efficiency in irrigation systems due to increasing water scarcity can lead to major changes in cropping patterns other studies such as those by chai et al 2014 and chai et al 2015 analyse this issue for the case of china in the case of southern spain the evolution of the grb since year 2000 has witnessed increasing water use efficiency through investments in water saving modernisation this process has been described by expósito and berbel 2019 and berbel et al 2019 who found a significant increase in irrigation water productivity driven by the creation of new irrigated areas dedicated to high value crops mainly perennials olives and citrus fruits and with a predominant use of deficit irrigation strategies using crop yield water and climate models this paper contributes to the existing literature by offering a detailed assessment of changes in cropping patterns and crop productivity at river basin scale our ultimate aim is to discuss the implications for water policy of these changes in cropping patterns since these might compromise the basin capacity to meet irrigation requirements in the future the case of the grb despite sharing certain similarities with other water stressed regions e g california australia shows its own characteristics specifically the results reveal how the combination of technological innovations in irrigation has led to greater efficiency in the use of resources which has been accompanied by an expansion of irrigated area especially the area devoted to crops capable of generating higher levels of gross value added per unit of irrigation i e olives citrus fruit and almonds furthermore this study contributes to the knowledge of the implications of this crop intensification for water policy since the shift to perennial crops has led to a significant change in irrigation requirements thus both implying higher risk under drought conditions and extreme events and increasing the system vulnerability this paper is structured as follows the next section presents the materials used in the work and a brief description of the case study section 3 details the methodology applied section 4 shows the main results followed by a discussion in section 5 finally section 6 summarises the main conclusions of the paper 2 materials and method the case study focuses on the grb located in the southern region of spain fig 1 which supposes approximately 25 of the spanish irrigated area this basin is characterised as having a continental mediterranean climate with hot dry summers cold winters and an average annual rainfall of approximately 590 mm the surface water resources available across the whole basin provide a total of 7540 hm3 year and 1851 hm3 year underground the total water demand in the basin adds up to 3720 48 hm3 year with agricultural use representing 86 of the total demand 3207 hm3 year and 11 from urban demand 404 hm3 year of total demand 76 that is 2845 hm3 year comes from surface water with the origin of the resource distributed as follows regulated 2492 15 hm3 year unregulated 306 hm3 year other minor sources are reused water 34 hm3 year groundwater 840 hm3 year and springs 46 hm3 year chg 2022 since this study aims to quantify the expansion of perennial crops in the grb fig 2 which is characterised by limited natural water availability the water requirements of each crop group are calculated the most representative crops in the basin form the following groups a herbaceous crops rice maize wheat cotton sunflower sugar beet alfalfa tomato potato garlic and greenhouse vegetables b olive trees and vineyards and c fruit trees and others including citrus almond and strawberry the water data set is compiled from 2000 to 2021 and considers hydrological years 1st october to 30th september table a1 in the appendix details the statistical sources for the main variables and parameters used in this study these generally consist of official published data for the cultivated area water withdrawal crop prices and yields although the data has been obtained from various official sources depending on the years available this information has been complemented with published academic and technical reports such as those on intensive and super intensive olive areas official statistics minimised densities from 100 to 1600 trees per ha under the same item and fao parameters have also been employed the method followed to calculate the evolution of crop patterns and water requirements at river basin scale is explained in detail in the section below 2 1 crop pattern estimation crops that are representative of the grb form the object of our study of which 16 crops were finally selected which represent 92 of the cultivated area the official irrigated area of each crop for the time series was given for the period 1989 2018 although high quality data is also available for the period 2001 2021 see table a1 in the appendix for source details to complete the series of years extrapolation has been carried out and finally the crops have been grouped into 2 weighted categories herbaceous and perennial based on the percentages of surface area of each crop 2 2 water requirement estimation this study uses the crop coefficient method developed by allen et al 1998 based on the calculation of crop evapotranspiration etc precipitation p and reference evapotranspiration eto for the annual series 2000 2021 have been used as the main variables and crop coefficients kc and useful or effective rainfall pe are needed to calculate crop evapotranspiration etc the net irrigation water requirements hereinafter iwr have been estimated monthly by using the single crop coefficient method in the fao 56 manual and applying a simple water balance this coefficient is adapted to the crop phenology of the area and as far as possible local crop coefficients available from various studies are also employed the crop evapotranspiration et c eq 1 under the assumption that the crop does not suffer from water stress is therefore 1 et c et o k c where eto is the reference evapotranspiration whose calculation can be carried out following the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 and k c is the crop coefficient in this case the reference evapotranspiration has been extracted from the daily historical records of eight meteorological stations located across the grb included in the andalusian agroclimatic information network the mean monthly reference evapotranspiration eto of the 2000 2021 series is greater in the summer months and reaches a maximum in july of 226 mm and a minimum in december of 37 mm with an annual eto mean of 1413 mm crop coefficients applicable in different parts of the world are widely available for this work the values compiled in chapter 6 of fao handbook 56 allen et al 1998 have been taken as a reference and have been replaced by values from recent studies carried out in the area where possible for perennial crops and for olive groves in addition to k c a coverage factor k r has been used which is applicable when coverage falls below 50 depending on the percentage of ground cover s c average crown diameter in metres ø and planting density in trees per hectare d 2 k r 2 s c 100 3 s c π 2 d 400 the net requirements of a crop can be defined as the amount of water that would undergo evapotranspiration if there were no limitations on its availability therefore only the maximum potential consumption per cultivated area is considered the calculation of net requirements is performed by a simple water balance of monthly water outflows minus inflows first the monthly crop evapotranspiration et c month is calculated additionally the monthly effective precipitation p e is calculated using usda scs united states dept of agriculture soil conservation service scs 1993 the main variable for the calculation of the effective or useful precipitation is the monthly precipitation p t calculated from the annual series 2000 2021 daily records of the average of 8 meteorological stations whereby two stations lie in each of the 4 provinces that are within the territory of the grb baza and loja granada huesa and úbeda jaén córdoba and hornachuelos córdoba la rinconada and lebrija seville the winter months experience a concentration of more than 50 of the total average annual rainfall while the summers remain very dry the average rainfall of the 2000 2021 series in our study is 479 mm per year fig 3 the estimation of the irrigation requirement involves quantification of the water accumulated in the soil during the previous months to carry out the balance to this end the amount of water available in a generic soil has been estimated based on its retention capacity and the depth of the roots of each crop the soil retention capacity as determined by fao 56 m3 m3 has been chosen uniformly for all crops at 0 16 which represents a loam soil the depth of the roots depends on the crop under analysis and range from 0 30 m for strawberry to 2 00 m for alfalfa for each crop the soil storage capacity mm is calculated as the product of the root depth and retention capacity variables the following application efficiency values were used for this study localised irrigation drip 0 90 sprinkler irrigation 0 80 and surface irrigation 0 60 daccache ciurana et al 2014 according to the current grb hydrological plan chg 2022 conduction and distribution efficiency reaches 95 this results in water conveyance gross losses of 5 these gross losses are due to the extraction of the water released from the reservoir for this reason the efficiency of the system is calculated as the result of the overall efficiency considering both the conduction and distribution losses olive grove parameters are taken from the study by orgaz et al 1999 which was carried out in andalusia with which irrigation requirements were initially calculated in a similar way to the remaining crops for the traditional planting frame of 8 8 m 80 120 trees ha and the super intensive planting of 4 1 5 m 1667 trees ha for all other crops except alfalfa and strawberry the values of kc evolution and crop phenology have been taken from chapter 6 of the fao 56 manual table 1 shows the information necessary for the application of the method chosen in our study 3 results the results of this study focus on showing the long term evolution of changing cropping patterns and are complemented by an analysis of the evolution of crop water requirements iwr and their economic impact at basin level 3 1 change in cropping patterns in the period 1989 2018 there was a profound change in the predominant crops in our case study in addition to a highly significant increase in the area irrigated as fig 4 shows in said period there was a change from a predominance of herbaceous crops to a cropping pattern with a predominance of perennial crops especially with olive groves and other fruit trees such as citrus and almond trees herbaceous crops increased from 211 288 ha 1989 to 313 095 ha 2018 and perennials increased from 104 450 ha to 543 334 ha the greater share of perennials has significant consequences for the sustainability of the use of water resources in the grb fig 5 shows the percentages of crop area broken down into three groups herbaceous olive and other perennials herbaceous crops decrease from 67 1989 to 37 of total irrigated area 2018 while perennials on the other hand increase to 63 2018 compared to 33 1989 with olive groves constituting a total of 52 of the total irrigated area thereby accounting for 82 of perennials the increase in the irrigated area can be accredited to various factors including the conversion of rainfed perennials mainly olive groves into irrigated land for olive groves an internal change from irrigated herbaceous to irrigated perennials and the massive conversion of rainfed herbaceous to irrigated perennials consequently irrigated perennials have significantly increased their presence in the basin in terms of cultivated area an increase of 60 though the total cultivated area in the basin has decreased in the last two decades 5 4 see table 2 3 2 crop water requirements crop iwr are estimated as explained in the previous sections for each of the 16 representative crops in our case study this method calculates the net iwr which can be converted into gross iwr by applying the efficiency of the system of water use due to the shift towards perennial crops basin iwr have increased in recent years as shown in fig 6a this shows a positive trend with different points fluctuating according to the variable rainfall and evapotranspiration with high levels of net water requirements exceeding 5000 hm3 in hydrological periods in which extreme droughts have predominated such as the 2004 2005 period with rainfall below 250 mm and the 2011 2012 period with barely 300 mm of rainfall this has exerted an impact throughout the basin since it has limited the availability of water for irrigation and forced the more efficient management of irrigation systems irrigation systems have increased their efficiency thereby reducing losses in the use of the resource and partially compensating the increase in net iwr this is due to the significant effort in modernising irrigation systems whereby low levels of technology with gravity irrigation systems have been replaced with systems with a greater use of the resource such as drip irrigation systems thereby making the grb stand out for its high level of technology with percentages of over 75 for drip systems across the entire irrigation surface area table 3 as previously mentioned in order to calculate the efficiency of the system at basin level table 3 losses of 5 due to conduction and distribution in the irrigation systems have been considered chg 2022 gross iwr are equivalent to the quotient between net iwr and overall irrigation efficiency these values are calculated as described in the previous sections as can be observed in fig 5b the cumulative gross crop requirements for the entire irrigated area exceed the normal yearly water rights in the grb with an average value of 3300 hm3 for the period 2000 2021 these results show the situation of closure in which the basin finds itself due to the lack of water to meet the water requirements of crops in a context of a decrease in herbaceous crops and an increase in perennial crops with a predominance of olive groves there is also a slight upward trend in the increase in net iwr at basin level determined by the change in productive orientation and irrigated surface area especially regarding olive groves this context is particularly serious in those years of drought in which drought protocols are applied with a reduction in the endowments which can range from 50 drought protocol applied in years 2006 2007 2008 and 2020 to 18 in the 21 22 campaign this predominance of perennials increases the vulnerability of the basin in periods of water scarcity it also implies a higher financial risk in the case of water supply failure in comparison with the previous context where the largest share constituted irrigated herbaceous crops that can be transformed into rainfed herbaceous crops in the case of drought without long term losses as is the case of perennials especially for trees non adapted to stress e g intensive olives almonds citrus peaches and other fruit trees this increasing vulnerability can be identified in the trend lines shown in fig 6 for total gross iwr which have a slightly positive slope and for net iwr the table below summarises the evolution of the main variables as shown in table 4 it can be observed how global basin irrigation abstraction rights have decreased since 2009 due to the application of the european water framework directive wfd unfortunately net iwr potential evapotranspiration etp useful rainfall continue to grow throughout the period due to the increase in irrigated area and to the conversion from herbaceous to perennial crops with an increase of 29 in 2000 2018 as mentioned above irrigation efficiency increases during the period thereby partially compensating for the increment in net iwr from 0 68 to 0 77 while gross iwr grow at an annual rate that accumulates 15 2018 vs 2001 since iwr exceed availability the irrigation system applies deficit irrigation as a response with a relative irrigation supply ris decreasing from 0 70 to 0 56 at the end of the period it is worth bearing in mind that we are assuming that irrigation abstractions are close to water rights although in normal years water abstractions are usually slightly below water rights since some land is under transformation or simply not 100 of the irrigation quota is used if initial 2000 2002 and final 2018 2020 periods are compared we observe that average abstraction drops from 3372 hm3 to 3202 hm3 efficiency increases from 68 up to 77 and estimated return flows fall from 1079 hm3 to 737 hm3 32 reduction and therefore net consumption abstraction minus return flows has increased from 2293 hm3 to 2466 hm3 7 increase in these last two decades the evolution in cropping patterns observed in the grb has also triggered economic effects i e crop income that help in the understanding of these changes for this purpose a simple economic analysis has been carried out based on agricultural yields and prices extracted from the agricultural statistics yearbook of the andalusian government junta de andalucía for each of the years of the period analysed 2000 2020 and the moving average of the last 3 years has been employed to smooth out conjunctural changes with respect to production the average of the last 5 years has been utilised the results are shown in fig 7 which illustrates a clear difference in total income for the two groups of irrigated crops across the whole basin herbaceous crops obtain an average total income of 292 million euros while for perennial crops this figure amounts to an average total of 731 million euros whereby 30 of the total income of the last 20 years is from herbaceous crops and 70 from perennial crops two marked turning points can be observed which coincide with the years of extreme drought in the year 2004 2005 there was a rising trend in income from perennial crops which can be explained by the increase in prices that occurred during this period of drought with low yields in 2011 2012 with the second extreme drought income from herbaceous crops fell significantly due to the decrease in the cultivated area a greater requirement for water and the fall in cap subsidies for this type of crop 4 discussion the evolution in water requirements and changes in cropping patterns described in this paper share similarities with the process described for california by mall and herman 2019 however one major difference between these two regions involves the greater importance of surface water for the grb 25 of spanish irrigated area compared to the essential role of groundwater in the californian case which together with california s extensive water infrastructure supports a thriving agricultural industry with annual revenues exceeding usd 30 billion cooley et al 2015 the evolution of the grb and the consequences for water supply risks are similar to the process described for california by mall and herman 2019 whereby the evolution for the area of perennial type crops the evolution of water productivity and the deterioration of supply risk are features common to the two cases the analysis of our case study has clearly revealed how the combination of technological innovations in irrigation has led to greater efficiency in the use of resources which has been accompanied by an expansion of irrigated area especially the area devoted to crops capable of generating higher levels of gross value added per unit of irrigation i e olives citrus fruit and almonds it should be borne in mind that the general policy of the spanish ministry of agriculture and the guadalquivir river agency is based on limiting the expansion of the irrigated area as clearly established in the last three hydrological plans 2010 2016 and current 2022 and on the subsidisation of water saving investments or irrigation modernisation specifically the current plan states chg 2022 this plan does not allow any entitlement change that implies any increase in the volume of irrigation water and or irrigated area art 18 normative moreover the entitlements of water rights are being reduced by approximately 25 once the modernisation process is finished despite this farmers are free to use their water allocation with the sole restriction of respecting both volume and irrigated area as can be observed a proportion of the farmers have intensified cultivation by substituting herbaceous crops with irrigated perennials our point is that with this intensification the new crop pattern is more water demanding and as farmers cannot exceed allocation the result is a global dominance of regulated deficit irrigation rdi techniques especially in the case of mediterranean crops e g olives almonds citrus fruit the intensification process observed towards higher value crops and the increasing proportion of perennial crops also imply higher risk under drought conditions and extreme events in the river basin which could increase socio economic vulnerability as well as diminish the effectiveness of climate change adaptation strategies escriva bou et al 2017 the average cumulative total gross iwr in the series from 2000 to 2021 are 5344 hm3 according to our study these gross requirements have increased by 15 with respect to the year 2000 which lies within the values contemplated in the study conducted by fader et al 2016 in which the percentage of gross irrigation requirements in mediterranean basins would increase from 4 to 18 with respect to the year 2000 due to climate change alone in this scenario there are several voices that call for a reduction of the irrigated area and the policy to reduce or abandon irrigation is considered a desired solution by certain social groups e g environmental activists in order to analyse the drivers that might explain these crop pattern changes in 2010 a survey was addressed to farmers who implemented water saving technologies irrigation modernisation in the grb their responses are summarised in following table table 5 according to the farmers point of view the main driver of change has been modernisation in the case of perennials followed by agricultural policy and market conditions in the case of herbaceous crops these last two are the predominant drivers going beyond the farmers responses the pull and push factors can be identified in that market forces are driving farmers towards higher value crops since commodities e g cereals industrials have a decreasing lower profitability while other crops especially trees such as almond citrus fruit and olive trees enjoy a competitive advantage and acceptable profitability this change driven by market forces has probably been accelerated by the existence of a modernised water supply that gives farmers higher reliability and flexibility in their irrigation management there is also a point that deserves special mention in our analysis and that is the hypothesis of the rebound effect as an undesirable outcome of irrigation modernisation this effect has been highlighted in several papers such as perry et al 2020 these authors claim that irrigation modernisation and associated water application efficiency has caused increased returns to irrigation which have resulted in the significant augmentation of consumptive use this line of thinking states that investment in irrigation system improvements may cause unexpectedly and unavoidably increased water scarcity in the basin our opinion based on the analytical framework developed by berbel and mateos 2018 is that the rebound effect can be prevented if two conditions are met a strict prohibition of irrigated area expansion and b reduction of the allocation of water rights in order to maintain return flows in the system and prevent appropriation by farmers consequently the etp increases at basin level but since both conditions are enforced by the basin water agency consumption or etp should not increase and the result is that ris as a ratio that measures etp at maximum yield vs water supply has been decreasing in recent decades as shown in table 4 we believe this point to be highly relevant regarding policy decision making and requires further research beyond our case study as also identified in our study the increases devoted to perennials aggravate the administrative closure of the basin demand is greater than available resources and affect the system with the following results a increased water productivity b more inelasticity in irrigation demand and c increased vulnerability of the agricultural system to extreme events such as droughts although most of the drivers pressures and processes are common in other closed basins around the world such as the murray darling basin grafton 2017 and the jordan river basin molle et al 2010 three factors render the grb a distinctive case the cultivation of high value irrigated mediterranean crops a predominance of deficit irrigation and major investment in water saving technologies likewise the greatest problem identified involves the limitation of water availability of the basin to satisfy the water demands or requirements of each crop as estimated in the time series of the study it can be observed that over the last 20 years the irrigation water available in the grb 3300 hm3 year has fallen below the estimated cumulative gross requirements of the crops farmers should adapt to the scarcity by applying deficit irrigation techniques regulated deficit irrigation rdi is generally defined as an irrigation practice whereby a crop is irrigated with an amount of water below the dose required for optimal plant growth by applying water deficits when the stress to the crops exerts the lowest impact in productivity the practice reduces the amount of water employed to irrigate crops and improves the response of plants to a certain degree of water deficit thereby increasing the efficiency of crop water use regulated deficit irrigation is considered a key water saving practice for the efficient use of limited water resources fereres and soriano 2007 the use of rdi as an adaptation to structural water scarcity and drought has been documented for water irrigation associations in grb in the period 2000 2008 garcía vila et al 2008 it is worth noting that the crop response to water stress and consequently the yield losses under rdi depends on the nature of the crops although all instances of water stress reduce yield due to rdi and a minimum survival dose is needed vegetables do not adapt to rdi and the general response of vegetable farmers therefore is to reduce irrigated area if water supply is reduced by type of crop alfalfa has a linear response et lindenmayer et al 2011 and olive crops are the best adapted to water stress although yield may also be reduced expósito berbel 2016 meanwhile citrus and almond trees can support a mild rdi around 20 below maximum yield but yield and tree health can be affected by lower di doses moldero et al 2021 most of the studies reviewed herein show that the main benefit of using rdi is to reduce the amount of irrigation and increase efficiency but that crop yield can be increased maintained or decreased egea et al 2011 ghrab et al 2013 li et al 2014 li et al 2019 this leads us to continue along the line of research towards agroeconomic models that properly integrate the effects of irrigation efficiency into the yield function since oversimplified models that fail to consider the full relationships between irrigation crop and economics can lead to incomplete conclusions berbel and mateos 2014 nevertheless the decrease of ris from 0 70 2000 to 0 56 2021 should be considered as a worrying indicator of system vulnerability although certain crops can adapt to deficit irrigation such as olive trees 50 of irrigated area other crops suffer with reduced water applications thereby endangering profitability and the survival of crops and farms in the case of california mall 2019 argues that farmer vulnerability is associated with increasing perennial crop acreage from 1996 to 2016 ranging up to a projected 30 increase in revenue losses during dry years relative to the historical crop distribution this vulnerability refers to farmer financial losses since water stress may reduce annual income and even produce irreversible fatal damage to the perennials mainly trees in the grb case other perennial crops such as alfalfa are not significant we agree with this point and assume that tree plantations suppose a significant capital investment that can be damaged by severe droughts when even survival irrigation doses cannot be guaranteed by the basin water agency furthermore a reduction in yield may suppose farmer losses as tree plantations usually have higher fixed costs that include both tree maintenance and the financial service of loans employed to initially finance plantations moreover adaptation to climate change will require a water supply guarantee that takes into account greater drought frequency and higher temperatures with the associated increased iwr in this context the guadalquivir water agency defines an emergency survival reserve of 100 hm3 in the latest hydrological plan chg 2022 which is devoted exclusively to trees under an extreme drought scenario understandably the increase in perennial crops compels the water agency to increase this emergency reserve thus imposing a significant constraint to water management in the basin as previously discussed the distribution of the irrigated area in the grb of various crops shows a predominance of perennials trees with rice maize and wheat at 24 alfalfa 1 vegetables 7 and trees mainly olives almonds and citrus at 63 although vulnerability to drought is probably a function of specific crops and their relative prices local and regional institutions for water reallocation e g markets user based reallocation may serve as a tool to prevent losses during drought events however since the share of low value crops is limited at approximately 24 of irrigated area we believe that the margin for farmers to manoeuvre remains very limited nevertheless additional economic analysis in the grb should be conducted to answer the hypothesis that vulnerability to drought is linked to lower ris falling from 0 70 to 0 56 over a two decade period and to an increase of perennials in the basin crop patterns furthermore according to the results of our paper the right balance between current farm profitability and future global water guarantee requires further research the results of this study clearly show how the combination of technological innovations in irrigation has led to greater efficiency in the use of water resources which has been accompanied by an expansion of the irrigated area especially that dedicated to perennial crops capable of generating higher value furthermore the intensification process observed towards higher value crops and the increasing proportion of perennial crops significantly raises agricultural income but simultaneously implies a higher risk in drought conditions or extreme events in the basin which could negatively affect not only socio economic vulnerability but also the effectiveness of adaptation to climate change escriva bou et al 2017 5 conclusions in our opinion the findings of our analysis of crop pattern evolution in the grb and the associated iwr highlight the need for a better design of water and agricultural policies that increase adaptive capacity towards both climate change and increasing water scarcity the increase in iwr beyond the level of water availability driven by increased irrigated area and crop intensification forces farmers to use deficit irrigation techniques these strategies have the advantage of increasing the productivity of irrigation water but also suffer from the disadvantage of an increase in the vulnerability of the system to drought due to the lack of a safety margin this work provides an analysis of the trajectory followed by a mediterranean basin in terms of changes in crop patterns and irrigation requirements covering the last two decades and serves as a complement to studies carried out in similar regions our study coincides not only with the diagnosis of increased resource productivity due to improved efficiency and productive intensification but also in highlighting the risks of implementing a strategy that fails to consider the existence of periodic droughts that characterise the mediterranean climate we believe that further research is needed to identify the characteristics of current processes in mediterranean river basins in order to guarantee the effectiveness of water and climate policies in a context of ever increasing water scarcity and economic

8979,this paper analyses the impacts and water policy implications of an increase of perennial crops on irrigation water requirements and on the vulnerability of the agricultural system to climatic events in the case of the guadalquivir river basin as indicated by the eu water framework directive wfd the characterisation of a river basin requires information on the major economic drivers and pressures at river basin scale guadalquivir river basin southern spain can be considered a representative mediterranean case study that has faced basin closure and continues the trend towards increased crop intensification and greater water use efficiency our result shows an increased vulnerability to drought and water scarcity in the basin due to the expansion of irrigated perennial crops and a decrease of ris relative irrigation supply from 0 70 to 0 56 in the period 2000 2021 thereby forcing farmers to adopt deficit irrigation techniques the potential increase in the frequency of droughts and the growth of irrigation water requirements iwr due to higher temperatures raise the vulnerability of the system to extreme climate events such findings can be employed to support the efficient allocation of water resources in order to improve water policy through its adaptation to increasing risks related to droughts and water scarcity keywords irrigation water requirements basin closure deficit irrigation ris drought vulnerability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction models of climate change predict significant changes in precipitation patterns and increased temperatures which will exacerbate water scarcity in the mediterranean region as well as in other parts of the world giorgi and lionello 2008 iglesias et al 2011a iglesias et al 2011b grasso and feola 2012 iglesias and garrote 2015 average temperatures are due to increase by 1 5 degrees centigrade compared to pre industrial levels according to a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 fader et al 2016 state that in a business as usual scenario this has caused an increase in gross irrigation requirements of between 4 and 18 the mediterranean region is one of the areas most affected by these impacts this area is characterised by its economic dynamism with special emphasis on agricultural activity and high population density which increases over the summer period and this region suffers from severe water resource constraints giorgi and lionello 2008 giannakopoulos et al 2009 garcía ruiz et al 2011 fader et al 2016 although the climatic conditions of the mediterranean area are suitable for the maintenance and survival of a wide range of crops irrigated agriculture has become an essential activity for the maintenance of agricultural yields and the income of its inhabitants daccache et al 2014 irrigated agriculture in the mediterranean represents approximately 30 of cropland and is by far the largest consumer of freshwater in the region at between 70 and 80 of available resources fao 2016 this increased water scarcity in already closed basins defined as those where all their water resources are fully allocated raises the risk of the overexploitation of water resources degrading the quality of the resource and forcing farmers not only to change their cropping patterns but also to implement new techniques that are more efficient in the use of the resource such as the modernisation of systems and the application of deficit irrigation practices pisinaras et al 2010 berahmani et al 2012 several studies recommend the improvement of irrigation efficiency as the most appropriate adaptation strategy to enhance sustainability in water management especially in the mediterranean region daccache et al 2014 fader et al 2016 in spain public and private investments for irrigation modernisation have been substantial in recent decades especially in the southern and eastern part of the country espinosa tasón et al 2020 these investments have sought to save water in the irrigation sector while maximising crop yields maintaining agricultural incomes and increasing the resilience of the sector on the other hand changes in irrigation technology drip irrigation on demand systems have supported an increase both in perennial and high value horticultural crops as an adaptation to both increasing scarcity and decreasing profitability of commodities e g cotton maize in california mall and herman 2019 reveal similar results from their analysis of the risks associated with increasing water scarcity due to the progressive expansion of perennial crops in the case of the california central valley expósito and berbel 2017 2019 analyse the evolution of water productivity in the process of closure of the guadalquivir river basin grb southern spain and conclude that the process of irrigation modernisation together with the expansion of irrigated area and changes in cropping patterns towards perennial crops have created greater pressure on the resources available in the basin in this respect the work of pedraza et al 2012 and that of argüelles et al 2012 have already highlighted the risks associated with changes in irrigated cropping patterns in the guadalquivir basin in the case of australia this same phenomenon has been analysed in various studies loch and adamson 2015 adamson et al 2017 adamson and loch 2018 whereby the increase of efficiency in irrigation systems due to increasing water scarcity can lead to major changes in cropping patterns other studies such as those by chai et al 2014 and chai et al 2015 analyse this issue for the case of china in the case of southern spain the evolution of the grb since year 2000 has witnessed increasing water use efficiency through investments in water saving modernisation this process has been described by expósito and berbel 2019 and berbel et al 2019 who found a significant increase in irrigation water productivity driven by the creation of new irrigated areas dedicated to high value crops mainly perennials olives and citrus fruits and with a predominant use of deficit irrigation strategies using crop yield water and climate models this paper contributes to the existing literature by offering a detailed assessment of changes in cropping patterns and crop productivity at river basin scale our ultimate aim is to discuss the implications for water policy of these changes in cropping patterns since these might compromise the basin capacity to meet irrigation requirements in the future the case of the grb despite sharing certain similarities with other water stressed regions e g california australia shows its own characteristics specifically the results reveal how the combination of technological innovations in irrigation has led to greater efficiency in the use of resources which has been accompanied by an expansion of irrigated area especially the area devoted to crops capable of generating higher levels of gross value added per unit of irrigation i e olives citrus fruit and almonds furthermore this study contributes to the knowledge of the implications of this crop intensification for water policy since the shift to perennial crops has led to a significant change in irrigation requirements thus both implying higher risk under drought conditions and extreme events and increasing the system vulnerability this paper is structured as follows the next section presents the materials used in the work and a brief description of the case study section 3 details the methodology applied section 4 shows the main results followed by a discussion in section 5 finally section 6 summarises the main conclusions of the paper 2 materials and method the case study focuses on the grb located in the southern region of spain fig 1 which supposes approximately 25 of the spanish irrigated area this basin is characterised as having a continental mediterranean climate with hot dry summers cold winters and an average annual rainfall of approximately 590 mm the surface water resources available across the whole basin provide a total of 7540 hm3 year and 1851 hm3 year underground the total water demand in the basin adds up to 3720 48 hm3 year with agricultural use representing 86 of the total demand 3207 hm3 year and 11 from urban demand 404 hm3 year of total demand 76 that is 2845 hm3 year comes from surface water with the origin of the resource distributed as follows regulated 2492 15 hm3 year unregulated 306 hm3 year other minor sources are reused water 34 hm3 year groundwater 840 hm3 year and springs 46 hm3 year chg 2022 since this study aims to quantify the expansion of perennial crops in the grb fig 2 which is characterised by limited natural water availability the water requirements of each crop group are calculated the most representative crops in the basin form the following groups a herbaceous crops rice maize wheat cotton sunflower sugar beet alfalfa tomato potato garlic and greenhouse vegetables b olive trees and vineyards and c fruit trees and others including citrus almond and strawberry the water data set is compiled from 2000 to 2021 and considers hydrological years 1st october to 30th september table a1 in the appendix details the statistical sources for the main variables and parameters used in this study these generally consist of official published data for the cultivated area water withdrawal crop prices and yields although the data has been obtained from various official sources depending on the years available this information has been complemented with published academic and technical reports such as those on intensive and super intensive olive areas official statistics minimised densities from 100 to 1600 trees per ha under the same item and fao parameters have also been employed the method followed to calculate the evolution of crop patterns and water requirements at river basin scale is explained in detail in the section below 2 1 crop pattern estimation crops that are representative of the grb form the object of our study of which 16 crops were finally selected which represent 92 of the cultivated area the official irrigated area of each crop for the time series was given for the period 1989 2018 although high quality data is also available for the period 2001 2021 see table a1 in the appendix for source details to complete the series of years extrapolation has been carried out and finally the crops have been grouped into 2 weighted categories herbaceous and perennial based on the percentages of surface area of each crop 2 2 water requirement estimation this study uses the crop coefficient method developed by allen et al 1998 based on the calculation of crop evapotranspiration etc precipitation p and reference evapotranspiration eto for the annual series 2000 2021 have been used as the main variables and crop coefficients kc and useful or effective rainfall pe are needed to calculate crop evapotranspiration etc the net irrigation water requirements hereinafter iwr have been estimated monthly by using the single crop coefficient method in the fao 56 manual and applying a simple water balance this coefficient is adapted to the crop phenology of the area and as far as possible local crop coefficients available from various studies are also employed the crop evapotranspiration et c eq 1 under the assumption that the crop does not suffer from water stress is therefore 1 et c et o k c where eto is the reference evapotranspiration whose calculation can be carried out following the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 and k c is the crop coefficient in this case the reference evapotranspiration has been extracted from the daily historical records of eight meteorological stations located across the grb included in the andalusian agroclimatic information network the mean monthly reference evapotranspiration eto of the 2000 2021 series is greater in the summer months and reaches a maximum in july of 226 mm and a minimum in december of 37 mm with an annual eto mean of 1413 mm crop coefficients applicable in different parts of the world are widely available for this work the values compiled in chapter 6 of fao handbook 56 allen et al 1998 have been taken as a reference and have been replaced by values from recent studies carried out in the area where possible for perennial crops and for olive groves in addition to k c a coverage factor k r has been used which is applicable when coverage falls below 50 depending on the percentage of ground cover s c average crown diameter in metres ø and planting density in trees per hectare d 2 k r 2 s c 100 3 s c π 2 d 400 the net requirements of a crop can be defined as the amount of water that would undergo evapotranspiration if there were no limitations on its availability therefore only the maximum potential consumption per cultivated area is considered the calculation of net requirements is performed by a simple water balance of monthly water outflows minus inflows first the monthly crop evapotranspiration et c month is calculated additionally the monthly effective precipitation p e is calculated using usda scs united states dept of agriculture soil conservation service scs 1993 the main variable for the calculation of the effective or useful precipitation is the monthly precipitation p t calculated from the annual series 2000 2021 daily records of the average of 8 meteorological stations whereby two stations lie in each of the 4 provinces that are within the territory of the grb baza and loja granada huesa and úbeda jaén córdoba and hornachuelos córdoba la rinconada and lebrija seville the winter months experience a concentration of more than 50 of the total average annual rainfall while the summers remain very dry the average rainfall of the 2000 2021 series in our study is 479 mm per year fig 3 the estimation of the irrigation requirement involves quantification of the water accumulated in the soil during the previous months to carry out the balance to this end the amount of water available in a generic soil has been estimated based on its retention capacity and the depth of the roots of each crop the soil retention capacity as determined by fao 56 m3 m3 has been chosen uniformly for all crops at 0 16 which represents a loam soil the depth of the roots depends on the crop under analysis and range from 0 30 m for strawberry to 2 00 m for alfalfa for each crop the soil storage capacity mm is calculated as the product of the root depth and retention capacity variables the following application efficiency values were used for this study localised irrigation drip 0 90 sprinkler irrigation 0 80 and surface irrigation 0 60 daccache ciurana et al 2014 according to the current grb hydrological plan chg 2022 conduction and distribution efficiency reaches 95 this results in water conveyance gross losses of 5 these gross losses are due to the extraction of the water released from the reservoir for this reason the efficiency of the system is calculated as the result of the overall efficiency considering both the conduction and distribution losses olive grove parameters are taken from the study by orgaz et al 1999 which was carried out in andalusia with which irrigation requirements were initially calculated in a similar way to the remaining crops for the traditional planting frame of 8 8 m 80 120 trees ha and the super intensive planting of 4 1 5 m 1667 trees ha for all other crops except alfalfa and strawberry the values of kc evolution and crop phenology have been taken from chapter 6 of the fao 56 manual table 1 shows the information necessary for the application of the method chosen in our study 3 results the results of this study focus on showing the long term evolution of changing cropping patterns and are complemented by an analysis of the evolution of crop water requirements iwr and their economic impact at basin level 3 1 change in cropping patterns in the period 1989 2018 there was a profound change in the predominant crops in our case study in addition to a highly significant increase in the area irrigated as fig 4 shows in said period there was a change from a predominance of herbaceous crops to a cropping pattern with a predominance of perennial crops especially with olive groves and other fruit trees such as citrus and almond trees herbaceous crops increased from 211 288 ha 1989 to 313 095 ha 2018 and perennials increased from 104 450 ha to 543 334 ha the greater share of perennials has significant consequences for the sustainability of the use of water resources in the grb fig 5 shows the percentages of crop area broken down into three groups herbaceous olive and other perennials herbaceous crops decrease from 67 1989 to 37 of total irrigated area 2018 while perennials on the other hand increase to 63 2018 compared to 33 1989 with olive groves constituting a total of 52 of the total irrigated area thereby accounting for 82 of perennials the increase in the irrigated area can be accredited to various factors including the conversion of rainfed perennials mainly olive groves into irrigated land for olive groves an internal change from irrigated herbaceous to irrigated perennials and the massive conversion of rainfed herbaceous to irrigated perennials consequently irrigated perennials have significantly increased their presence in the basin in terms of cultivated area an increase of 60 though the total cultivated area in the basin has decreased in the last two decades 5 4 see table 2 3 2 crop water requirements crop iwr are estimated as explained in the previous sections for each of the 16 representative crops in our case study this method calculates the net iwr which can be converted into gross iwr by applying the efficiency of the system of water use due to the shift towards perennial crops basin iwr have increased in recent years as shown in fig 6a this shows a positive trend with different points fluctuating according to the variable rainfall and evapotranspiration with high levels of net water requirements exceeding 5000 hm3 in hydrological periods in which extreme droughts have predominated such as the 2004 2005 period with rainfall below 250 mm and the 2011 2012 period with barely 300 mm of rainfall this has exerted an impact throughout the basin since it has limited the availability of water for irrigation and forced the more efficient management of irrigation systems irrigation systems have increased their efficiency thereby reducing losses in the use of the resource and partially compensating the increase in net iwr this is due to the significant effort in modernising irrigation systems whereby low levels of technology with gravity irrigation systems have been replaced with systems with a greater use of the resource such as drip irrigation systems thereby making the grb stand out for its high level of technology with percentages of over 75 for drip systems across the entire irrigation surface area table 3 as previously mentioned in order to calculate the efficiency of the system at basin level table 3 losses of 5 due to conduction and distribution in the irrigation systems have been considered chg 2022 gross iwr are equivalent to the quotient between net iwr and overall irrigation efficiency these values are calculated as described in the previous sections as can be observed in fig 5b the cumulative gross crop requirements for the entire irrigated area exceed the normal yearly water rights in the grb with an average value of 3300 hm3 for the period 2000 2021 these results show the situation of closure in which the basin finds itself due to the lack of water to meet the water requirements of crops in a context of a decrease in herbaceous crops and an increase in perennial crops with a predominance of olive groves there is also a slight upward trend in the increase in net iwr at basin level determined by the change in productive orientation and irrigated surface area especially regarding olive groves this context is particularly serious in those years of drought in which drought protocols are applied with a reduction in the endowments which can range from 50 drought protocol applied in years 2006 2007 2008 and 2020 to 18 in the 21 22 campaign this predominance of perennials increases the vulnerability of the basin in periods of water scarcity it also implies a higher financial risk in the case of water supply failure in comparison with the previous context where the largest share constituted irrigated herbaceous crops that can be transformed into rainfed herbaceous crops in the case of drought without long term losses as is the case of perennials especially for trees non adapted to stress e g intensive olives almonds citrus peaches and other fruit trees this increasing vulnerability can be identified in the trend lines shown in fig 6 for total gross iwr which have a slightly positive slope and for net iwr the table below summarises the evolution of the main variables as shown in table 4 it can be observed how global basin irrigation abstraction rights have decreased since 2009 due to the application of the european water framework directive wfd unfortunately net iwr potential evapotranspiration etp useful rainfall continue to grow throughout the period due to the increase in irrigated area and to the conversion from herbaceous to perennial crops with an increase of 29 in 2000 2018 as mentioned above irrigation efficiency increases during the period thereby partially compensating for the increment in net iwr from 0 68 to 0 77 while gross iwr grow at an annual rate that accumulates 15 2018 vs 2001 since iwr exceed availability the irrigation system applies deficit irrigation as a response with a relative irrigation supply ris decreasing from 0 70 to 0 56 at the end of the period it is worth bearing in mind that we are assuming that irrigation abstractions are close to water rights although in normal years water abstractions are usually slightly below water rights since some land is under transformation or simply not 100 of the irrigation quota is used if initial 2000 2002 and final 2018 2020 periods are compared we observe that average abstraction drops from 3372 hm3 to 3202 hm3 efficiency increases from 68 up to 77 and estimated return flows fall from 1079 hm3 to 737 hm3 32 reduction and therefore net consumption abstraction minus return flows has increased from 2293 hm3 to 2466 hm3 7 increase in these last two decades the evolution in cropping patterns observed in the grb has also triggered economic effects i e crop income that help in the understanding of these changes for this purpose a simple economic analysis has been carried out based on agricultural yields and prices extracted from the agricultural statistics yearbook of the andalusian government junta de andalucía for each of the years of the period analysed 2000 2020 and the moving average of the last 3 years has been employed to smooth out conjunctural changes with respect to production the average of the last 5 years has been utilised the results are shown in fig 7 which illustrates a clear difference in total income for the two groups of irrigated crops across the whole basin herbaceous crops obtain an average total income of 292 million euros while for perennial crops this figure amounts to an average total of 731 million euros whereby 30 of the total income of the last 20 years is from herbaceous crops and 70 from perennial crops two marked turning points can be observed which coincide with the years of extreme drought in the year 2004 2005 there was a rising trend in income from perennial crops which can be explained by the increase in prices that occurred during this period of drought with low yields in 2011 2012 with the second extreme drought income from herbaceous crops fell significantly due to the decrease in the cultivated area a greater requirement for water and the fall in cap subsidies for this type of crop 4 discussion the evolution in water requirements and changes in cropping patterns described in this paper share similarities with the process described for california by mall and herman 2019 however one major difference between these two regions involves the greater importance of surface water for the grb 25 of spanish irrigated area compared to the essential role of groundwater in the californian case which together with california s extensive water infrastructure supports a thriving agricultural industry with annual revenues exceeding usd 30 billion cooley et al 2015 the evolution of the grb and the consequences for water supply risks are similar to the process described for california by mall and herman 2019 whereby the evolution for the area of perennial type crops the evolution of water productivity and the deterioration of supply risk are features common to the two cases the analysis of our case study has clearly revealed how the combination of technological innovations in irrigation has led to greater efficiency in the use of resources which has been accompanied by an expansion of irrigated area especially the area devoted to crops capable of generating higher levels of gross value added per unit of irrigation i e olives citrus fruit and almonds it should be borne in mind that the general policy of the spanish ministry of agriculture and the guadalquivir river agency is based on limiting the expansion of the irrigated area as clearly established in the last three hydrological plans 2010 2016 and current 2022 and on the subsidisation of water saving investments or irrigation modernisation specifically the current plan states chg 2022 this plan does not allow any entitlement change that implies any increase in the volume of irrigation water and or irrigated area art 18 normative moreover the entitlements of water rights are being reduced by approximately 25 once the modernisation process is finished despite this farmers are free to use their water allocation with the sole restriction of respecting both volume and irrigated area as can be observed a proportion of the farmers have intensified cultivation by substituting herbaceous crops with irrigated perennials our point is that with this intensification the new crop pattern is more water demanding and as farmers cannot exceed allocation the result is a global dominance of regulated deficit irrigation rdi techniques especially in the case of mediterranean crops e g olives almonds citrus fruit the intensification process observed towards higher value crops and the increasing proportion of perennial crops also imply higher risk under drought conditions and extreme events in the river basin which could increase socio economic vulnerability as well as diminish the effectiveness of climate change adaptation strategies escriva bou et al 2017 the average cumulative total gross iwr in the series from 2000 to 2021 are 5344 hm3 according to our study these gross requirements have increased by 15 with respect to the year 2000 which lies within the values contemplated in the study conducted by fader et al 2016 in which the percentage of gross irrigation requirements in mediterranean basins would increase from 4 to 18 with respect to the year 2000 due to climate change alone in this scenario there are several voices that call for a reduction of the irrigated area and the policy to reduce or abandon irrigation is considered a desired solution by certain social groups e g environmental activists in order to analyse the drivers that might explain these crop pattern changes in 2010 a survey was addressed to farmers who implemented water saving technologies irrigation modernisation in the grb their responses are summarised in following table table 5 according to the farmers point of view the main driver of change has been modernisation in the case of perennials followed by agricultural policy and market conditions in the case of herbaceous crops these last two are the predominant drivers going beyond the farmers responses the pull and push factors can be identified in that market forces are driving farmers towards higher value crops since commodities e g cereals industrials have a decreasing lower profitability while other crops especially trees such as almond citrus fruit and olive trees enjoy a competitive advantage and acceptable profitability this change driven by market forces has probably been accelerated by the existence of a modernised water supply that gives farmers higher reliability and flexibility in their irrigation management there is also a point that deserves special mention in our analysis and that is the hypothesis of the rebound effect as an undesirable outcome of irrigation modernisation this effect has been highlighted in several papers such as perry et al 2020 these authors claim that irrigation modernisation and associated water application efficiency has caused increased returns to irrigation which have resulted in the significant augmentation of consumptive use this line of thinking states that investment in irrigation system improvements may cause unexpectedly and unavoidably increased water scarcity in the basin our opinion based on the analytical framework developed by berbel and mateos 2018 is that the rebound effect can be prevented if two conditions are met a strict prohibition of irrigated area expansion and b reduction of the allocation of water rights in order to maintain return flows in the system and prevent appropriation by farmers consequently the etp increases at basin level but since both conditions are enforced by the basin water agency consumption or etp should not increase and the result is that ris as a ratio that measures etp at maximum yield vs water supply has been decreasing in recent decades as shown in table 4 we believe this point to be highly relevant regarding policy decision making and requires further research beyond our case study as also identified in our study the increases devoted to perennials aggravate the administrative closure of the basin demand is greater than available resources and affect the system with the following results a increased water productivity b more inelasticity in irrigation demand and c increased vulnerability of the agricultural system to extreme events such as droughts although most of the drivers pressures and processes are common in other closed basins around the world such as the murray darling basin grafton 2017 and the jordan river basin molle et al 2010 three factors render the grb a distinctive case the cultivation of high value irrigated mediterranean crops a predominance of deficit irrigation and major investment in water saving technologies likewise the greatest problem identified involves the limitation of water availability of the basin to satisfy the water demands or requirements of each crop as estimated in the time series of the study it can be observed that over the last 20 years the irrigation water available in the grb 3300 hm3 year has fallen below the estimated cumulative gross requirements of the crops farmers should adapt to the scarcity by applying deficit irrigation techniques regulated deficit irrigation rdi is generally defined as an irrigation practice whereby a crop is irrigated with an amount of water below the dose required for optimal plant growth by applying water deficits when the stress to the crops exerts the lowest impact in productivity the practice reduces the amount of water employed to irrigate crops and improves the response of plants to a certain degree of water deficit thereby increasing the efficiency of crop water use regulated deficit irrigation is considered a key water saving practice for the efficient use of limited water resources fereres and soriano 2007 the use of rdi as an adaptation to structural water scarcity and drought has been documented for water irrigation associations in grb in the period 2000 2008 garcía vila et al 2008 it is worth noting that the crop response to water stress and consequently the yield losses under rdi depends on the nature of the crops although all instances of water stress reduce yield due to rdi and a minimum survival dose is needed vegetables do not adapt to rdi and the general response of vegetable farmers therefore is to reduce irrigated area if water supply is reduced by type of crop alfalfa has a linear response et lindenmayer et al 2011 and olive crops are the best adapted to water stress although yield may also be reduced expósito berbel 2016 meanwhile citrus and almond trees can support a mild rdi around 20 below maximum yield but yield and tree health can be affected by lower di doses moldero et al 2021 most of the studies reviewed herein show that the main benefit of using rdi is to reduce the amount of irrigation and increase efficiency but that crop yield can be increased maintained or decreased egea et al 2011 ghrab et al 2013 li et al 2014 li et al 2019 this leads us to continue along the line of research towards agroeconomic models that properly integrate the effects of irrigation efficiency into the yield function since oversimplified models that fail to consider the full relationships between irrigation crop and economics can lead to incomplete conclusions berbel and mateos 2014 nevertheless the decrease of ris from 0 70 2000 to 0 56 2021 should be considered as a worrying indicator of system vulnerability although certain crops can adapt to deficit irrigation such as olive trees 50 of irrigated area other crops suffer with reduced water applications thereby endangering profitability and the survival of crops and farms in the case of california mall 2019 argues that farmer vulnerability is associated with increasing perennial crop acreage from 1996 to 2016 ranging up to a projected 30 increase in revenue losses during dry years relative to the historical crop distribution this vulnerability refers to farmer financial losses since water stress may reduce annual income and even produce irreversible fatal damage to the perennials mainly trees in the grb case other perennial crops such as alfalfa are not significant we agree with this point and assume that tree plantations suppose a significant capital investment that can be damaged by severe droughts when even survival irrigation doses cannot be guaranteed by the basin water agency furthermore a reduction in yield may suppose farmer losses as tree plantations usually have higher fixed costs that include both tree maintenance and the financial service of loans employed to initially finance plantations moreover adaptation to climate change will require a water supply guarantee that takes into account greater drought frequency and higher temperatures with the associated increased iwr in this context the guadalquivir water agency defines an emergency survival reserve of 100 hm3 in the latest hydrological plan chg 2022 which is devoted exclusively to trees under an extreme drought scenario understandably the increase in perennial crops compels the water agency to increase this emergency reserve thus imposing a significant constraint to water management in the basin as previously discussed the distribution of the irrigated area in the grb of various crops shows a predominance of perennials trees with rice maize and wheat at 24 alfalfa 1 vegetables 7 and trees mainly olives almonds and citrus at 63 although vulnerability to drought is probably a function of specific crops and their relative prices local and regional institutions for water reallocation e g markets user based reallocation may serve as a tool to prevent losses during drought events however since the share of low value crops is limited at approximately 24 of irrigated area we believe that the margin for farmers to manoeuvre remains very limited nevertheless additional economic analysis in the grb should be conducted to answer the hypothesis that vulnerability to drought is linked to lower ris falling from 0 70 to 0 56 over a two decade period and to an increase of perennials in the basin crop patterns furthermore according to the results of our paper the right balance between current farm profitability and future global water guarantee requires further research the results of this study clearly show how the combination of technological innovations in irrigation has led to greater efficiency in the use of water resources which has been accompanied by an expansion of the irrigated area especially that dedicated to perennial crops capable of generating higher value furthermore the intensification process observed towards higher value crops and the increasing proportion of perennial crops significantly raises agricultural income but simultaneously implies a higher risk in drought conditions or extreme events in the basin which could negatively affect not only socio economic vulnerability but also the effectiveness of adaptation to climate change escriva bou et al 2017 5 conclusions in our opinion the findings of our analysis of crop pattern evolution in the grb and the associated iwr highlight the need for a better design of water and agricultural policies that increase adaptive capacity towards both climate change and increasing water scarcity the increase in iwr beyond the level of water availability driven by increased irrigated area and crop intensification forces farmers to use deficit irrigation techniques these strategies have the advantage of increasing the productivity of irrigation water but also suffer from the disadvantage of an increase in the vulnerability of the system to drought due to the lack of a safety margin this work provides an analysis of the trajectory followed by a mediterranean basin in terms of changes in crop patterns and irrigation requirements covering the last two decades and serves as a complement to studies carried out in similar regions our study coincides not only with the diagnosis of increased resource productivity due to improved efficiency and productive intensification but also in highlighting the risks of implementing a strategy that fails to consider the existence of periodic droughts that characterise the mediterranean climate we believe that further research is needed to identify the characteristics of current processes in mediterranean river basins in order to guarantee the effectiveness of water and climate policies in a context of ever increasing water scarcity and economic
