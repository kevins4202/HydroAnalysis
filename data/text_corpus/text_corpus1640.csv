8200,study region southwest coastal region of bangladesh study focus deep groundwater in the southern ganges brahmaputra meghna delta the coastal region of bangladesh is partially salty whereas the drivers behind this salinity are not well understood in this study we explored the origin and evolutionary processes of the salinization in deep groundwater by analyzing geochemistry and environmental isotopes paleogeography and sedimentation processes new hydrological insights for the region the deep groundwater in the paleo channel area exhibited higher salinity and lighter stable isotopes of water while that in the paleo interfluve area lower salinity and heavier stable isotopes based on the cl br molar ratios the seawater and the coastal rainwater were surmised to be the ultimate source of the observed deep groundwater salinity evolution of the deep groundwater salinity can be explained by the paleogeography and associated paleo and recent processes the brackish estuarine water formed in the paleo channels during the postglacial transgression was possibly intruded into the fresh deep groundwater due to the density contrast the brackish deep groundwater in the paleo channel area was subsequently mixed with the fresh groundwater in the paleo interfluve area through lateral flow driven by both anthropogenic municipal pumping and natural processes these new insights about the occurrence and distribution of the fresh and the brackish deep groundwater can facilitate the management of potable water supply in the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta or other similar regions keywords deep groundwater coastal bangladesh paleogeography postglacial transgression brackish water pumping 1 introduction groundwater is a major freshwater resource for drinking and irrigation purposes in the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm delta of bangladesh where more than 160 million people live nowadays knappett et al 2016 mahmud et al 2017 in the southern part of the gbm delta the shallow groundwater excels with higher arsenic concentrations often exceeding drinking water limit edmunds et al 2015 mainuddin et al 2014 and ranges from brackish to saline condition ayers et al 2016 bahar and reza 2010 bwdb 2013 islam et al 2017 naus et al 2019 worland et al 2015 this situation alongside with the surface water salinity and pollution benneyworth et al 2016 kibria et al 2016 rahman et al 2000 has negatively affected the security of freshwater supply the access to safe potable water with low arsenic content and satisfactory salinity level requires the exploitation of the deep groundwater deeper than 150 m bgl that is physically separated from shallow groundwater by aquitards at least in the southern part of the gbm delta dphe apsu jica 2006 lapworth et al 2018 mahmud et al 2017 more than 345 000 deep community wells were installed across the country by 2011 knappett et al 2016 more than 100 high yield deep wells of 2500 m3 day capacity have been constructed for rural water supply and more than 20 municipal wells of 4500 m3 day capacity have been made in the khulna city for urban water supply adb 2011 burgess et al 2010 lged 2005 shamsudduha et al 2019 however in some places in this region the deep groundwater is known to be brackish or saline adb 2011 bwdb 2013 halim et al 2010 hoque and burgess 2012 islam et al 2019 lged 2005 rahman et al 2011 ravenscroft et

include entrapment of connate seawater or paleo brackish water in a geologic formation these conditions are often perturbed by natural and anthropogenic phenomena such as mixing of groundwater in different aquifers salinization from rivers through surface water groundwater interaction and direct seawater intrusion de montety et al 2008 kooi et al 2000 larsen et al 2017 mikita et al 2011 tran

through surface water groundwater interaction mainly occur within unconfined shallow aquifers de montety et al 2008 however the salinization processes can be more complex in confined aquifers like the deep aquifers in the southern deltaic coastal regions of bangladesh where the aquifers are separated by thick aquitards from overlying shallow aquifers dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 according to the geochemical studies in the gbm delta of bangladesh deep groundwater salinity is interpreted to originate from the present day seawater bwdb 2013 datta et al 2020 halim et al 2010 majumder et al

rahman et al 2011 however evolutionary processes of deep groundwater salinity should be understood based on the knowledge of geochemistry and spatio temporal dynamics of the area from paleogeography and sedimentation processes perspectives the latter is essential as active sedimentation was evidenced in the area that had been strongly affected by the sea level fluctuations hoque et al 2014 ravenscroft et al 2018 to this end our study aims to explore the origin and evolutionary processes of the high salinity deep groundwater in the southwestern coastal bangladesh by analyzing hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes paleogeography sedimentation and delta building processes and also anthropogenic interventions this study will provide a better hydrogeological insight of the origin extent and processes of brackish saline deep groundwater which is essential for the sustainable use of this precious resource 2 study area 2 1 location and general features the study area is located in the southwestern coastal region of bangladesh fig 1 the climate in the area is dominated by the southwest monsoon the monthly average rainfall and evapotranspiration vary from 4 to 339 mm and from 75 to 158 mm respectively while the annual averages are 1796 mm and 1348 mm respectively mainuddin et al 2014 about 80 of the annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season june to october scarce rainfall and a large scale reduction of fluvial discharge from the upstream of the ganges river during the dry season november to may result in the water level drop of the tidal rivers in this region it also enhances the landward migration of seawater along the rivers by 160 170 km from the coast bhuiyan and dutta 2012 rahman et al 2000 zaman et al 2017 from paleogeography perspective the study area features two buried landscapes paleo interfluve and paleo channel fig 1 they were formed by weathering and valley incision through the period of the last glacial lowstands 117 18 ka bp when the sea level had gradually lowered and reached to the lowest level at the last glacial maximum bgs and dphe 2001 hoque et al 2012 2014 the estimated coastline at the time of the last marine incursion ca 7 ka bp grall et al 2018 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 crosses the northern part of the study area 2 2 geology and stratigraphy we compiled the data from 3 946 boreholes in bangladesh figures s1 to s4 and table s1 and constructed three schematic cross sections by taking into account the interpretation by hoque et al 2014 and other published information chamberlain et al 2020 goodbred and kuehl 2000 umitsu 1987 1993 two schematic cross sections were constructed from the northwest to the southeast being perpendicular to the paleo shoreline at ca 7 ka bp fig 2 a and b and another one was constructed from the southwest to the northeast being parallel to the paleo shoreline fig 2c among the two northwest to southeast schematic cross sections one was created along the paleo interfluve fig 2a while the second one was made along the paleo channel fig 2b the approximate locations of the cross sections are shown in fig 1 see also fig s1 the schematic cross sections shown in fig 2 are substantially simplified with regards to the prevailing complex lithological characteristics of the study area figures s2 and s3 additional information about the lithological characteristics and schematic cross sections can be found in the supplementary material fluvio deltaic sediments typically thicken from north to south and surficial clay silt layers are omnipresent over the region fig 2a and b sand facies dominate in the north whereas facies in the south exhibit frequent interfingering of clay silt with sand and the thickness of clay silt varies from few to more than 100 m dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 the paleo interfluve surface was exposed during the last glacial maximum and was heavily weathered and oxidized during a long term period then a red clay paleosol was developed overlying the oxidized brown sands as seen from fig 2a and c hoque et al 2014 mcarthur et al 2008 hoque et al 2014 reported that the thickness of the paleosol ranges from 0 5 to 5 m while the thickness of the brown sands from 4 6 to 55 m near the northern flank of the study area the paleo interfluve surface is underlain by plio pleistocene sediments and is overlain by postglacial sediments hoque et al 2014 postglacial sands are finer grained while plio pleistocene sands are coarse grained bgs and dphe 2001 ravenscroft and mcarthur 2004 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 in the southern part of the study area clay silt layers are present within the sand facies separating upper pleistocene sands from lower plio pleistocene sands bgs and dphe 2001 hoque et al 2014 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 thickness of this clay silt layer generally increases toward the south while the layer is thin or even absent in some areas in the north clay silt layers are also found in some areas within the deeper plio pleistocene sands bgs and dphe 2001 dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 along the paleo channel fig 2b thick channel fill sediments are observed grall et al 2018 during the last glacial maximum sea level was decreased down to around 135 m below the present day sea level and the river incision reached its base level acharyya et al 2000 grall et al 2018 hoque et al 2014 rashid et al 2011 ravenscroft et al 2018 at this glacial maxima the major rivers flowed along the incised channels and basal sand and gravel beds were deposited within the channels which were overlain by sediments deposited during the postglacial transgression as shown in fig 2b acharyya et al 2000 goodbred and kuehl 2000 grall et al 2018 islam and tooley 1999 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 umitsu 1985 1987 1993 the clay silt layers are sparsely distributed below the incised paleo channel surface stratigraphic characteristics of both paleo interfluve and paleo channels are shown in fig 2c 2 3 hydrogeology and aquifer characteristics plio pleistocene and holocene sands are the main aquifers in the study area aquifers in the north are mainly coarse grained single to double layered systems in the south they transform to finer grained multi layered systems ravenscroft et al 2018 as seen from fig 2a and b fig 2 also illustrates that the deep aquifers are formed within plio pleistocene sands whereas shallow aquifers within pleistocene to holocene sands the isolation of the deep aquifers from the shallow ones is manifested in the south in the form of the laterally continuous clay silt aquitards with variable thickness while such isolation does not exist in the north as seen from fig 2a and b adb 2011 dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 it is clear that subsurface confining unit at around 150 m bgl is thick in the paleo interfluve areas whereas it is relatively thin in the paleo channel areas fig 2c the paleosol along the paleo interfluve areas separates the shallow aquifer into two the upper and the lower shallow aquifers fig 2a and c reported hydraulic conductivities vary in 4 63 10 6 to 5 52 10 4 m s and in 3 47 10 5 to 2 82 10 4 m s range in the deep and the shallow aquifers respectively bwdb 2013 in this area the natural groundwater flow is directed from the northwest to the southeast with low hydraulic gradients 1 10 5 m m indicating a slow groundwater movement adb 2011 bgs and dphe 2001 majumder et al 2011 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling water samples were collected from 166 deep and 81 shallow groundwater wells in november 2016 september 2017 june 2018 and july 2018 deep groundwater wells comprised production wells and hand pumped wells the shallow groundwater wells were only hand pumped wells the locations of the wells are shown in fig 1 screen depths vary from 155 476 m bgl for the deep groundwater wells and 15 146 m bgl for the shallow groundwater wells ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using the ph conductivity meter d 54 horiba the water samples were then collected in 30 50 ml polyethylene bottles for the analyses of alkalinity dissolved components sio2 cl and br and stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in addition a total of 24 water samples from 6 deep groundwater 284 296 m bgl and 6 shallow groundwater 32 64 m bgl wells in the khulna city were collected in 1000 ml polyethylene bottles for the analyses of 3h and 14c the production wells were tested and sampled under continuous pumping conditions whereas hand pumped wells were tested and sampled after manually purging the well water for the field parameters ph and ec to show the stable values it should be noted that the hand pumped wells were daily used and the measured ph and ec values became stable within rather short period of time all samples were kept without a preservative except 14c samples that were preserved with naoh to prevent dissolved inorganic carbon from degassing as co2 3 2 water sample analysis concentrations of alkalinity and dissolved components sio2 cl and br were measured in the university of tokyo measurements of stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h were conducted in the university of tokyo and the university of tsukuba radiogenic isotopes were analyzed at the geo science laboratory co ltd nagoya japan 3h and at the beta analytic inc u s a 14c alkalinity was measured by acid titration methods and converted into hco3 concentrations sio2 was measured using the silicomolybdate method with a colorimeter apha 2017 cl and br were measured by the ion chromatographs using ionpac as18 column with the dionex integrion hpic thermo scientific u s a and using as12a column with the dionex dx 120 thermo scientific u s a also δ18o and δ2h were measured by tunable wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds l2130 i and l1102 i picarro inc santa clara ca u s a and the measurement errors were 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δ2h respectively larsen et al 2017 yamanaka and ma 2017 3h concentrations were measured by a liquid scintillation counter lsc lb5 aloka after electrolytic enrichment and results were reported in tritium units tu with the approximate detection limit of 0 3 tu radiocarbon 14c measurements were performed using graphite targets by a tandem accelerator mass spectrometer ams the results are present as percent modern carbon pmc with the measurement errors of 0 1 pmc 3 3 multivariate analyses the obtained data were statistically examined by hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis and principal component factor analysis using the statistical software minitab 19 www minitab com the dataset was based on the 247 groundwater samples and yielded seven parameters ph ec cl hco3 sio2 δ18o and δ2h ec values and cl concentrations were log transformed to minimize the effects of large variations to reduce the outlier effects and ultimately to improve the results qian et al 2007 templ et al 2008 standardization was applied to each variable in the dataset prior to the multivariate analyses to calculate a zero mean and unit variance andrade and stigter 2011 cloutier et al 2008 ghesquière et al 2015 for the hierarchical cluster analysis the ward s linkage method was used as an amalgamation algorithm and the manhattan distance as similarity measurement nogueira et al 2019 strauss and von maltitz 2017 the principal component analysis and the factor analysis were applied to identify the important factors responsible for the variation of the groundwater clusters güler et al 2012 thyne et al 2004 the principal component analysis was performed using a correlation matrix to identify principal components that are linear combinations of the observed variables tanasković et al 2012 in the factor analysis principal components method of extraction and varimax rotation were applied to identify latent factors that cannot be directly measured or observed güler et al 2012 suk and lee 1999 to determine the number of principal components or factors to be extracted the kaiser criterion the cattell scree plot and the explained variance criterion were used güler et al 2012 4 results 4 1 general characteristics of hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes the analyses of groundwater samples were interpreted and depicted in fig 3 for the detailed data refer to the dataset s1 from rahman et al 2021 the deep groundwater samples generally showed higher ph values and were more enriched with heavy stable water isotopes than the shallow groundwater samples meanwhile the deep groundwater samples had lower concentrations of cl hco3 and sio2 than the shallow groundwater samples 14c concentrations ranged from 7 9 17 5 pmc in the deep groundwater and 35 7 82 4 pmc in the shallow groundwater respectively dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 these results are consistent with the previous studies in the gbm delta of bangladesh aggarwal et al 2000 hoque and burgess 2012 majumder et al 2011 mihajlov et al 2016 all the measured 3h activities were found to be below detection limit 0 3 tu dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 resonating with the data by majumder et al 2011 and naus et al 2019 the deep groundwater samples in the paleo channel and the paleo interfluve areas exhibited clear differences in geochemical and stable isotopic compositions fig 4 the deep groundwater samples in the paleo channel area were higher in cl lower in ph and lighter in stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h than those in the paleo interfluve area hco3 and sio2 concentrations were nearly similar between the paleo interfluve and the paleo channel areas meanwhile we did not evidence any contrast in the shallow groundwater samples between the paleo channel and the paleo interfluve areas figure s5 in supplementary material 4 2 multivariate analyses 4 2 1 hierarchical clustering analysis in total seven clusters c 1 to c 7 were retrieved fig 5 the number of groundwater samples in each cluster is shown in fig 6 note that c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 mainly contained the deep groundwater samples 98 98 94 and 84 respectively whereas c 7 was heavily prevailed by the shallow groundwater samples 94 meanwhile c 5 and c 6 were the clusters with the shallow groundwater samples twice the amount 68 and 64 respectively of the deep groundwater ones 32 and 36 respectively the geochemical and isotopic variabilities among the clusters are shown in fig 7 the deep groundwater dominated the clusters from c 1 to c 4 they contained lower salinity ec and cl and sio2 but higher ph and heavier stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h than c 6 and c 7 almost similar hco3 concentrations were observed in c 1 to c 6 which were lower than those in c 7 among the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 exhibited lower values of ec and lower concentrations of cl br and sio2 which were followed by c 2 c 3 and c 4 the opposite pattern was observed in ph and stable isotope compositions among these clusters distinct spatial patterns can be inferred from the deep groundwater dominated clusters fig 8 in particular c 1 and c 2 were mostly distributed within the paleo interfluve area c 1 was located in the interior parts of the paleo interfluve c 2 was at the eastern flank meanwhile c 3 and c 4 were mostly distributed within the paleo channel and at the interface between paleo interfluve and paleo channel areas note that the majority of c 3 was located in the south compared with c 4 other clusters c 5 to c 7 did not reveal any significant spatial patterns fig 8 4 2 2 principal component and factor analyses two principal components obtained from the multivariate analysis explained around 78 of the variance and were considered to be reasonable selection of number of components based on kaiser s criterion and scree plot thyne et al 2004 figure s6 and table s2 in supplementary material then factor analysis was performed and two principal factors were selected table 1 the first factor explained ca 45 of the variance and was associated with positive loadings of sio2 and hco3 and negative loadings of stable isotopes and ph the second factor accounted for ca 33 of the variance and ec and cl had strong negative loadings while ph and stable isotopes had weak positive loadings the cross plots between two major factors are shown in fig 9 the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 were mostly plotted on the negative side of the first factor whereas a shallow groundwater dominated cluster c 7 and a mixed groundwater cluster c 6 were plotted on the positive side the groundwater samples in c 5 were plotted between the deep groundwater and the shallow groundwater dominated clusters in fig 9 three clusters c 1 c 2 and c 5 were mostly plotted on the positive side whereas c 3 c 4 and c 6 were plotted on the negative side along the axis of the second factor y axis of the figure meanwhile the c 7 samples were distributed in both positive and negative sides 5 discussion 5 1 seawater coastal rainwater as an ultimate source of salinity the cross plots between δ 18o and δ 2h of groundwater samples are shown in fig 10 this figure also indicates the local meteoric water lines based on the nearby three gnip stations fig 1 a line connecting the river water data in the rupsha bhairab mayur river systems fig 1b and standard seawater most groundwater data fell on or very close to the local meteoric water lines while some samples in the mixed c 5 and c 6 and the shallow groundwater dominated c 7 clusters were plotted closer to the river water seawater line suggesting that both deep and shallow groundwater samples generally stemmed from local precipitation seemingly affected by the river water and the seawater in some of the shallow groundwater the present day meteoric water and or river water is unlikely a source of groundwater because 3h activities were below the detection limit 0 3 tu dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 were heavier in isotopic composition whereas the shallow groundwater dominated cluster c 7 was lighter see fig 7 g and 7 h for details these distribution patterns and the different 14c activities between the deep groundwater 7 9 17 5 pmc and the shallow groundwater 35 7 82 4 pmc dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 indicated that the deep groundwater and the shallow groundwater were recharged in different times among the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 and c 2 were plotted in relatively heavier portion whereas c 3 and c 4 in relatively lighter portion figs 7 and 10 note that the salinity was found in the ascending order for c 1 then for c 2 c 3 whereas c 4 exhibited the highest salinity fig 7 this is an opposite trend compared with the simple freshwater seawater mixing where stable isotope values become heavier as salinity increases wang and jiao 2012 indicating that existence of the deep groundwater salinity cannot be simply explained by the mixing between fresh groundwater and seawater at the same time nearly all the groundwater clusters fell along the seawater line in the cross plot between cl concentrations and cl br molar ratios fig 11 suggesting that the seawater or the coastal rainwater or both could be the ultimate source of salinity 5 2 paleogeography and possible evolution sequence of deep groundwater salinity to discuss how the deep groundwater salinity has evolved in the study area the cross plots between cl and δ 18o were made fig 12 in overall a decreasing trend of δ 18o with the increase of cl in the deep groundwater dominated clusters was observed by comparing the plotted clusters of c 1 through c 4 since c 1 and c 2 were located in the paleo interfluve area and c 3 and c 4 in the paleo channel area fig 8 evolution of the fresh and the brackish deep groundwater can be explained by the paleogeography and associated paleo processes at the time of the last glacial maximum paleogeography was characterized with the existence of paleo interfluve and the deeply incised paleo channels hoque et al 2014 mcarthur et al 2008 fig 2c in the study area one could expect that the groundwater should mainly flow from north or northwest to south or southeast forming fresh deep groundwater c 1 beneath both the paleo interfluve and the paleo channel areas fig 13 sea level started to rise rapidly at around 15 ka bp goodbred and kuehl 2000 ravenscroft et al 2005 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 during the postglacial transgression the paleo valleys were started to be filled with sediments and became estuary conditions hoque et al 2012 mcarthur et al 2008 ravenscroft et al 2018 fig 14 b during the transgression c 3 was first formed in the study area by the mixing of brackish estuarine water with the fresh groundwater supposedly by vertical infiltration driven by the gravitational processes fig 14b during this stage δ18o values in paleo precipitation were lighter compared to those during the last glacial maximum as inferred from the variations of δ 18o in the mawmluh cave carbonate as shown in fig 15 berkelhammer et al 2012 dutt et al 2015 the isotopic variations in the cave carbonate may suggest that the similar changes of the stable isotopic characteristics occurred in riverine discharge we found that δ 18o values in the cave carbonate exerted a progressive depletion after the last glacial maximum from around 15 ka bp fig 15 also δ18o values and salinity of surface water in the bay of bengal exhibited similar decreasing trends associated with the increase of riverine flux by precipitation and meltwater runoff from the higher mountains dutt et al 2015 govil and divakar naidu 2011 raza et al 2014 rostek et al 1993 sijinkumar et al 2016 possible brackish end member water in estuarine condition with slightly lighter stable isotopic characteristics can be seemingly explained by the mixing between stable isotopically lighter freshwater and seawater as c 4 is located in the north and is slightly shallower see figure s7 in the supplementary material younger brackish water with lighter stable isotopes could be a possible end member to form brackish c 4 the evolution of salinity in c 2 is possibly associated with the mixing between c 1 and c 3 c 4 caused by pumping induced effects and natural processes in the khulna city the deep groundwater has been heavily exploited by high capacity municipal production wells since the 1970s resulted in the formation of a cone of depression within the urban area bwdb 2013 lged 2005 fig 16 the hydraulic gradient formed by the pumping activities has caused the possible advective transport of saline groundwater toward the paleo interfluve area most of the c 2 samples are located between the c 1 and the c 3 c 4 dominated areas and within the cone of depression pointing to possible existence of pumping induced effects 5 3 alternative hypotheses conceptual models of mixing we are aware about the remained uncertainties in the paleogeographic interpretation of deep groundwater salinity in particular our 3h and 14c data were obtained only from the paleo interfluve area while the data from the paleo channel area were absent also the estimated isotopic compositions in paleo precipitation and paleo river water included large uncertainties as they were inferred from the cave carbonate the alternative possible interpretations for explaining our data and results are shown in the section below these hypotheses open the window for a further discussion and more detailed analyses that can strengthen the current findings hypothesis 1 the first hypothesis is proposed as following we suggest that the shallow and the deep groundwater has been mixed or are being mixed nowadays figs 7 10 and 12 indicate that the clusters c 2 c 3 and c 4 could originate from the mixing between c 1 and c 6 c 7 this does not explain 14c data collected from the khulna city i e the distinct values between the shallow 35 7 82 4 pmc and the deep groundwater 7 9 17 5 pmc samples however we showed that a low permeability layer between shallow and deep aquifers is thin or even absent in numerous borehole logs in the eastern paleo channel area thus these stratigraphic characteristics may permit the connection between the shallow and the deep groundwater in the paleo channel area khan et al 2019 we underline that further analyses of 3h and 14c in the paleo channel areas and examination of spatial distribution of the confining layer between the shallow and the deep aquifers are needed hypothesis 2 the remnant of paleo seawater can still exist in the deep groundwater in some areas below the paleo interfluve and can mix with the fresh groundwater in the deep aquifer the cl δ18o plots of c 1 and c 2 fig 12 possibly unravel mixing processes between the fresh groundwater c 1 and the seawater moreover the c 2 samples exhibited the lowest 14c concentration among the measurements in this study therefore a source of salinity in c 2 could be the remnant of paleo seawater invaded into deep groundwater hypothesis 3 we suggest another hypothesis that the deep groundwater salinization is somehow physically linked to transpiration the increase of cl concentration without corresponding substantial isotopic enrichment in deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 to c 3 see fig 12 could emerge due to either dissolution of halite or transpiration iaea 1981 cl br molar ratios fig 11 did not support halite formation and dissolution because all the deep groundwater dominated clusters fell along the seawater line lee et al 2016 nogueira et al 2019 while transpiration by halophytic coastal vegetation could have increased the salinity without modifying stable isotopic characteristics of water lee et al 2016 nogueira et al 2019 it should be noted that halophytic vegetation i e mangroves had supposedly grown in the study area during the postglacial transgression and the high stand conditions acharyya et al 2000 goodbred and kuehl 2000 islam and tooley 1999 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 umitsu 1987 1993 in any case further field surveys and groundwater analyses are necessary to support or to refute the hypotheses that can fully explain the salinization processes in the area 6 conclusions geochemical and isotopic compositions of both deep groundwater and shallow groundwater were investigated to constrain sources and processes of the deep groundwater salinity in the southwestern deltaic coastal region of bangladesh the deep groundwater generally exhibited lower values of salinity ec and cl hco3 sio2 and 14c while higher values of ph and heavier stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h than those in shallow groundwater the deep groundwater below the paleo interfluve was characterized by lower salinity ec and cl higher ph and heavier stable isotopes of water compared with those below the paleo channel we used the hierarchical cluster analysis to classify the majority of deep groundwater samples into four clusters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 the c 1 samples are mostly distributed in the paleo interfluve area whereas the c 3 and the c 4 samples are mostly located in the paleo channel area c 2 is located between c 1 and c 3 c 4 clusters we surmised that the salinity in the deep groundwater has evolved from paleo brackish estuarine water during a transgression after the last glacial maximum brackish estuarine river water formed in the paleo channel area was forced into fresh deep groundwater being possibly driven by the water density contrast the brackish deep groundwater in the paleo channel area was subsequently mixed with the fresh deep groundwater in the paleo interfluve area through lateral flow driven by both anthropogenic municipal pumping and natural processes as a result slightly brackish deep groundwater has been established three independent hypotheses explaining the salinization of the deep groundwater were also suggested further analyses and field surveys can check the validity of our hypotheses and therefore represent a next step to pursue our findings provided new insights into the present day distributions of fresh and brackish deep groundwater and for the management of the potable water supply in the region the paleogeographic controls of deep groundwater characteristics brackish water in the paleo channel area and fresh water in the paleo interfluve area should be extensively studied over the coastal region of bangladesh together with the recent anthropogenic interventions the knowledge about deep groundwater characteristics in the region will help determining optimal locations for well construction and reaching long term stable freshwater supply this will facilitate water supply management environmental

8200,study region southwest coastal region of bangladesh study focus deep groundwater in the southern ganges brahmaputra meghna delta the coastal region of bangladesh is partially salty whereas the drivers behind this salinity are not well understood in this study we explored the origin and evolutionary processes of the salinization in deep groundwater by analyzing geochemistry and environmental isotopes paleogeography and sedimentation processes new hydrological insights for the region the deep groundwater in the paleo channel area exhibited higher salinity and lighter stable isotopes of water while that in the paleo interfluve area lower salinity and heavier stable isotopes based on the cl br molar ratios the seawater and the coastal rainwater were surmised to be the ultimate source of the observed deep groundwater salinity evolution of the deep groundwater salinity can be explained by the paleogeography and associated paleo and recent processes the brackish estuarine water formed in the paleo channels during the postglacial transgression was possibly intruded into the fresh deep groundwater due to the density contrast the brackish deep groundwater in the paleo channel area was subsequently mixed with the fresh groundwater in the paleo interfluve area through lateral flow driven by both anthropogenic municipal pumping and natural processes these new insights about the occurrence and distribution of the fresh and the brackish deep groundwater can facilitate the management of potable water supply in the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta or other similar regions keywords deep groundwater coastal bangladesh paleogeography postglacial transgression brackish water pumping 1 introduction groundwater is a major freshwater resource for drinking and irrigation purposes in the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm delta of bangladesh where more than 160 million people live nowadays knappett et al 2016 mahmud et al 2017 in the southern part of the gbm delta the shallow groundwater excels with higher arsenic concentrations often exceeding drinking water limit edmunds et al 2015 mainuddin et al 2014 and ranges from brackish to saline condition ayers et al 2016 bahar and reza 2010 bwdb 2013 islam et al 2017 naus et al 2019 worland et al 2015 this situation alongside with the surface water salinity and pollution benneyworth et al 2016 kibria et al 2016 rahman et al 2000 has negatively affected the security of freshwater supply the access to safe potable water with low arsenic content and satisfactory salinity level requires the exploitation of the deep groundwater deeper than 150 m bgl that is physically separated from shallow groundwater by aquitards at least in the southern part of the gbm delta dphe apsu jica 2006 lapworth et al 2018 mahmud et al

water supply and more than 20 municipal wells of 4500 m3 day capacity have been made in the khulna city for urban water supply adb 2011 burgess et al 2010 lged 2005 shamsudduha et al 2019 however in some places in this region the deep groundwater is known to be brackish or saline adb 2011 bwdb 2013 halim et al 2010 hoque and burgess 2012 islam et al 2019 lged 2005 rahman et al 2011 ravenscroft et

include entrapment of connate seawater or paleo brackish water in a geologic formation these conditions are often perturbed by natural and anthropogenic phenomena such as mixing of groundwater in

through surface water groundwater interaction mainly occur within unconfined shallow aquifers de montety et al 2008 however the salinization processes can be more complex in confined aquifers like the deep aquifers in the southern deltaic coastal regions of bangladesh where the aquifers are separated by thick aquitards from overlying shallow aquifers dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 according to the geochemical studies in the gbm delta of bangladesh deep groundwater salinity is interpreted to originate from the present day seawater bwdb 2013 datta et al 2020 halim et al 2010 majumder et al

rahman et al 2011 however evolutionary processes of deep groundwater salinity should be understood based on the knowledge of geochemistry and spatio temporal dynamics of the area from paleogeography and sedimentation processes perspectives the latter is essential as active sedimentation was evidenced in the area that had been strongly affected by the sea level fluctuations hoque et al 2014 ravenscroft et al 2018 to this end our study aims to explore the origin and evolutionary processes of the high salinity deep groundwater in the southwestern coastal bangladesh by analyzing hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes paleogeography sedimentation and delta building processes and also anthropogenic interventions this study will provide a better hydrogeological insight of the origin extent and processes of brackish saline deep groundwater which is essential for the sustainable use of this precious resource 2 study area 2 1 location and general features the study area is located in the southwestern coastal region of bangladesh fig 1 the climate in the area is dominated by the southwest monsoon the monthly average rainfall and evapotranspiration vary from 4 to 339 mm and from 75 to 158 mm respectively while the annual averages are 1796 mm and 1348 mm respectively mainuddin et al 2014 about 80 of the annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season june to october scarce rainfall and a large scale reduction of fluvial discharge from the upstream of the ganges river during the dry season november to may result in the water level drop of the tidal rivers in this region it also enhances the landward migration of seawater along the rivers by 160 170 km from the coast bhuiyan and dutta 2012 rahman et al 2000 zaman et al 2017 from paleogeography perspective the study area features two buried landscapes paleo interfluve and paleo channel fig 1 they were formed by weathering and valley incision through the period of the last glacial lowstands 117 18 ka bp when the sea level had gradually lowered and reached to the lowest level at the last glacial maximum bgs and dphe 2001 hoque et al 2012 2014 the estimated coastline at the time of the last marine incursion ca 7 ka bp grall et al 2018 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 crosses the northern part of the study area 2 2 geology and stratigraphy we compiled the data from 3 946 boreholes in bangladesh figures s1 to s4 and table s1 and constructed three schematic cross sections by taking into account the interpretation by hoque et al 2014 and other published information chamberlain et al 2020 goodbred and kuehl 2000 umitsu 1987 1993 two schematic cross sections were constructed from the northwest to the southeast being perpendicular to the paleo shoreline at ca 7 ka bp fig 2 a and b and another one was constructed from the southwest to the northeast being parallel to the paleo shoreline fig 2c among the two northwest to southeast schematic cross sections one was created along the paleo interfluve fig 2a while the second one was made along the paleo channel fig 2b the approximate locations of the cross sections are shown in fig 1 see also fig s1 the schematic cross sections shown in fig 2 are substantially simplified with regards to the prevailing complex lithological characteristics of the study area figures s2 and s3 additional information about the lithological characteristics and schematic cross sections can be found in the supplementary material fluvio deltaic sediments typically thicken from north to south and surficial clay silt layers are omnipresent over the region fig 2a and b sand facies dominate in the north whereas facies in the south exhibit frequent interfingering of clay silt with sand and the thickness of clay silt varies from few to more than 100 m dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 the paleo interfluve surface was exposed during the last glacial maximum and was heavily weathered and oxidized during a long term period then a red clay paleosol was developed overlying the oxidized brown sands as seen from fig 2a and c hoque et al 2014 mcarthur et al 2008 hoque et al 2014 reported that the thickness of the paleosol ranges from 0 5 to 5 m while the thickness of the brown sands from 4 6 to 55 m near the northern flank of the study area the paleo interfluve surface is underlain by plio pleistocene sediments and is overlain by postglacial sediments hoque et al 2014 postglacial sands are finer grained while plio pleistocene sands are coarse grained bgs and dphe 2001 ravenscroft and mcarthur 2004 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 in the southern part of the study area clay silt layers are present within the sand facies separating upper pleistocene sands from lower plio pleistocene sands bgs and dphe 2001 hoque et al 2014 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 thickness of this clay silt layer generally increases toward the south while the layer is thin or even absent in some areas in the north clay silt layers are also found in some areas within the deeper plio pleistocene sands bgs and dphe 2001 dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 along the paleo channel fig 2b thick channel fill sediments are observed grall et al 2018 during the last glacial maximum sea level was decreased down to around 135 m below the present day sea level and the river incision reached its base level acharyya et al 2000 grall et al 2018 hoque et al 2014 rashid et al 2011 ravenscroft et al 2018 at this glacial maxima the major rivers flowed along the incised channels and basal sand and gravel beds were deposited within the channels which were overlain by sediments deposited during the postglacial transgression as shown in fig 2b acharyya et al 2000 goodbred and kuehl 2000 grall et al 2018 islam and tooley 1999 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 umitsu 1985 1987 1993 the clay silt layers are sparsely distributed below the incised paleo channel surface stratigraphic characteristics of both paleo interfluve and paleo channels are shown in fig 2c 2 3 hydrogeology and aquifer characteristics plio pleistocene and holocene sands are the main aquifers in the study area aquifers in the north are mainly coarse grained single to double layered systems in the south they transform to finer grained multi layered systems ravenscroft et al 2018 as seen from fig 2a and b fig 2 also illustrates that the deep aquifers are formed within plio pleistocene sands whereas shallow aquifers within pleistocene to holocene sands the isolation of the deep aquifers from the shallow ones is manifested in the south in the form of the laterally continuous clay silt aquitards with variable thickness while such isolation does not exist in the north as seen from fig 2a and b adb 2011 dphe apsu jica 2006 mahmud et al 2017 it is clear that subsurface confining unit at around 150 m bgl is thick in the paleo interfluve areas whereas it is relatively thin in the paleo channel areas fig 2c the paleosol along the paleo interfluve areas separates the shallow aquifer into two the upper and the lower shallow aquifers fig 2a and c reported hydraulic conductivities vary in 4 63 10 6 to 5 52 10 4 m s and in 3 47 10 5 to 2 82 10 4 m s range in the deep and the shallow aquifers respectively bwdb 2013 in this area the natural groundwater flow is directed from the northwest to the southeast with low hydraulic gradients 1 10 5 m m indicating a slow groundwater movement adb 2011 bgs and dphe 2001 majumder et al 2011 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling water samples were collected from 166 deep and 81 shallow groundwater wells in november 2016 september 2017 june 2018 and july 2018 deep groundwater wells comprised production wells and hand pumped wells the shallow groundwater wells were only hand pumped wells the locations of the wells are shown in fig 1 screen depths vary from 155 476 m bgl for the deep groundwater wells and 15 146 m bgl for the shallow groundwater wells ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using the ph conductivity meter d 54 horiba the water samples were then collected in 30 50 ml polyethylene bottles for the analyses of alkalinity dissolved components sio2 cl and br and stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in addition a total of 24 water samples from 6 deep groundwater 284 296 m bgl and 6 shallow groundwater 32 64 m bgl wells in the khulna city were collected in 1000 ml polyethylene bottles for the analyses of 3h and 14c the production wells were tested and sampled under continuous pumping conditions whereas hand pumped wells were tested and sampled after manually purging the well water for the field parameters ph and ec to show the stable values it should be noted that the hand pumped wells were daily used and the measured ph and ec values became stable within rather short period of time all samples were kept without a preservative except 14c samples that were preserved with naoh to prevent dissolved inorganic carbon from degassing as co2 3 2 water sample analysis concentrations of alkalinity and dissolved components sio2 cl and br were measured in the university of tokyo measurements of stable isotopes

percent modern carbon pmc with the measurement errors of 0 1 pmc 3 3 multivariate analyses the obtained data were statistically examined by hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis and principal component factor analysis using the statistical software minitab 19 www minitab com the dataset was based on the 247 groundwater samples and yielded seven parameters ph ec cl hco3 sio2 δ18o and δ2h ec values and cl concentrations were log transformed to minimize the effects of large variations to reduce the outlier effects and ultimately to improve the results qian et al 2007 templ et al 2008 standardization was applied to each variable in the dataset prior to the multivariate analyses to calculate a zero mean and unit variance andrade and stigter 2011 cloutier et al 2008 ghesquière et al 2015 for the hierarchical cluster analysis the ward s linkage method was used as an amalgamation algorithm and the manhattan distance as similarity measurement nogueira et al 2019 strauss and von maltitz 2017 the principal component analysis and the factor analysis were applied to identify the important factors responsible for the variation of the groundwater clusters güler et al 2012 thyne et al 2004 the principal component analysis was performed using a correlation matrix to identify principal components that are linear combinations of the observed variables tanasković et al 2012 in the factor analysis principal components method of extraction and varimax rotation were applied to identify latent factors that cannot be directly measured or observed güler et al 2012 suk and lee 1999 to determine the number of principal components or factors to be extracted the kaiser criterion the cattell scree plot and the explained variance criterion were used güler et al 2012 4 results 4 1 general characteristics of hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes the analyses of groundwater samples were interpreted and depicted in fig 3 for the detailed data refer to the dataset s1 from rahman et al 2021 the deep groundwater samples generally showed higher ph values and were more enriched with heavy stable water isotopes than the shallow groundwater samples meanwhile the deep groundwater samples had lower concentrations of cl hco3 and sio2 than the shallow groundwater samples 14c concentrations ranged from 7 9 17 5 pmc in the deep groundwater and 35 7 82 4 pmc in the shallow groundwater respectively dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 these results are consistent with the previous studies in the gbm delta of bangladesh aggarwal et al 2000 hoque and burgess 2012 majumder et al 2011 mihajlov et al 2016 all the measured 3h activities were found to be below detection limit 0 3 tu dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 resonating with the data by majumder et al 2011 and naus et al 2019 the deep groundwater samples in the paleo channel and the paleo interfluve areas exhibited clear differences in geochemical and stable isotopic compositions fig 4 the deep groundwater samples in the paleo channel area were higher in cl lower in ph and lighter in stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h than those in the paleo interfluve area hco3 and sio2 concentrations were nearly similar between the paleo interfluve and the paleo channel areas meanwhile we did not evidence any contrast in the shallow groundwater samples between the paleo channel and the paleo interfluve areas figure s5 in supplementary material 4 2 multivariate analyses 4 2 1 hierarchical clustering analysis in total seven clusters c 1 to c 7 were retrieved fig 5 the number of groundwater samples in each cluster is shown in fig 6 note that c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 mainly contained the deep groundwater samples 98 98 94 and 84 respectively whereas c 7 was heavily prevailed by the shallow groundwater samples 94 meanwhile c 5 and c 6 were the clusters with the shallow groundwater samples twice the amount 68 and 64 respectively of the deep groundwater ones 32 and 36 respectively the geochemical and isotopic variabilities among the clusters are shown in fig 7 the deep groundwater dominated the clusters from c 1 to c 4 they contained lower salinity ec and cl and sio2 but higher ph and heavier stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h than c 6 and c 7 almost similar hco3 concentrations were observed in c 1 to c 6 which were lower than those in c 7 among the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 exhibited lower values of ec and lower concentrations of cl br and sio2 which were followed by c 2 c 3 and c 4 the opposite pattern was observed in ph and stable isotope compositions among these clusters distinct spatial patterns can be inferred from the deep groundwater dominated clusters fig 8 in particular c 1 and c 2 were mostly distributed within the paleo interfluve area c 1 was located in the interior parts of the paleo interfluve c 2 was at the eastern flank meanwhile c 3 and c 4 were mostly distributed within the paleo channel and at the interface between paleo interfluve and paleo channel areas note that the majority of c 3 was located in the south compared with c 4 other clusters c 5 to c 7 did not reveal any significant spatial patterns fig 8 4 2 2 principal component and factor analyses two principal components obtained from the multivariate analysis explained around 78 of the variance and were considered to be reasonable selection of number of components based on kaiser s criterion and scree plot thyne et al 2004 figure s6 and table s2 in supplementary material then factor analysis was performed and two principal factors were selected table 1 the first factor explained ca 45 of the variance and was associated with positive loadings of sio2 and hco3 and negative loadings of stable isotopes and ph the second factor accounted for ca 33 of the variance and ec and cl had strong negative loadings while ph and stable isotopes had weak positive loadings the cross plots between two major factors are shown in fig 9 the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 were mostly plotted on the negative side of the first factor whereas a shallow groundwater dominated cluster c 7 and a mixed groundwater cluster c 6 were plotted on the positive side the groundwater samples in c 5 were plotted between the deep groundwater and the shallow groundwater dominated clusters in fig 9 three clusters c 1 c 2 and c 5 were mostly plotted on the positive side whereas c 3 c 4 and c 6 were plotted on the negative side along the axis of the second factor y axis of the figure meanwhile the c 7 samples were distributed in both positive and negative sides 5 discussion 5 1 seawater coastal rainwater as an ultimate source of salinity the cross plots between δ 18o and δ 2h of groundwater samples are shown in fig 10 this figure also indicates the local meteoric water lines based on the nearby three gnip stations fig 1 a line connecting the river water data in the rupsha bhairab mayur river systems fig 1b and standard seawater most groundwater data fell on or very close to the local meteoric water lines while some samples in the mixed c 5 and c 6 and the shallow groundwater dominated c 7 clusters were plotted closer to the river water seawater line suggesting that both deep and shallow groundwater samples generally stemmed from local precipitation seemingly affected by the river water and the seawater in some of the shallow groundwater the present day meteoric water and or river water is unlikely a source of groundwater because 3h activities were below the detection limit 0 3 tu dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 were heavier in isotopic composition whereas the shallow groundwater dominated cluster c 7 was lighter see fig 7 g and 7 h for details these distribution patterns and the different 14c activities between the deep groundwater 7 9 17 5 pmc and the shallow groundwater 35 7 82 4 pmc dataset s1 rahman et al 2021 indicated that the deep groundwater and the shallow groundwater were recharged in different times among the deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 and c 2 were plotted in relatively heavier portion whereas c 3 and c 4 in relatively lighter portion figs 7 and 10 note that the salinity was found in the ascending order for c 1 then for c 2 c 3 whereas c 4 exhibited the highest salinity fig 7 this is an opposite trend compared with the simple freshwater seawater mixing where stable isotope values become heavier as salinity increases wang and jiao 2012 indicating that existence of the deep groundwater salinity cannot be simply explained by the mixing between fresh groundwater and seawater at the same time nearly all the groundwater clusters fell along the seawater line in the cross plot between cl concentrations and cl br molar ratios fig 11 suggesting that the seawater or the coastal rainwater or both could be the ultimate source of salinity 5 2 paleogeography and possible evolution sequence of deep groundwater salinity to discuss how the deep groundwater salinity has evolved in the study area the cross plots between cl and δ 18o were made fig 12 in overall a decreasing trend of δ 18o with the increase of cl in the deep groundwater dominated clusters was observed by comparing the plotted clusters of c 1 through c 4 since c 1 and c 2 were located in the paleo interfluve area and c 3 and c 4 in the paleo channel area fig 8 evolution of the fresh and the brackish deep groundwater can be explained by the paleogeography and associated paleo processes at the time of the last glacial maximum paleogeography was characterized with the existence of paleo interfluve and the deeply incised paleo channels hoque et al 2014 mcarthur et al 2008 fig 2c in the study area one could expect that the groundwater should mainly flow from north or northwest to south or southeast forming fresh deep groundwater c 1 beneath both the paleo interfluve and the paleo channel areas fig 13 sea level started to rise rapidly at around 15 ka bp goodbred and kuehl 2000 ravenscroft et al 2005 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 during the postglacial transgression the paleo valleys were started to be filled with sediments and became estuary conditions hoque et al 2012 mcarthur et al 2008 ravenscroft et al 2018 fig 14 b during the transgression c 3 was first formed in the study area by the mixing of brackish estuarine water with the fresh groundwater supposedly by vertical infiltration driven by the gravitational processes fig 14b during this stage δ18o values in paleo precipitation were lighter compared to those during the last glacial maximum as inferred from the variations of δ 18o in the mawmluh cave carbonate as shown in fig 15 berkelhammer et al 2012 dutt et al 2015 the isotopic variations in the cave carbonate may suggest that the similar changes of the stable isotopic characteristics occurred in riverine discharge we found that δ 18o values in the cave carbonate exerted a progressive depletion after the last glacial maximum from around 15 ka bp fig 15 also δ18o values and salinity of surface water in the bay of bengal exhibited similar decreasing trends associated with the increase of riverine flux by precipitation and meltwater runoff from the higher mountains dutt et al 2015 govil and divakar naidu 2011 raza et al 2014 rostek et al 1993 sijinkumar et al 2016 possible brackish end member water in estuarine condition with slightly lighter stable isotopic characteristics can be seemingly explained by the mixing between stable isotopically lighter freshwater and seawater as c 4 is located in the north and is slightly shallower see figure s7 in the supplementary material younger brackish water with lighter stable isotopes could be a possible end member to form brackish c 4 the evolution of salinity in c 2 is possibly associated with the mixing between c 1 and c 3 c 4 caused by pumping induced effects and natural processes in the khulna city the deep groundwater has been heavily exploited by high capacity municipal production wells since the 1970s resulted in the formation of a cone of depression within the urban area bwdb 2013 lged 2005 fig 16 the hydraulic gradient formed by the pumping activities has caused the possible advective transport of saline groundwater toward the paleo interfluve area most of the c 2 samples are located between the c 1 and the c 3 c 4 dominated areas and within the cone of depression pointing to possible existence of pumping induced effects 5 3 alternative hypotheses conceptual models of mixing we are aware about the remained uncertainties in the paleogeographic interpretation of deep groundwater salinity in particular our 3h and 14c data were obtained only from the paleo interfluve area while the data from the paleo channel area were absent also the estimated isotopic compositions in paleo precipitation and paleo river water included large uncertainties as they were inferred from the cave carbonate the alternative possible interpretations for explaining our data and results are shown in the section below these hypotheses open the window for a further discussion and more detailed analyses that can strengthen the current findings hypothesis 1 the first hypothesis is proposed as following we suggest that the shallow and the deep groundwater has been mixed or are being mixed nowadays figs 7 10 and 12 indicate that the clusters c 2 c 3 and c 4 could originate from the mixing between c 1 and c 6 c 7 this does not explain 14c data collected from the khulna city i e the distinct values between the shallow 35 7 82 4 pmc and the deep groundwater 7 9 17 5 pmc samples however we showed that a low permeability layer between shallow and deep aquifers is thin or even absent in numerous borehole logs in the eastern paleo channel area thus these stratigraphic characteristics may permit the connection between the shallow and the deep groundwater in the paleo channel area khan et al 2019 we underline that further analyses of 3h and 14c in the paleo channel areas and examination of spatial distribution of the confining layer between the shallow and the deep aquifers are needed hypothesis 2 the remnant of paleo seawater can still exist in the deep groundwater in some areas below the paleo interfluve and can mix with the fresh groundwater in the deep aquifer the cl δ18o plots of c 1 and c 2 fig 12 possibly unravel mixing processes between the fresh groundwater c 1 and the seawater moreover the c 2 samples exhibited the lowest 14c concentration among the measurements in this study therefore a source of salinity in c 2 could be the remnant of paleo seawater invaded into deep groundwater hypothesis 3 we suggest another hypothesis that the deep groundwater salinization is somehow physically linked to transpiration the increase of cl concentration without corresponding substantial isotopic enrichment in deep groundwater dominated clusters c 1 to c 3 see fig 12 could emerge due to either dissolution of halite or transpiration iaea 1981 cl br molar ratios fig 11 did not support halite formation and dissolution because all the deep groundwater dominated clusters fell along the seawater line lee et al 2016 nogueira et al 2019 while transpiration by halophytic coastal vegetation could have increased the salinity without modifying stable isotopic characteristics of water lee et al 2016 nogueira et al 2019 it should be noted that halophytic vegetation i e mangroves had supposedly grown in the study area during the postglacial transgression and the high stand conditions acharyya et al 2000 goodbred and kuehl 2000 islam and tooley 1999 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 umitsu 1987 1993 in any case further field surveys and groundwater analyses are necessary to support or to refute the hypotheses that can fully explain the salinization processes in the area 6 conclusions geochemical and isotopic compositions of both deep groundwater and shallow groundwater were investigated to constrain sources and processes of the deep groundwater salinity in the southwestern deltaic coastal region of bangladesh the deep groundwater generally exhibited lower values of salinity ec and cl hco3 sio2 and 14c while higher values of ph and heavier stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h than those in shallow groundwater the deep groundwater below the paleo interfluve was characterized by lower salinity ec and cl higher ph and heavier stable isotopes of water compared with those below the paleo channel we used the hierarchical cluster analysis to classify the majority of deep groundwater samples into four clusters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 the c 1 samples are mostly distributed in the paleo interfluve area whereas the c 3 and the c 4 samples are mostly located in the paleo channel area c 2 is located between c 1 and c 3 c 4 clusters we surmised that the salinity in the deep groundwater has evolved from paleo brackish estuarine water during a transgression after the last glacial maximum brackish estuarine river water formed in the paleo channel area was forced into fresh deep groundwater being possibly driven by the water density contrast the brackish deep groundwater in the paleo channel area was subsequently mixed with the fresh deep groundwater in the paleo interfluve area through lateral flow driven by both anthropogenic municipal pumping and natural processes as a result slightly brackish deep groundwater has been established three independent hypotheses explaining the salinization of the deep groundwater were also suggested further analyses and field surveys can check the validity of our hypotheses and therefore represent a next step to pursue our findings provided new insights into the present day distributions of fresh and brackish deep groundwater and for the management of the potable water supply in the region the paleogeographic controls of deep groundwater characteristics brackish water in the paleo channel area and fresh water in the paleo interfluve area should be extensively studied over the coastal region of bangladesh together with the recent anthropogenic interventions the knowledge about deep groundwater characteristics in the region will help determining optimal locations for well construction and reaching long term stable freshwater supply this will facilitate water supply management environmental

8201,study region the great rift valley lakes of kenya have recently experienced significant increases in their water levels negatively impacting the local communities this has provoked renewed concerns about the causations with various geological anthropogenic and hydro climatic influences hypothesized as potential causes of the water level rises study focus this study analyses and documents water level fluctuations in lakes baringo bogoria nakuru solai elementaita and naivasha hydrometeorological analyses are undertaken to understand potential causes and lake volume data is used to derive the integrated catchment response icr a magnitude which allows to relate changes in water balance components to signals observed in the lake volume changes new hydrological insights for the region compared to 1984 2009 the recent increases in lake areas range from 21 for lake naivasha to an extraordinary 123 for lake solai mean annual rainfall for 2010 2020 increased by up to 30 actual evapotranspiration also increased but to lesser extent compared to rainfall the results illustrate that changes in catchment properties due to anthropogenic influences or changes in underground permeability are not necessary to explain the lake level rises based on the icr only surprisingly minor changes in the water balance are necessary to explain the lake level rises since an increase of only 0 4 2 of mean annual effective rainfall leads to the observed phenomena keywords rift valley lakes lake level rises kenya rainfall evapotranspiration 1 introduction water resource systems across the globe are today being affected by a number of natural and anthropogenic factors gownaris et al 2018 jenny et al 2020 salmaso et al 2020 changes in climatic and land use conditions increased water demand from a growing human population and depletion of groundwater resources remain issues of key concern amongst water managers du preez and van huyssteen 2020 fishman 2018 flörke et al 2018 in sub saharan africa water resource systems are essential to local economies through supply of water for domestic and agricultural utilities fishery recreation and promotion of local tourism aura et al 2020 cowx and ogutu owhayo 2019 minale 2020 in eastern africa the rift valley lakes provide eco regions of great biodiversity considered today amongst the global200 freshwater ecoregions of the world fouchy et al 2018 olson and dinerstein 2002 however the rift valley lakes have witnessed upsurges in their lake water levels areas and volumes affecting not only the rich biodiversity but also the infrastructure and livelihoods of the local communities living within vicinity the situation has been aggravated more recently considering the continued above average rainfall being observed in the long rainy season wainwright et al 2020 lake turkana the largest permanent desert lake in the world has also shown substantial increases in water levels thereby affecting the local communities ojwang et al 2016 these trends of lake turkana generally contradict the forecasted negative impacts of the ongoing water resources projects being carried along the omo river in ethiopia which is considered the main water source for the lake avery and tebbs 2018 generally eastern africa has shown substantial variability of its climate in the distant to the near past where distinct wet and dry periods have been witnessed conway 2002 demenocal and rind 2019 nicholson 2019 sutcliffe and parks 1999 wainwright et al 2020 this led not only to drastic changes in lake levels finney et al 2019 goman et al 2017 grove 2019 maina et al 2018 mccall 2010 onywere et al 2013 richardson 1966 ricketts and johnson 2019 sutcliffe and parks 1999 verschuren 2001 2019 whittaker 2019 but also river flows e g grove 2019 sutcliffe and parks 1999 between 1961 and 1964 for example water levels in lake victoria rose by over two meters fig 3 2 in sutcliffe and parks 1999 and annual outflow from the lake through the victoria or white nile more than doubled in this same very short period of time fig 3 8 in sutcliffe and parks 1999 the water level rises in the lakes of the central rift valley of kenya have begun to receive some scientific reflections in the recent past onywere et al 2013 were the first to describe the phenomena of lake level rises including detailed descriptions of the affected lake properties building up on these findings obando et al 2016 illustrated the massive negative impacts of the flooding caused by the water level rises on the local population living within the riparian areas gichuru and waithaka 2015 similar to moturi 2015 focused their analyses on the trends of lake nakuru water surface variations between 1984 and 2013 concluding that no direct correlation between rainfall and changes in the lake surface area could be found more recently kiage and douglas 2020 assessed changes in land cover within the catchments of lake baringo bogoria nakuru and elementaita as a potential driver of the increasing lake water levels odongo et al 2015 analysed time series of precipitation and flow as well as annual mean lake volumes for the period 1960 2010 for lake naivasha to uncover possible abrupt shifts and gradual trends for the covered years which lie before the start of the recent lake level rises most river gauging stations showed no evidence of trends in the annual mean and maximum flows as well as seasonal flows rcmrd 2021 analysed the lake area increases for the period 06 2013 09 2020 and conclude that a detailed investigation into the lake water balances role of climatology lake catchment land use change land degradation and sediment yield into the lakes from the catchment as well as the role of geological activities including the status of the many geological fault and fissures in the region are key in understanding the underlying factors in the phenomenon although these studies show the development of the lake areas over time for single dates the time series are incomplete and the methods of lake area delineation from satellite imagery differ rainfall data is partially analysed however only for single ground stations and not necessarily for a longer period and no systematic hydroclimatic analysis exists additionally developments in lake levels and lake volumes have not yet been documented stimulated by country wide media coverage renewed increases in the lake water levels have recently provoked expert opinion and public debates on the potential causes of the water rises e g avery 2020 chebet 2018 chepkoech 2020 cherono 2021 omondi 2020a b wambua soi 2020 the expert discourses revolve around potential geological anthropogenic and hydro climatic influences geologically it is argued that the affected rift valley lakes all of which lie in closed basins without surface outlets are located in a geologically highly active zone in the earth s crust gregory 1896 smith 1989 consequently recent movement of tectonic plates in the region could have caused decreases in underground permeability thereby decreasing sub terranean outflow or seepage this process could be described as hasty hydrogeological instationarity the expert opinion is underlined by continued geothermal and volcanic activity witnessed within the entire region obando et al 2016 renaut et al 2017 smith 1989 tole 1996 the anthropogenic influences leading to hydrological changes consequent of land use and land cover lulc change and degradation of the catchment areas has also been hypothesised as an important reason for the lake level rises by the ministry of environment water and natural resources and water resources managers from administration chepkoech 2020 here it is argued that the potential sealing and clogging of the underground water paths due to higher sediment loads from the surrounding degraded catchments due to land use and land cover changes could have enhanced reduced permeability of the underground pathways in one way or the other with this it is further argued that increased sediment activation and erosion in the lake watersheds and in consequent higher siltation rates have impacted the lake volumes leading to the water levels rises this theory follows recent independent studies that have shown dwindled forest cover in upstream headlands due to human encroachment with agricultural land and peri urban areas having almost proportionately increased boitt 2016 kiage and douglas 2020 higher sediment inputs from the degraded lands consequently could probable be in favour of higher sediment yields hydrologically lulc changes often leads to higher surface runoff and less infiltration process thereby accelerating surface runoff and peak discharges on shorter time scales guzha et al 2018 this in turn affects the overall water balance on a longer time scale through decreased actual evapotranspiration andréassian 2004 precipitation and actual evapotranspiration constitute major hydro climatic drivers and components of the water balance since they define the atmospheric boundary conditions rising water levels can therefore also be explained by a deviation of inflow and on lake precipitation and or actual evapotranspiration from a magnitude that would result in an equilibrium in the lake water levels larger values in rainfall and or lower actual evapotranspiration compared to the mean values if the lake surfaces are in equilibrium would be the rational variations in lake volume is an integral response to potential changes not only in the catchment but also in the lake water balance whatever the cause for the lake level changes is kiage and douglas 2020 argue that all the above can potentially play a role in the lake level fluctuations a quantifiable magnitude can be derived by analysing changes in lake volume since they constitute an integrated catchment response changes in lake volume reflect potential influences due to deviations from an equilibrium regarding inflow and outflow lulc changes or hydro climatic changes these are the options publicly debated for the analysis of hydroclimatic changes time series of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration ideally available as catchment values are necessary the limited rainfall observations on the ground are important but exhibit some deficits related to uncertainties due to systematic and random errors in point measurements also they do not sufficiently capture the spatio temporal variability of rainfall in the drainage basins of the lake catchments e g rainfall in the valley floors is only 30 compared to rainfall in the head water catchments since the lakes are encircled by higher mountain ranges and escarpments kiage and douglas 2020 additionally the lake level rises are acute at point of writing 03 2021 the timely availability of time series from ground stations for a more or less online monitoring or rapid analysis is rarely given a number of reasons can be attributed to this including a lack of consistent maintenance and lack of financial resources as an alternative rainfall data estimated by remotely sensed satellite data and ideally corrected by local observations e g ashouri et al 2015 beck et al 2019 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 maidment et al 2014 tarnavsky et al 2014 or meteorological reanalysis data e g hersbach et al 2020 muñoz sabater 2019 rienecker et al 2011 rodell et al 2004a saha et al 2014 therefore constitute a potential alternative regarding actual evapotranspiration hardly any measured information is available on the ground this holds true not only for the study regions but is still generally a global challenge with few areas as exceptions baldocchi et al 2001 modelled actual evapotranspiration rates from meteorological reanalysis data can provide an alternative in this case e g muñoz sabater 2019 rodell et al 2004b although the data must be used with care considering the inherent associated uncertainties 1 1 research questions and objectives based on these guiding problems with respect to understanding the mechanisms behind the lake water level increases in the central kenya rift valley the following research questions and answers as objectives are aimed to be investigated in this research 1 what are the magnitudes in changes in lake characteristics i e water surface area water level and water volume over time i e for 1984 2020 a period of 37 years 2 how has catchment rainfall and actual evapotranspiration evolved over this period thereby also considering spatio temporal variability 3 what are the changes in lake water volume and how does this magnitude translate to changes in water balance components 4 are the derived changes in water volume observable trends in rainfall and actual evapotranspiration or are other causalities drivers for the lake level increases it is clear that the current fluctuations in lake levels have previously been there probably with higher intensity at the same time the negative effects on the local population are not comparable higher population densities especially in the riparian areas and generally higher damage potentials i e the upper limit of the loss or damage constituting all assets and affected persons which can potentially be damaged by the rising lake levels are very different now this in combination with widespread media coverage gives the whole phenomena an unprecedent focus also different from previous lake level fluctuations is our ability to observe these changes in space and time in unknown detail although local observation networks have deteriorated information based on remote sensing has exploded this makes this investigation and descriptions possible the main lakes in the central rift valley with different spatial catchment characteristics but also water quality properties as investigated lake baringo lake bogoria lake nakuru lake solai lake elementaita and lake naivasha 2 materials and methods 2 1 study lakes the study lakes are located in the central rift valley of kenya which is part of the east african rift system ranging from the gulf of aden at the horn of africa to the south of lake malawi between malawi and mozambique also denoted in fig 1 from north to south are the investigated lakes a baringo b bogoria c nakuru d solai e elementaita and f naivasha apart from the larger scale feature of the east african rift valley the western rift system running south in the western border of uganda is also visible from fig 1 in total the study area and lake basins cover an area of 13 355 km² the orographic catchment areas of the single lakes and other lake characteristics are summarized in table 1 fig 2 shows spatial characteristics of the central rift valley and gives an overview of the landscape the lakes are located panel a depicts the topography and elevation including the orographic catchment areas highlighting the fact that the lakes lie in closed basins where the lake is the sink and where no surface outlets are present the lakes are all located in the rift floor encircled by high mountain ranges and escarpments the lowest lake regarding lake level but also mean catchment elevation of 1722 m is baringo in the north and the highest is lake naivasha 2355 m in the south table 1 both lakes are freshwater despite high potential evapotranspiration rates the lakes have not become saline indicating that there is substantial underground loss of water through seepage which hinders the accumulation of dissolved solids through flushing becht et al 2006 darling et al 1996 1990 derakhshan 2017 yihdego and becht 2013 the smallest lakes regarding water and catchment area lake solai de bock et al 2009 goman et al 2017 nyaga et al 2019 with a mean catchment elevation of 1759 m also shows lower alkalinity indicating some loss through the underground probably leaking towards lake bogoria and baringo which lie in a downward elevation gradient to the north olago and mavuti 2017 bogoria nakuru and elementaita are in contrast highly saline which however does not mean that no underground seepage is present the magnitude of underground seepage will be lower compared to the freshwater lakes mccall 2010 generally a falling elevation gradient is evident from south to north from naivasha to baringo as can also be seen from the mean catchment and lake level elevations in table 1 although naivasha also leaks to the south towards lake magadi flow towards elementaita nakuru and bogoria is probable and is shown by others becht et al 2006 darling et al 1996 verschuren 2001 vegetation cover is indicated in panel b utilizing the mean annual ndvi lp daac 2015 vegetation density closely follows elevation with higher areas and escarpments e g aberdares east of naivasha the mau escarpment west of nakuru or the mountain ranges around the kerio valley east of bogoria and baringo showing higher vegetation cover areas of lower vegetation cover are evident in the rift floor e g elementaita badlands onywere et al 2013 and generally towards the north and east of the study area the vegetation cover has a very similar pattern compared to the rainfall distribution see fig 5 which makes sense vegetation and the hydro meteorological system is water limited landcover although already generalized for mapping is heterogeneous fig 2 panel c where climate allows agriculture and cropland define the landcover systematic irrigation is limited to areas with water supply e g around lake naivasha a mix of shrub trees and herbaceous cover are characteristic for the rift floor whereas the manifestation of the composition depends on small scale climatic aspects and mainly rainfall distribution higher elevation areas show a landcover dominated by tree and herbaceous cover east of the study area the laikipia plains are dominated by shrub and herbaceous cover fig 3 shows the investigated lakes in more detail and thereby visualizing the water occurrence mask from 1984 to 2020 especially for lake baringo nakuru and naivasha but also the smallest lake solai a large variability and expansion in lake area is visible lake baringo kiage and douglas 2020 obando et al 2016 odada et al 2006 onywere et al 2013 is internationally recognized for its biodiversity but is also important to the communities in its basin as a source of water for domestic and agricultural use and watering livestock other important uses are income generation through tourism biodiversity conservation and fishing three indigenous human communities live in the basin namely the ilchamus pokots and tugens seasonal rivers that drain into the lake include ol arabel makutan tangulbei endao and chemeron perkerra and molo are perennial and significantly lower discharges are characteristic during dry season lake baringo experiences very high annual evaporation rates 1650 2300 mm compared to an annual rainfall of 450 900 mm and therefore lake levels depend heavily on inflows from rivers originating from the humid parts of the drainage basin where the annual rainfall varies between 1100 mm and 2700 mm onywere et al 2013 conductivity is reported to be around 1760 μs cm de bock et al 2009 or 894 4 μs cm obando et al 2016 the orographic catchment size is around 6610 km² the region around lake baringo is presently inundated with several hotels and rural infrastructure including homes agricultural fields and grazing areas dispensaries health centres and schools being affected obando et al 2016 about 5000 people living around the area have been displaced by the flood inundation avery 2020 lake bogoria agembe et al 2016 mccall 2010 renaut et al 2017 is located in a deep depression with comparatively steeper slopes than lakes baringo or nakuru although the lake level increases when measured in absolute number are high the steeper topography of the surrounding area limits the spread of flood waters mostly to the north of the lake the lake is located within a national reserve where important infrastructure related to tourism have been affected and rendered unusable most geothermal springs associated with the lake region and a prominent touristic attraction have been submerged renaut et al 2017 the lake is highly alkaline with a conductivity of 31 046 μs cm obando et al 2016 the catchment area is around 1060 km² receiving around mean annual rainfall of 1035 mm for the period 1981 2020 with increasing water levels of lake bogoria there is renewed concern that the alkaline lake will overflow and merge with the freshwater lake baringo located about 20 km to the north thereby causing severe cross contamination chepkoech 2020 lake nakuru kiage and douglas 2020 kimaru et al 2019 obando et al 2016 onywere et al 2013 is surrounded and protected by a national park established in 1961 and which covers 188 km² the lake is a ramsar site of wetlands of international importance lake nakuru national park is the only park within kenya to be entirely fenced protective measures within the park have helped threatened species including the famous black rhino to repopulate lake nakuru is also famous for its spectacular bird populations including both the lesser and greater flamingo who rely on the algae in the lake the increases in the lake water levels have changed the water quality of the normally alkaline saline lake oduor and schagerl 2007 leading to loss of the algae abundance in consequence a vast number of flamingos have left kiage and douglas 2020 report on the hyper salinity with conductivity values of up to 160 000 μs cm however without reference date obando et al 2016 report on a conductivity of 49 000 μs cm lake nakuru is fed by the baharini spring on its eastern shoreline four seasonal rivers and the permanent ngosur river the seasonal rivers are the njoro nderit makalia and lamudhiak all of which originate in the eastern mau forest mean annual catchment rainfall is 1013 mm for the period 1981 2020 the overall catchment size is around 1471 km² flood inundation around lake nakuru affect the existing national park and road infrastructure thereby limiting accessibility since about 60 of the park are inaccessible onywere et al 2013 other damages to the infrastructure e g flooding of the main administrative block also negatively affect tourism activities and the local economy that depends on this obando et al 2016 lake solai de bock et al 2009 goman et al 2017 nyaga et al 2019 the smallest of the study lakes and until now not considered in an analysis of lake level and lake area variation is located about 50 km north of nakuru town and 20 km southeast of lake bogoria it has a drainage basin of only 214 km² and also does not have a surface outflow rainfall is comparable to lake bogoria with a mean annual value of 1023 mm a open water conductivity measured in 2003 and 2004 had a range of 776 111 2398 166 μs cm de bock et al 2009 maximum values of 2900 μs cm are reported by nyaga et al 2019 lake elementaita with a mean water surface area of 18 8 km² lies 20 km south of lake nakuru and around 40 km north of naivasha the highly alkaline sodium carbonate salts and shallow lake is characterised by hypersaline waters with an electric conductivity between 12 000 and 40 000 μs cm kiage and douglas 2020 the catchment area is the smallest after solai and covers an area of 772 km² lake elementaita receives the least rainfall of all investigated lakes 914 mm a damage potential in riparian areas around elementaita but also lake solai is low the effects of the lake level rise are therefore at least the ones directly aimed towards society comparatively low lake naivasha becht et al 2005 maina et al 2018 to the south has an orographic catchment area of 2355 km² and receives around 13 more rainfall compared to elementaita 1030 mm a the mean lake area is 128 8 km² and after baringo it is the second largest lake in the study agembe et al 2016 report of conductivity values ranging from 250 to 400 μs cm for lake naivasha impacts on the lake level increases can be said to be relatively lower the long term economic history and tradition around the lake becht et al 2005 ricciardi 1981 also including a longer history of scientific research of the area has also led to a stronger awareness of potential hazard from flooding since the current fluctuations are not unprecedented richardson 1966 verschuren 2001 larger parts of the riparian zones surrounding lake naivasha are generally dominated by tourism infrastructure and more pronounced industrial agriculture and flower farms targeted mainly for export to other parts of the world lake naivasha has a satellite lake to the west small lake or lake oloiden which is not covered in our analysis 2 2 data basis in this work i the database for hydrological time series over inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2020 2019 2015 ii climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 dataset and iii era5 land muñoz sabater 2019 dataset are the main data basis used for analyzing lake properties and hydro meteorological conditions over time in the study area the merit hydro dem yamazaki et al 2019 is used for delineating orographic catchment boundaries 2 2 1 database for hydrological time series over inland waters dahiti changes in lake volume can be derived by integrating ground measurements of lake levels and lake area estimates e g from satellite imagery for the study lakes however no complete measurements on lake levels exist as an alternative altimeter satellites with the capacity to measure water level have proven reliability over time from previous applications crétaux et al 2011 göttl et al 2016 santos da silva et al 2010 villadsen et al 2016 information on the binary signal regarding water cover can be derived through systematic analysis of electromagnetic waves emitted due to specific surface properties applying different combinations of spectral bands to derive a numerical number which is subordinated to a threshold value for water herndon et al 2020 kiage and douglas 2020 several global products on water cover based on remote sensing data exist e g carroll et al 2017 hakimdavar et al 2020 klein et al 2017 pekel et al 2016 one of the global products the database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti busker et al 2019 schwatke et al 2020 2015 offers additional valuable information on properties of water bodies also including a description of uncertainty dahiti provides a variety of hydrological information on lakes reservoirs rivers and wetlands derived from satellite data i e from multi mission satellite altimetry and optical remote sensing imagery the comprehensive data set spanning the period 1984 to near present contains consistent information on time series on lake areas lake volumes altimetry and bathymetry which are very relevant for the current challenges in the central rift valley lakes of kenya in this study dahiti is utilized to describe the surface area water level and volume variations the lake surface area data is derived based on optical image analyses of landsat and sentinel 2 the surface area time series of dahiti is a continuous dataset ranging from 1984 to near present schwatke et al 2019 dahiti also uses satellite altimetry to derive water level data from wetlands reservoirs and other inland water bodies the volume variations of dahiti is calculated based on the combination of water surface area and water level time series based on the dependency of these two variables a hypsometry model is computed based on the new modified strahler approach all hydrological products provided in the dahiti dataset are developed and maintained by the deutsches geodätisches forschungsinstitut der technischen universität münchen dgfi tum they are free of charge and publicly available on the dahiti website https dahiti dgfi tum de dahiti contains the data of the lakes baringo dahiti id 13 608 bogoria 13 607 nakuru 13 220 solai 13 609 elementaita 13 611 naivasha 13 610 and oloiden 17 681 2 2 1 1 lake surface areas for the calculation of high resolution time variable water surfaces optical images of landsat and sentinel 2 are used to identify surface water areas from 1984 to near present as a first step a water land mask is extracted by using five different water indexes accompanied by an automated threshold computation the combination of five different water indexes is used because no optimal water index exists for all areas the water indexes used to derive the land water mask include the modified normalized difference water index mndwi new water index nwi automated water extraction index for non shadow areas aweinsh automated water extraction index for shadow areas aweish and the tasseled cap for wetness tcwet by combining these five indexes their unique advantages can be used to finally achieve a daily land water mask all pixels classified as water by four or five indexes will be represented as water pixels that are classified as water by none or only one index are set to land all other pixels classified as water by two or three indexes are set to data gaps and are filled in the following step in the second step data gaps occurring due to different causes e g voids cloud cover are filled by using a long term water probability mask this mask is finally used iteratively to fill the data gaps which leads to a gap reduced surface area time series for lakes and reservoirs the correlation of surface water and water levels from in situ and satellite altimetry has increased significantly from 0 61 to 0 86 after filling the data gaps of lake surfaces this demonstrates the quality improvement by filling the data gaps as well as the enhanced reliability of the approach schwatke et al 2019 as reference and comparison data to the dahiti lake area lake area values published in kiage and douglas 2020 obando et al 2016 and onywere et al 2013 are additionally used 2 2 1 2 lake water levels initially satellite altimetry was designed to monitor water levels over oceans however for almost two decades satellite altimetry has been proven to have the potential to observe rivers and small lakes with reliable accuracies the advantage of satellite altimetry is that even in remote areas without local infrastructure water levels can be estimated quite accurately since most satellite missions follow specific ground tracks inland water bodies are only crossed by chance big water bodies have therefore a higher probability of being crossed compared to small ones additionally the temporal resolution is also limited to 10 35 days due to the respective orbit repetition configuration of the specific satellite mission therefore in dahiti multiple satellite altimeter systems are combined to increase the temporal and spatial resolution schwatke et al 2015 altimeter data provided by different missions including envisat ers 2 jason 1 2 3 topex poseidon saral altika and sentinel 3a 3b are utilised for the dahiti dataset the dahiti method for estimation of water level time series incorporates three main steps of data processing namely data pre processing kalman filtering and postprocessing the pre processing step includes range corrections computation of height errors and outlier rejection the last step is to merge all water levels derived from the previous steps to form a single time series schwatke et al 2015 dahiti yields a very accurate water level time series estimation for inland water bodies the validation shows root mean square errors between 4 and 36 cm for lakes compared to in situ measurements generally an increase in accuracy could be achieved compared to other available altimeter data bases schwatke et al 2015 in this study the water level series of the lakes baringo 2004 2020 bogoria 2016 2020 nakuru 2016 2020 solai 2016 2020 elementaita 2012 2020 naivasha 2012 2020 and oloiden not available cover different periods because the lakes are crossed by different available altimeter mission 2 2 1 3 lake volume variation the dahiti database also includes data of volume variations of inland water bodies the volume variations are calculated based on the lake surface area and the water level time series within the dahiti database schwatke et al 2020 the estimation of volume variations is based on three steps i estimation of hypsometry ii computation of bathymetry and iii calculation of the volume variation the water area water level relationship of each lake is described by the hypsometry the hypsometry again depends on the lake s bathymetry in the past linear or polynomial functions have frequently been used to fit a hypsometric curve to every water body nevertheless they do not capture the entire variations of the area height relation therefore schwatke et al 2020 utilize a modified strahler model developed in 1952 the strahler model strahler 1952 was originally developed to relate the horizontal cross sectional area to the relative elevation above the basin outlet water levels and surface areas are mostly not obtained on the same date therefore only data pairs whose temporal difference is less than 10 days is used to establish the hypsometry this maximizes the number of data pairs and minimizes possible errors as a pre processing step to derive the bathymetry of inland water bodies the water level of each surface area obtained has to be estimated therefore the established hypsometric curve is also used to derive a water level time series this method minimizes errors from altimetry but other errors due to extrapolation or time dependent changes might occur the bathymetry is then calculated using the land water masks and the according water levels in a descending order to calculate the height of the bathymetry each pixel column is processed separately using a median filter of the size five for the land water mask in the direction of decreasing water levels uncertainties of corrupt land water pixels are reduced schwatke et al 2020 finally the volume variation time series of each lake can be computed the volume variations are calculated based on the bathymetry and a combination of water levels obtained from satellite altimetry and the estimated water levels based on the hypsometric curve to compute the volume below the respective water level the water level is intersected pixel wise with the bathymetry which has a spatial resolution of 30 m these pixel volumes of the current water level are then accumulated to obtain a volume above the minimum observed surface area it is important to note that the volume below the minimum observed value is unknown and that with this approach only volume variations can be computed since not the complete bathymetry is known due to the short periods of water level time series from satellite altimetry the computed hypsometry is used to derived additional water levels from surface areas this allows us to densify and to extend the water level time series until 1984 2 2 2 rainfall data the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps environmental record is a quasi global 50 s 50 n high resolution 0 05 daily pentadal and monthly precipitation dataset the chirps dataset builds on previous approaches to smart interpolation techniques and high resolution long period of record precipitation estimates based on infrared cold cloud duration ccd observations the algorithm i is built around a 0 05 climatology that incorporates satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations ii incorporates daily pentadal and monthly 1981 present 0 05 ccd based precipitation estimates iii blends station data to produce a preliminary information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks and iv uses a novel blending procedure incorporating the spatial correlation structure of ccd estimates to assign interpolation weights funk et al 2015 several global data sets of rainfall some of which are referred to in the introduction could have been used for this study our decision to use chirps is based on several studies applying chirps in east africa which showed comparatively better performances and agreements of chirps with station data e g dinku et al 2018 2007 kimani et al 2017 omonge et al 2021 also recently kimaru et al 2019 modelled the inflows to lake nakuru using chirps rainfall as input apart from chirps rainfall data from the ground stations nakuru meteorological station and snake farm meteorological station on the shores of lake baringo both time series digitalized from plots in kiage and douglas 2020 are used as reference for the remote sensing rainfall product chirps 2 2 3 evapotranspiration data and effective rainfall for the current study data derived from the newest reanalysis product of ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts is used the era5 land era5l dataset with global coverage thereby provides gap free time series with monthly and hourly resolution for 15 meteorological variables for the period 1981 to near present muñoz sabater 2019 yang and giusti 2020 here we used monthly averages which were processed via google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 era5 land is a derivative of the era5 climate reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 however only covering the terrestrial components with an improved spatio temporal resolution era5 land has a spatial resolution of 0 1 arc degrees compared to the grid size of era5 with of 0 25 arc degrees the temporal resolution of era5 land is 1 h while era5 has a coarser 3 h resolution there is no data assimilation applied to era5 land but observations are indirectly implemented via the assimilated atmospheric fields of era5 yang and giusti 2020 for the current study actual evapotranspiration and the ratio between actual evapotranspiration aet and rainfall and thus indirectly the runoff coefficient see eq 1 is derived from era5l potential evapotranspiration pet is also used for plotting to characterize the climate in the lake basins the unitless runoff coefficient is defined as 1 r c q r r a e t r 1 a e t r with rc runoff coefficient q runoff mm r rainfall mm and aet actual evapotranspiration mm the difference between aet and r is the effective rainfall 2 3 integrated catchment response icr relating changes in lake volume to potential changes in the water balance and inflows to the lakes over time understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to the lake level fluctuations necessitate an analysis of the temporal characteristics of the water balance and inflows to the lakes bringing the storage term to the left the following longer term water balance equation for a lake watershed can be defined all units in mm 2 s r q g w a e t q o u t r c r q g w q o u t r a e t r r q g w q o u t m

watersheds aet to the actual catchment evapotranspiration including evaporation from the lake surface rc to the runoff coefficient see eq 1 and qout to runoff from the lake i e outflow through a surface water body or the seepage into the underground the lake volume variation data from dahiti allows to quantify the magnitude of changes to be expected on the right hand side of the water balance equation since s integrates potential changes occurring the catchment the year to year lake volume variation data is in combination with orographic catchment area used to derive a magnitude for every year t which we refer to as integrated catchment response icr mm 3 i c r t s t k m 3 s t 1 k m 3 10 12 a r e a k m ² 10 6 m m in eq 3 the difference in lake volume variation s from one year to the next is calculated and converted from km³ to dm³ and is then normalized by the orographic catchment area area which is converted from km² to m² this results in the unit mm for the icr which is then used as a comparison to changes in water balance components e g rainfall icr is based on the satellite derived lake volume variation data normalized by catchment area and indicates to which extent catchment water balance components changed from one year to the next to result in a change in lake volume the analysis thereby focuses on deviations from long term means of periods when the lake was in an equilibrium and the surface areas and volumes did not change significantly over time 2 4 time series analysis for analysing changes in the hydrometeorological characteristics explorative statistics and visual inspection of different time series is used these analyses include time series in rainfall aet and ratios between aet and rainfall but also lake properties such as lake areas potential trends in time series are evaluated by comparing averages of different periods for evaluating breakpoints in time series the method described in bai and perron 2003 and zeileis et al 2003 are implemented in the current study 3 results 3 1 overview relative changes in lake areas and observed trends in catchment rainfall although interannual fluctuations were present regarding lake areas before 2010 a pronounced increase is evident from satellite based observations congested into the dahiti dataset after 2010 fig 4 the range of increase in relation to the mean values of 1984 2009 depends on the topographical setting of the lakes see also fig 3 and ranges from 21 for lake naivasha to an extraordinary 123 for lake solai in december 2020 lake bogoria 28 is located in a deep depression where increases in water level do not show a pronounced signal in water area lake baringo 59 in december 2020 and lake nakuru 70 just like lake solai are located in flatter basins where an increase in water level leads to a larger signal and increase in lake area similar to the adjacent lake naivasha lake elementaita shows lower variation and a lower increase of around 25 since 2010 visual inspection of the relationship between rainfall and lake area fluctuations in fig 4 clearly shows the reaction of deficits brownish shaded bars and surpluses blueish shaded bars in fig 4 of rainfall variability in signals in lake area in baringo bogoria and solai rainfall surpluses of larger than 25 compared to the long term mean of 1984 2009 lead to the exceptional increases in lake area for nakuru elementaita and naivasha at least around 2010 rainfall surpluses lie around 25 but three wet subsequent years lead to the observed increases in lake areas before 2010 wetter years and partially wetter periods are visible where the magnitudes of surpluses in rainfall are however lower these periods are characterized by steady or slightly increasing lake areas for all lakes and after 2018 rainfall anomalies in the catchment rainfall exceed 50 leading to further increases in lake levels an important component and driver of the water balance of the lakes is therefore rainfall fig 5 shows a more detailed temporal development of the mean annual rainfall sums for the orographic lake catchments for the period 1981 2020 as orange dashed line meteorological station data from snake farm lake baringo and nakuru meteorological station data extracted from kiage and douglas 2020 using tools provided by rohatgi 2020 are shown as comparison for the remote sensing derived areal means for the basins the two rainfall curves chirps station data match quite well for nakuru regarding interannual variability and generally mean values for longer time periods in contrast the snake farm rainfall time series shows a more pronounced interannual variability compared to chirps also before the year 2000 the longer term means are lower compared to the remotely sensed data the differences in variability may be explained by spatio temporal variability of the rainfall process the mean basin value represents the rainfall for an area of over 6600 km² with an elevation range of around 963 3014 m table 1 this value will be smoother compared to a point observation deviations from the mean are smaller as shown in figs a1 and a2 resulting in the conclusion that although the mean is different the temporal variability shows a better agreement tabulated data on annual rainfall is documented in table a1 why did we relate annual rainfall to the mean of 1984 2009 in fig 4 the rainfall in all lake basins shows a changepoint in year 2009 vertical dashed line in fig 5 due to a structural change in the time series the breakpoints were thereby objectively calculated following the method described in bai and perron 2003 and zeileis et al 2003 and which are implemented in the r package strucchange team r development core 2018 zeileis et al 2002 this means that the longer term means substantially differ between 1981 2009 and 2010 2020 as can be seen by the different dashed lines labeled with the respective means as can be seen from fig 5 the long term mean rainfall for the period 1981 2020 is similar for nearly all lake basins and lies around 1010 1040 mm a lake elementaita basin however is around 10 drier with a mean basin value of around 900 mm a parts of the basin especially in the rift valley floor receives less than 700 mm annual rainfall with elementaita badlands gilgil and marigat areas receiving the least 500 mm onywere et al 2013 for the 11 years following 2009 the annual rainfall mean increases by around 28 265 mm baringo 27 264 mm bogoria 20 193 mm nakuru 27 260 mm solai and 23 201 mm 24 231 mm and for elementaita and naivasha also see figs a1 and a2 for plots on deviations in and mm it is interesting to observe that although a change point in rainfall is already found for the year 2009 the signal in the changes rises in lake areas is lagged and occurs approximately one year later this is confirmed when calculating the correlation between lagged rainfall and lake area fig 6 with the exception of lake solai the largest correlation values are found with a rainfall lag of one year lake solai has the smallest orographic catchment area of 214 km² and the reaction of rainfall on the lake area is therefore more immediate and the highest correlation is also found for a lag of 0 years the same is the case for elementaita which also has a comparatively small catchment area of 772 km² although the highest correlation for baringo is found with a lag of one year the correlation of lag with the year two is not very much smaller this means that the memory of rainfall regarding lake area is longer and that it takes longer that a reaction of rainfall is visible in a signal in the lake area this corresponds well with the fact that the lake baringo basin with 6609 km² is the largest among the investigated lakes and that size does matter in this case correlation values for monthly data is documented in the appendix in fig a4 3 2 spatial trends in rainfall the drier rift valley floors e g between lake naivasha and lake elementaita or south of lake baringo are also visible in fig 7 a which depicts the spatial distribution of the long term mean annual rainfall for the overall period with data 1981 2020 from fig 7 a it is also visible that the highest rainfall sums and thus most significant water contributions to the lakes are to be expected in higher elevation zones like the aberdares range east of lake naivasha the mau escarpment to the west of lake nakuru or the mountain range south east of lake baringo whilst in the lower valley floors annual rainfall of 500 1000 mm a can be expected the upper elevation zones receive up to 2000 mm a on the long term average generally a mean increase in rainfall as a function of altitude of around 24 mm 100 m is found for the study area and on an annual scale as was already shown for the time series of basin average rainfall values changes in rainfall over time have occurred the spatial distribution of the temporal rainfall trend for the period 1981 2020 in mm a for the study region is shown in fig 7 b the lowest at least in absolute number increases are found in the rift valley floor with an increase of 0 10 mm a in contrast highest increases are found for higher elevated areas at the top of the escarpments with increases of slightly above 15 mm a generally an upward increasing trend in rainfall is found for all lake basins a comparison of the four decades between 1981 and 2020 fig 7 c f shows that until 2000 rainfall was mostly around or below the long term mean of 1981 2020 especially after 2010 however noteworthy positive deviations in rainfall are visible this decade being much wetter compared to the long term mean for the entire study region this agrees with recently published data by wainwright et al 2020 fig a3 shows mean annual rainfall and temporal trends in rainfall for kenya for the same periods for the majority of the country for the overall period 1981 2010 a positive trend is visible fig a3 b the highest increases are found west of the study region between mt elgon and lake victoria although an overall positive trend is found for most areas in the country the maps show a regionally more heterogenous picture in the single decades fig a3 c f with regions being drier and wetter compared to the long term mean this is especially the case for the periods before 2011 after 2011 however wetter conditions are found for all nearly all regions with the exception of an area east of garissa and around the coast towards somalia fig a3 f 3 3 changes in lake areas and lake levels over time the time series analysis of rainfall showed that 2009 was a breakpoint after which catchment rainfall characteristics changed and a noteworthy increase in the average of rainfall occurred after this year this also matches well with the succeeding rising signals in lake level displayed in figs 8 and 9 which document in absolute numbers km² and m the temporal developments of lake areas and lake levels the green bars depict mean annual values which are connected by a dashed line in case of missing annual data the points are linearly connected additionally the mean monthly data available is displayed as grey crosses the coloring of horizontal lines on top of the bars shows the number of observations per year uncertainties in the estimates are shown as light blue error bars the completeness of the time series varies depending on the lake whereas after 1999 complete time series are available for most lakes with the exception of lake nakuru with one missing year and lake naivasha with several years missing before 1999 fewer data points are available and even if annual values are displayed the number of underlying data points of single years is rather low this is due to scanty satellite imagery available before this time nevertheless general trends can also be depicted for most lakes in the 1980s and 1990s it is important to note that the data of lake baringo for the year 2012 is probably biased since only two observations in january are available so that potential lake level rises during this year are not appropriately captured the tabulated annual values can be found in the appendix table a2 to our knowledge lake area and water level data in this consistent form has previously not been available for the study lakes when comparing the absolute values of lake levels to previous data it must be considered that the reference elevation may be different dahiti provides orthometric height which are related to a geoid model the relative changes however are consistent the temporal patterns of lake areas and levels correlate between the lakes and with the exception of lake naivasha show correlations values of above 0 8 to 0 9 fig a5 due to intensive water use e g for irrigation purposes the lake area and level of naivasha is anthropogenically influenced onywere et al 2013 what may also explain the lower correlation values lowest lake levels in naivasha are found in 2009 the figures again show that lake areas and levels closely follow rainfall fluctuations reacting to wetter and drier periods the reaction of the lakes with the smallest catchment and surface areas lake solai and elementaita show the fastest and most pronounced reaction to rainfall fluctuations this also corresponds to the correlation between lagged rainfall and lake area shown in fig 6 and fig a4 lake baringo and nakuru exhibited the smallest areas and lowest levels in 1995 with 118 3 and 33 1 km² and lake levels of 971 4 and 1759 8 m bogoria showed the second lowest levels in 1995 31 9 km² which is slightly higher compared to the absolute minimum of 31 5 km² in 2006 data for solai and elementaita show that the lowest lake area extents occurred in the 1984 and 1987 with 3 3 km² 1005 9 m and 15 1 km² 1775 9 m respectively different characteristics regarding the occurrence of the minimum lake area is found for naivasha here a value of 104 9 km² 1880 m is found in the year 2009 lake baringo s largest extent at least measured as a mean annual value occurred in 2014 with 197 1 km² this is also the case for solai 11 7 km² and elementaita 21 9 km² from fig 8 and fig 9 it is however evident that the trends in the monthly data grey crosses show a steep increase in 2020 where the latest observations in december 2020 exceed all previous measurements this is the case for all lakes accordingly largest mean annual lake areas lake levels of 41 2 km² 998 1 m 62 3 km² 1766 2 m and 147 7 km² 1887 5 m are found for bogoria nakuru and naivasha in 2020 largest difference or largest fluctuation between minimum and maximum water level is found for lake solai with 8 53 m followed by baringo 8 23 m naivasha 7 48 m nakuru 6 40 m bogoria 4 99 m and finally elementaita with 2 38 m for most lakes the highest levels are found around 2013 2014 which are however surpassed in the year 2020 in which new records are evident fig 9 in fig 8 published lake area data available for baringo bogoria nakuru and naivasha is additionally plotted as reference for bogoria and nakuru the independent area estimations mostly match quite well this is also the case for the data from kiage and douglas 2020 which also matches well in baringo this is not necessarily surprising and can be explained with the fact that kiage and douglas 2020 also used the modified normalized difference water index mndwi to delineate the lake surfaces and mndwi is one of the indexes used in dahiti for baringo and naivasha larger deviations are evident when comparing our results with obando et al 2016 and onywere et al 2013 who both manually delineated water areas for satellite imagery for the respective lakes maximum water surface areas in onywere et al 2013 are documented for september 2013 baringo 231 6 km² and october 2013 naivasha 169 9 km² obando et al 2016 find december 2014 baringo 219 8 km² and december 2013 naivasha 1652 km² evaluating our data for the years 2013 and 2014 maximum lake extent in dahiti is found in january 2014 for baringo 199 5 km² and september 2014 for naivasha 139 9 km² for baringo the difference to onywere et al 2013 is thus 32 1 km² or 16 1 and 20 1 km² 10 1 in comparison to obando et al 2016 for naivasha the deviation compared to onywere et al 2013 is 30 1 km² 21 5 and 25 3 km² 18 1 in comparison to obando et al 2016 both lakes have fringing swamps and submerged vegetation this vegetation is dynamic and follows water level fluctuations garcia benedito 2019 a possible explanation for the differences could therefore be that these riparian areas where not identified as water surfaces in the automatic classification scheme of dahiti since the water signal was too weak and vegetation dominated the signal in contrast during manual classification the expert can decide to classify these areas as water maybe due to additional knowledge from a field visit a comparison and visual inspection of fig 2 in onywere et al 2013 and the land water mask from dahiti for october 2013 fig a6 seem to indicate this where larger differences in water classification are evident in the northern part of lake naivasha from fig a6 these areas look like fringing swamps and water coverage is not evident in contrast the expansion of water in these areas is visible in fig a7 which shows the situation in july 2020 additionally for naivasha obando et al 2016 and onywere et al 2013 both included lake oloiden a small satellite lake west of lake naivasha in their estimations of water surface area for naivasha fig 10 shows the surface area of oloiden based on dahiti data at the low water level in 2010 lake oloiden had developed alkalinity that allowed a large population of flamingos to inhabit it onywere et al 2013 when adding the maximum extent of lake oloiden in 2013 and 2014 5 6 km² to our estimates a sum of 145 43 km² is found which is however still substantially smaller the deviation compared to onywere et al 2013 is still 24 5 km² 16 8 and 19 7 km² 13 6 in comparison to obando et al 2016 lake oloiden was not included in the systematic analysis of the study lakes since no altimetry and in consequence volume data is available 3 4 trends in lake volume and water balance components fig 11 depicts the temporal development of the lake volume variation km³ for the study lakes the lake volume variation thereby shows the water volume in the lakes above a threshold value which corresponds to the observed surface area within the period 1984 2020 the data therefore does not show the total lake volume since the bathymetric conditions below the lowest observed water level are unknown for this information bathymetric surveys would be necessary as has e g been done by maina et al 2018 for lake naivasha and lake oloiden maina et al 2018 report a total volume of 0 72 km³ for lake naivasha in the year 2016 our lake volume variation data shows a value of around 0 25 km³ for 2016 leading to the conclusion that the difference of 0 47 km³ of water was stored in lake naivasha during the lowest period of available observation in dahiti since we are interested in the year to year changes in water volume the data is nevertheless sufficient for brevity we will use the term lake volume in the following with the exception of lake naivasha which experienced a decline in water volume until around 1990 the other lakes show little interannual variability and fairly stable conditions until around 2010 only after this period after which rainfall characteristics changed see vertical lines in fig 5 in the year 2009 lake volumes substantially increased compared to 1984 2009 annual rainfall increased by around 25 in 2010 and after 2018 by even more than 50 noticeable is also that single months in the year 2020 are substantially larger compared to the mean annual value this can be explained with the very wet second half year of 2020 which led to a strong increase in lake volume fig 11 fig a7 for fig 12 the difference in year to year lake volume variation data is in combination with orographic catchment area used to derive a magnitude for every year which we refer to as integrated catchment response icr mm interannual changes in lake volume follow rainfall anomalies shown in the upper section of the plots similar patterns can be detected especially after 2000 when the lake data situation becomes more consistent before 2000 single values are present but unfortunately do not allow to judge on reaction of wet rainfall anomalies on icr striking since suspicious is the icr of 2013 with a value of over 140 mm for lake baringo the reason is probably unrepresentative data for the year 2012 in this whole year only two data point are observed in the dry season month of january biasing the picture in nature mean lake volume variation of 2012 was probably higher since lake level already increased during the whole year 2012 since icr is calculated as the difference between lake volume of 2013 and 2012 a bias is present already in the previous figures of lake area level and volume variation the clear discontinuity at baringo of 2012 was unrealistic the structure of the lake volume variation and the icr probably followed a pattern observed at lake naivasha or lake nakuru the larger lakes it is however important to note that averaging over several years eliminates this bias icr indicates to which extent catchment water balance components changed from one year to the next to result in a change in lake volume a comparison of water balance components is reasonable for the averages of over 2 5 years also considering the temporal correlation structure between lagged rainfall and lake signal shown in fig 6 the number of years also depends on lake catchment area since smaller lakes like solai will probably have a smaller storage a small torrent shows immediate reaction to rainfall the effects on runoff and flood will however vanish comparatively fast accordingly lake solai with a catchment of only 214 km² which is only 3 of the baringo basin shows particular immediate responses to rainfall anomalies resulting in the somewhat choppy picture of the icr in fig 12 considering means of several years and thereby neglecting interannual storage in the catchment several scenarios are feasible they depend on potential trends in the boundary conditions e g underground seepage intercatchment leakages and meteorological drivers i e rainfall actual evapotranspiration and include i no change from one year to the next in lake levels could mean that rainfall evapotranspiration boundary conditions subterranean inflow or seepage are stable and stationary so that the lake stays in an equilibrium ii an increase in lake volume from one year to the next could mean that rainfall has increased or evapotranspiration has decreased again that assuming stable seepage iii again assuming otherwise constant boundary conditions a decrease in the lake level could mean that rainfall has decreased or evapotranspiration has increased scenarios i to iii can clearly become more complex when potential changes or interactions between rainfall and evapotranspiration are considered namely when they change in such a way that they enhance or compensate each other lake levels can remain constant when rainfall increases but also actual evapotranspiration increases with the same magnitude at the same time lake levels can also stay constant if rainfall decreases and actual evapotranspiration decreases apart from this interplay of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration changes in boundary conditions can have similar effects at this point we ignore these and assume that they are stable over time subsurface outflow intercatchment leakages to other lake basins are present but are also stable over time we are simplifying the domain of analysis in fig 12 we only showed rainfall anomalies which however were at least regarding temporal trends closely followed by the icr apart from rainfall actual evapotranspiration is especially important in the water limited systems the lakes are located here potentially a much larger amount of water could be lost to the atmosphere than is available with the exception of the lake surface potential evapotranspiration pet from era5l ranges from around 3020 mm a in baringo to 2225 mm a in the solai catchment fig a8 in relation to era5l rainfall pet is 2 65 baringo to 1 2 solai times higher compared to rainfall fig a9 with the exception of single years in solai the catchments are always water limited actual evapotranspiration based on era5l aet fig a10 is as expected much lower compared to pet interannual variability in aet is high and follows rainfall anomalies very low outliers in aet in single years occur during dry years or periods the direction of longer term trends in aet also follows rainfall with lower values before 2009 however no breakpoint year is found for 2009 for era5l aet aet values shown in fig a10 are partially higher compared to chirps rainfall see fig 5 and table 2 the reason is that era5l rainfall is substantially higher compared to chirps so that at least within era5l the water balance is closed and consistent differences in rainfall between chirps and era5l range from around 20 in baringo 1021 mm a vs 1240 mm a for 1984 2020 to nearly 100 in solai 1015 vs 2021 mm a table 2 since chirps has proven to provide reliable rainfall estimates in the study region see references in section data basis the high era5l rainfall and in consequence era5l aet values seem unrealistic and are therefore not used directly to account for this probable overestimation we use the ratio between era5l aet to rainfall fig 13 to derive an adjusted aet values based on chirps rainfall see adj aet in table 2 we thereby assume that the partitioning of rainfall and aet in era5l is in a correct magnitude and can be used to derive aet based on chirps rainfall in contrast to aet which is quite stationary over time the ratio between aet and rainfall from era5l fig 13 shows a much more pronounced change signal when comparing the periods before and after 2009 here the year 2009 is also calculated as a breakpoint year similar to rainfall for all lake catchments the ratio substantially decreased after 2009 meaning that in relation less rainfall is evapotranspirated generally the ratio between aet and rainfall shows a high interannual variability values of larger than one can be explained with storage effects from one year to the next and also evaporation from the lake surfaces the highest ratios of around 0 85 for the period 1984 2020 are found for lake nakuru and baringo around 80 85 of rainfall is lost to the atmosphere and around 15 20 are available for runoff the lowest values are found for lake solai with a long term mean of 0 62 for the overall period and 0 51 for 2010 2020 even if the era5l rainfall and aet values are too high we assume that the ratio between aet and rainfall is in the correct magnitude the unitless runoff coefficient ratio between runoff and precipitation rc can be calculated as the difference between 1 and the ratio between aet and rainfall a comparison with published data for the study region shows that the numbers given in fig 13 and table 2 are somewhat in the range of previously published runoff coefficients for lake naivasha where a long term mean ratio of aet to rainfall of 0 72 results in a runoff coefficient rc of 0 28 for the era5l data ayenew et al 2007 used a value of 0 13 for rc for the same lake odongo 2016 published mean rc values of 0 2 0 25 muthuwatta 2014 evaluated runoff and precipitation data for a single year 1971 for lake naivasha tributaries and found very low rc values of 8 5 at gilgil and 3 5 for the malewa subbasin evaluating runoff coefficients for only a single year must however be taken with care since high interannual variability and storage effects are ignored for the njemps flats in baringo wairagu et al 1993 published rc values of 0 2 which are in the range of our values for single events from a 0 3 km² highly erodible semiarid catchment in the baringo district sutherland and bryan 1990 publish a runoff coefficient of 46 critchley and the world bank 1986 present examples of runoff coefficients of 30 for microcatchments in baringo and 13 19 for larger catchments in turkana which is further north and drier compared to our study lakes in a more recent study data in kimaru et al 2019 can be used to derive a ratio between aet and rainfall of 0 74 which is around 0 07 lower compared to our values the comparison with published data in summary highlights uncertainties regarding runoff coefficients some studies agree with our numbers others do not additionally for bogoria solai and elementaita no studies were found for comparison and especially for lake solai and lake bogoria the era5l derived ratio of aet to rainfall seem too low considering the dry climate this is especially the case to the years after 2009 table 2 summarizes the mean catchment water balance components and the integrated catchment response icr for 1984 2020 black font 1984 2009 orange font and 2010 2020 blue font apart from averages and deviations from the long term mean of 1984 2009 of aet and rainfall the deviation of effective rainfall is shown which was calculated using chirps rainfall and the era5l ratio between aet and rainfall for the calculation of deviations in table 2 1984 2009 is used as a reference since in this period the lakes were more or less in an equilibrium and the following deviations from the mean of this period after 2010 led to the observed lake level rises this is confirmed by the icr for 1984 2009 which lies around zero in most lakes one exception is lake naivasha where water levels were however anthropogenically influenced in this period onywere et al 2013 in the period 2010 2020 rainfall increased by around 30 for the baringo bogoria and solai catchments in nakuru elementaita and naivasha the rainfall increases were lower amount to 21 25 and 25 respectively in contrast the increases in aet are lower compared to changes in rainfall and lie around 14 for baringo and elementaita 13 for naivasha 11 for nakuru and 7 for bogoria and solai for 2010 2020 the icr is positive corresponding to positive deviations in rainfall although the absolute differences between icr and deviation of effective chirps rainfall are high the signals show in the expected directions positive wet rainfall anomalies lead to an increase in the icr and vice versa generally effective rainfall deviation is larger compared to the icr and although these numbers do not match the positive deviations in effective rainfall are very sufficient to explain the lake level rises 4 discussion in a perfect world the deviations of effective rainfall would equal the integrated catchment response icr in table 2 given that all other boundary conditions e g underground seepage intercatchment leakages are constant when focusing on the icr and effective rainfall possible explanations for the differences include i the effective rainfall is based on chirps and on the ratio between era5l aet and rainfall these ratios are connected with uncertainties and it is feasible that in effect the runoff coefficients are smaller which would mean that effective rainfall is also smaller and lead to a better matching with the icr this is especially the case for solai and bogoria where runoff coefficients seem too high for a dry climate especially in the period after 2009 higher runoff coefficients could be expected since potential evapotranspiration was not reduced and higher rainfall was available for aet in summary uncertainties in aet are large and there are indications that our calculations based on era5l data show too low aet values ii although chirps has proven to be reliable for hydrological applications in the study region in the past it is clear that the estimates are also afflicted with uncertainties especially when considering that catchment means are used nevertheless the deviations between effective rainfall and icr for 2010 2020 are large in absolute numbers but comparatively low in relative terms for baringo for example the difference amounts to 149 mm which is only 12 of the mean rainfall for bogoria and solai the difference is around 18 of rainfall and for the other lakes it is lower compared to baringo when put into perspective considering all the numerous uncertainties in i point rainfall measurements and ii areal or basin averages estimates herrnegger et al 2018 2015 the relative errors are low iii the icr dependents on lake volume variation data and thus on multiple satellite data and complex pre processing steps comparisons with published data fig 8 suggest that the lake areas used are possibly too small since inundated swamps and riparian vegetation is not identified as water assuming that larger water areas were present would mean that the lake volume would be larger compared to our data in this case the lake volumes and icr would be larger and would better fit to the effective rainfall values whatever the reasons are the results however clearly show the connection between effective rainfall and changes in lake areas although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out and may play a role the icr values show that only very small changes in the overall water balance are necessary to explain the lake level rises for baringo for example a change of only 16 9 mm a which is less than 2 of the annual rainfall before 2010 of 938 3 mm a is sufficient the analysis of the hydrometeorological conditions show that changes in boundary conditions e g changes in catchment properties due to anthropogenic influences intercatchment leakages changes in underground permeability are not necessary to explain lake level rises apart from inflow and direct evaporation and rainfall the lake levels clearly depend on the degree of underground seepage for baringo solai and naivasha since they are the only fresh water lakes and therefore must have an underground outflow hindering the accumulation of salt leading to alkalinity for bogoria nakuru and elementaita since they are alkaline and if existent underground seepage is of lower relevance becht et al 2006 2005 onywere et al 2013 verschuren 2001 verschuren et al 2000 yihdego and becht 2013 the faults especially for lakes baringo solai and naivasha are not necessarily reduced and our analysis shows that changes in permeability are not necessary to explain increases in lake levels compared to rainfall the changes in era5l based aet are significantly lower this is surprising especially considering the energy oversupply for the evapotranspiration process shown in the data of potential evapotranspiration regarding aet however even larger uncertainties exist since no direct measurements exist and the magnitude of aet directly defines the effective rainfall larger aet values compared to our results are very probable it remains important to benchmark remote sensing or numerical modelling based rainfall products like chirps or meteorological parameters from era5l although many issues exist regarding comparability of products covering very different spatial domains omonge et al 2021 a comparison simply helps to gain credibility and assurance the estimates of aet are purely model driven and could not be validated in contrast the chirps rainfall estimates per se include ground station data accordingly and as could be shown with the comparison with published station data a high agreement could be found for rainfall data from nakuru meteorological station and chirps for data of snake farm near the shores of lake baringo larger deviations were found regarding absolute values where however differences in the spatial domains of the time series are problematic in this case it must be considered that lake baringo lies in the drier north and in the rift floor where it is generally drier the main sources of water for the catchment lies in the upstream areas which show higher elevation areas the areal rainfall will therefore be different higher from a ground station located in the driest part of the catchment this analysis heavily depends and was only possible due to the availability of relevant remotely sensed data at the same time information from a hydrometeorological observation network on the ground would significantly reduce speculative aspects and increase credibility of this analysis the upkeeping and maintenance of the ground observation network for the measurement of meteorological and hydrological parameters is of uttermost importance remotely sensed data cannot completely substitute these measurements of e g rainfall temperature discharge or lake levels it is clear that financial and administrative challenges exist it must however be clear that only these measurements allow to analyse and plan water resources in a sustainable manor to plan for the future but also understand the past we need historical observations averages in the icr for several years indicate changes in water balance components in comparison to the mean using the mean icr for the period 2010 2020 changes of inflow into the lakes in comparison to mean discharge can be evaluated for lake baringo a difference to the mean of around 3 5 m³ s is found this means that the average inflow to the lake must have increased by this size simply to explain the observed surge in lake volume for the other lakes also due to their smaller catchments smaller values are found and range from 0 5 m³ s for bogoria 0 9 m³ s for nakuru 0 14 m³ s for solai 0 1 m³ s for elementaita and 1 2 m³ s for naivasha measurements of discharge if provided to stakeholders and science in a timely manner could allow for validation of these values additionally with discharge data runoff coefficients could be estimated with higher certainties which in our case had to be estimated purely based on numerical model outputs and are afflicted with large uncertainties the climate in eastern africa has shown substantial variability in the distant but also near past where distinct wet and dry periods occur we are currently again in such a wet period also in the context of the ability in differentiating between climate variability and human induced climate change it is very important to sustain and provide ground measurements of relevant hydrometeorological variables the long term observations within the nile basin see examples in the introduction highlight the benefit of these kind of measurements 5 summary and conclusions the lakes in the central rift valley of kenya have experienced extraordinary rises in their water levels since 2010 the increases in lake level areas and consequent inundations of the riparian areas have had significant negative impacts on the local communities since homes schools hospitals roads but also the basis for the local economy such as agricultural areas or tourism infrastructure like hotels have been submerged and rendered unusable intense country wide media coverage due to increases in the water levels have provoked public debates on the potential causes with expert opinions divided along geological anthropogenic and hydro climatic influences this study assessed potential hydro climatic influences covering the six most affected lakes the aim of this work was the systematic analysis and documentation of the trends and changes in lake areas lake levels and lake volumes for the period 1984 2020 and covering 37 years additionally a hydrometeorological analysis is performed to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the lake level rises apart from effective rainfall and actual evapotranspiration aet trends we also analyze changes in the integrated catchment response icr a magnitude derived from year to year lake volume changes and which reflects changes in the lake catchment water balance as data sources we use dahiti for information on lake properties over time chirps for rainfall and era5 land era5l for deriving actual evapotranspiration when possible and available data from ground observations are used for comparison and validation the work focuses on the main affected lakes which are baringo with a catchment area of 6609 km² bogoria 1060 km² nakuru 1471 km² solai 214 km² elementaita 772 km² and naivasha 3229 km² in relation to the mean of 1984 2009 the increases in lake areas ranges from 21 for lake naivasha to an extraordinary 123 for lake solai in december 2020 lake bogoria 28 is located in a deep depression where increases in water level do not show such a pronounced signal in water area lake baringo 59 in december 2020 and lake nakuru 70 just like lake solai are located in flatter basins similar to the adjacent lake naivasha lake elementaita shows lower variation and a lower increase of around 25 compared to values before 2010 largest fluctuation between minimum and maximum water level is found for lake solai with 8 53 m followed by baringo 8 23 m naivasha 7 48 m nakuru 6 40 m bogoria 4 99 m and finally elementaita with 2 38 m for most lakes the highest levels are found around 2013 2014 which are however surpassed in the year 2020 in which new records are observed the analysis of lake catchment rainfall time series shows that 2009 is a breakpoint year the time series 1981 2009 and 2010 2020 show different properties with noteworthy differences in the average rainfall values this matches well with observations in lake levels which were more or less constant in the period before 2009 in the period 2010 2020 rainfall increased by around 30 for the baringo bogoria and solai catchments in nakuru elementaita and naivasha the rainfall increases were lower and amount to 21 25 and 25 respectively after 2018 annual rainfall partially increased by even more than 50 in contrast the increases in era5l based aet are lower compared to changes in rainfall and lie around 14 for baringo and elementaita 13 for naivasha 11 for nakuru and 7 for bogoria and solai these increases are probably too low for 2010 2020 the integrated catchment response icr is positive corresponding to positive deviations in effective rainfall although the absolute differences between icr and deviation of effective chirps rainfall are high the signals show in the expected directions positive wet rainfall anomalies lead to an increase in the icr and vice versa the icr indicates that only small changes in water balance components explain the lake level rises i e 16 9 mm a baringo 14 6 mm a bogoria 19 4 mm a nakuru 20 6 mm a solai 3 8 mm a elementaita and 12 1 mm a for naivasha these values correspond to only around 0 4 2 of annual rainfall before the lake levels increased and are magnitudes which are difficult to observe especially when considering catchment wide rainfall from the icr changes in mean inflows compared to the mean when the lake is in an equilibrium can be evaluated for lake baringo the average inflow to the lake must have increased by at least 3 5 m³ s simply to explain the observed surge in lake volume for the other lakes also due to their smaller catchments smaller values are found and range from 0 5 m³ s for bogoria 0 9 m³ s for nakuru 0 14 m³ s for solai 0 1 m³ s for elementaita and 1 2 m³ s for naivasha the results clearly show the connection between effective rainfall and changes in lake areas and although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out and may play a role the analysis of the hydrometeorological trends shows that changes in boundary conditions e g changes in catchment properties due to anthropogenic influences intercatchment leakages changes in underground permeability are not necessary to explain the lake level rises generally the increases in effective rainfall are sufficient to explain the lake level rises we closely describe potential uncertainties in the analysis here we conclude that information from the ground observation network would significantly reduce speculative aspects and increase credibility of this analysis remotely sensed data cannot completely substitute the measurements of e g rainfall temperature discharge or lake levels these time series should be made available to the public and science for further analysis and understanding in this respect further analysis should include additional measurements from the ground e g for the analysis of changes in runoff coefficients since especially the ratios between eta and rainfall from era5l seem to be biased this work purely focused on the statistical analysis of time series of lake properties and hydro meteorological time series with the aim to describe and understand the underlying mechanisms leading to the observed changes analysis on seasonal level also including in situ data and other meteorological parameters such as air temperature should be part of future work important future work must also include the analysis of flood hazard flood exposition and flood risk stemming from the lake level rises it is clear that the current fluctuations in lake levels have been there in past probably with higher intensity at the same time the negative effects on the local population are not comparable higher population densities especially in the riparian areas and generally higher damage potentials are very different now in this context the analysis of the potential flood risk and generation of anticipatory flood risk maps considering continued lake levels rises constitute an important work for the future since it can allow to mitigate potential losses author contributions mh and lo designed the study mh gs and cs performed all analyses mh cs and

8201,study region the great rift valley lakes of kenya have recently experienced significant increases in their water levels negatively impacting the local communities this has provoked renewed concerns about the causations with various geological anthropogenic and hydro climatic influences hypothesized as potential causes of the water level rises study focus this study analyses and documents water level fluctuations in lakes baringo bogoria nakuru solai elementaita and naivasha hydrometeorological analyses are undertaken to understand potential causes and lake volume data is used to derive the integrated catchment response icr a magnitude which allows to relate changes in water balance components to signals observed in the lake volume changes new hydrological insights for the region compared to 1984 2009 the recent increases in lake areas range from 21 for lake naivasha to an extraordinary 123 for lake solai mean annual rainfall for 2010 2020 increased by up to 30 actual evapotranspiration also increased but to lesser extent compared to rainfall the results illustrate that changes in catchment properties due to anthropogenic influences or changes in underground permeability are not necessary to explain the lake level rises based on the icr only surprisingly minor changes in the water balance are necessary to explain the lake level rises since an increase of only 0 4 2 of mean annual effective rainfall leads to the observed phenomena keywords rift valley lakes lake level rises kenya rainfall evapotranspiration 1 introduction water resource systems across the globe are today being affected by a number of natural and anthropogenic factors gownaris et al 2018 jenny et al 2020 salmaso et al 2020 changes in climatic and land use conditions increased water demand from a growing human population and depletion of groundwater resources remain issues of key concern amongst water managers du preez and van huyssteen 2020 fishman 2018 flörke et al 2018 in sub saharan africa water resource systems are essential to local economies through supply of water for domestic and agricultural utilities fishery recreation and promotion of local tourism aura et al 2020 cowx and ogutu owhayo 2019 minale 2020 in eastern africa the rift valley lakes provide eco regions of great biodiversity considered today amongst the global200 freshwater ecoregions of the world fouchy et al 2018 olson and dinerstein 2002 however the rift valley lakes have witnessed upsurges in their lake water levels areas and volumes affecting not only the rich biodiversity but also the infrastructure and livelihoods of the local communities living within vicinity the situation has been aggravated more recently considering the continued above average rainfall being observed in the long rainy season wainwright et al 2020 lake turkana the largest permanent desert lake in the world has also shown substantial increases in water levels thereby affecting the local communities ojwang et al 2016 these trends of lake turkana generally contradict the forecasted negative impacts of the ongoing water resources projects being carried along the omo river in ethiopia which is considered the main water source for the lake avery and tebbs 2018 generally eastern africa has shown substantial variability of its climate in the distant to the near past where distinct wet and dry periods have been witnessed conway 2002 demenocal and rind 2019 nicholson 2019 sutcliffe and parks 1999 wainwright et al 2020 this led not only to drastic changes in lake levels finney et al 2019 goman et al

2019 sutcliffe and parks 1999 between 1961 and 1964 for example water levels in lake victoria rose by over two meters fig 3 2 in sutcliffe and parks 1999 and annual outflow from the lake through the victoria or white nile more than doubled in this same very short period of time fig 3 8 in sutcliffe and parks 1999 the water level rises in the lakes of the central rift valley of kenya have begun to receive some scientific reflections in the recent past onywere et al 2013 were the first to describe the phenomena of lake level rises including detailed descriptions of the affected lake properties building up on these findings obando et al 2016 illustrated the massive negative impacts of the flooding caused by the water level rises on the local population living within the riparian areas gichuru and waithaka 2015 similar to moturi 2015 focused their analyses on the trends of lake nakuru water surface variations between 1984 and 2013 concluding that no direct correlation between rainfall and changes in the lake surface area could be found more recently kiage and douglas 2020 assessed changes in land cover within the catchments of lake baringo bogoria nakuru and elementaita as a potential driver of the increasing lake water levels odongo et al 2015 analysed time series of precipitation and flow as well as annual mean lake volumes for the period 1960 2010 for lake naivasha to uncover possible abrupt shifts and gradual trends for the covered years which lie before the start of the recent lake level rises most river gauging stations showed no evidence of trends in the annual mean and maximum flows as well as seasonal flows rcmrd 2021 analysed the lake area increases for the period 06 2013 09 2020 and conclude that a detailed investigation into the lake water balances role of climatology lake catchment land use change land degradation and sediment yield into the lakes from the catchment as well as the role of geological activities including the status of the many geological fault and fissures in the region are key in understanding the underlying factors in the phenomenon although these studies show the development of the lake areas over time for single dates the time series are incomplete and the methods of lake area delineation from satellite imagery differ rainfall data is partially analysed however only for single ground stations and not necessarily for a longer period and no systematic hydroclimatic analysis exists additionally developments in lake levels and lake volumes have not yet been documented stimulated by country wide media coverage renewed increases in the lake water levels have recently provoked expert opinion and public debates on the potential causes of the water rises e g avery 2020 chebet 2018 chepkoech 2020 cherono 2021 omondi 2020a b wambua soi 2020 the expert discourses revolve around potential geological anthropogenic and hydro climatic influences geologically it is argued that the affected rift valley lakes all of which lie in closed basins without surface outlets are located in a geologically highly active zone in the earth s crust gregory 1896 smith 1989 consequently recent movement of tectonic plates in the region could have caused decreases in underground permeability thereby decreasing sub terranean outflow or seepage this process could be described as hasty hydrogeological instationarity the expert opinion is underlined by continued geothermal and volcanic activity witnessed within the entire region obando et al 2016 renaut et al 2017 smith 1989 tole 1996 the anthropogenic influences leading to hydrological changes consequent of land use and land cover lulc change and degradation of the catchment areas has also been hypothesised as an important reason for the lake level rises by the ministry of environment water and natural resources and water resources managers from administration chepkoech 2020 here it is argued that the potential sealing and clogging of the underground water paths due to higher sediment loads from the surrounding degraded catchments due to land use and land cover changes could have enhanced reduced permeability of the underground pathways in one way or the other with this it is further argued that increased sediment activation and erosion in the lake watersheds and in consequent higher siltation rates have impacted the lake volumes leading to the water levels rises this theory follows recent independent studies that have shown dwindled forest cover in upstream headlands due to human encroachment with agricultural land and peri urban areas having almost proportionately increased boitt 2016 kiage and douglas 2020 higher sediment inputs from the degraded lands consequently could probable be in favour of higher sediment yields hydrologically lulc changes often leads to higher surface runoff and less infiltration process thereby accelerating surface runoff and peak discharges on shorter time scales guzha et al 2018 this in turn affects the overall water balance on a longer time scale through decreased actual evapotranspiration andréassian 2004 precipitation and actual evapotranspiration constitute major hydro climatic drivers and components of the water balance since they define the atmospheric boundary conditions rising water levels can therefore also be explained by a deviation of inflow and on lake precipitation and or actual evapotranspiration from a magnitude that would result in an equilibrium in the lake water levels larger values in rainfall and or lower actual evapotranspiration compared to the mean values if the lake surfaces are in equilibrium would be the rational variations in lake volume is an integral response to potential changes not only in the catchment but also in the lake water balance whatever the cause for the lake level changes is kiage and douglas 2020 argue that all the above can potentially play a role in the lake level fluctuations a quantifiable magnitude can be derived by analysing changes in lake volume since they constitute an integrated catchment response changes in lake volume reflect potential influences due to deviations from an equilibrium regarding inflow and outflow lulc changes or hydro climatic changes these are the options publicly debated for the analysis of hydroclimatic changes time series of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration ideally available as catchment values are necessary the limited rainfall observations on the ground are important but exhibit some deficits related to uncertainties due to systematic and random errors in point measurements also they do not sufficiently capture the spatio temporal variability of rainfall in the drainage basins of the lake catchments e g rainfall in the valley floors is only 30 compared to rainfall in the head water catchments since the lakes are encircled by higher mountain ranges and escarpments kiage and douglas 2020 additionally the lake level rises are acute at point of writing 03 2021 the timely availability of time series from ground stations for a more or less online monitoring or rapid analysis is rarely given a number of reasons can be attributed to this including a lack of consistent maintenance and lack of financial resources as an alternative rainfall data estimated by remotely sensed satellite data and ideally corrected by local observations e g ashouri et al 2015 beck et al 2019 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 maidment et al 2014 tarnavsky et al 2014 or meteorological reanalysis data e g hersbach et al 2020 muñoz sabater 2019 rienecker et al 2011 rodell et al 2004a saha et al 2014 therefore constitute a potential alternative regarding actual evapotranspiration hardly any measured information is available on the ground this holds true not only for the study regions but is still generally a global challenge with few areas as exceptions baldocchi et al 2001 modelled actual evapotranspiration rates from meteorological reanalysis data can provide an alternative in this case e g muñoz sabater 2019 rodell et al 2004b although the data must be used with care considering the inherent associated uncertainties 1 1 research questions and objectives based on these guiding problems with respect to understanding the mechanisms behind the lake water level increases in the central kenya rift valley the following research questions and answers as objectives are aimed to be investigated in this research 1 what are the magnitudes in changes in lake characteristics i e water surface area water level and water volume over time i e for 1984 2020 a period of 37 years 2 how has catchment rainfall and actual evapotranspiration evolved over this period thereby also considering spatio temporal variability 3 what are the changes in lake water volume and how does this magnitude translate to changes in water balance components 4 are the derived changes in water volume observable trends in rainfall and actual evapotranspiration or are other causalities drivers for the lake level increases it is clear that the current fluctuations in lake levels have previously been there probably with higher intensity at the same time the negative effects on the local population are not comparable higher population densities especially in the riparian areas and generally higher damage potentials i e the upper limit of the loss or damage constituting all assets and affected persons which can potentially be damaged by the rising lake levels are very different now this in combination with widespread media coverage gives the whole phenomena an unprecedent focus also different from previous lake level fluctuations is our ability to observe these changes in space and time in unknown detail although local observation networks have deteriorated information based on remote sensing has exploded this makes this investigation and descriptions possible the main lakes in the central rift valley with different spatial catchment characteristics but also water quality properties as investigated lake baringo lake bogoria lake nakuru lake solai lake elementaita and lake naivasha 2 materials and methods 2 1 study lakes the study lakes are located in the central rift valley of kenya which is part of the east african rift system ranging from the gulf of aden at the horn of africa to the south of lake malawi between malawi and mozambique also denoted in fig 1 from north to south are the investigated lakes a baringo b bogoria c nakuru d solai e elementaita and f naivasha apart from the larger scale feature of the east african rift valley the western rift system running south in the western border of uganda is also visible from fig 1 in total the study area and lake basins cover an area of 13 355 km² the orographic catchment areas of the single lakes and other lake characteristics are summarized in table 1 fig 2 shows spatial characteristics of the central rift valley and gives an overview of the landscape the lakes are located panel a depicts the topography and elevation including the orographic catchment areas highlighting the fact that the lakes lie in closed basins where the lake is the sink and where no surface outlets are present the lakes are all located in the rift floor encircled by high mountain ranges and escarpments the lowest lake regarding lake level but also mean catchment elevation of 1722 m is baringo in the north and the highest is lake naivasha 2355 m in the south table 1 both lakes are freshwater despite high potential evapotranspiration rates the lakes have not become saline indicating that there is substantial underground loss of water through seepage which hinders the accumulation of dissolved solids through flushing becht et al 2006 darling et al 1996 1990 derakhshan 2017 yihdego and becht 2013 the smallest lakes regarding water and catchment area lake solai de bock et al 2009 goman et al 2017 nyaga et al 2019 with a mean catchment elevation of 1759 m also shows lower alkalinity indicating some loss through the underground probably leaking towards lake bogoria and baringo which lie in a downward elevation gradient to the north olago and mavuti 2017 bogoria nakuru and elementaita are in contrast highly saline which however does not mean that no underground seepage is present the magnitude of underground seepage will be lower compared to the freshwater lakes mccall 2010 generally a falling elevation gradient is evident from south to north from naivasha to baringo as can also be seen from the mean catchment and lake level elevations in table 1 although naivasha also leaks to the south towards lake magadi flow towards elementaita nakuru and bogoria is probable and is shown by others becht et al 2006 darling et al 1996 verschuren 2001 vegetation cover is indicated in panel b utilizing the mean annual ndvi lp daac 2015 vegetation density closely follows elevation with higher areas and escarpments e g aberdares east of naivasha the mau escarpment west of nakuru or the mountain ranges around the kerio valley east of bogoria and baringo showing higher vegetation cover areas of lower vegetation cover are evident in the rift floor e g elementaita badlands onywere et al 2013 and generally towards the north and east of the study area the vegetation cover has a very similar pattern compared to the rainfall distribution see fig 5 which makes sense vegetation and the hydro meteorological system is water limited landcover although already generalized for mapping is heterogeneous fig 2 panel c where climate allows agriculture and cropland define the landcover systematic irrigation is limited to areas with water supply e g around lake naivasha a mix of shrub trees and herbaceous cover are characteristic for the rift floor whereas the manifestation of the composition depends on small scale climatic aspects and mainly rainfall distribution higher elevation areas show a landcover dominated by tree and herbaceous cover east of the study area the laikipia plains are dominated by shrub and herbaceous cover fig 3 shows the investigated lakes in more detail and thereby visualizing the water occurrence mask from 1984 to 2020 especially for lake baringo nakuru and naivasha but also the smallest lake solai a large variability and expansion in lake area is visible lake baringo kiage and douglas 2020 obando et al 2016 odada et al 2006 onywere et al 2013 is internationally recognized for its biodiversity but is also important to the communities in its basin as a source of water for domestic and agricultural use and watering livestock other important uses are income generation through tourism biodiversity conservation and fishing three indigenous human communities live in the basin namely the ilchamus pokots and tugens seasonal rivers that drain into the lake include ol arabel makutan tangulbei endao and chemeron perkerra and molo are perennial and significantly lower discharges are characteristic during dry season lake baringo experiences very high annual evaporation rates 1650 2300 mm compared to an annual rainfall of 450 900 mm and therefore lake levels depend heavily on inflows from rivers originating from the humid parts of the drainage basin where the annual rainfall varies between 1100 mm and 2700 mm onywere et al 2013 conductivity is reported to be around 1760 μs cm de bock et al 2009 or 894 4 μs cm obando et al 2016 the orographic catchment size is around 6610 km² the region around lake baringo is presently inundated with several hotels and rural infrastructure including homes agricultural fields and grazing areas dispensaries health centres and schools being affected obando et al 2016 about 5000 people living around the area have been displaced by the flood inundation avery 2020 lake bogoria agembe et al 2016 mccall 2010 renaut et al 2017 is located in a deep depression with comparatively steeper slopes than lakes baringo or nakuru although the lake level increases when measured in absolute number are high the steeper topography of the surrounding area limits the spread of flood waters mostly to the north of the lake the lake is located within a national reserve where important infrastructure related to tourism have been affected and rendered unusable most geothermal springs associated with the lake region and a prominent touristic attraction have been submerged renaut et al 2017 the lake is highly alkaline with a conductivity of 31 046 μs cm obando et al 2016 the catchment area is around 1060 km² receiving around mean annual rainfall of 1035 mm for the period 1981 2020 with increasing water levels of lake bogoria there is renewed concern that the alkaline lake will overflow and merge with the freshwater lake baringo located about 20 km to the north thereby causing severe cross contamination chepkoech 2020 lake nakuru kiage and douglas 2020 kimaru et al 2019 obando et al 2016 onywere et al 2013 is surrounded and protected by a national park established in 1961 and which covers 188 km² the lake is a ramsar site of wetlands of international importance lake nakuru national park is the only park within kenya to be entirely fenced protective measures within the park have helped threatened species including the famous black rhino to repopulate lake nakuru is also famous for its spectacular bird populations including both the lesser and greater flamingo who rely on the algae in the lake the increases in the lake water levels have changed the water quality of the normally alkaline saline lake oduor and schagerl 2007 leading to loss of the algae abundance in consequence a vast number of flamingos have left kiage and douglas 2020 report on the hyper salinity with conductivity values of up to 160 000 μs cm however without reference date obando et al 2016 report on a conductivity of 49 000 μs cm lake nakuru is fed by the baharini spring on its eastern shoreline four seasonal rivers and the permanent ngosur river the seasonal rivers are the njoro nderit makalia and lamudhiak all of which originate in the eastern mau forest mean annual catchment rainfall is 1013 mm for the period 1981 2020 the overall catchment size is around 1471 km² flood inundation around lake nakuru affect the existing national park and road infrastructure thereby limiting accessibility since about 60 of the park are inaccessible onywere et al 2013 other damages to the infrastructure e g flooding of the main administrative block also negatively affect tourism activities and the local economy that depends on this obando et al 2016 lake solai de bock et al 2009 goman et al 2017 nyaga et al 2019 the smallest of the study lakes and until now not considered in an analysis of lake level and lake area variation is located about 50 km north of nakuru town and 20 km southeast of lake bogoria it has a drainage basin of only 214 km² and also does not have a surface outflow rainfall is comparable to lake bogoria with a mean annual value of 1023 mm a open water conductivity measured in 2003 and 2004 had a range of 776 111 2398 166 μs cm de bock et al 2009 maximum values of 2900 μs cm are reported by nyaga et al 2019 lake elementaita with a mean water surface area of 18 8 km² lies 20 km south of lake nakuru and around 40 km north of naivasha the highly alkaline sodium carbonate salts and shallow lake is characterised by hypersaline waters with an electric conductivity between 12 000 and 40 000 μs cm kiage and douglas 2020 the catchment area is the smallest after solai and covers an area of 772 km² lake elementaita receives the least rainfall of all investigated lakes 914 mm a damage potential in riparian areas around elementaita but also lake solai is low the effects of the lake level rise are therefore at least the ones directly aimed towards society comparatively low lake naivasha becht et al 2005 maina et al 2018 to the south has an orographic catchment area of 2355 km² and receives around 13 more rainfall compared to elementaita 1030 mm a the mean lake area is 128 8 km² and after baringo it is the second largest lake in the study agembe et al 2016 report of conductivity values ranging from 250 to 400 μs cm for lake naivasha impacts on the lake level increases can be said to be relatively lower the long term economic history and tradition around the lake becht et al 2005 ricciardi 1981 also including a longer history of scientific research of the area has also led to a stronger awareness of potential hazard from flooding since the current fluctuations are not unprecedented richardson 1966 verschuren 2001 larger parts of the riparian zones surrounding lake naivasha are generally dominated by tourism infrastructure and more pronounced industrial agriculture and flower farms targeted mainly for export to other parts of the world lake naivasha has a satellite lake to the west small lake or lake oloiden which is not covered in our analysis 2 2 data basis in this work i the database for hydrological time series over inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2020 2019 2015 ii climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 dataset and iii era5 land muñoz sabater 2019 dataset are the main data basis used for analyzing lake properties and hydro meteorological conditions over time in the study area the merit hydro dem yamazaki et al 2019 is used for delineating orographic catchment boundaries 2 2 1 database for hydrological time series over inland waters dahiti changes in lake volume can be derived by integrating ground measurements of lake levels and lake area estimates e g from satellite imagery for the study lakes however no complete measurements on lake levels exist as an alternative altimeter satellites with the capacity to measure water level have proven reliability over time from previous applications crétaux et al 2011 göttl et al 2016 santos da silva et al 2010 villadsen et al 2016 information on the binary signal regarding water cover can be derived through systematic analysis of electromagnetic waves emitted due to specific surface properties applying different combinations of spectral bands to derive a numerical number which is subordinated to a threshold value for water herndon et al 2020 kiage and douglas 2020 several global products on water cover based on remote sensing data exist e g carroll et al 2017 hakimdavar et al 2020 klein et al 2017 pekel et al 2016 one of the global products the database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti busker et al 2019 schwatke et al 2020 2015 offers additional valuable information on properties of water bodies also including a description of uncertainty dahiti provides a variety of hydrological information on lakes reservoirs rivers and wetlands derived from satellite data i e from multi mission satellite altimetry and optical remote sensing imagery the comprehensive data set spanning the period 1984 to near present contains consistent information on time series on lake areas lake volumes altimetry and bathymetry which are very relevant for the current challenges in the central rift valley lakes of kenya in this study dahiti is utilized to describe the surface area water level and volume variations the lake surface area data is derived based on optical image analyses of landsat and sentinel 2 the surface area time series of dahiti is a continuous dataset ranging from 1984 to near present schwatke et al 2019 dahiti also uses satellite altimetry to derive water level data from wetlands reservoirs and other inland water bodies the volume variations of dahiti is calculated based on the combination of water surface area and water level time series based on the dependency of these two variables a hypsometry model is computed based on the new modified strahler approach all hydrological products provided in the dahiti dataset are developed and maintained by the deutsches geodätisches forschungsinstitut der technischen universität münchen dgfi tum they are free of charge and publicly available on the dahiti website https dahiti dgfi tum de dahiti contains the data of the lakes baringo dahiti id 13 608 bogoria 13 607 nakuru 13 220 solai 13 609 elementaita 13 611 naivasha 13 610 and oloiden 17 681 2 2 1 1 lake surface areas for the calculation of high resolution time variable water surfaces optical images of landsat and sentinel 2 are used to identify surface water areas from 1984 to near present as a first step a water land mask is extracted by using five different water indexes accompanied by an automated threshold computation the combination of five different water indexes is used because no optimal water index exists for all areas the water indexes used to derive the land water mask include the modified normalized difference water index mndwi new water index nwi automated water extraction index for non shadow areas aweinsh automated water extraction index for shadow areas aweish and the tasseled cap for wetness tcwet by combining these five indexes their unique advantages can be used to finally achieve a daily land water mask all pixels classified as water by four or five indexes will be represented as water pixels that are classified as water by none or only one index are set to land all other pixels classified as water by two or three indexes are set to data gaps and are filled in the following step in the second step data gaps occurring due to different causes e g voids cloud cover are filled by using a long term water probability mask this mask is finally used iteratively to fill the data gaps which leads to a gap reduced surface area time series for lakes and reservoirs the correlation of surface water and water levels from in situ and satellite altimetry has increased significantly from 0 61 to 0 86 after filling the data gaps of lake surfaces this demonstrates the quality improvement by filling the data gaps as well as the enhanced reliability of the approach schwatke et al 2019 as reference and comparison data to the dahiti lake area lake area values published in kiage and douglas 2020 obando et al 2016 and onywere et al 2013 are additionally used 2 2 1 2 lake water levels initially satellite altimetry was designed to monitor water levels over oceans however for almost two decades satellite altimetry has been proven to have the potential to observe rivers and small lakes with reliable accuracies the advantage of satellite altimetry is that even in remote areas without local infrastructure water levels can be estimated quite accurately since most satellite missions follow specific ground tracks inland water bodies are only crossed by chance big water bodies have therefore a higher probability of being crossed compared to small ones additionally the temporal resolution is also limited to 10 35 days due to the respective orbit repetition configuration of the specific satellite mission therefore in dahiti multiple satellite altimeter systems are combined to increase the temporal and spatial resolution schwatke et al 2015 altimeter data provided by different missions including envisat ers 2 jason 1 2 3 topex poseidon saral altika and sentinel 3a 3b are utilised for the dahiti dataset the dahiti method for estimation of water level time series incorporates three main steps of data processing namely data pre processing kalman filtering and postprocessing the pre processing step includes range corrections computation of height errors and outlier rejection the last step is to merge all water levels derived from the previous steps to form a single time series schwatke et al 2015 dahiti yields a very accurate water level time series estimation for inland water bodies the validation shows root mean square errors between 4 and 36 cm for lakes compared to in situ measurements generally an increase in accuracy could be achieved compared to other available altimeter data bases schwatke et al 2015 in this study the water level series of the lakes baringo 2004 2020 bogoria 2016 2020 nakuru 2016 2020 solai 2016 2020 elementaita 2012 2020 naivasha 2012 2020 and oloiden not available cover different periods because the lakes are crossed by different available altimeter mission 2 2 1 3 lake volume variation the dahiti database also includes data of volume variations of inland water bodies the volume variations are calculated based on the lake surface area and the water level time series within the dahiti database schwatke et al 2020 the estimation of volume variations is based on three steps i estimation of hypsometry ii computation of bathymetry and iii calculation of the volume variation the water area water level relationship of each lake is described by the hypsometry the hypsometry again depends on the lake s bathymetry in the past linear or polynomial functions have frequently been used to fit a hypsometric curve to every water body nevertheless they do not capture the entire variations of the area height relation therefore schwatke et al 2020 utilize a modified strahler model developed in 1952 the strahler model strahler 1952 was originally developed to relate the horizontal cross sectional area to the relative elevation above the basin outlet water levels and surface areas are mostly not obtained on the same date therefore only data pairs whose temporal difference is less than 10 days is used to establish the hypsometry this maximizes the number of data pairs and minimizes possible errors as a pre processing step to derive the bathymetry of inland water bodies the water level of each surface area obtained has to be estimated therefore the established hypsometric curve is also used to derive a water level time series this method minimizes errors from altimetry but other errors due to extrapolation or time dependent changes might occur the bathymetry is then calculated using the land water masks and the according water levels in a descending order to calculate the height of the bathymetry each pixel column is processed separately using a median filter of the size five for the land water mask in the direction of decreasing water levels uncertainties of corrupt land water pixels are reduced schwatke et al 2020 finally the volume variation time series of each lake can be computed the volume variations are calculated based on the bathymetry and a combination of water levels obtained from satellite altimetry and the estimated water levels based on the hypsometric curve to compute the volume below the respective water level the water level is intersected pixel wise with the bathymetry which has a spatial resolution of 30 m these pixel volumes of the current water level are then accumulated to obtain a volume above the minimum observed surface area it is important to note that the volume below the minimum observed value is unknown and that with this approach only volume variations can be computed since not the complete bathymetry is known due to the short periods of water level time series from satellite altimetry the computed hypsometry is used to derived additional water levels from surface areas this allows us to densify and to extend the water level time series until 1984 2 2 2 rainfall data the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps environmental record is a quasi global 50 s 50 n high resolution 0 05 daily pentadal and monthly precipitation dataset the chirps dataset builds on previous approaches to smart interpolation techniques and high resolution long period of record precipitation estimates based on infrared cold cloud duration ccd observations the algorithm i is built around a 0 05 climatology that incorporates satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations ii incorporates daily pentadal and monthly 1981 present 0 05 ccd based precipitation estimates iii blends station data to produce a preliminary information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks and iv uses a novel blending procedure incorporating the spatial correlation structure of ccd estimates to assign interpolation weights funk et al 2015 several global data sets of rainfall some of which are referred to in the introduction could have been used for this study our decision to use chirps is based on several studies applying chirps in east africa which showed comparatively better performances and agreements of chirps with station data e g dinku et al 2018 2007 kimani et al 2017 omonge et al 2021 also recently kimaru et al 2019 modelled the inflows to lake nakuru using chirps rainfall as input apart from chirps rainfall data from the ground stations nakuru meteorological station and snake farm meteorological station on the shores of lake baringo both time series digitalized from plots in kiage and douglas 2020 are used as reference for the remote sensing rainfall product chirps 2 2 3 evapotranspiration data and effective rainfall for the current study data derived from the newest reanalysis product of ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts is used the era5 land era5l dataset with global coverage thereby provides gap free time series with monthly and hourly resolution for 15 meteorological variables for the period 1981 to near present muñoz sabater 2019 yang and giusti 2020 here we used monthly averages which were processed via google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 era5 land is a derivative of the era5 climate reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 however only covering the terrestrial components with an improved spatio temporal resolution era5 land has a spatial resolution of 0 1 arc degrees compared to the grid size of era5 with of 0 25 arc degrees the temporal resolution of era5 land is 1 h while era5 has a coarser 3 h resolution there is no data assimilation applied to era5 land but observations are indirectly implemented via the assimilated atmospheric fields of era5 yang and giusti 2020 for the current study actual evapotranspiration and the ratio between actual evapotranspiration aet and rainfall and thus indirectly the runoff coefficient see eq 1 is derived from era5l potential evapotranspiration pet is also used for plotting to characterize the climate in the lake basins the unitless runoff coefficient is defined as 1 r c q r r a e t r 1 a e t r with rc runoff coefficient q runoff mm r rainfall mm and aet actual evapotranspiration mm the difference between aet and r is the effective rainfall 2 3 integrated catchment response icr relating changes in lake volume to potential changes in the water balance and inflows to the lakes over time understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to the lake level fluctuations necessitate an analysis of the temporal characteristics of the water balance and inflows to the lakes bringing the storage term to the left the following longer term water balance equation for a lake watershed can be defined all units in mm 2 s r q g w a e t q o u t r c r q g w q o u t r a e t r r q g w q o u t m

watersheds aet to the actual catchment evapotranspiration including evaporation from the lake surface rc to the runoff coefficient see eq 1 and qout to runoff from the lake i e outflow through a surface water body or the seepage into the underground the lake volume variation data from dahiti allows to quantify the magnitude of changes to be expected on the right hand side of the water balance equation since s integrates potential changes occurring the catchment the year to year lake volume variation data is in combination with orographic catchment area used to derive a magnitude for every year t which we refer to as integrated catchment response icr mm 3 i c r t s t k m 3 s t 1 k m 3 10 12 a r e a k m ² 10 6 m m in eq 3 the difference in lake volume variation s from one year to the next is calculated and converted from km³ to dm³ and is then normalized by the orographic catchment area area which is converted from km² to m² this results in the unit mm for the icr which is then used as a comparison to changes in water balance components e g rainfall icr is based on the satellite derived lake volume variation data normalized by catchment area and indicates to which extent catchment water balance components changed from one year to the next to result in a change in lake volume the analysis thereby focuses on deviations from long term means of periods when the lake was in an equilibrium and the surface areas and volumes did not change significantly over time 2 4 time series analysis for analysing changes in the hydrometeorological characteristics explorative statistics and visual inspection of different time series is used these analyses include time series in rainfall aet and ratios between aet and rainfall but also lake properties such as lake areas potential trends in time series are evaluated by comparing averages of different periods for evaluating breakpoints in time series the method described in bai and perron 2003 and zeileis et al 2003 are implemented in the current study 3 results 3 1 overview relative changes in lake areas and observed trends in catchment rainfall although interannual fluctuations were present regarding lake areas before 2010 a pronounced increase is evident from satellite based observations congested into the dahiti dataset after 2010 fig 4 the range of increase in relation to the mean values of 1984 2009 depends on the topographical setting of the lakes see also fig 3 and ranges from 21 for lake naivasha to an extraordinary 123 for lake solai in december 2020 lake bogoria 28 is located in a deep depression where increases in water level do not show a pronounced signal in water area lake baringo 59 in december 2020 and lake nakuru 70 just like lake solai are located in flatter basins where an increase in water level leads to a larger signal and increase in lake area similar to the adjacent lake naivasha lake elementaita shows lower variation and a lower increase of around 25 since 2010 visual inspection of the relationship between rainfall and lake area fluctuations in fig 4 clearly shows the reaction of deficits brownish shaded bars and surpluses blueish shaded bars in fig 4 of rainfall variability in signals in lake area in baringo bogoria and solai rainfall surpluses of larger than 25 compared to the long term mean of 1984 2009 lead to the exceptional increases in lake area for nakuru elementaita and naivasha at least around 2010 rainfall surpluses lie around 25 but three wet subsequent years lead to the observed increases in lake areas before 2010 wetter years and partially wetter periods are visible where the magnitudes of surpluses in rainfall are however lower these periods are characterized by steady or slightly increasing lake areas for all lakes and after 2018 rainfall anomalies in the catchment rainfall exceed 50 leading to further increases in lake levels an important component and driver of the water balance of the lakes is therefore rainfall fig 5 shows a more detailed temporal development of the mean annual rainfall sums for the orographic lake catchments for the period 1981 2020 as orange dashed line meteorological station data from snake farm lake baringo and nakuru meteorological station data extracted from kiage and douglas 2020 using tools provided by rohatgi 2020 are shown as comparison for the remote sensing derived areal means for the basins the two rainfall curves chirps station data match quite well for nakuru regarding interannual variability and generally mean values for longer time periods in contrast the snake farm rainfall time series shows a more pronounced interannual variability compared to chirps also before the year 2000 the longer term means are lower compared to the remotely sensed data the differences in variability may be explained by spatio temporal variability of the rainfall process the mean basin value represents the rainfall for an area of over 6600 km² with an elevation range of around 963 3014 m table 1 this value will be smoother compared to a point observation deviations from the mean are smaller as shown in figs a1 and a2 resulting in the conclusion that although the mean is different the temporal variability shows a better agreement tabulated data on annual rainfall is documented in table a1 why did we relate annual rainfall to the mean of 1984 2009 in fig 4 the rainfall in all lake basins shows a changepoint in year 2009 vertical dashed line in fig 5 due to a structural change in the time series the breakpoints were thereby objectively calculated following the method described in bai and perron 2003 and zeileis et al 2003 and which are implemented in the r package strucchange team r development core 2018 zeileis et al 2002 this means that the longer term means substantially differ between 1981 2009 and 2010 2020 as can be seen by the different dashed lines labeled with the respective means as can be seen from fig 5 the long term mean rainfall for the period 1981 2020 is similar for nearly all lake basins and lies around 1010 1040 mm a lake elementaita basin however is around 10 drier with a mean basin value of around 900 mm a parts of the basin especially in the rift valley floor receives less than 700 mm annual rainfall with elementaita badlands gilgil and marigat areas receiving the least 500 mm onywere et al 2013 for the 11 years following 2009 the annual rainfall mean increases by around 28 265 mm baringo 27 264 mm bogoria 20 193 mm nakuru 27 260 mm solai and 23 201 mm 24 231 mm and for elementaita and naivasha also see figs a1 and a2 for plots on deviations in and mm it is interesting to observe that although a change point in rainfall is already found for the year 2009 the signal in the changes rises in lake areas is lagged and occurs approximately one year later this is confirmed when calculating the correlation between lagged rainfall and lake area fig 6 with the exception of lake solai the largest correlation values are found with a rainfall lag of one year lake solai has the smallest orographic catchment area of 214 km² and the reaction of rainfall on the lake area is therefore more immediate and the highest correlation is also found for a lag of 0 years the same is the case for elementaita which also has a comparatively small catchment area of 772 km² although the highest correlation for baringo is found with a lag of one year the correlation of lag with the year two is not very much smaller this means that the memory of rainfall regarding lake area is longer and that it takes longer that a reaction of rainfall is visible in a signal in the lake area this corresponds well with the fact that the lake baringo basin with 6609 km² is the largest among the investigated lakes and that size does matter in this case correlation values for monthly data is documented in the appendix in fig a4 3 2 spatial trends in rainfall the drier rift valley floors e g between lake naivasha and lake elementaita or south of lake baringo are also visible in fig 7 a which depicts the spatial distribution of the long term mean annual rainfall for the overall period with data 1981 2020 from fig 7 a it is also visible that the highest rainfall sums and thus most significant water contributions to the lakes are to be expected in higher elevation zones like the aberdares range east of lake naivasha the mau escarpment to the west of lake nakuru or the mountain range south east of lake baringo whilst in the lower valley floors annual rainfall of 500 1000 mm a can be expected the upper elevation zones receive up to 2000 mm a on the long term average generally a mean increase in rainfall as a function of altitude of around 24 mm 100 m is found for the study area and on an annual scale as was already shown for the time series of basin average rainfall values changes in rainfall over time have occurred the spatial distribution of the temporal rainfall trend for the period 1981 2020 in mm a for the study region is shown in fig 7 b the lowest at least in absolute number increases are found in the rift valley floor with an increase of 0 10 mm a in contrast highest increases are found for higher elevated areas at the top of the escarpments with increases of slightly above 15 mm a generally an upward increasing trend in rainfall is found for all lake basins a comparison of the four decades between 1981 and 2020 fig 7 c f shows that until 2000 rainfall was mostly around or below the long term mean of 1981 2020 especially after 2010 however noteworthy positive deviations in rainfall are visible this decade being much wetter compared to the long term mean for the entire study region this agrees with recently published data by wainwright et al 2020 fig a3 shows mean annual rainfall and temporal trends in rainfall for kenya for the same periods for the majority of the country for the overall period 1981 2010 a positive trend is visible fig a3 b the highest increases are found west of the study region between mt elgon and lake victoria although an overall positive trend is found for most areas in the country the maps show a regionally more heterogenous picture in the single decades fig a3 c f with regions being drier and wetter compared to the long term mean this is especially the case for the periods before 2011 after 2011 however wetter conditions are found for all nearly all regions with the exception of an area east of garissa and around the coast towards somalia fig a3 f 3 3 changes in lake areas and lake levels over time the time series analysis of rainfall showed that 2009 was a breakpoint after which catchment rainfall characteristics changed and a noteworthy increase in the average of rainfall occurred after this year this also matches well with the succeeding rising signals in lake level displayed in figs 8 and 9 which document in absolute numbers km² and m the temporal developments of lake areas and lake levels the green bars depict mean annual values which are connected by a dashed line in case of missing annual data the points are linearly connected additionally the mean monthly data available is displayed as grey crosses the coloring of horizontal lines on top of the bars shows the number of observations per year uncertainties in the estimates are shown as light blue error bars the completeness of the time series varies depending on the lake whereas after 1999 complete time series are available for most lakes with the exception of lake nakuru with one missing year and lake naivasha with several years missing before 1999 fewer data points are available and even if annual values are displayed the number of underlying data points of single years is rather low this is due to scanty satellite imagery available before this time nevertheless general trends can also be depicted for most lakes in the 1980s and 1990s it is important to note that the data of lake baringo for the year 2012 is probably biased since only two observations in january are available so that potential lake level rises during this year are not appropriately captured the tabulated annual values can be found in the appendix table a2 to our knowledge lake area and water level data in this consistent form has previously not been available for the study lakes when comparing the absolute values of lake levels to previous data it must be considered that the reference elevation may be different dahiti provides orthometric height which are related to a geoid model the relative changes however are consistent the temporal patterns of lake areas and levels correlate between the lakes and with the exception of lake naivasha show correlations values of above 0 8 to 0 9 fig a5 due to intensive water use e g for irrigation purposes the lake area and level of naivasha is anthropogenically influenced onywere et al 2013 what may also explain the lower correlation values lowest lake levels in naivasha are found in 2009 the figures again show that lake areas and levels closely follow rainfall fluctuations reacting to wetter and drier periods the reaction of the lakes with the smallest catchment and surface areas lake solai and elementaita show the fastest and most pronounced reaction to rainfall fluctuations this also corresponds to the correlation between lagged rainfall and lake area shown in fig 6 and fig a4 lake baringo and nakuru exhibited the smallest areas and lowest levels in 1995 with 118 3 and 33 1 km² and lake levels of 971 4 and 1759 8 m bogoria showed the second lowest levels in 1995 31 9 km² which is slightly higher compared to the absolute minimum of 31 5 km² in 2006 data for solai and elementaita show that the lowest lake area extents occurred in the 1984 and 1987 with 3 3 km² 1005 9 m and 15 1 km² 1775 9 m respectively different characteristics regarding the occurrence of the minimum lake area is found for naivasha here a value of 104 9 km² 1880 m is found in the year 2009 lake baringo s largest extent at least measured as a mean annual value occurred in 2014 with 197 1 km² this is also the case for solai 11 7 km² and elementaita 21 9 km² from fig 8 and fig 9 it is however evident that the trends in the monthly data grey crosses show a steep increase in 2020 where the latest observations in december 2020 exceed all previous measurements this is the case for all lakes accordingly largest mean annual lake areas lake levels of 41 2 km² 998 1 m 62 3 km² 1766 2 m and 147 7 km² 1887 5 m are found for bogoria nakuru and naivasha in 2020 largest difference or largest fluctuation between minimum and maximum water level is found for lake solai with 8 53 m followed by baringo 8 23 m naivasha 7 48 m nakuru 6 40 m bogoria 4 99 m and finally elementaita with 2 38 m for most lakes the highest levels are found around 2013 2014 which are however surpassed in the year 2020 in which new records are evident fig 9 in fig 8 published lake area data available for baringo bogoria nakuru and naivasha is additionally plotted as reference for bogoria and nakuru the independent area estimations mostly match quite well this is also the case for the data from kiage and douglas 2020 which also matches well in baringo this is not necessarily surprising and can be explained with the fact that kiage and douglas 2020 also used the modified normalized difference water index mndwi to delineate the lake surfaces and mndwi is one of the indexes used in dahiti for baringo and naivasha larger deviations are evident when comparing our results with obando et al 2016 and onywere et al 2013 who both manually delineated water areas for satellite imagery for the respective lakes maximum water surface areas in onywere et al 2013 are documented for september 2013 baringo 231 6 km² and october 2013 naivasha 169 9 km² obando et al 2016 find december 2014 baringo 219 8 km² and december 2013 naivasha 1652 km² evaluating our data for the years 2013 and 2014 maximum lake extent in dahiti is found in january 2014 for baringo 199 5 km² and september 2014 for naivasha 139 9 km² for baringo the difference to onywere et al 2013 is thus 32 1 km² or 16 1 and 20 1 km² 10 1 in comparison to obando et al 2016 for naivasha the deviation compared to onywere et al 2013 is 30 1 km² 21 5 and 25 3 km² 18 1 in comparison to obando et al 2016 both lakes have fringing swamps and submerged vegetation this vegetation is dynamic and follows water level fluctuations garcia benedito 2019 a possible explanation for the differences could therefore be that these riparian areas where not identified as water surfaces in the automatic classification scheme of dahiti since the water signal was too weak and vegetation dominated the signal in contrast during manual classification the expert can decide to classify these areas as water maybe due to additional knowledge from a field visit a comparison and visual inspection of fig 2 in onywere et al 2013 and the land water mask from dahiti for october 2013 fig a6 seem to indicate this where larger differences in water classification are evident in the northern part of lake naivasha from fig a6 these areas look like fringing swamps and water coverage is not evident in contrast the expansion of water in these areas is visible in fig a7 which shows the situation in july 2020 additionally for naivasha obando et al 2016 and onywere et al 2013 both included lake oloiden a small satellite lake west of lake naivasha in their estimations of water surface area for naivasha fig 10 shows the surface area of oloiden based on dahiti data at the low water level in 2010 lake oloiden had developed alkalinity that allowed a large population of flamingos to inhabit it onywere et al 2013 when adding the maximum extent of lake oloiden in 2013 and 2014 5 6 km² to our estimates a sum of 145 43 km² is found which is however still substantially smaller the deviation compared to onywere et al 2013 is still 24 5 km² 16 8 and 19 7 km² 13 6 in comparison to obando et al 2016 lake oloiden was not included in the systematic analysis of the study lakes since no altimetry and in consequence volume data is available 3 4 trends in lake volume and water balance components fig 11 depicts the temporal development of the lake volume variation km³ for the study lakes the lake volume variation thereby shows the water volume in the lakes above a threshold value which corresponds to the observed surface area within the period 1984 2020 the data therefore does not show the total lake volume since the bathymetric conditions below the lowest observed water level are unknown for this information bathymetric surveys would be necessary as has e g been done by maina et al 2018 for lake naivasha and lake oloiden maina et al 2018 report a total volume of 0 72 km³ for lake naivasha in the year 2016 our lake volume variation data shows a value of around 0 25 km³ for 2016 leading to the conclusion that the difference of 0 47 km³ of water was stored in lake naivasha during the lowest period of available observation in dahiti since we are interested in the year to year changes in water volume the data is nevertheless sufficient for brevity we will use the term lake volume in the following with the exception of lake naivasha which experienced a decline in water volume until around 1990 the other lakes show little interannual variability and fairly stable conditions until around 2010 only after this period after which rainfall characteristics changed see vertical lines in fig 5 in the year 2009 lake volumes substantially increased compared to 1984 2009 annual rainfall increased by around 25 in 2010 and after 2018 by even more than 50 noticeable is also that single months in the year 2020 are substantially larger compared to the mean annual value this can be explained with the very wet second half year of 2020 which led to a strong increase in lake volume fig 11 fig a7 for fig 12 the difference in year to year lake volume variation data is in combination with orographic catchment area used to derive a magnitude for every year which we refer to as integrated catchment response icr mm interannual changes in lake volume follow rainfall anomalies shown in the upper section of the plots similar patterns can be detected especially after 2000 when the lake data situation becomes more consistent before 2000 single values are present but unfortunately do not allow to judge on reaction of wet rainfall anomalies on icr striking since suspicious is the icr of 2013 with a value of over 140 mm for lake baringo the reason is probably unrepresentative data for the year 2012 in this whole year only two data point are observed in the dry season month of january biasing the picture in nature mean lake volume variation of 2012 was probably higher since lake level already increased during the whole year 2012 since icr is calculated as the difference between lake volume of 2013 and 2012 a bias is present already in the previous figures of lake area level and volume variation the clear discontinuity at baringo of 2012 was unrealistic the structure of the lake volume variation and the icr probably followed a pattern observed at lake naivasha or lake nakuru the larger lakes it is however important to note that averaging over several years eliminates this bias icr indicates to which extent catchment water balance components changed from one year to the next to result in a change in lake volume a comparison of water balance components is reasonable for the averages of over 2 5 years also considering the temporal correlation structure between lagged rainfall and lake signal shown in fig 6 the number of years also depends on lake catchment area since smaller lakes like solai will probably have a smaller storage a small torrent shows immediate reaction to rainfall the effects on runoff and flood will however vanish comparatively fast accordingly lake solai with a catchment of only 214 km² which is only 3 of the baringo basin shows particular immediate responses to rainfall anomalies resulting in the somewhat choppy picture of the icr in fig 12 considering means of several years and thereby neglecting interannual storage in the catchment several scenarios are feasible they depend on potential trends in the boundary conditions e g underground seepage intercatchment leakages and meteorological drivers i e rainfall actual evapotranspiration and include i no change from one year to the next in lake levels could mean that rainfall evapotranspiration boundary conditions subterranean inflow or seepage are stable and stationary so that the lake stays in an equilibrium ii an increase in lake volume from one year to the next could mean that rainfall has increased or evapotranspiration has decreased again that assuming stable seepage iii again assuming otherwise constant boundary conditions a decrease in the lake level could mean that rainfall has decreased or evapotranspiration has increased scenarios i to iii can clearly become more complex when potential changes or interactions between rainfall and evapotranspiration are considered namely when they change in such a way that they enhance or compensate each other lake levels can remain constant when rainfall increases but also actual evapotranspiration increases with the same magnitude at the same time lake levels can also stay constant if rainfall decreases and actual evapotranspiration decreases apart from this interplay of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration changes in boundary conditions can have similar effects at this point we ignore these and assume that they are stable over time subsurface outflow intercatchment leakages to other lake basins are present but are also stable over time we are simplifying the domain of analysis in fig 12 we only showed rainfall anomalies which however were at least regarding temporal trends closely followed by the icr apart from rainfall actual evapotranspiration is especially important in the water limited systems the lakes are located here potentially a much larger amount of water could be lost to the atmosphere than is available with the exception of the lake surface potential evapotranspiration pet from era5l ranges from around 3020 mm a in baringo to 2225 mm a in the solai catchment fig a8 in relation to era5l rainfall pet is 2 65 baringo to 1 2 solai times higher compared to rainfall fig a9 with the exception of single years in solai the catchments are always water limited actual evapotranspiration based on era5l aet fig a10 is as expected much lower compared to pet interannual variability in aet is high and follows rainfall anomalies very low outliers in aet in single years occur during dry years or periods the direction of longer term trends in aet also follows rainfall with lower values before 2009 however no breakpoint year is found for 2009 for era5l aet aet values shown in fig a10 are partially higher compared to chirps rainfall see fig 5 and table 2 the reason is that era5l rainfall is substantially higher compared to chirps so that at least within era5l the water balance is closed and consistent differences in rainfall between chirps and era5l range from around 20 in baringo 1021 mm a vs 1240 mm a for 1984 2020 to nearly 100 in solai 1015 vs 2021 mm a table 2 since chirps has proven to provide reliable rainfall estimates in the study region see references in section data basis the high era5l rainfall and in consequence era5l aet values seem unrealistic and are therefore not used directly to account for this probable overestimation we use the ratio between era5l aet to rainfall fig 13 to derive an adjusted aet values based on chirps rainfall see adj aet in table 2 we thereby assume that the partitioning of rainfall and aet in era5l is in a correct magnitude and can be used to derive aet based on chirps rainfall in contrast to aet which is quite stationary over time the ratio between aet and rainfall from era5l fig 13 shows a much more pronounced change signal when comparing the periods before and after 2009 here the year 2009 is also calculated as a breakpoint year similar to rainfall for all lake catchments the ratio substantially decreased after 2009 meaning that in relation less rainfall is evapotranspirated generally the ratio between aet and rainfall shows a high interannual variability values of larger than one can be explained with storage effects from one year to the next and also evaporation from the lake surfaces the highest ratios of around 0 85 for the period 1984 2020 are found for lake nakuru and baringo around 80 85 of rainfall is lost to the atmosphere and around 15 20 are available for runoff the lowest values are found for lake solai with a long term mean of 0 62 for the overall period and 0 51 for 2010 2020 even if the era5l rainfall and aet values are too high we assume that the ratio between aet and rainfall is in the correct magnitude the unitless runoff coefficient ratio between runoff and precipitation rc can be calculated as the difference between 1 and the ratio between aet and rainfall a comparison with published data for the study region shows that the numbers given in fig 13 and table 2 are somewhat in the range of previously published runoff coefficients for lake naivasha where a long term mean ratio of aet to rainfall of 0 72 results in a runoff coefficient rc of 0 28 for the era5l data ayenew et al 2007 used a value of 0 13 for rc for the same lake odongo 2016 published mean rc values of 0 2 0 25 muthuwatta 2014 evaluated runoff and precipitation data for a single year 1971 for lake naivasha tributaries and found very low rc values of 8 5 at gilgil and 3 5 for the malewa subbasin evaluating runoff coefficients for only a single year must however be taken with care since high interannual variability and storage effects are ignored for the njemps flats in baringo wairagu et al 1993 published rc values of 0 2 which are in the range of our values for single events from a 0 3 km² highly erodible semiarid catchment in the baringo district sutherland and bryan 1990 publish a runoff coefficient of 46 critchley and the world bank 1986 present examples of runoff coefficients of 30 for microcatchments in baringo and 13 19 for larger catchments in turkana which is further north and drier compared to our study lakes in a more recent study data in kimaru et al 2019 can be used to derive a ratio between aet and rainfall of 0 74 which is around 0 07 lower compared to our values the comparison with published data in summary highlights uncertainties regarding runoff coefficients some studies agree with our numbers others do not additionally for bogoria solai and elementaita no studies were found for comparison and especially for lake solai and lake bogoria the era5l derived ratio of aet to rainfall seem too low considering the dry climate this is especially the case to the years after 2009 table 2 summarizes the mean catchment water balance components and the integrated catchment response icr for 1984 2020 black font 1984 2009 orange font and 2010 2020 blue font apart from averages and deviations from the long term mean of 1984 2009 of aet and rainfall the deviation of effective rainfall is shown which was calculated using chirps rainfall and the era5l ratio between aet and rainfall for the calculation of deviations in table 2 1984 2009 is used as a reference since in this period the lakes were more or less in an equilibrium and the following deviations from the mean of this period after 2010 led to the observed lake level rises this is confirmed by the icr for 1984 2009 which lies around zero in most lakes one exception is lake naivasha where water levels were however anthropogenically influenced in this period onywere et al 2013 in the period 2010 2020 rainfall increased by around 30 for the baringo bogoria and solai catchments in nakuru elementaita and naivasha the rainfall increases were lower amount to 21 25 and 25 respectively in contrast the increases in aet are lower compared to changes in rainfall and lie around 14 for baringo and elementaita 13 for naivasha 11 for nakuru and 7 for bogoria and solai for 2010 2020 the icr is positive corresponding to positive deviations in rainfall although the absolute differences between icr and deviation of effective chirps rainfall are high the signals show in the expected directions positive wet rainfall anomalies lead to an increase in the icr and vice versa generally effective rainfall deviation is larger compared to the icr and although these numbers do not match the positive deviations in effective rainfall are very sufficient to explain the lake level rises 4 discussion in a perfect world the deviations of effective rainfall would equal the integrated catchment response icr in table 2 given that all other boundary conditions e g underground seepage intercatchment leakages are constant when focusing on the icr and effective rainfall possible explanations for the differences include i the effective rainfall is based on chirps and on the ratio between era5l aet and rainfall these ratios are connected with uncertainties and it is feasible that in effect the runoff coefficients are smaller which would mean that effective rainfall is also smaller and lead to a better matching with the icr this is especially the case for solai and bogoria where runoff coefficients seem too high for a dry climate especially in the period after 2009 higher runoff coefficients could be expected since potential evapotranspiration was not reduced and higher rainfall was available for aet in summary uncertainties in aet are large and there are indications that our calculations based on era5l data show too low aet values ii although chirps has proven to be reliable for hydrological applications in the study region in the past it is clear that the estimates are also afflicted with uncertainties especially when considering that catchment means are used nevertheless the deviations between effective rainfall and icr for 2010 2020 are large in absolute numbers but comparatively low in relative terms for baringo for example the difference amounts to 149 mm which is only 12 of the mean rainfall for bogoria and solai the difference is around 18 of rainfall and for the other lakes it is lower compared to baringo when put into perspective considering all the numerous uncertainties in i point rainfall measurements and ii areal or basin averages estimates herrnegger et al 2018 2015 the relative errors are low iii the icr dependents on lake volume variation data and thus on multiple satellite data and complex pre processing steps comparisons with published data fig 8 suggest that the lake areas used are possibly too small since inundated swamps and riparian vegetation is not identified as water assuming that larger water areas were present would mean that the lake volume would be larger compared to our data in this case the lake volumes and icr would be larger and would better fit to the effective rainfall values whatever the reasons are the results however clearly show the connection between effective rainfall and changes in lake areas although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out and may play a role the icr values show that only very small changes in the overall water balance are necessary to explain the lake level rises for baringo for example a change of only 16 9 mm a which is less than 2 of the annual rainfall before 2010 of 938 3 mm a is sufficient the analysis of the hydrometeorological conditions show that changes in boundary conditions e g changes in catchment properties due to anthropogenic influences intercatchment leakages changes in underground permeability are not necessary to explain lake level rises apart from inflow and direct evaporation and rainfall the lake levels clearly depend on the degree of underground seepage for baringo solai and naivasha since they are the only fresh water lakes and therefore must have an underground outflow hindering the accumulation of salt leading to alkalinity for bogoria nakuru and elementaita since they are alkaline and if existent underground seepage is of lower relevance becht et al 2006 2005 onywere et al 2013 verschuren 2001 verschuren et al 2000 yihdego and becht 2013 the faults especially for lakes baringo solai and naivasha are not necessarily reduced and our analysis shows that changes in permeability are not necessary to explain increases in lake levels compared to rainfall the changes in era5l based aet are significantly lower this is surprising especially considering the energy oversupply for the evapotranspiration process shown in the data of potential evapotranspiration regarding aet however even larger uncertainties exist since no direct measurements exist and the magnitude of aet directly defines the effective rainfall larger aet values compared to our results are very probable it remains important to benchmark remote sensing or numerical modelling based rainfall products like chirps or meteorological parameters from era5l although many issues exist regarding comparability of products covering very different spatial domains omonge et al 2021 a comparison simply helps to gain credibility and assurance the estimates of aet are purely model driven and could not be validated in contrast the chirps rainfall estimates per se include ground station data accordingly and as could be shown with the comparison with published station data a high agreement could be found for rainfall data from nakuru meteorological station and chirps for data of snake farm near the shores of lake baringo larger deviations were found regarding absolute values where however differences in the spatial domains of the time series are problematic in this case it must be considered that lake baringo lies in the drier north and in the rift floor where it is generally drier the main sources of water for the catchment lies in the upstream areas which show higher elevation areas the areal rainfall will therefore be different higher from a ground station located in the driest part of the catchment this analysis heavily depends and was only possible due to the availability of relevant remotely sensed data at the same time information from a hydrometeorological observation network on the ground would significantly reduce speculative aspects and increase credibility of this analysis the upkeeping and maintenance of the ground observation network for the measurement of meteorological and hydrological parameters is of uttermost importance remotely sensed data cannot completely substitute these measurements of e g rainfall temperature discharge or lake levels it is clear that financial and administrative challenges exist it must however be clear that only these measurements allow to analyse and plan water resources in a sustainable manor to plan for the future but also understand the past we need historical observations averages in the icr for several years indicate changes in water balance components in comparison to the mean using the mean icr for the period 2010 2020 changes of inflow into the lakes in comparison to mean discharge can be evaluated for lake baringo a difference to the mean of around 3 5 m³ s is found this means that the average inflow to the lake must have increased by this size simply to explain the observed surge in lake volume for the other lakes also due to their smaller catchments smaller values are found and range from 0 5 m³ s for bogoria 0 9 m³ s for nakuru 0 14 m³ s for solai 0 1 m³ s for elementaita and 1 2 m³ s for naivasha measurements of discharge if provided to stakeholders and science in a timely manner could allow for validation of these values additionally with discharge data runoff coefficients could be estimated with higher certainties which in our case had to be estimated purely based on numerical model outputs and are afflicted with large uncertainties the climate in eastern africa has shown substantial variability in the distant but also near past where distinct wet and dry periods occur we are currently again in such a wet period also in the context of the ability in differentiating between climate variability and human induced climate change it is very important to sustain and provide ground measurements of relevant hydrometeorological variables the long term observations within the nile basin see examples in the introduction highlight the benefit of these kind of measurements 5 summary and conclusions the lakes in the central rift valley of kenya have experienced extraordinary rises in their water levels since 2010 the increases in lake level areas and consequent inundations of the riparian areas have had significant negative impacts on the local communities since homes schools hospitals roads but also the basis for the local economy such as agricultural areas or tourism infrastructure like hotels have been submerged and rendered unusable intense country wide media coverage due to increases in the water levels have provoked public debates on the potential causes with expert opinions divided along geological anthropogenic and hydro climatic influences this study assessed potential hydro climatic influences covering the six most affected lakes the aim of this work was the systematic analysis and documentation of the trends and changes in lake areas lake levels and lake volumes for the period 1984 2020 and covering 37 years additionally a hydrometeorological analysis is performed to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the lake level rises apart from effective rainfall and actual evapotranspiration aet trends we also analyze changes in the integrated catchment response icr a magnitude derived from year to year lake volume changes and which reflects changes in the lake catchment water balance as data sources we use dahiti for information on lake properties over time chirps for rainfall and era5 land era5l for deriving actual evapotranspiration when possible and available data from ground observations are used for comparison and validation the work focuses on the main affected lakes which are baringo with a catchment area of 6609 km² bogoria 1060 km² nakuru 1471 km² solai 214 km² elementaita 772 km² and naivasha 3229 km² in relation to the mean of 1984 2009 the increases in lake areas ranges from 21 for lake naivasha to an extraordinary 123 for lake solai in december 2020 lake bogoria 28 is located in a deep depression where increases in water level do not show such a pronounced signal in water area lake baringo 59 in december 2020 and lake nakuru 70 just like lake solai are located in flatter basins similar to the adjacent lake naivasha lake elementaita shows lower variation and a lower increase of around 25 compared to values before 2010 largest fluctuation between minimum and maximum water level is found for lake solai with 8 53 m followed by baringo 8 23 m naivasha 7 48 m nakuru 6 40 m bogoria 4 99 m and finally elementaita with 2 38 m for most lakes the highest levels are found around 2013 2014 which are however surpassed in the year 2020 in which new records are observed the analysis of lake catchment rainfall time series shows that 2009 is a breakpoint year the time series 1981 2009 and 2010 2020 show different properties with noteworthy differences in the average rainfall values this matches well with observations in lake levels which were more or less constant in the period before 2009 in the period 2010 2020 rainfall increased by around 30 for the baringo bogoria and solai catchments in nakuru elementaita and naivasha the rainfall increases were lower and amount to 21 25 and 25 respectively after 2018 annual rainfall partially increased by even more than 50 in contrast the increases in era5l based aet are lower compared to changes in rainfall and lie around 14 for baringo and elementaita 13 for naivasha 11 for nakuru and 7 for bogoria and solai these increases are probably too low for 2010 2020 the integrated catchment response icr is positive corresponding to positive deviations in effective rainfall although the absolute differences between icr and deviation of effective chirps rainfall are high the signals show in the expected directions positive wet rainfall anomalies lead to an increase in the icr and vice versa the icr indicates that only small changes in water balance components explain the lake level rises i e 16 9 mm a baringo 14 6 mm a bogoria 19 4 mm a nakuru 20 6 mm a solai 3 8 mm a elementaita and 12 1 mm a for naivasha these values correspond to only around 0 4 2 of annual rainfall before the lake levels increased and are magnitudes which are difficult to observe especially when considering catchment wide rainfall from the icr changes in mean inflows compared to the mean when the lake is in an equilibrium can be evaluated for lake baringo the average inflow to the lake must have increased by at least 3 5 m³ s simply to explain the observed surge in lake volume for the other lakes also due to their smaller catchments smaller values are found and range from 0 5 m³ s for bogoria 0 9 m³ s for nakuru 0 14 m³ s for solai 0 1 m³ s for elementaita and 1 2 m³ s for naivasha the results clearly show the connection between effective rainfall and changes in lake areas and although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out and may play a role the analysis of the hydrometeorological trends shows that changes in boundary conditions e g changes in catchment properties due to anthropogenic influences intercatchment leakages changes in underground permeability are not necessary to explain the lake level rises generally the increases in effective rainfall are sufficient to explain the lake level rises we closely describe potential uncertainties in the analysis here we conclude that information from the ground observation network would significantly reduce speculative aspects and increase credibility of this analysis remotely sensed data cannot completely substitute the measurements of e g rainfall temperature discharge or lake levels these time series should be made available to the public and science for further analysis and understanding in this respect further analysis should include additional measurements from the ground e g for the analysis of changes in runoff coefficients since especially the ratios between eta and rainfall from era5l seem to be biased this work purely focused on the statistical analysis of time series of lake properties and hydro meteorological time series with the aim to describe and understand the underlying mechanisms leading to the observed changes analysis on seasonal level also including in situ data and other meteorological parameters such as air temperature should be part of future work important future work must also include the analysis of flood hazard flood exposition and flood risk stemming from the lake level rises it is clear that the current fluctuations in lake levels have been there in past probably with higher intensity at the same time the negative effects on the local population are not comparable higher population densities especially in the riparian areas and generally higher damage potentials are very different now in this context the analysis of the potential flood risk and generation of anticipatory flood risk maps considering continued lake levels rises constitute an important work for the future since it can allow to mitigate potential losses author contributions mh and lo designed the study mh gs and cs performed all analyses mh cs and

8202,study region three karst regions in hungary and slovakia study focus time series of environmental tracers both in the groundwater recharge and discharge provide important insights into how a karst water system works the aim of the present work was to study the response of discharging karst waters to recharge using time series of environmental tracers such as tritium stable water isotopes noble gases and sf6 new hydrological insights for the region our results show that sampling frequency plays a significant role in detecting short residence times months the seasonality of 18o isotope composition of a selected karst spring indicates a 10 contribution of recent water with a residence time of half a year the contribution of an older component can be proven by the decrease of the tritium content of the waters which compares to the decreasing trend of the tritium time series of the precipitation however the tritium concentrations are just slightly lower than those of the precipitation and the recharge water hence the residence times of these shallow springs are supposed to be short 3h 3he and sf6 apparent ages confirm this to be between 0 and 10 years with a median of 1 4 years our study demonstrates that long term time series are preferable to provide better estimation to the age distribution than individual short term investigations keywords karst hydrology environmental tracers tritium oxygen isotopes residence time 1 introduction karst aquifers are a valuable groundwater resource as they provide drinking water to about 25 of the world s population van beynen 2011 karst systems are a vulnerable environment having high permeability due to their conduit flow component which allows for very fast transport of contaminants foster et al 2013 fig 1 karst waters are a very important source for drinking water especially in countries possessing large karst areas and lacking access to drinking water resources when studying the properties of shallow groundwater aquifers the recharging as well as the discharging water has to be investigated katz et al 1997 clark and fritz 2013 hartmann et al 2013 brenčič and vreča 2016 the relationship of groundwater in the initial and the final state gives us valuable insights into how the flow system works lee and krothe 2001 barbieri et al 2005 long et al 2008 in a shallow groundwater system like an epigene karst aquifer the change in the recharge water from precipitation is evidently reflected in the groundwater and in the discharge water i e springs bonacci et al 2016 sun et al 2016 sappa et al 2018 stroj et al 2020 to improve the understanding of the groundwater flow systems in karstified carbonates the basic concepts of hydraulic flow have to be considered which are in accordance with hydraulic continuity tóth 1995 the groundwater flow patterns are controlled largely by topography and the groundwater movement has been conceptualized to occur within local intermediate and regional flow systems tóth 1963 in the case of small drainage basins local to intermediate groundwater flow systems water table configuration is considered as the main driving force of groundwater flow and the recharge and discharge properties of karst aquifers are defined mainly by the geological structure faulted fractured zones the spring represents an output of the groundwater flow system combining numerous theoretical flow pathways although the subsurface processes are less evident numerical simulations are used to improve better understanding of the flow systems and to calculate residence times for instance using particle tracking wang et al 2016 and or numerical simulation molson and frind 2012 janos et al 2018 investigation of the transport and geochemical processes through the rock matrix is also an important step between the infiltration and the leakage szijártó et al 2021 in the last few decades stable and radioactive isotopes have become powerful tools usually used as natural tracers in order to solve many problems in karst hydrogeology like management of karst water resources criss et al 2007 vulnerability of karst aquifers trček and zojer 2010 karst engineering etc goldscheider 2015 vasić et al 2020 evaluation of different isotope composition can be applied to obtain information about the behaviour of the karst aquifer such as the origin of the groundwater the mixing properties and dynamics the age distribution as well as aquifer processes occurring within the geological structure response of recharge to discharge mook 2006 knowledge of the groundwater residence time is of great importance since accurate age determinations can give us an insight to what extent the resource that we want to use is renewable or whether it is a limited deep aquifer and a geological reserve which does not have active interaction with different ambient water bodies including surface waters criss and davisson 1996 criss et al 2007 since karst aquifers are vulnerable to pollution the response of the water quality to a potential surface contamination has to be taken into account as a first approach the mean residence time of the spring water can be estimated using environmental tracers the mean residence time in a karstic aquifer represents an average age composed of the waters of different residence times contributing to the water discharge at the spring to constrain the residence time of these waters a higher sampling frequency within a longer time period is recommended to reveal both short and long term patterns in the stable or radioactive isotope compositions and or other chemical tracers of the springs when using transit times based on environmental tracers in hydrological systems long term time series are recommended einsiedl 2005 stewart and morgenstern 2016 the aim of this study was to examine the response of discharging karst waters using time series of environmental tracers in order to determine the age distribution of the karst springs additionally we intended to study shallow karst aquifers representing local groundwater flow systems focusing on the investigation of how the recent change of the tritium input function of the precipitation could be used in shallow karst aquifers springs in three mainly autogenic karst areas were studied in central europe hungary and slovakia groundwater samples for environmental tracers were taken in different frequencies between 2008 and 2018 and the time series were compared to long term isotope records of the precipitation 2 site description 2 1 mecsek mts mecsek mountains are

uplands zone of the bükk mts hungary fig 2c includes middle and upper triassic limestone the majority of the area is hosted by the bükkfennsík formation anchimetamorphosed platform facies limestone the southern strip of the catchment consists of the felsőtárkányi formation intrashelf basin facies thick bedded limestone with marl and chert intercalations while the northern strip is made up of the fehérkői formation thick bedded platform facies limestone there are a large number of karst springs registered in the bükk area the annual precipitation is 700 850 mm spinoni et al 2015 the long term

recharge is 280 km2 the long term average recharge calculated for the bükk is 32 4 while on the karstic upland area the annual recharge is assumed to exceed 36 kovács et al 2015 the uplands area has a large number of sinkholes following linear patterns kovács et al 2015 demonstrated that these features delineate water table conduits at depth and that the size of low permeability matrix blocks in between karst conduits range between 200 and 500 m during drought periods karst water level drops concentrated flow ceases within karst conduits and large scale diffuse flow starts becoming dominant in the system kovács et al 2015 this sort of scale change of flow systems is characteristic of the bükk uplands 2 3 slovak karst slovak karst is the largest continuous karst area of slovakia situated on the south eastern boundary which extends into hungary as the aggtelek karst forming the gömör torna karst system fig 2 together they present the largest plateau karst area of central europe the

kas jasovká plateau has a very clear hydrological boundary karst springs have variable water yields many of which are only seasonal however the strongest springs with average discharge of 20 50 l s are outlets from underground passages hochmuth and gessert 2017 table 1 3 methods 3 1 sampling strategy between 2006 and 2020 water samples for environmental isotope tracers 3h 18o 2h noble gases were taken regularly from karst springs in the three study areas five of the monitored springs kánya mariska anyák melegmányi and dagonyászó springs are located in the western mecsek and two springs csurgó and pásztor springs are located in eastern mecsek kánya and mariska are located a few hundred meters from each other and the same is true for anyák and melegmányi springs table 1 in bükk mts we focused on two springs szinva and ódor the szinva catchment extends over a 12 3 km elongated area of 37 km2 the szinva spring is located at 343 m asl the ódor spring is located to the western south from the szinva by 30 km at an elevation of 490 m asl eight karst springs were regularly investigated in the slovak karst the elevation of recharge area in the three study sites compares to each other ranging from 240 to 700 m asl the mean discharge rates are also shown in table 1 these latter values were determined using the bucket method in the mecsek mts and at ódor spring while the discharge of szinva and other springs in the slovak karst were calculated from water velocities using flow profiling to reveal long changes in isotope properties seasonal sampling frequency was chosen for the mecsek mts and slovak karst one specific spring anyák was chosen to perform monthly sampling to observe whether there was a contribution of infiltration of very short residence time ódor and szinva springs were sampled in a 1 2 year time steps since the searching for the long term trend was of interest in bükk mts 3 2 analytical methods isotope analyses were performed at the isotope climatology and environmental research centre icer institute for nuclear research debrecen hungary karst water samples have been analysed for tritium using the 3he ingrowth method with a special 4he isotope dilution technique palcsu et al 2010 papp et al 2012 the uncertainty of the method is 0 1 0 3 tu in the range of 5 10 tu stable isotope ratios δ 2h and δ 18o have been determined either by isotope ratio mass spectrometry vodila et al 2011 or cavity enhanced absorption spectrometry czuppon et al 2018 for hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios both methods have a measurement error of 1 5 and 0 1 respectively in order to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages of the water samples have also been taken for noble gas analysis helium including 3he 4he neon argon krypton and xenon concentrations have been analysed mass spectrometrically with a standard deviation of 1 2 as described by papp et al 2012 3 3 calculation of apparent ages tritium and noble gas measurement allow us to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages the tritiogenic 3he component can be decomposed from the measured noble gas concentrations and 3he 4he ratio and then the 3h 3he age is calculated by equation 1 where t is the age λ is the decay constant of tritium 3hmeas is the measured tritium concentration and the 3hetrit is the tritiogenic component of dissolved 3he schlosser et al 1988 palcsu et al 2017 1 t 3 h 3 h e 1 λ ln 3 h m e a s 3 h e t r i t 3 h m e a s the accuracy of the age calculations is 1 2 years several samples have been analysed for sf6 in the institute for environmental physics iup heidelberg germany by gas chromatography friedrich et al 2013 and then sf6 apparent ages have been calculated based on the comparison of atmospheric mixing ratio of sf6 in the previous decades darling et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 tritium the tritium values of the karst spring samples are slightly decreasing in each study sites in the investigated period fig 3 in mecsek mts the tritium of all springs are significantly decreasing from 7 0 to 8 0 tu to 4 5 5 5 tu during seven years 2013 2020 fig 3a most of the springs have similar tritium concentrations the only exception is csurgó spring with a slightly lower tritium content the tritium concentrations of the springs are compared to that of the precipitation and the recharge water fig 3 shows the tritium concentration of the monthly precipitation taken in debrecen east hungary the arithmetic mean as an average of the monthly precipitation is 10 4 tu for the whole data set of the 19 years of collection the time series of tritium in monthly precipitation shows a clear seasonality palcsu et al 2018 i e the winter precipitation has a significantly lower tritium content than the summer precipitation although the sampling location for the precipitation tritium time series is about 300 km apart the mecsek mts 100 km from the bükk mts and 150 km from the slovak karst fig 2 we consider this to be representative of the precipitation falling at each study site the water samples in mecsek mts were taken at 3 4 months intervals in the first three years and then less frequently yet in the first three years the seasonality of the tritium concentration of the precipitation and hence recharge water cannot be observed in the discharge of the karst aquifer in the bükk mts two karst springs have been investigated a 14 year long but less frequent sampling was performed at ódor spring fig 3c the tritium concentration of ódor spring was first observed to be decreasing from 2006 until 2009 from 9 to 6 tu and then it was rising by the next year and then decreasing again the tritium concentration in 2019 2020 reached 3 0 tu another karst spring in bükk mts the szinva spring was sampled at weekly resolution for a discharge study in 2015 and then in 2017 again in each individual year the tritium time series show a decreasing trend in fact the tritium values are significantly lower in 2017 than in 2015 fig 3c note that the accuracy of the tritium analyses is between 0 11 and 0 22 tu for these water samples hence these changes in tritium are significant an additional sample was analysed in 2020 but the tritium concentration cannot be significantly distinguished from the last results of 2017 to summarize in each study site the tritium concentrations of the karst waters show a long term decreasing trend the exception are two springs in the slovak karst that have higher tritium concentration in 2020 springs with the lowest tritium concentration might have the longer mean residence time similar decreasing trends can be seen in spring waters of other shallow karst aquifers kluge et al 2010a al charideh 2011 ozyurt et al 2014 although the tritium concentration of precipitation is decreasing throughout the 1990 s after 2005 it remains almost stable the decreasing trend in the tritium time series can be attributed to these following processes i the bomb contribution having higher tritium content is getting negligible in the aquifer due to wash out and radioactive decay ii the contribution of recharge is weak due to perhaps less precipitation or higher evaporation transpiration rate iii the trend is following the trend in the precipitation which is modulated by the solar cycle palcsu et al 2018 recently demonstrated that the tritium concentration of the precipitation does have a link to the solar cycle the higher annual tritium concentrations between 2006 and 2009 see fig 6 can be attributed to weak solar magnetic activity when more cosmic galactic particles could reach the earth s atmosphere producing more cosmogenic nuclei like tritium palcsu et al 2018 to distinguish and confirm which process is responsible to the decrease of tritium other environmental tracers have to be evaluated 4 2 18o isotope composition in karst springs seasonal patterns in stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water are frequently observed and used to reveal short response from recharge to discharge mance et al 2014 hu et al 2015 jeelani et al 2015 malík et al 2015 cao et al 2018 however as previously discussed we did not observe any seasonality in the tritium time series stable isotope values of mecsek and slovak karst springs do not exhibit a clear seasonal cycle corroborating the absence of intra annual variability in tritium levels however as samples have been taken at 3 4 month intervals the lack of seasonality in both environmental tracers may be a result of under sampling fig 4 a and b show the oxygen isotope composition of the mecsek and the slovak karst respectively these two sites have slightly different oxygen isotope signature the springs in the slovak karst have more positive values by 0 5 1 0 this can be attributed to several factors the lower elevation or the higher mean annual temperature of the slovak karst and moisture source regions or the recharge seasonality are different at the two areas to confirm the absence or presence of seasonality in the springs a frequent 3 4 week sampling period was performed at anyák spring mecsek mts for 18o analysis from september 2015 until december 2018 the main assumption is that if the 18o of the local precipitation is varying according to the seasonality fig 4c the spring water has a very young component it must be observed in the time series of the karst water as a seasonal change contrary to the previous observations when the sampling has not been done less frequently in 3 4 month steps the δ 18o time series of anyák spring shows a significant periodic variation as a result of a visual comparison of the two time series this variation is shifted by 0 5 years from the seasonal variation of the precipitation fig 4d indicating a significant contribution of a fresh water component with a residence time of potentially half a year in principle the age of the fresh component can be n 0 5 years n is an integer but as can be seen later the overall mean residence time of the water is very short when estimating the yield of this very young component one has to take a look at the magnitude of the variation in the δ 18o of the spring water and precipitation the spring water is varying in a range of 0 6 between 10 0 and 9 4 while the 18o composition of precipitation covers a range of 6 between 12 and 6 fig 4c and d considering the variations of δ 18o values and assuming the older component has a constant stable isotope composition i e well mixed the first order assumption for the contribution of the youngest water is at least 10 on the other hand the average δ 18o of anyák spring is 9 75 and the δ 18o values are varying around this value while the unweighted and the weighted by the precipitation amount mean averages of δ 18o of the precipitation at six stations in the mecsek mts are 8 82 and 8 66 respectively eq 2 shows how different averages are calculated subscipts s and w denote summer and winter monthly precipitation amounts and an additional weighing factor are referred as p and x respectively 2 δ 18 o p r s δ 18 o s p s w δ 18 o w p w x s p s w p w x the spring has a lower δ 18o value than the precipitation average this suggests that the winter precipitation prevails in the recharging water in hungary the summer months have more precipitation hence when calculating mean annual average δ 18o values weighted by the precipitation amount the δ 18o will be higher than the arithmetic average of the monthly values an additional weighing factor refer to x in eq 2 for the hydrologic winter half year november to april was modelled to obtain close match to the one of the long term average of the spring if we give an additional weighing factor of 5 after a trial and error searching as a best fit parameter for the cold months an average value 9 74 is obtained which is reliable for the long term average for the anyák spring 9 75 this approach gives an assumption that the precipitation fallen in the winter half year prevails to the recharge by a factor of five than that of the summer months from may to october the same approach will be used when estimating the tritium concentration of the recharge water based on the monthly tritium values and precipitation amounts 4 3 recharge component analysis to detect the origin of the water in the springs and reveal the contribution of the re evaporation of local waters the relationship of 18o and 2h has been examined the local meteoric water line in the mecsek mts is δ 2h 7 84 δ 18o 6 77 fórizs et al 2020 the δ 2h δ 18o values of the spring waters are slightly above the lmwl indicating a small contribution of re evaporation to the local precipitation although this effect has a minor importance fig 5 as one could see in figs 2 and 3 the tritium values of the springs are decreasing and lower than that of the precipitation this allows us to restrict an estimation to the age distribution of the waters the 18o time series of one specific karst spring anyák mecsek mts indicates a half year residence time for the recent precipitation with a contribution of around 10 the tritium time series and other dating methods such as 3h 3he kluge et al 2010b szűcs et al 2015 miller et al 2017 palcsu et al 2017 and sf6 age determinations friedrich et al 2013 delbart et al 2014 help us estimate the contribution of the older components in the range of years fig 6 shows all tritium concentrations for each study sites and the precipitation for debrecen eastern hungary additionally an estimation for the tritium time series of the recharge water is also given in fig 6 the annual mean tritium values of the recharge estimation have been composed by weighing the monthly tritium values with the precipitation amount and an additional factor of 5 for the months within the winter half year see the chapter of 18o isotope composition above in fig 6 the lower tritium values of the spring waters indicate that the mean residence time of the water is not zero if we want to estimate a residence time of the water the tritium concentrations of the water and the precipitation have to be compared the average tritium concentrations arithmetic means of the precipitation in debrecen eastern hungary and in krakow southern poland are 10 8 tu palcsu et al 2018 and 10 0 tu gnip database iaea respectively we are aware that the isotope composition of precipitation does not reflect that of infiltrating water because the summer contribution is smaller than that of the other seasons due to evaporation and transpiration in case of the debrecen precipitation the arithmetic mean of the monthly tritium is 10 8 tu while the mean tritium concentration weighted by the precipitation amount is 11 5 tu note that there is more precipitation in summer than in winter while using an additional weighing factor of 5 for the winter hydrological half year as was derived from the stable isotope composition see above the mean is 9 9 tu as for a first estimation of the mean residence time of the springs in mecsek mts this latter weighted mean tritium concentration is used to the calculation according to the radioactive decay law one can obtain mean residence times between 1 and 12 years the youngest is the spring in the slovak karst 0 2 years mecsek spings and szinva have similar ages 0 4 years while the oldest is ódor 4 12 years however this calculation assumes that the tritium concentration of the recharge water i e the weighted average of the precipitation does not change obviously this is not absolutely true figs 3 and 6 show that the tritium concentration of the precipitation in the investigated duration do change after the 1990 s this change is apparently solely due to the solar cycle palcsu et al 2018 the attenuation of the bomb peak cannot be seen any more in the precipitation in fig 6 an apparent conformity between the long term tritium trends of the spring waters and the precipitation recharge water can be seen an important question resulting from our study is whether these variations in the spring water tritium time series can be attributed to the solar cycle morgenstern et al 2010 if this is correct the long term change of the tritium time series in the precipitation due to the solar cycle could be used to constrain the age distribution of shallow karst springs when applying long term time series for karst waters to answer the question of the presence of the solar cycle in the time series the mean residence times of the waters have to be taken into account 4 4 apparent ages additional age tracers have been used to further analyse the residence time in the mecsek mts samples for dissolved noble gases were taken between 2013 and 2015 and then 3h 3he apparent ages were calculated fig 7 a these ages are varying between 0 and 10 years the distribution of the age values is exponential see the histogram in fig 7b the median of these 47 3h 3he ages is 1 4 years note that some tritiogenic 3he might have been lost during sampling when the water yield was too small as these springs are open discharges it is possible that some helium degassing could have occurred during sampling however we consider this process to be negligible although these young ages can be considered as minimum ages these 3h 3he ages indicate that the mean residence time of the water are up to 10 years to verify this in july 2013 water samples for sf6 determination were taken at four springs in mecsek mts the calculated sf6 apparent ages corrected for excess air amount determined from the noble gas temperature calculation agree very well to the 3h 3he ages in all cases and both were from 0 to 1 4 years indicating that those discharging waters were indeed very young table 2 4 5 source of variability in spring water tritium the long term tritium monitoring data of three different shallow karst aquifers shows in most cases decreasing tritium concentrations and thus exhibits a similar pattern to the natural variability of tritium concentration in precipitation in these three karst areas significant higher changes in either air temperature or precipitation amount evaporation transpiration rate and recharge rate cannot be seen which would be responsible to the change of the distribution of younger and older water ages in the aquifer thus resulting in lower tritium concentrations one explanation for this effect can be the attenuation of the bomb peak contribution the aquifers contain waters of different residence times thus the older components used to include more tritium from the nuclear weapon tests while the tritium concentration of the younger components is free of bomb tritium and has already reached the natural level palcsu et al 2018 as time goes the contribution of the bomb tritium gets less significant moreover the radioactive decay provides an additional decrease of tritium the decreasing signature is the strongest in case of ódor spring bükk mts as it also has the lowest tritium concentration this strongest decrease and the lowest tritium amount are in accordance with the highest mean residence time the other springs in bükk and mecsek mts show similar pattern even if a slight contribution of very recent waters detected by the frequent analysis of δ 18o might contribute to the age distribution of the springs as can be seen in anyák spring mecsek mts the decreasing trends are similar to each other and can be attributed to the depletion of the bomb contribution however those springs whose tritium concentrations are higher i e closer to that of precipitation and the estimated recharge values may follow another trend as well i e having some increase from 2016 onwards as the 3h 3he and sf6 apparent ages indicate that the spring water in mecsek mts is very young 1 4 years as a medial of the age distribution it is expected that the long term changes of tritium in precipitation and hence the recharge water is reflected more directly in the spring waters since the precipitation time series are modulated by solar activity palcsu et al 2018 the solar cycle should be observed in the tritium time series of the karst waters the highest tritium concentrations can be seen in the slovakian karst springs fig 6 the individual samples as well as the annual averages are increasing in tritium from the year 2016 similar pattern can be observed in the precipitation and the recharge estimate the tritium is increasing from 2015 probably due to the weakening solar activity as expected however even though the signatures compare well we do not conclude the elevated tritium of the slovakian spring is directly linked to the increase of the precipitation the 6 year time series is still not long enough to decide whether the tritium in the precipitation modulated by the solar activity can be observed in shallow karst aquifers 5 conclusion time series of environmental tracers have revealed important information on the recharge and discharge conditions in three karst aquifers in hungary and slovakia frequent sampling 2 4 weeks of spring waters can help us determining the contribution of recent infiltration in the case of spring waters from mecsek mts in hungary the 10 of the discharge water has a residence time of half a year additionally the recharge conditions can be also estimated using the stable isotope composition of the water weighing isotope data of the winter and summer months separately provides us with an adequate estimation to investigate the behavior of the recharge during the winter and summer half year this approach namely using a weighing factor of 5 for the winter months has been used when estimating the tritium concentration of the recharge water based on the monthly tritium values and precipitation amounts the apparent ages vary between 0 and 10 years showing and exponential distribution in the 3h 3he ages of the mecsek springs the median of the 3h 3he ages is 1 4 years using the tritium values and the estimation of the tritium time series of the recharge water mean residence times have been estimated the youngest is the spring in the slovak karst 0 2 years mecsek spings and szinva have similar ages 0 4 years while the oldest is ódor 4 12 years an important question resulting from our study is whether the variation of tritium in the spring water can be attributed to the solar cycle even though the signatures compare well we do not conclude the elevated tritium of the slovakian springs or some mecsek springs is directly linked to the increase of the precipitation the 6 year time series is still not long enough to decide whether the tritium in the precipitation modulated by the solar activity can be observed in shallow karst aquifers the solar activity signal would make possible the determination of a few year residence times using long term times series of environmental tracers including tritium however further studies and longer time series are needed for this thus additional samples for tritium will be taken from each spring in these study areas twice a year and hopefully after obtaining longer time series we can confirm the absence or presence of the solar component in the shallow karst waters credit authorship

8202,study region three karst regions in hungary and slovakia study focus time series of environmental tracers both in the groundwater recharge and discharge provide important insights into how a karst water system works the aim of the present work was to study the response of discharging karst waters to recharge using time series of environmental tracers such as tritium stable water isotopes noble gases and sf6 new hydrological insights for the region our results show that sampling frequency plays a significant role in detecting short residence times months the seasonality of 18o isotope composition of a selected karst spring indicates a 10 contribution of recent water with a residence time of half a year the contribution of an older component can be proven by the decrease of the tritium content of the waters which compares to the decreasing trend of the tritium time series of the precipitation however the tritium concentrations are just slightly lower than those of the precipitation and the recharge water hence the residence times of these shallow springs are supposed to be short 3h 3he and sf6 apparent ages confirm this to be between 0 and 10 years with a median of 1 4 years our study demonstrates that long term time series are preferable to provide better estimation to the age distribution than individual short term investigations keywords karst hydrology

waters are a very important source for drinking water especially in countries possessing large karst areas and lacking access to drinking water resources when studying the properties of shallow groundwater aquifers the recharging as well as the discharging water has to be investigated katz et al 1997 clark and fritz 2013 hartmann et al 2013 brenčič and vreča 2016 the relationship of groundwater in the initial and the final state gives us valuable insights into how the flow system works lee and krothe 2001 barbieri et al 2005 long et al 2008 in a shallow groundwater system like an

2018 stroj et al 2020 to improve the understanding of the groundwater flow systems in karstified carbonates the basic concepts of hydraulic flow have to be considered which are in accordance with hydraulic continuity tóth 1995 the groundwater flow patterns are controlled largely by topography and the groundwater movement has been conceptualized to occur within local intermediate and regional flow systems tóth 1963 in the case of small drainage basins local to intermediate groundwater flow systems water table configuration is considered as the main driving force of groundwater flow and the recharge and discharge properties of karst aquifers are defined mainly by the geological structure faulted fractured zones the spring represents an output of the groundwater flow system combining numerous theoretical flow pathways although the subsurface processes are less evident numerical simulations are used to improve better understanding of the flow systems and to calculate residence times for instance using particle tracking wang et al 2016 and or numerical simulation molson and frind 2012 janos et al 2018 investigation of the transport and geochemical processes through the rock matrix is also an important step between the infiltration and the leakage szijártó et al 2021 in the last few decades stable and radioactive isotopes have become powerful tools usually used as natural tracers in order to solve many problems in karst hydrogeology like management of karst water resources criss et al 2007 vulnerability of karst aquifers trček and zojer 2010 karst engineering etc goldscheider 2015 vasić et al 2020 evaluation of different isotope composition can be applied to obtain information about the behaviour of the karst aquifer such as the origin of the groundwater the mixing properties and dynamics the age distribution as well as aquifer processes occurring within the geological structure response of recharge to discharge mook 2006 knowledge of the groundwater residence time is of great importance since accurate age determinations can give us an insight to what extent the resource that we want to use is renewable or whether it is a limited deep aquifer and a geological reserve which does not have active interaction with different ambient water bodies including surface waters criss and davisson 1996 criss et al 2007 since karst aquifers are vulnerable to pollution the response of the water quality to a potential surface contamination has to be taken into account as a first approach the mean residence time of the spring water can be estimated using environmental tracers the mean residence time in a karstic aquifer represents an average age composed of the waters of different residence times contributing to the water discharge at the spring to constrain the residence time of these waters a higher sampling frequency within a longer time period is recommended to reveal both short and long term patterns in the stable or radioactive isotope compositions and or other chemical tracers of the springs when using transit times based on environmental tracers in hydrological systems long term time series are recommended einsiedl 2005 stewart and morgenstern 2016 the aim of this study was to examine the response of discharging karst waters using time series of environmental tracers in order to determine the age distribution of the karst springs additionally we intended to study shallow karst aquifers representing local groundwater flow systems focusing on the investigation of how the recent change of the tritium input function of the precipitation could be used in shallow karst aquifers springs in three mainly autogenic karst areas were studied in central europe hungary and slovakia groundwater samples for environmental tracers were taken in different frequencies between 2008 and 2018 and the time series were compared to long term isotope records of the precipitation 2 site description 2 1 mecsek mts mecsek mountains are located in southern hungary central europe fig 2 d the geological structure of western mecsek is characterized by an anticline with an east west line of strike the well karstified triassic limestone and dolomite of the anticline are particularly stressed fragmented and faulted barta and tarnai 1999 the geological structure of eastern mecsek is characterised by a syncline composed of middle and upper jurassic and lower cretaceous limestone that is less prone to karstification although geologically part of a single block topographically the karstic rocks of western mecsek can be found in three different zones and are mainly covered by brown forest soil with clay illuviation hoyk 1999 and c3 type plants in western mecsek hydrologeological investigations in the recharge area of the

vadose zone has been estimated to be on average 50 m based on dye tracing studies rónaki 1972 suggested that 80 of the recharge area of anyák and melegmányi springs was karstic while kánya and mariska

uplands zone of the bükk mts hungary fig 2c includes middle and upper triassic limestone the majority of the area is hosted by the bükkfennsík formation anchimetamorphosed platform facies limestone the southern strip of the catchment consists of the felsőtárkányi formation intrashelf basin facies thick bedded limestone with marl and chert intercalations while the northern strip is made up of the fehérkői formation thick bedded platform facies limestone there are a large number of karst springs registered in the bükk area the annual precipitation is 700 850 mm spinoni et al 2015 the long term average discharge of the bükk springs is 2 25 m3 s one of the main springs the szinva is used as a drink water resource for over 100 000 inhabitants the total catchment area including allogenic recharge is 280 km2 the long term average recharge calculated for the bükk is 32 4 while on the karstic upland area the annual recharge is assumed to exceed 36 kovács et al 2015 the uplands area has a large number of sinkholes following linear patterns kovács et al 2015 demonstrated that these features delineate water table conduits at depth and that the size of low permeability matrix blocks in between karst conduits range between 200 and 500 m during drought periods karst water level drops concentrated flow ceases within karst conduits and large scale diffuse flow starts becoming dominant in the system kovács et al 2015 this sort of scale change of flow systems is characteristic of the bükk uplands 2 3 slovak karst slovak karst is the largest continuous karst area of slovakia situated on the south eastern boundary which extends into hungary as the aggtelek karst forming the gömör torna karst system fig 2 together they present the largest plateau karst area of central europe the

kas jasovká plateau has a very clear hydrological boundary karst springs have variable water yields many of which are only seasonal however the strongest springs with average discharge of 20 50 l s are outlets from underground passages hochmuth and gessert 2017 table 1 3 methods 3 1 sampling strategy between 2006 and 2020 water samples for environmental isotope tracers 3h 18o 2h noble gases were taken regularly from karst springs in the three study areas five of the monitored springs kánya mariska anyák melegmányi and dagonyászó springs are located in the western mecsek and two springs csurgó and pásztor springs are located in eastern mecsek kánya and mariska are located a few hundred meters from each other and the same is true for anyák and melegmányi springs table 1 in bükk mts we focused on two springs szinva and ódor the szinva catchment extends over a 12 3 km elongated area of 37 km2 the szinva spring is located at 343 m asl the ódor spring is located to the western south from the szinva by 30 km at an elevation of 490 m asl eight karst springs were regularly investigated in the slovak karst the elevation of recharge area in the three study sites compares to each other ranging from 240 to 700 m asl the mean discharge rates are also shown in table 1 these latter values were determined using the bucket method in the mecsek mts and at ódor spring while the discharge of szinva and other springs in the slovak karst were calculated from water velocities using flow profiling to reveal long changes in isotope properties seasonal sampling frequency was chosen for the mecsek mts and slovak karst one specific spring anyák was chosen to perform monthly sampling to observe whether there was a contribution of infiltration of very short residence time ódor and szinva springs were sampled in a 1 2 year time steps since the searching for the long term trend was of interest in bükk mts 3 2 analytical methods isotope analyses were performed at the isotope climatology and environmental research centre icer institute for nuclear research debrecen hungary karst water samples have been analysed for tritium using the 3he ingrowth method with a special 4he isotope dilution technique palcsu et al 2010 papp et al 2012 the uncertainty of the method is 0 1 0 3 tu in the range of 5 10 tu stable isotope ratios δ 2h and δ 18o have been determined either by isotope ratio mass spectrometry vodila et al 2011 or cavity enhanced absorption spectrometry czuppon et al 2018 for hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios both methods have a measurement error of 1 5 and 0 1 respectively in order to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages of the water samples have also been taken for noble gas analysis helium including 3he 4he neon argon krypton and xenon concentrations have been analysed mass spectrometrically with a standard deviation of 1 2 as described by papp et al 2012 3 3 calculation of apparent ages tritium and noble gas measurement allow us to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages the tritiogenic 3he component can be decomposed from the measured noble gas concentrations and 3he 4he ratio and then the 3h 3he age is calculated by equation 1 where t is the age λ is the decay constant of tritium 3hmeas is the measured tritium concentration and the 3hetrit is the tritiogenic component of dissolved 3he schlosser et al 1988 palcsu et al 2017 1 t 3 h 3 h e 1 λ ln 3 h m e a s 3 h e t r i t 3 h m e a s the accuracy of the age calculations is 1 2 years several samples have been analysed for sf6 in the institute for environmental physics iup heidelberg germany by gas chromatography friedrich et al 2013 and then sf6 apparent ages have been calculated based on the comparison of atmospheric mixing ratio of sf6 in the previous decades darling et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 tritium the tritium values of the karst spring samples are slightly decreasing in each study sites in the investigated period fig 3 in mecsek mts the tritium of all springs are significantly decreasing from 7 0 to 8 0 tu to 4 5 5 5 tu during seven years 2013 2020 fig 3a most of the springs have similar tritium concentrations the only exception is csurgó spring with a slightly lower tritium content the tritium concentrations of the springs are compared to that of the precipitation and the recharge water fig 3 shows the tritium concentration of the monthly precipitation taken in debrecen east hungary the arithmetic mean as an average of the monthly precipitation is 10 4 tu for the whole data set of the 19 years of collection the time series of tritium in monthly precipitation shows a clear seasonality palcsu et al 2018 i e the winter precipitation has a significantly lower tritium content than the summer precipitation although the sampling location for the precipitation tritium time series is about 300 km apart the mecsek mts 100 km from the bükk mts and 150 km from the slovak karst fig 2 we consider this to be representative of the precipitation falling at each study site the water samples in mecsek mts were taken at 3 4 months intervals in the first three years and then less frequently yet in the first three years the seasonality of the tritium concentration of the precipitation and hence recharge water cannot be observed in the discharge of the karst aquifer in the bükk mts two karst springs have been investigated a 14 year long but less frequent sampling was performed at ódor spring fig 3c the tritium concentration of ódor spring was first observed to be decreasing from 2006 until 2009 from 9 to 6 tu and then it was rising by the next year and then decreasing again the tritium concentration in 2019 2020 reached 3 0 tu another karst spring in bükk mts the szinva spring was sampled at weekly resolution for a discharge study in 2015 and then in 2017 again in each individual year the tritium time series show a decreasing trend in fact the tritium values are significantly lower in 2017 than in 2015 fig 3c note that the accuracy of the tritium analyses is between 0 11 and 0 22 tu for these water samples hence these changes in tritium are significant an additional sample was analysed in 2020 but the tritium concentration cannot be significantly distinguished from the last results of 2017 to summarize in each study site the tritium concentrations of the karst waters show a long term decreasing trend the exception are two springs in the slovak karst that have higher tritium concentration in 2020 springs with the lowest tritium concentration might have the longer mean residence time similar decreasing trends can be seen in spring waters of other shallow karst aquifers kluge et al 2010a al charideh 2011 ozyurt et al 2014 although the tritium concentration of precipitation is decreasing throughout the 1990 s after 2005 it remains almost stable the decreasing trend in the tritium time series can be attributed to these following processes i the bomb contribution having higher tritium content is getting negligible in the aquifer due to wash out and radioactive decay ii the contribution of recharge is weak due to perhaps less precipitation or higher evaporation transpiration rate iii the trend is following the trend in the precipitation which is modulated by the solar cycle palcsu et al 2018 recently demonstrated that the tritium concentration of the precipitation does have a link to the solar cycle the higher annual tritium concentrations between 2006 and 2009 see fig 6 can be attributed to weak solar magnetic activity when more cosmic galactic particles could reach the earth s atmosphere producing more cosmogenic nuclei like tritium palcsu et al 2018 to distinguish and confirm which process is responsible to the decrease of tritium other environmental tracers have to be evaluated 4 2 18o isotope composition in karst springs seasonal patterns in stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water are frequently observed and used to reveal short response from recharge to discharge mance et al 2014 hu et al 2015 jeelani et al 2015 malík et al 2015 cao et al 2018 however as previously discussed we did not observe any seasonality in the tritium time series stable isotope values of mecsek and slovak karst springs do not exhibit a clear seasonal cycle corroborating the absence of intra annual variability in tritium levels however as samples have been taken at 3 4 month intervals the lack of seasonality in both environmental tracers may be a result of under sampling fig 4 a and b show the oxygen isotope composition of the mecsek and the slovak karst respectively these two sites have slightly different oxygen isotope signature the springs in the slovak karst have more positive values by 0 5 1 0 this can be attributed to several factors the lower elevation or the higher mean annual temperature of the slovak karst and moisture source regions or the recharge seasonality are different at the two areas to confirm the absence or presence of seasonality in the springs a frequent 3 4 week sampling period was performed at anyák spring mecsek mts for 18o analysis from september 2015 until december 2018 the main assumption is that if the 18o of the local precipitation is varying according to the seasonality fig 4c the spring water has a very young component it must be observed in the time series of the karst water as a seasonal change contrary to the previous observations when the sampling has not been done less frequently in 3 4 month steps the δ 18o time series of anyák spring shows a significant periodic variation as a result of a visual comparison of the two time series this variation is shifted by 0 5 years from the seasonal variation of the precipitation fig 4d indicating a significant contribution of a fresh water component with a residence time of potentially half a year in principle the age of the fresh component can be n 0 5 years n is an integer but as can be seen later the overall mean residence time of the water is very short when estimating the yield of this very young component one has to take a look at the magnitude of the variation in the δ 18o of the spring water and precipitation the spring water is varying in a range of 0 6 between 10 0 and 9 4 while the 18o composition of precipitation covers a range of 6 between 12 and 6 fig 4c and d considering the variations of δ 18o values and assuming the older component has a constant stable isotope composition i e well mixed the first order assumption for the contribution of the youngest water is at least 10 on the other hand the average δ 18o of anyák spring is 9 75 and the δ 18o values are varying around this value while the unweighted and the weighted by the precipitation amount mean averages of δ 18o of the precipitation at six stations in the mecsek mts are 8 82 and 8 66 respectively eq 2 shows how different averages are calculated subscipts s and w denote summer and winter monthly precipitation amounts and an additional weighing factor are referred as p and x respectively 2 δ 18 o p r s δ 18 o s p s w δ 18 o w p w x s p s w p w x the spring has a lower δ 18o value than the precipitation average this suggests that the winter precipitation prevails in the recharging water in hungary the summer months have more precipitation hence when calculating mean annual average δ 18o values weighted by the precipitation amount the δ 18o will be higher than the arithmetic average of the monthly values an additional weighing factor refer to x in eq 2 for the hydrologic winter half year november to april was modelled to obtain close match to the one of the long term average of the spring if we give an additional weighing factor of 5 after a trial and error searching as a best fit parameter for the cold months an average value 9 74 is obtained which is reliable for the long term average for the anyák spring 9 75 this approach gives an assumption that the precipitation fallen in the winter half year prevails to the recharge by a factor of five than that of the summer months from may to october the same approach will be used when estimating the tritium concentration of the recharge water based on the monthly tritium values and precipitation amounts 4 3 recharge component analysis to detect the origin of the water in the springs and reveal the contribution of the re evaporation of local waters the relationship of 18o and 2h has been examined the local meteoric water line in the mecsek mts is δ 2h 7 84 δ 18o 6 77 fórizs et al 2020 the δ 2h δ 18o values of the spring waters are slightly above the lmwl indicating a small contribution of re evaporation to the local precipitation although this effect has a minor importance fig 5 as one could see in figs 2 and 3 the tritium values of the springs are decreasing and lower than that of the precipitation this allows us to restrict an estimation to the age distribution of the waters the 18o time series of one specific karst spring anyák mecsek mts indicates a half year residence time for the recent precipitation with a contribution of around 10 the tritium time series and other dating methods such as 3h 3he kluge et al 2010b szűcs et al 2015 miller et al 2017 palcsu et al 2017 and sf6 age determinations friedrich et al 2013 delbart et al 2014 help us estimate the contribution of the older components in the range of years fig 6 shows all tritium concentrations for each study sites and the precipitation for debrecen eastern hungary additionally an estimation for the tritium time series of the recharge water is also given in fig 6 the annual mean tritium values of the recharge estimation have been composed by weighing the monthly tritium values with the precipitation amount and an additional factor of 5 for the months within the winter half year see the chapter of 18o isotope composition above in fig 6 the lower tritium values of the spring waters indicate that the mean residence time of the water is not zero if we want to estimate a residence time of the water the tritium concentrations of the water and the precipitation have to be compared the average tritium concentrations arithmetic means of the precipitation in debrecen eastern hungary and in krakow southern poland are 10 8 tu palcsu et al 2018 and 10 0 tu gnip database iaea respectively we are aware that the isotope composition of precipitation does not reflect that of infiltrating water because the summer contribution is smaller than that of the other seasons due to evaporation and transpiration in case of the debrecen precipitation the arithmetic mean of the monthly tritium is 10 8 tu while the mean tritium concentration weighted by the precipitation amount is 11 5 tu note that there is more precipitation in summer than in winter while using an additional weighing factor of 5 for the winter hydrological half year as was derived from the stable isotope composition see above the mean is 9 9 tu as for a first estimation of the mean residence time of the springs in mecsek mts this latter weighted mean tritium concentration is used to the calculation according to the radioactive decay law one can obtain mean residence times between 1 and 12 years the youngest is the spring in the slovak karst 0 2 years mecsek spings and szinva have similar ages 0 4 years while the oldest is ódor 4 12 years however this calculation assumes that the tritium concentration of the recharge water i e the weighted average of the precipitation does not change obviously this is not absolutely true figs 3 and 6 show that the tritium concentration of the precipitation in the investigated duration do change after the 1990 s this change is apparently solely due to the solar cycle palcsu et al 2018 the attenuation of the bomb peak cannot be seen any more in the precipitation in fig 6 an apparent conformity between the long term tritium trends of the spring waters and the precipitation recharge water can be seen an important question resulting from our study is whether these variations in the spring water tritium time series can be attributed to the solar cycle morgenstern et al 2010 if this is correct the long term change of the tritium time series in the precipitation due to the solar cycle could be used to constrain the age distribution of shallow karst springs when applying long term time series for karst waters to answer the question of the presence of the solar cycle in the time series the mean residence times of the waters have to be taken into account 4 4 apparent ages additional age tracers have been used to further analyse the residence time in the mecsek mts samples for dissolved noble gases were taken between 2013 and 2015 and then 3h 3he apparent ages were calculated fig 7 a these ages are varying between 0 and 10 years the distribution of the age values is exponential see the histogram in fig 7b the median of these 47 3h 3he ages is 1 4 years note that some tritiogenic 3he might have been lost during sampling when the water yield was too small as these springs are open discharges it is possible that some helium degassing could have occurred during sampling however we consider this process to be negligible although these young ages can be considered as minimum ages these 3h 3he ages indicate that the mean residence time of the water are up to 10 years to verify this in july 2013 water samples for sf6 determination were taken at four springs in mecsek mts the calculated sf6 apparent ages corrected for excess air amount determined from the noble gas temperature calculation agree very well to the 3h 3he ages in all cases and both were from 0 to 1 4 years indicating that those discharging waters were indeed very young table 2 4 5 source of variability in spring water tritium the long term tritium monitoring data of three different shallow karst aquifers shows in most cases decreasing tritium concentrations and thus exhibits a similar pattern to the natural variability of tritium concentration in precipitation in these three karst areas significant higher changes in either air temperature or precipitation amount evaporation transpiration rate and recharge rate cannot be seen which would be responsible to the change of the distribution of younger and older water ages in the aquifer thus resulting in lower tritium concentrations one explanation for this effect can be the attenuation of the bomb peak contribution the aquifers contain waters of different residence times thus the older components used to include more tritium from the nuclear weapon tests while the tritium concentration of the younger components is free of bomb tritium and has already reached the natural level palcsu et al 2018 as time goes the contribution of the bomb tritium gets less significant moreover the radioactive decay provides an additional decrease of tritium the decreasing signature is the strongest in case of ódor spring bükk mts as it also has the lowest tritium concentration this strongest decrease and the lowest tritium amount are in accordance with the highest mean residence time the other springs in bükk and mecsek mts show similar pattern even if a slight contribution of very recent waters detected by the frequent analysis of δ 18o might contribute to the age distribution of the springs as can be seen in anyák spring mecsek mts the decreasing trends are similar to each other and can be attributed to the depletion of the bomb contribution however those springs whose tritium concentrations are higher i e closer to that of precipitation and the estimated recharge values may follow another trend as well i e having some increase from 2016 onwards as the 3h 3he and sf6 apparent ages indicate that the spring water in mecsek mts is very young 1 4 years as a medial of the age distribution it is expected that the long term changes of tritium in precipitation and hence the recharge water is reflected more directly in the spring waters since the precipitation time series are modulated by solar activity palcsu et al 2018 the solar cycle should be observed in the tritium time series of the karst waters the highest tritium concentrations can be seen in the slovakian karst springs fig 6 the individual samples as well as the annual averages are increasing in tritium from the year 2016 similar pattern can be observed in the precipitation and the recharge estimate the tritium is increasing from 2015 probably due to the weakening solar activity as expected however even though the signatures compare well we do not conclude the elevated tritium of the slovakian spring is directly linked to the increase of the precipitation the 6 year time series is still not long enough to decide whether the tritium in the precipitation modulated by the solar activity can be observed in shallow karst aquifers 5 conclusion time series of environmental tracers have revealed important information on the recharge and discharge conditions in three karst aquifers in hungary and slovakia frequent sampling 2 4 weeks of spring waters can help us determining the contribution of recent infiltration in the case of spring waters from mecsek mts in hungary the 10 of the discharge water has a residence time of half a year additionally the recharge conditions can be also estimated using the stable isotope composition of the water weighing isotope data of the winter and summer months separately provides us with an adequate estimation to investigate the behavior of the recharge during the winter and summer half year this approach namely using a weighing factor of 5 for the winter months has been used when estimating the tritium concentration of the recharge water based on the monthly tritium values and precipitation amounts the apparent ages vary between 0 and 10 years showing and exponential distribution in the 3h 3he ages of the mecsek springs the median of the 3h 3he ages is 1 4 years using the tritium values and the estimation of the tritium time series of the recharge water mean residence times have been estimated the youngest is the spring in the slovak karst 0 2 years mecsek spings and szinva have similar ages 0 4 years while the oldest is ódor 4 12 years an important question resulting from our study is whether the variation of tritium in the spring water can be attributed to the solar cycle even though the signatures compare well we do not conclude the elevated tritium of the slovakian springs or some mecsek springs is directly linked to the increase of the precipitation the 6 year time series is still not long enough to decide whether the tritium in the precipitation modulated by the solar activity can be observed in shallow karst aquifers the solar activity signal would make possible the determination of a few year residence times using long term times series of environmental tracers including tritium however further studies and longer time series are needed for this thus additional samples for tritium will be taken from each spring in these study areas twice a year and hopefully after obtaining longer time series we can confirm the absence or presence of the solar component in the shallow karst waters credit authorship

8203,study region the niger river basin nrb at niamey west africa study focus two approaches to estimate the cross section of rivers based solely on satellite imagery or digital elevation model dem and altimetry for a large data deficient region are proposed these approaches are the lateral method lm which directly provides the cross sections and the mixed method mm which incorporates a dem with topography bathymetry the lm consists of following the river water lateral evolution on either side of a centerline using daily planet scope imagery while the riverbed is estimated using satellite altimeters the mm is based on the riverbed estimated from altimetry during the recession period and the banks heights are extracted from a dem river discharge was estimated at four cross sections over a reach of 30 km at niamey an evaluation of the estimated discharge using in situ discharge at niamey hydrometric station presents a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 93 and a relative bias of 3 3 new hydrological insights for the region the proposed method is feasible for other rivers in the sahelian zone and supports a better understanding of surface water hydrology for example the estimated discharge at four cross sections at a river reach of 30 km at niamey was used to observe downstream flow gains nevertheless the role of uncertainties and other contributions e g evaporation losses on the observed gains deserves further investigation keywords lateral method mixed method niger river satellite imagery satellite altimetry 1 introduction information on river discharge remains an essential tool for water management and risk prevention see e g de bruijn 2004 hooijer et al 2004 klijn et al 2015 vis et al 2003 however a considerable number of rivers have few gauging devices distributed along their channels calmant and seyler 2006 committee 2001 sneeuw et al 2014 have shown that many river basins are largely ungauged or their datasets are not publicly available the decline in routine reporting of river discharge observations across the globe is a well known problem that has contributed to limiting understanding of surface water hydrology and how they are affected by climate change and anthropogenic activities e g ndehedehe 2019 vörösmarty et al 2005 new satellite hydrology missions like radar altimetry are filling this gap to an extent but their unavailability and capability to provide direct river discharge measurements for important but ungauged river basins remain a challenge to improve knowledge on the nature of climate change impacts on water resources new methods that optimize the prediction and modeling of river discharge observations are thus crucial aiming to circumvent this problem several studies have highlighted the feasibility of remotely sensed datasets to estimate river discharge see e g bjerklie et al 2005 durand et al 2009 elmi et al 2015 gleason and smith 2014 grünler et al 2013 sichangi et al 2018 for instance bjerklie et al 2005 combined aerial photos synthetic aperture radar sar images with topographical maps to estimate in bank river discharge elmi et al 2015 employed a rating curve through the quantile functions of measured discharge and estimated river width gleason and smith 2014 retrieved instantaneous river discharge using at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg durand et al 2009 used the surface water and ocean topography swot measurements concepts to estimate the river depth and discharge grünler et al 2013 converted the sar derived velocity to depth integrated velocity then applied an empirical model to estimate discharge sichangi et al 2018 investigated the time lag retrieved from the temporal river width observations at two stream segments a distance apart thereafter they ibid applied an empirical model to estimate the river discharge to sum up hagemann et al 2017 presented a bayesian amhg manning bam algorithm which implements a bayesian formulation of streamflow uncertainty using a combination of manning s equation and amhg to estimate discharge from only remotely sensed stream width slope and height at multiple locations along a mass conserved river segment using cubesat data feng et al 2019 estimated discharge for eleven arctic rivers with widths ranging from 16 to 1 000 m wide using bam amhg to solve hydraulic geometry parameters to estimate water flow brinkerhoff et al 2020 improved discharge estimation by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics they used over 370 000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data to test unsupervised learning and a method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing the data driven and empirical approaches of the mentioned studies indicated different accuracy and unique advantages over the other however potential limitations and unsuitability for several study regions in west africa are likely the need to know the distributions that quantify the a priori uncertainty of unknown quantities including discharge and hydraulic equation parameters nevertheless the present study introduces a new approach that allows obtaining the river cross section and consequently river discharge using only remotely sensed techniques satellite imagery and altimetry firstly cross section estimation using a proposed lateral method abbreviated herein as lm consisting of both horizontal width and vertical depth monitoring of river water evolution is introduced using planet scope daily images the change in river water width is observed laterally from a centerline while measurements recorded on the same day by satellite altimetry are used to estimate the water depth river bathymetry secondly based on the proposed mixed method shortened as mm the measurements of the river bottom height are collected during river recession using satellite altimetry in contrast the river banks height measurements are extracted using alos palsar radiometrically terrain corrected rtc digital elevation model dem the obtained cross section s area is estimated using the trapezoidal method and then the equivalent section is calculated to estimate the wetted perimeter while the average slope is estimated using the alos palsar rtc dem the values for estimating the roughness coefficient are those from chow 1959 after a careful analysis of the river characteristics using satellite images and previous studies massazza et al 2019 tiepolo et al 2019 finally using manning s equation and the extracted hydraulic parameters it is possible to estimate the river discharge the proposed method to estimate river cross section and discharge was investigated over the niger river basin nrb at niamey station fig 1 a west africa the particular choice of the niger river is because its low water level occurs naturally every year and has taken on a particular dimension in recent years because it occurs early and is very pronounced see the images at different periods shown in fig 1b e the river s bed dries up and the waters give way to rocks and other sandy plains visible along the bed fig 1b the drop in the water level of the niger river is accentuated in april and reaches its peak in may with an almost zero discharge generally in this period of the year a large part of the riverbed is exposed allowing people to cross the river on foot casse et al 2016 2015 descroix et al 2012 providing us the ability to map the height of the channel bottom that otherwise would remain unobservable this is explained by the low rainfall recorded in several places in the upper niger basin and the influence of human activities including intensive irrigation and the construction of water mobilization structures dams water drilling etc as discussed in previous studies aich et al 2016 angelina et al 2015 ghile et al 2014 goulden et al 2011 oguntunde and abiodun 2012 tiepolo et al 2019 therefore the main goals of this study are twofold i to develop a method that allows extraction of river bathymetry establishing river cross sections and extraction of hydrological parameters entering in the estimation of river discharge according to manning s equation using satellite images and satellite altimetry exclusively and ii to observe the gains and losses of flow in the downstream direction at a 30 km reach defined at niamey the subsequent sections of the study are structured as follows section 2 presents further details of the study area section 3 presents the description of the datasets and methods the results are presented in section 4 followed by their respective discussions finally the conclusions of the study are provided in section 5 2 regional setting the niger river is located in west africa fig 1a its length of 4184 km makes it the third longest river in africa after the nile 6 700 km and congo 47 00 km it originates at the north eastern border of sierra leone and guinea conakry at the foot of the loma mountains 9 65 n 10 87 w crosses guinea conakry mali niger benin and nigeria where it flows into the atlantic ocean 4 33 n 6 07 e the selected river reach used in this study belongs to the nrb at niamey fig 1a the nrb at niamey accounts for approximately 34 of the total nrb s catchment area this portion of the niger river s reach is characterized by two flooding periods the local flood generally happens from august to september which is strongly dependent on the rains it is caused by local rains whose waters are transported by tributaries of the area sirba goroual and dargol mixed with the mainstem then another flood period occurs from november to january caused by the waters coming from guinea and mali the upstream part of the study area casse and gosset 2015 descroix et al 2012 low waters are observed between april and may with discharge often almost null the selected reach nearby niamey is 30 km long fig 2 a it starts from the village of boubon 13 57 n 1 00 e crosses the city of niamey and ends at the village of koulou kwara 13 36 n 2 21 e and has an average width of 527 m fig 2b this value was estimated using planet scope images from september 30 of 2018 over the 30 km distance fig 2a the average water surface width extracted from 60 transects perpendicular to the flow and spaced 500 m apart is 527 m as shown in fig 2b further details are presented in sub section 3 1 1 the choice was made by considering the advantages offered by this part of the river such as its morphology topography the existence of a hydrometric station 13 50 n 2 11 e and the riverbed that is visible during may when some parts appear almost dry however a few scattered and deep areas of the river retain their waters throughout the year these are mainly the old sand quarries where the sand used for construction works was dredged 3 materials and methods 3 1 datasets this study was made possible by using several data including satellite images altimetry data and dem observed in situ data were used to assess the accuracy of the results they are described in the following sub sections 3 1 1 optical satellite images historical images available in google earth pro were used for the rapid detection of periods when the river bottom is visible and periods of the flood define the time interval required for the monitoring of the lateral evolution of the river water and limit the satellite images to be processed these images were used to retrieve the riverbanks and centerline and select the appropriate parts of the reach for extracting cross sections over time the river water width variations were then carried out using daily acquisition planet scope images access to data requires a quick and straightforward registration on planet explorer in total 109 images were collected over the period from may 30 2018 to september 30 2018 for analysis as part of this study planet scope images have four different multispectral bands which passes through the water slide red green blue and near infrared high spatial resolution 3 m allowing to detect changes even at small scale and high radiometric resolution 12 bit cooley et al 2017 wicaksono and lazuardi 2018 the images have undergone a range of corrections including orthorectification by removing the displacements caused by the tilt of the satellite sensor topographical variation and the curvature of the earth orthorectification is the process of transforming raw imagery to an accurate orthogonal projection as against the perspective projection of the raw image it was done by using the ground control points and a dem to make the images planimetrically correct and to give a constant scale wherein features are represented in their actual positions also color correction using a color curve to optimize colors as seen by the human eye for providing images as they would look if viewed from the satellite s perspective was applied marta 2018 this processing scheme makes planet scope images reliable for use in several fields that require images with precise geolocation and map projection the product can then be used and ingested directly into a geographic information system or remote sensing studies the possibility offered by the planet explorer plugin to define a tolerated percentage of cloudy images allowed us to receive clear images with excellent visibility directly the river width values extraction from satellite imagery was done using rivwidth tool written by pavelsky and smith 2008 the tool is freely accessible from http uncglobalhydrology org rivwidth rivwidth automates the continuous extraction of river width values at regular intervals along an entire river reach for a river reach lacking islands the input is a channel mask which is a binary mask that assigns water pixels a value of 1 and nonwater pixels a value of 0 a second input a river mask was required in a river reach with islands this binary mask differentiates those areas within the river boundary including islands and those outside the river the algorithm used to calculate a centerline starts with the binary river mask and determines the distance from each river pixel to the nearest non river pixel using a uniform cost search algorithm cormen et al 2001 the distance map is then convolved with a bidirectional laplacian filter thus a series of transects that are orthogonal to the centerline at each centerline pixel are generated finally the calculation of the river width is performed for each centerline pixel using the series of pixel values that intersect its orthogonal line segment 3 1 2 digital elevation model alos palsar rtc dem 12 5 m of the surrounded area was used to derive the river reach slope and extract the riverbank s points x y z the data is freely accessible from https search asf alaska edu the dem provided to users is based on the world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 reference ellipsoid and has undergone corrections such as radiometric correction this elevation model consists of eliminating the misleading influence of topography on the backscatter values and a terrain correction which is applied to avoid geometric distortions that induce geolocation errors zhao et al 2017 combining these two corrections produces a dem with considerably high quality for various scientific applications based on ellipsoidal heights referred to the ellipsoid here given by wgs84 rather than the orthometric heights referred to the geoid correa muñoz et al 2019 evaluated the quality of nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster and alos palsar dems by comparison with control points obtained by the global positioning system they found that the alos palsar rtc dem provides the best accuracy of heights and was used to derivate terrain parameters elevation slope and aspect furthermore bhardwaj 2019 observed that in predominantly plain and rugged regions with mixed land use land cover alos palsar rtc data have higher accuracy than tandem x90 m dem 3 1 3 satellite altimetry data data from five altimetry missions were used to monitor the water elevation variations namely envisat jason 2 cryosat 2 sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b the combination of data from the five altimetric missions enabled us to increase the frequency of water elevation observation due to the appreciable density of virtual stations present along the river reach see the altimetry missions ground tracks that intersected the river reach shown in fig 2a the data are already processed by agencies and mostly contain the algorithms suitable for inland water studies which the reliability has been shown by previous studies boergens et al 2017 dubey et al 2015 kittel et al 2020 koblinsky et al 1993 kuo and kao 2011 tarpanelli et al 2019 tourian et al 2017 2016 villadsen et al 2015 we directly and freely accessed the ocean surface topography mission ostm jason 2 along track pistach hydrology data from https www aviso altimetry fr envisat sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b geophysical data record gdr from https scihub copernicus eu accessibility to cryosat 2 data was possible to us after a request through http ctoh legos obs mip fr a summary of the main characteristics of these missions is given in table 1 the five missions table 1 present different temporal resolutions and or measurement epochs for example there are missions with a 10 day repeat period jason 2 a 27 day repeat period sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b a 369 day repeat period with 30 day sub cycles cryosat 2 and a 35 day repeat period for envisat the choice of the river reach shown in fig 2a was made based on the density of satellite altimetry derived water levels available at the date of may 30 2018 these are cryosat 2 track 1176 jason 2 track 241 and sentinel 3a track 4672 a large part about 80 of the reach channel bottom is observable and we call this date t 0 the locations of these ground tracks that are oblique concerning the direction of flow were selected to construct cross sections perpendicular to the flow direction noteworthy the water elevations measured by altimeter do not correspond to a single point s measurement but to the average elevations of a surface observed and measured by altimeter within a footprint the footprint is the area on the earth s surface illuminated by the radar beam we have then for this study assumed the oblique ground track water elevation to be representative at the perpendicular cross section for example the altimeter ground footprint diameter is about 1 66 km for cryosat 2 600 m for sentinel 3a and ranges from 2 to 4 km for jason 2 depending on the satellite altitude jiang et al 2017 at the epoch t 0 the water elevations measured at the three ground track locations were averaged and the mean value was considered the zero of the water elevation measurements however the difference in elevations was calculated for each location this elevation difference allows us to deduce the water surface elevation at any cross section location knowing the height at one cross section location since the altimetry missions do not have the same revisit time they cannot measure the water level every time on the same day throughout the study period in the case of unavailability of a ground track that directly intersected the cross section the measurement made by the nearby ground track was considered to be representative of the cross section is included in its footprint this allowed us to increase the frequency of water surface elevation measurements at each cross section and the elevation width combination extracted on the same day led to the construction of the cross sections finally all water levels from the different missions were used to construct water level time series after bias correction the biases among the various missions were minimized by fitting the respective water level series into a model with a constant linear annual amplitude and phase terms the parameters were estimated with a least squares fitting procedure the final water level series at the four cross section locations are referred to the wgs84 to be consistent with the rtc dem 3 1 4 in situ river discharge for validation purposes the water levels time series from 01 01 2005 to 12 31 2018 were acquired at niamey s hydrometric station 13 50 n 2 11 e see fig 2 from the niger basin authority autorité du basin du niger abn abn is an intergovernmental organization in west africa aiming to foster co operation in managing and developing the resources of the basin of the niger river it is headquartered in niamey republic of niger the water level measurements were generally recorded twice a day e g 08 00 and 18 00 local time hence a stage discharge relation was used to estimate the river discharge from the water levels at niamey using a rating curve estimated by abn at which further details can be found in krekeler 2012 3 2 methods one of this study s focuses was to estimate the river bottom geometry shape with good precision to minimize the errors while retrieving the cross sections and estimating the parameters used to compute river discharge this required careful monitoring from the river recession period to the river flood period which lasts about five months may to september for the niger river section 2 the time slider provided in google earth to move between image acquisition dates can make it possible to detect the dates when the riverbed appears without water and the periods of flood for this study a careful observation carried out on images taken between january 2018 and december 2018 showed that the images taken on may 30 2018 offered the best visibility of the riverbed while the maximum flooded area was observed in the images taken on september 30 2018 may 30 2018 is then considered the start time t 0 as mentioned in sub section 3 1 3 3 2 1 cross sections establishment the so called lateral method lm and mixed method mm are introduced aiming to estimate the river cross sections which are fundamental to compute the river discharge based on manning s equation sub section 3 2 2 a brief highlight of the lm and mm methods is given below a the lateral method lm after selecting the river reach and according to the available satellite altimetry ground tracks the lm method aims to subsidize the construction of cross sections at the location of orbital altimeter crossings however the cross sections are normal to the centerline based on the images showing the dry riverbed at a known date t 0 the river centerline was drawn from the start to the end of the reach fig 2a as shown in fig 3 a the letter j was placed along the centerline to indicate the starting points for the lateral progression of the water width from the centerline to the right r and left l banks see the diagram in fig 3a careful sorting was necessary to select clear images and reject altered or cloudy images analysis of the daily satellite images was then carried out to extract the water width evolution from the dry riverbed period t 0 to the period of the maximum flooded area t n as shown in fig 3b this process was repeated two to three times depending on the image quality and the measurements were averaged to minimize errors furthermore the width monitoring was accompanied by the water elevation monitoring recorded by altimetry missions on the same day fig 3b with this it was possible to obtain the horizontal and vertical evolution of the river water simultaneously a combination of the data obtained from the right side r and the left side l shown in fig 3b gave a cross section xs of the river at the location j as shown in fig 3c therefore the process was applied to extract the four cross sections at orbital altimeter crossings see fig 2a for their locations in this study b the mixed method mm as for the lm approach a careful inspection of the historical images was carried out to identify the periods that the river dried up and that of the maximum flooded area the images in which the river appeared to be at its minimum and the maximum level were used to distinguish the riverbed and to delineate the river banks then the riverbanks heights were extracted from alos palsar rtc dem sub section 3 1 2 and the riverbed was masked out fig 4 a next the riverbed limits were then used to access all the points that lay within the riverbed which provided the longitudes and latitudes altitude within the riverbed were discarded forming a sampling grid fig 4b however in order to assign elevations to this sampling grid interpolation extrapolation was carried out using the height measurements from the five satellite altimetry missions that intersected the river reach fig 2a which were collected during the period of shallow water with a large part of the riverbed exposed altimetry data collected outside the riverbed was rejected ensuring that only the data heights of the exposed riverbed were retained the last phase of the process consisted of merging the points providing information on the height of the riverbed fig 4b and the points providing information on the height of the riverbanks fig 4a as shown in fig 4c this led to the creation of a mixed dem fig 4d which provided the topography and bathymetry necessary to extract the cross sections xs it should be emphasized that the basic difference between the lm and mm is that the former uses optical images and altimetry while the latter uses dem and altimetry while both provide means to estimate the channel cross sections mm has the advantage of providing the whole bathymetry of the reach which could be helpful for other applications that said the mm estimated cross sections are used to assess those estimated from lm 3 2 2 hydraulic parameters and river discharge estimation the river discharge according to manning s equation 1 q 1 n a r 2 3 s 1 2 can be easily computed if the river cross section sub section 3 2 1 and water level altimetry see sub section 3 1 3 are available in eq 1 q represents the discharge n is the roughness coefficient a is the cross sectional area r is the hydraulic radius and s is the slope of the channel at the respective cross section location a cross section area can be approximated using the trapezoidal rule the area is evaluated by splitting the total cross section area into several small trapezoids the sum of their areas gives the cross section s area the way trapezoids hug the cross section shape can give a much better area estimate than rectangles the hydraulic radius can be calculated as 2 r a p w where the wetted perimeter p w which can be derived from the derived cross sections lm and mm and water levels from altimetry regarding the slope s by using the concept of reach length lefavour and alsdorf 2005 firstly we extracted the main stem the main trunk or channel elevations from alos palsar rtc dem over 1400 km of middle niger and combined with flow distance to investigate the alos palsar rtc dem error along the river main stem the standard error of the elevation average σ values is about 4 31 m using a subset of alos palsar rtc dem containing only pixels that intersect the streamline over the middle niger we calculated the change of z values for a cell based on all surrounding cells and found a minimum slope s min of 1 12 cm km along the main stem nevertheless to calculate a reliable slope from a dem reach length needs to extend a sufficient distance to accommodate the errors in elevations lefavour and alsdorf 2005 suggested a simple relationship to determine the appropriate reach length rl 3 r l 2 σ s min where s min represents the minimum slope and σ is the standard error of the elevation average we then found an appropriate rl of approximately 769 km and a slope of 2 29 0 02 cm km at 97 confidence interval as shown in fig 5 the slope value is treated as a constant for discharge calculation at the four cross section locations along the 30 km reach the manning roughness coefficient n necessary in eq 1 determines the resistance exerted by the channel to the water flow in hydrology this resistance is linked to the frictional forces generated by the materials constituting the channel it can be determined by considering several factors as explained by chow 1959 4 n n o n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 where n 0 is a particle size value assigned according to the size and shape of the materials constituting the channel n 1 is a value added to n 0 to correct the effect of surface roughness n 2 is a value assigned according to the variations of the cross section n 3 is a value assigned according to the influence in obstruction n 4 is a value assigned according to the type of vegetation cover and n 5 is a correction factor assigned according to the stream meandering degree for this study parameters n 0 and n 1 values were drawn from the results of previous studies belcore et al 2019 massazza et al 2019 carried out on the niger river and its tributaries and the values of parameters n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 were decided after an analysis of planet scope satellite images due to the similar characteristics of the locations of the four cross sections we assumed a constant value of the roughness coefficient for all flow levels during the study period as well as within the river cross section these figures are presented in table 2 3 2 3 performance measures the performance of the estimated discharge was determined using the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse the relative bias in percent re and the nse coefficient given as e g moriasi et al 2007 5 rmse 1 t i 1 t q obs i q r i 2 6 nrmse rmse q obs 100 7 re 1 t q r q obs 1 t q obs 100 and 8 nse 1 i 1 t q obs i q r i 2 i 1 t q obs i q

situ measurement and q obs is the mean value of the observed discharge 4 results and discussion 4 1 on the estimated cross sections in this section the derived cross sections from the lm and mm approaches are analyzed and compared a total of four cross sections were established including one at the hydrometric station xs 3 shown in fig 2a the exact locations were maintained for both methods mm and lm in order to allow their intercomparisons the raw rtc dem does not show the bathymetry of the river mainly due to the inability of the sensors to image the river bottom due to the presence of water however cross sections were made using raw rtc dem to ensure that the derived river banks fit with the ones resulting from mm and lm approaches as can be seen in fig 6 panels a c e and g the riverbanks derived from the raw rtc dem overlap appreciably with those resulting from the lm and mm approaches without apparent bias and or systematic differences due to the lack of in situ data for the bathymetry of the niger river the river cross section comparison was made only between the mm and lm methods using the coefficient of determination r 2 r squared at each of the four locations the intercomparison between the cross sections derived from the mm and the lm approaches shows an almost similar configuration with a high coefficient of determination 0 99 for xs 2 and xs 4 and 0 98 for xs 1 and xs 3 fig 6b d f and h however the riverbanks derived from the raw rtc dem and the mm seem to better overlap this situation is observable at the level of the four cross sections and can be explained by the fact that the data for both methods are from the same source i e alos palsar rtc dem hence only cross sections based on the lm approach are considered to estimate the niger river discharge section 4 2 this particular choice is because lm uses optical images and altimetry and could easily be implemented at any water resource institute department to estimate the cross sections under the conditions of exposed riverbeds as it is the case of many rivers at the sahelian zone 4 2 on the estimated river discharge based on the lm approach the discharge was estimated from 01 01 2005 to 10 01 2018 for the four cross sections fig 7 a c e and g noteworthy observed daily river discharge is available only at xs 3 niamey albeit the distance to xs 1 upstream xs 2 upstream and xs 4 downstream is 14 5 km 4 km and 15 5 km respectively it is not expected here that the estimated discharge at the three cross sections will provide the same values that is additional flow gains or losses could be expected between the upstream cross sections relatively to niamey xs 3 overall the river discharge at the four cross sections peaks in september and january which almost coincides with the flood periods in the region fig 7 the first flood the red flood or local flood reaches the region from august to september and the second one guinean flood or black flood during november to january section 2 the low flow period generally occurs in june the main peak of precipitation generally occurs during july august which is associated with the annual cycle furthermore there is a smaller peak that generally happens around january cf section 2 furthermore fig 7 panels b d f and h presents the comparison between estimated discharge at the four cross sections and those observed at niamey station in terms of their scatter plots and relationship correlations noteworthy the comparisons of the estimated discharges with in situ discharge for all four cross section locations are performed here only for verifying the overall consistency between the estimated and observed series there is a good agreement between the lm estimated and observed discharges for all four locations fig 7 panels b d f and h however the scatter plot for discharge values above approximately 1400 m3s 1 seems to be more dispersed concerning the 1 1 line red line for xs 1 xs 2 and xs 4 locations fig 7b d and h this could be due to a potential overestimation of the discharge over august and september and or indication of a potential flow losses of the xs 1 and xs 2 relatively to niamey station the accuracy of lm to estimate discharge q r was carried out by comparison with the observed discharge q obs at the xs 3 location table 3 since it is the only cross section that has observed discharge niamey station as highlighted in table 3 the performance evaluation indicates that lm estimated discharge for xs 3 has high accuracy a slight overestimation of the discharge resulted in a positive value of re 3 3 the nse coefficient value shows a very good fit with a performance of 0 93 according to moriasi et al 2007 nse 1 0 is the perfect fit nse 0 75 is a very good fit nse 0 64 to 0 74 is a good fit nse 0 5 to 0 64 is a satisfactory fit and nse 0 5 is an unsatisfactory fit overall the result shows that the proposed method can estimate the river discharge since there is consistency among different discharge variations fig 7 notably a slight overestimation of the estimated discharge at xs 3 during the high flow season of september october is observed this can be explained by the cross section s area calculation using the trapezoidal method which loses precision when the geometry of the section becomes more complex and larger during the high flow seasons tallarida and murray 1987 yeh 2002 table 3 also presents the streamflow gains and losses which were estimated by computing the difference in streamflow at the upstream at xs 1 xs 2 and xs 3 and downstream at xs 4 over the reach fig 2a that is the contributions of evaporation losses e and inflows from tributaries to the main steam i were neglected otherwise the gains and losses g could be estimated as g q d q u i e after ignoring the contributions of diversions return to the reach and seeps the mean values of gains and loss for xs 1 xs 2 and xs 3 regarding xs 4 is 4 4 m3s 1 7 7 m3s 1 and 2 9 m3s 1 respectively the positive values g indicate a gaining stream reach and albeit evaporation was not considered it would sum up to the gains anyhow and thereby we can conclude that the overall reach is indeed a gaining stream since the results show a reasonable estimation of river discharge at niamey station table 3 and fig 7e the application of the lm is feasible and can be extended to other rivers in the sahelian zone these rivers are generally characterized by a dry and wet cycle due to their high dependence on seasonal rains such as senegal and nakambe rivers karambiri et al 2011 and sirba river passerotti et al 2020 this approach lm then has the advantage of being less expensive compared to the method proposed by bjerklie et al 2005 where the acquisition of aerial photos can add costs it can be applied to a single stream segment compared to sichangi et al 2018 which requires two stream segments to estimate the time lag in the variation in river width furthermore the proposed approach mm also provides river bathymetry and cross sections of the river that can be used for other purposes such as navigation vessels or bridge building however the proposed lm and mm approaches cannot apply to rivers whose bottom is not visible at some point during the observation period which is the main limitation of the present study the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas instrument onboard the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 2 icesat 2 launched in 2018 provides a dataset atl13 for water surface elevations and is also able to see the topography of a river bottom but still not much data on many rivers in the near future its data can be useful in calibrating the derived cross sections using the framework developed in this study and their combination will also give considerable precise cross sections 5 conclusions two approaches for the extraction of river cross sections using alos palsar rtc dem and satellite imagery and altimetry for river discharge were introduced manning s equation parameters were extracted then river discharge was estimated the cross section geometry is obtained by lateral monitoring lm approach of the river water evolution while simultaneously the depth is being monitored by satellite altimetry mm approach the resulting cross section s area is estimated using the discretization of the cross sections into smaller trapezoids trapezoidal method then the equivalent section was calculated to estimate the wetted perimeter and the average river slope was obtained along a 30 km river reach using alos palsar rtc dem images lm and mm approaches thus have the advantage of supporting the estimation of river discharge by remote sensing only i e no need for any in situ measurements modeled quantities and empirical approaches the comparison between the lm and the mm showed an excellent linear relationship in terms of derived cross sections hence since the lm is relatively easy to implement and the derived cross sections are similar to those from mm we have used it to estimating river discharges at the four cross sections evaluation of the discharge at xs 3 with observed river discharge at niamey station presents an nse coefficient of 0 93 this shows that the precision is acceptable for estimating the discharge for ungauged rivers or those difficult to access however some errors resulting in a high value of rmse were observed which could be induced by the uncertainty in estimating large areas with complex geometry during periods of high river flooding one of the advantages of remote sensing estimated discharge is the possibility of investigating the gains and losses of flow in the downstream direction over the studied reach here we estimated the gains and losses of the xs 1 xs 2 and xs 3 relatively to xs 4 the results showed that on average there was a gain of 4 4 m3s 1 7 7 m3s 1 and 2 9 m3s 1 for the respective cross sections over the study period however this deserves further investigation since the roles of evaporation losses and inflows from tributaries to the main stem and the uncertainties of the estimated discharges were not considered authors statement b o m lamine

8203,study region the niger river basin nrb at niamey west africa study focus two approaches to estimate the cross section of rivers based solely on satellite imagery or digital elevation model dem and altimetry for a large data deficient region are proposed these approaches are the lateral method lm which directly provides the cross sections and the mixed method mm which incorporates a dem with topography bathymetry the lm consists of following the river water lateral evolution on either side of a centerline using daily planet scope imagery while the riverbed is estimated using satellite altimeters the mm is based on the riverbed estimated from altimetry during the recession period and the banks heights are extracted from a dem river discharge was estimated at four cross sections over a reach of 30 km at niamey an evaluation of the estimated discharge using in situ discharge at niamey hydrometric station presents a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 93 and a relative bias of 3 3 new hydrological insights for the region the proposed method is feasible for other rivers in the sahelian zone and supports a better understanding of surface water hydrology for example the estimated discharge at four cross sections at a river reach of 30 km at niamey was used to observe downstream flow gains nevertheless the role of uncertainties and other contributions e g evaporation losses on the observed gains deserves further investigation keywords lateral method mixed method niger river satellite imagery satellite altimetry 1 introduction information on river discharge remains an essential tool for water management and risk prevention see e g de bruijn 2004 hooijer et al 2004 klijn et al 2015 vis et al 2003 however a considerable number of rivers have few gauging devices distributed along their channels calmant and seyler 2006 committee 2001 sneeuw et al 2014 have shown that many river basins are largely ungauged or their datasets are not publicly available the decline in routine reporting of river discharge observations across the globe is a well known problem that has contributed to limiting understanding of surface water hydrology and how they are affected by climate change and anthropogenic activities e g ndehedehe 2019 vörösmarty et al 2005 new satellite hydrology missions like radar altimetry are filling this gap to an extent but their unavailability and capability to provide direct river discharge measurements for important but ungauged river basins remain a challenge to improve knowledge on the nature of climate change impacts on water resources new methods that optimize the prediction and modeling of river discharge observations are thus crucial aiming to circumvent this problem several studies have highlighted the feasibility of remotely sensed datasets to estimate river discharge see e g bjerklie et al 2005 durand et al 2009 elmi et al 2015 gleason and smith 2014 grünler et al 2013 sichangi et al 2018 for instance bjerklie et al 2005 combined aerial photos synthetic aperture radar sar images with topographical maps to estimate in bank river discharge elmi et al 2015 employed a rating curve through the quantile functions of measured discharge and estimated river width gleason and smith 2014 retrieved instantaneous river discharge using at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg durand et al 2009 used the surface water and ocean topography swot measurements concepts to estimate the river depth and discharge grünler et al 2013 converted the sar derived velocity to depth integrated velocity then applied an empirical model to estimate discharge sichangi et al 2018 investigated the time lag retrieved from the temporal river width observations at two stream segments a distance apart thereafter they ibid applied an empirical model to estimate the river discharge to sum up hagemann et al 2017 presented a bayesian amhg manning bam algorithm which implements a bayesian formulation of streamflow uncertainty using a combination of manning s equation and amhg to estimate discharge from only remotely sensed stream width slope and height at multiple locations along a mass conserved river segment using cubesat data feng et al 2019 estimated discharge for eleven arctic rivers with widths ranging from 16 to 1 000 m wide using bam amhg to solve hydraulic geometry parameters to estimate water flow brinkerhoff et al 2020 improved discharge estimation by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics they used over 370 000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data to test unsupervised learning and a method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing the data driven and empirical approaches of the mentioned studies indicated different accuracy and unique advantages over the other however potential limitations and unsuitability for several study regions in west africa are likely the need to know the distributions that quantify the a priori uncertainty of unknown quantities including discharge and hydraulic equation parameters nevertheless the present study introduces a new approach that allows obtaining the river cross section and consequently river discharge using only remotely sensed techniques satellite imagery and altimetry firstly cross section estimation using a proposed lateral method abbreviated herein as lm consisting of both horizontal width and vertical depth monitoring of river water evolution is introduced using planet scope daily images the change in river water width is observed laterally from a centerline while measurements recorded on the same day by satellite altimetry are used to estimate the water depth river bathymetry secondly based on the proposed mixed method shortened as mm the measurements of the river bottom height are collected during river recession using satellite altimetry in contrast the river banks height measurements are extracted using alos palsar radiometrically terrain corrected rtc digital elevation model dem the obtained cross section s area is estimated using the trapezoidal method and then the equivalent section is calculated to estimate the wetted perimeter while the average slope is estimated using the alos palsar rtc dem the values for estimating the roughness coefficient are those from chow 1959 after a careful analysis of the river characteristics using satellite images and previous studies massazza et al 2019 tiepolo et al 2019 finally using manning s equation and the extracted hydraulic parameters it is possible to estimate the river discharge the proposed method to estimate river cross section and discharge was investigated over the niger river basin nrb at niamey station fig 1 a west africa the particular choice of the niger river is because its low water level occurs naturally every year and has taken on a particular dimension in recent years because it occurs early and is very pronounced see the images at different periods shown in fig 1b e the river s bed dries up and the waters give way to rocks and other sandy plains visible along the bed fig 1b the drop in the water level of the niger river is accentuated in april and reaches its peak in may with an almost zero discharge generally in this period of the year a large part of the riverbed is exposed allowing people to cross the river on foot casse et al 2016 2015 descroix et al 2012 providing us the ability to map the height of the channel bottom that otherwise would remain unobservable this is explained by the low rainfall recorded in several places in the upper niger basin and the influence of human activities including intensive irrigation and the construction of water mobilization structures dams water drilling etc as discussed in previous studies aich et al 2016 angelina et al 2015 ghile et al 2014 goulden et al 2011 oguntunde and abiodun 2012 tiepolo et al 2019 therefore the main goals of this study are twofold i to develop a method that allows extraction of river bathymetry establishing river cross sections and extraction of hydrological parameters entering in the estimation of river discharge according to manning s equation using satellite images and satellite altimetry exclusively and ii to observe the gains and losses of flow in the downstream direction at a 30 km reach defined at niamey the subsequent sections of the study are structured as follows section 2 presents further details of the study area section 3 presents the description of the datasets and methods the results are presented in section 4 followed by their respective discussions finally the conclusions of the study are provided in section 5 2 regional setting the niger river is located in west africa fig 1a its length of 4184 km makes it the third longest river in africa after the nile 6 700 km and congo 47 00 km it originates at the north eastern border of sierra leone and guinea conakry at the foot of the loma mountains 9 65 n 10 87 w crosses guinea conakry mali niger benin and nigeria where it flows into the atlantic ocean 4 33 n 6 07 e the selected river reach used in this study belongs to the nrb at niamey fig 1a the nrb at niamey accounts for approximately 34 of the total nrb s catchment area this portion of the niger river s reach is characterized by two flooding periods the local flood generally happens from august to september which is strongly dependent on the rains it is caused by local rains whose waters are transported by tributaries of the area sirba goroual and dargol mixed with the mainstem then another flood period occurs from november to january caused by the waters coming from guinea and mali the upstream part of the study area casse and gosset 2015 descroix et al 2012 low waters are observed between april and may with discharge often almost null the selected reach nearby niamey is 30 km long fig 2 a it starts from the village of boubon 13 57 n 1 00 e crosses the city of niamey and ends at the village of koulou kwara 13 36 n 2 21 e and has an average width of 527 m fig 2b this value was estimated using planet scope images from september 30 of 2018 over the 30 km distance fig 2a the average water surface width extracted from 60 transects perpendicular to the flow and spaced 500 m apart is 527 m as shown in fig 2b further details are presented in sub section 3 1 1 the choice was made by considering the advantages offered by this part of the river such as its morphology topography the existence of a hydrometric station 13 50 n 2 11 e and the riverbed that is visible during may when some parts appear almost dry however a few scattered and deep areas of the river retain their waters throughout the year these are mainly the old sand quarries where the sand used for construction works was dredged 3 materials and methods 3 1 datasets this study was made possible by using several data including satellite images altimetry data and dem observed in situ data were used to assess the accuracy of the results they are described in the following sub sections 3 1 1 optical satellite images historical images available in google earth pro were used for the rapid detection of periods when the river bottom is visible and periods of the flood define the time interval required for the monitoring of the lateral evolution of the river water and limit the satellite images to be processed these images were used to retrieve the riverbanks and centerline and select the appropriate parts of the reach for extracting cross sections over time the river water width variations were then carried out using daily acquisition planet scope images access to data requires a quick and straightforward registration on planet explorer in total 109 images were collected over the period from may 30 2018 to september 30 2018 for analysis as part of this study planet scope images have four different multispectral bands which passes through the water slide red green blue and near infrared high spatial resolution 3 m allowing to detect changes even at small scale and high radiometric resolution 12 bit cooley et al 2017 wicaksono and lazuardi 2018 the images have undergone a range of corrections including orthorectification by removing the displacements caused by the tilt of the satellite sensor topographical variation and the curvature of the earth orthorectification is the process of transforming raw imagery to an accurate orthogonal projection as against the perspective projection of the raw image it was done by using the ground control points and a dem to make the images planimetrically correct and to give a constant scale wherein features are represented in their actual positions also color correction using a color curve to optimize colors as seen by the human eye for providing images as they would look if viewed from the satellite s perspective was applied marta 2018 this processing scheme makes planet scope images reliable for use in several fields that require images with precise geolocation and map projection the product can then be used and ingested directly into a geographic information system or remote sensing studies the possibility offered by the planet explorer plugin to define a tolerated percentage of cloudy images allowed us to receive clear images with excellent visibility directly the river width values extraction from satellite imagery was done using rivwidth tool written by pavelsky and smith 2008 the tool is freely accessible from http uncglobalhydrology org rivwidth rivwidth automates the continuous extraction of river width values at regular intervals along an entire river reach for a river reach lacking islands the input is a channel mask which is a binary mask that assigns water pixels a value of 1 and nonwater pixels a value of 0 a second input a river mask was required in a river reach with islands this binary mask differentiates those areas within the river boundary including islands and those outside the river the algorithm used to calculate a centerline starts with the binary river mask and determines the distance from each river pixel to the nearest non river pixel using a uniform cost search algorithm cormen et al 2001 the distance map is then convolved with a bidirectional laplacian filter thus a series of transects that are orthogonal to the centerline at each centerline pixel are generated finally the calculation of the river width is performed for each centerline pixel using the series of pixel values that intersect its orthogonal line segment 3 1 2 digital elevation model alos palsar rtc dem 12 5 m of the surrounded area was used to derive the river reach slope and extract the riverbank s points x y z the data is freely accessible from https search asf alaska edu the dem provided to users is based on the world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 reference ellipsoid and has undergone corrections such as radiometric correction this elevation model consists of eliminating the misleading influence of topography on the backscatter values and a terrain correction which is applied to avoid geometric distortions that induce geolocation errors zhao et al 2017 combining these two corrections produces a dem with considerably high quality for various scientific applications based on ellipsoidal heights referred to the ellipsoid here given by wgs84 rather than the orthometric heights referred to the geoid correa muñoz et al 2019 evaluated the quality of nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster and alos palsar dems by comparison with control points obtained by the global positioning system they found that the alos palsar rtc dem provides the best accuracy of heights and was used to derivate terrain parameters elevation slope and aspect furthermore bhardwaj 2019 observed that in predominantly plain and rugged regions with mixed land use land cover alos palsar rtc data have higher accuracy than tandem x90 m dem 3 1 3 satellite altimetry data data from five altimetry missions were used to monitor the water elevation variations namely envisat jason 2 cryosat 2 sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b the combination of data from the five altimetric missions enabled us to increase the frequency of water elevation observation due to the appreciable density of virtual stations present along the river reach see the altimetry missions ground tracks that intersected the river reach shown in fig 2a the data are already processed by agencies and mostly contain the algorithms suitable for inland water studies which the reliability has been shown by previous studies boergens et al 2017 dubey et al 2015 kittel et al 2020 koblinsky et al 1993 kuo and kao 2011 tarpanelli et al 2019 tourian et al 2017 2016 villadsen et al 2015 we directly and freely accessed the ocean surface topography mission ostm jason 2 along track pistach hydrology data from https www aviso altimetry fr envisat sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b geophysical data record gdr from https scihub copernicus eu accessibility to cryosat 2 data was possible to us after a request through http ctoh legos obs mip fr a summary of the main characteristics of these missions is given in table 1 the five missions table 1 present different temporal resolutions and or measurement epochs for example there are missions with a 10 day repeat period jason 2 a 27 day repeat period sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b a 369 day repeat period with 30 day sub cycles cryosat 2 and a 35 day repeat period for envisat the choice of the river reach shown in fig 2a was made based on the density of satellite altimetry derived water levels available at the date of may 30 2018 these are cryosat 2 track 1176 jason 2 track 241 and sentinel 3a track 4672 a large part about 80 of the reach channel bottom is observable and we call this date t 0 the locations of these ground tracks that are oblique concerning the direction of flow were selected to construct cross sections perpendicular to the flow direction noteworthy the water elevations measured by altimeter do not correspond to a single point s measurement but to the average elevations of a surface observed and measured by altimeter within a footprint the footprint is the area on the earth s surface illuminated by the radar beam we have then for this study assumed the oblique ground track water elevation to be representative at the perpendicular cross section for example the altimeter ground footprint diameter is about 1 66 km for cryosat 2 600 m for sentinel 3a and ranges from 2 to 4 km for jason 2 depending on the satellite altitude jiang et al 2017 at the epoch t 0 the water elevations measured at the three ground track locations were averaged and the mean value was considered the zero of the water elevation measurements however the difference in elevations was calculated for each location this elevation difference allows us to deduce the water surface elevation at any cross section location knowing the height at one cross section location since the altimetry missions do not have the same revisit time they cannot measure the water level every time on the same day throughout the study period in the case of unavailability of a ground track that directly intersected the cross section the measurement made by the nearby ground track was considered to be representative of the cross section is included in its footprint this allowed us to increase the frequency of water surface elevation measurements at each cross section and the elevation width combination extracted on the same day led to the construction of the cross sections finally all water levels from the different missions were used to construct water level time series after bias correction the biases among the various missions were minimized by fitting the respective water level series into a model with a constant linear annual amplitude and phase terms the parameters were estimated with a least squares fitting procedure the final water level series at the four cross section locations are referred to the wgs84 to be consistent with the rtc dem 3 1 4 in situ river discharge for validation purposes the water levels time series from 01 01 2005 to 12 31 2018 were acquired at niamey s hydrometric station 13 50 n 2 11 e see fig 2 from the niger basin authority autorité du basin du niger abn abn is an intergovernmental organization in west africa aiming to foster co operation in managing and developing the resources of the basin of the niger river it is headquartered in niamey republic of niger the water level measurements were generally recorded twice a day e g 08 00 and 18 00 local time hence a stage discharge relation was used to estimate the river discharge from the water levels at niamey using a rating curve estimated by abn at which further details can be found in krekeler 2012 3 2 methods one of this study s focuses was to estimate the river bottom geometry shape with good precision to minimize the errors while retrieving the cross sections and estimating the parameters used to compute river discharge this required careful monitoring from the river recession period to the river flood period which lasts about five months may to september for the niger river section 2 the time slider provided in google earth to move between image acquisition dates can make it possible to detect the dates when the riverbed appears without water and the periods of flood for this study a careful observation carried out on images taken between january 2018 and december 2018 showed that the images taken on may 30 2018 offered the best visibility of the riverbed while the maximum flooded area was observed in the images taken on september 30 2018 may 30 2018 is then considered the start time t 0 as mentioned in sub section 3 1 3 3 2 1 cross sections establishment the so called lateral method lm and mixed method mm are introduced aiming to estimate the river cross sections which are fundamental to compute the river discharge based on manning s equation sub section 3 2 2 a brief highlight of the lm and mm methods is given below a the lateral method lm after selecting the river reach and according to the available satellite altimetry ground tracks the lm method aims to subsidize the construction of cross sections at the location of orbital altimeter crossings however the cross sections are normal to the centerline based on the images showing the dry riverbed at a known date t 0 the river centerline was drawn from the start to the end of the reach fig 2a as shown in fig 3 a the letter j was placed along the centerline to indicate the starting points for the lateral progression of the water width from the centerline to the right r and left l banks see the diagram in fig 3a careful sorting was necessary to select clear images and reject altered or cloudy images analysis of the daily satellite images was then carried out to extract the water width evolution from the dry riverbed period t 0 to the period of the maximum flooded area t n as shown in fig 3b this process was repeated two to three times depending on the image quality and the measurements were averaged to minimize errors furthermore the width monitoring was accompanied by the water elevation monitoring recorded by altimetry missions on the same day fig 3b with this it was possible to obtain the horizontal and vertical evolution of the river water simultaneously a combination of the data obtained from the right side r and the left side l shown in fig 3b gave a cross section xs of the river at the location j as shown in fig 3c therefore the process was applied to extract the four cross sections at orbital altimeter crossings see fig 2a for their locations in this study b the mixed method mm as for the lm approach a careful inspection of the historical images was carried out to identify the periods that the river dried up and that of the maximum flooded area the images in which the river appeared to be at its minimum and the maximum level were used to distinguish the riverbed and to delineate the river banks then the riverbanks heights were extracted from alos palsar rtc dem sub section 3 1 2 and the riverbed was masked out fig 4 a next the riverbed limits were then used to access all the points that lay within the riverbed which provided the longitudes and latitudes altitude within the riverbed were discarded forming a sampling grid fig 4b however in order to assign elevations to this sampling grid interpolation extrapolation was carried out using the height measurements from the five satellite altimetry missions that intersected the river reach fig 2a which were collected during the period of shallow water with a large part of the riverbed exposed altimetry data collected outside the riverbed was rejected ensuring that only the data heights of the exposed riverbed were retained the last phase of the process consisted of merging the points providing information on the height of the riverbed fig 4b and the points providing information on the height of the riverbanks fig 4a as shown in fig 4c this led to the creation of a mixed dem fig 4d which provided the topography and bathymetry necessary to extract the cross sections xs it should be emphasized that the basic difference between the lm and mm is that the former uses optical images and altimetry while the latter uses dem and altimetry while both provide means to estimate the channel cross sections mm has the advantage of providing the whole bathymetry of the reach which could be helpful for other applications that said the mm estimated cross sections are used to assess those estimated from lm 3 2 2 hydraulic parameters and river discharge estimation the river discharge according to manning s equation 1 q 1 n a r 2 3 s 1 2 can be easily computed if the river cross section sub section 3 2 1 and water level altimetry see sub section 3 1 3 are available in eq 1 q represents the discharge n is the roughness coefficient a is the cross sectional area r is the hydraulic radius and s is the slope of the channel at the respective cross section location a cross section area can be approximated using the trapezoidal rule the area is evaluated by splitting the total cross section area into several small trapezoids the sum of their areas gives the cross section s area the way trapezoids hug the cross section shape can give a much better area estimate than rectangles the hydraulic radius can be calculated as 2 r a p w where the wetted perimeter p w which can be derived from the derived cross sections lm and mm and water levels from altimetry regarding the slope s by using the concept of reach length lefavour and alsdorf 2005 firstly we extracted the main stem the main trunk or channel elevations from alos palsar rtc dem over 1400 km of middle niger and combined with flow distance to investigate the alos palsar rtc dem error along the river main stem the standard error of the elevation average σ values is about 4 31 m using a subset of alos palsar rtc dem containing only pixels that intersect the streamline over the middle niger we calculated the change of z values for a cell based on all surrounding cells and found a minimum slope s min of 1 12 cm km along the main stem nevertheless to calculate a reliable slope from a dem reach length needs to extend a sufficient distance to accommodate the errors in elevations lefavour and alsdorf 2005 suggested a simple relationship to determine the appropriate reach length rl 3 r l 2 σ s min where s min represents the minimum slope and σ is the standard error of the elevation average we then found an appropriate rl of approximately 769 km and a slope of 2 29 0 02 cm km at 97 confidence interval as shown in fig 5 the slope value is treated as a constant for discharge calculation at the four cross section locations along the 30 km reach the manning roughness coefficient n necessary in eq 1 determines the resistance exerted by the channel to the water flow in hydrology this resistance is linked to the frictional forces generated by the materials constituting the channel it can be determined by considering several factors as explained by chow 1959 4 n n o n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 where n 0 is a particle size value assigned according to the size and shape of the materials constituting the channel n 1 is a value added to n 0 to correct the effect of surface roughness n 2 is a value assigned according to the variations of the cross section n 3 is a value assigned according to the influence in obstruction n 4 is a value assigned according to the type of vegetation cover and n 5 is a correction factor assigned according to the stream meandering degree for this study parameters n 0 and n 1 values were drawn from the results of previous studies belcore et al 2019 massazza et al 2019 carried out on the niger river and its tributaries and the values of parameters n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 were decided after an analysis of planet scope satellite images due to the similar characteristics of the locations of the four cross sections we assumed a constant value of the roughness coefficient for all flow levels during the study period as well as within the river cross section these figures are presented in table 2 3 2 3 performance measures the performance of the estimated discharge was determined using the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse the relative bias in percent re and the nse coefficient given as e g moriasi et al 2007 5 rmse 1 t i 1 t q obs i q r i 2 6 nrmse rmse q obs 100 7 re 1 t q r q obs 1 t q obs 100 and 8 nse 1 i 1 t q obs i q r i 2 i 1 t q obs i q obs 2 respectively in eqs 5 8 the variables are as follow t represents the length of the time series of discharge q r is the resulting discharge from the model q obs is the observed discharge from in situ measurement and q obs is the mean value of the observed discharge 4 results and discussion 4 1 on the estimated cross sections in this section the derived cross sections from the lm and mm approaches are analyzed and compared a total of four cross sections were established including one at the hydrometric station xs 3 shown in fig 2a the exact locations were maintained for both methods mm and lm in order to allow their intercomparisons the raw rtc dem does not show the bathymetry of the river mainly due to the inability of the sensors to image the river bottom due to the presence of water however cross sections were made using raw rtc dem to ensure that the derived river banks fit with the ones resulting from mm and lm approaches as can be seen in fig 6 panels a c e and g the riverbanks derived from the raw rtc dem overlap appreciably with those resulting from the lm and mm approaches without apparent bias and or systematic differences due to the lack of in situ data for the bathymetry of the niger river the river cross section comparison was made only between the mm and lm methods using the coefficient of determination r 2 r squared at each of the four locations the intercomparison between the cross sections derived from the mm and the lm approaches shows an almost similar configuration with a high coefficient of determination 0 99 for xs 2 and xs 4 and 0 98 for xs 1 and xs 3 fig 6b d f and h however the riverbanks derived from the raw rtc dem and the mm seem to better overlap this situation is observable at the level of the four cross sections and can be explained by the fact that the data for both methods are from the same source i e alos palsar rtc dem hence only cross sections based on the lm approach are considered to estimate the niger river discharge section 4 2 this particular choice is because lm uses optical images and altimetry and could easily be implemented at any water resource institute department to estimate the cross sections under the conditions of exposed riverbeds as it is the case of many rivers at the sahelian zone 4 2 on the estimated river discharge based on the lm approach the discharge was estimated from 01 01 2005 to 10 01 2018 for the four cross sections fig 7 a c e and g noteworthy observed daily river discharge is available only at xs 3 niamey albeit the distance to xs 1 upstream xs 2 upstream and xs 4 downstream is 14 5 km 4 km and 15 5 km respectively it is not expected here that the estimated discharge at the three cross sections will provide the same values that is additional flow gains or losses could be expected between the upstream cross sections relatively to niamey xs 3 overall the river discharge at the four cross sections peaks in september and january which almost coincides with the flood periods in the region fig 7 the first flood the red flood or local flood reaches the region from august to september and the second one guinean flood or black flood during november to january section 2 the low flow period generally occurs in june the main peak of precipitation generally occurs during july august which is associated with the annual cycle furthermore there is a smaller peak that generally happens around january cf section 2 furthermore fig 7 panels b d f and h presents the comparison between estimated discharge at the four cross sections and those observed at niamey station in terms of their scatter plots and relationship correlations noteworthy the comparisons of the estimated discharges with in situ discharge for all four cross section locations are performed here only for verifying the overall consistency between the estimated and observed series there is a good agreement between the lm estimated and observed discharges for all four locations fig 7 panels b d f and h however the scatter plot for discharge values above approximately 1400 m3s 1 seems to be more dispersed concerning the 1 1 line red line for xs 1 xs 2 and xs 4 locations fig 7b d and h this could be due to a potential overestimation of the discharge over august and september and or indication of a potential flow losses of the xs 1 and xs 2 relatively to niamey station the accuracy of lm to estimate discharge q r was carried out by comparison with the observed discharge q obs at the xs 3 location table 3 since it is the only cross section that has observed discharge niamey station as highlighted in table 3 the performance evaluation indicates that lm estimated discharge for xs 3 has high accuracy a slight overestimation of the discharge resulted in a positive value of re 3 3 the nse coefficient value shows a very good fit with a performance of 0 93 according to moriasi et al 2007 nse 1 0 is the perfect fit nse 0 75 is a very good fit nse 0 64 to 0 74 is a good fit nse 0 5 to 0 64 is a satisfactory fit and nse 0 5 is an unsatisfactory fit overall the result shows that the proposed method can estimate the river discharge since there is consistency among different discharge variations fig 7 notably a slight overestimation of the estimated discharge at xs 3 during the high flow season of september october is observed this can be explained by the cross section s area calculation using the trapezoidal method which loses precision when the geometry of the section becomes more complex and larger during the high flow seasons tallarida and murray 1987 yeh 2002 table 3 also presents the streamflow gains and losses which were estimated by computing the difference in streamflow at the upstream at xs 1 xs 2 and xs 3 and downstream at xs 4 over the reach fig 2a that is the contributions of evaporation losses e and inflows from tributaries to the main steam i were neglected otherwise the gains and losses g could be estimated as g q d q u i e after ignoring the contributions of diversions return to the reach and seeps the mean values of gains and loss for xs 1 xs 2 and xs 3 regarding xs 4 is 4 4 m3s 1 7 7 m3s 1 and 2 9 m3s 1 respectively the positive values g indicate a gaining stream reach and albeit evaporation was not considered it would sum up to the gains anyhow and thereby we can conclude that the overall reach is indeed a gaining stream since the results show a reasonable estimation of river discharge at niamey station table 3 and fig 7e the application of the lm is feasible and can be extended to other rivers in the sahelian zone these rivers are generally characterized by a dry and wet cycle due to their high dependence on seasonal rains such as senegal and nakambe rivers karambiri et al 2011 and sirba river passerotti et al 2020 this approach lm then has the advantage of being less expensive compared to the method proposed by bjerklie et al 2005 where the acquisition of aerial photos can add costs it can be applied to a single stream segment compared to sichangi et al 2018 which requires two stream segments to estimate the time lag in the variation in river width furthermore the proposed approach mm also provides river bathymetry and cross sections of the river that can be used for other purposes such as navigation vessels or bridge building however the proposed lm and mm approaches cannot apply to rivers whose bottom is not visible at some point during the observation period which is the main limitation of the present study the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas instrument onboard the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 2 icesat 2 launched in 2018 provides a dataset atl13 for water surface elevations and is also able to see the topography of a river bottom but still not much data on many rivers in the near future its data can be useful in calibrating the derived cross sections using the framework developed in this study and their combination will also give considerable precise cross sections 5 conclusions two approaches for the extraction of river cross sections using alos palsar rtc dem and satellite imagery and altimetry for river discharge were introduced manning s equation parameters were extracted then river discharge was estimated the cross section geometry is obtained by lateral monitoring lm approach of the river water evolution while simultaneously the depth is being monitored by satellite altimetry mm approach the resulting cross section s area is estimated using the discretization of the cross sections into smaller trapezoids trapezoidal method then the equivalent section was calculated to estimate the wetted perimeter and the average river slope was obtained along a 30 km river reach using alos palsar rtc dem images lm and mm approaches thus have the advantage of supporting the estimation of river discharge by remote sensing only i e no need for any in situ measurements modeled quantities and empirical approaches the comparison between the lm and the mm showed an excellent linear relationship in terms of derived cross sections hence since the lm is relatively easy to implement and the derived cross sections are similar to those from mm we have used it to estimating river discharges at the four cross sections evaluation of the discharge at xs 3 with observed river discharge at niamey station presents an nse coefficient of 0 93 this shows that the precision is acceptable for estimating the discharge for ungauged rivers or those difficult to access however some errors resulting in a high value of rmse were observed which could be induced by the uncertainty in estimating large areas with complex geometry during periods of high river flooding one of the advantages of remote sensing estimated discharge is the possibility of investigating the gains and losses of flow in the downstream direction over the studied reach here we estimated the gains and losses of the xs 1 xs 2 and xs 3 relatively to xs 4 the results showed that on average there was a gain of 4 4 m3s 1 7 7 m3s 1 and 2 9 m3s 1 for the respective cross sections over the study period however this deserves further investigation since the roles of evaporation losses and inflows from tributaries to the main stem and the uncertainties of the estimated discharges were not considered authors statement b o m lamine

depths in this integrated modeling approach a time series runoff values were generated in ann model at the outlet of the baro basin and these runoff values were received by hec ras model to generate flood inundation areas along the main river the two models are integrated to improve the prediction accuracy in traditional flood forecasting models thus the improvement of accuracy of flood prediction related to space and time is presented as the novelty of this integrated ann approach and hec ras model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the baro akobo basin is located in the southwestern part of ethiopia geographically it is located between latitudes 5 31 and 10 54 north and longitude 33 and 36 17 east the river basin fig 1 is the fourth largest basin in the country covering an approximate area of 74 100 km2 the western northwestern and southwestern side of the basin is bordered with south sudan the northern and northeast side is bordered with the abay river basin and the east and southeast are bordered by the omo gibe river basin the river originates from the highlands in the southwest part of ethiopia and flows across the low lying plains the most recent 2015 flood event occurred in the river basin forced eviction of around 2 000 peoples out of their homes alemayehu 2016 thiemig et al 2013 woube 1999 abaya 2008 baro akobo basin is characterized as a hot tropical zone when compared with other basins in the country as a result of topographic characteristic the lower baro akobo river is extensively drained waterlogged in itang and alwero districts lower baro river is characterized by high rainfall and waterlogging and it is very sensitive to flooding 2 2 data and software used in this study arcgis ver 10 4 rstudio and hec ras ver 5 0

connected into hec ras model were also presented in detail under section 2 3 and 2 6 respectively 2 3 hydrologic modelling using ann artificial neural networks ann is an empirical model which takes only the information of few ground based hydrologic variables such as rainfall temperatures humidity topographic wetness index twi and gauged discharges without considering the physical properties of a catchment to undertake hydrologic processes and hence ann model is called data driven model kumar et al 2020 daliakopoulos and tsanis 2016 the hydrological modeling technique used to perform the

fig 3 the optimum number of input nodes hidden nodes and output node was selected according to the study conducted in lv et al 2020 to begin with the modeling the input parameters such as rainfall r temperatures t observed discharge q data of fourteen 14 stations on daily basis for 1999 2005 timescales and topographic wetness index twi were distributed over 30m 30m spatial resolution before using as training data in the ann model inverse distance weighted idw was used to convert point based input data into spatial data 30m 30m and topographical wetness index twi was also generated on the same spatial resolution the prepared input parameters were normalized and squashed in between 0 and 1 chan and chan 2020 a feedforward neural network nn is selected in this study based on the studies conducted by mashhadimoslem et al 2020 kan et al 2020 for this class of ann architecture rainfall r temperature t observed discharge q and topographical wetness index twi were assigned to the networks according to dolling and varas 2002 tayebiyan et al 2016 random initial weights were generated and assigned to the ann networks between input and hidden nodes hidden and output nodes van et al 2020 ouma et al 2020 the input parameters were assigned to the input nodes and linked with hidden nodes the synoptic connection between the input and hidden nodes and the hidden and output nodes were assigned by initial weights as we can see from eq 1 the random values of weights were assigned to each synoptic connection between nodes to begin with the training processes the input nodes labelled as 1 2 and 3 receive the values of input parameters normalized using eq 2 and send to hidden nodes labeled as 4 5 and 6 lv et al 2020 the total sum of the multiplied input parameters with the corresponding initial weights is activated using the eq 3 to develop a multi regression model chan and chan 2020 the synoptic links weights between the input and hidden nodes were assigned with weights labeled as the 1st 2nd and 3rd rows of the weight matrix in eq 1 and as well as the weights between hidden and output nodes were assigned with the weights labeled as the 4th row of the matrix once the input nodes receive the normalized input parameters rainfall temperature and twi then the weighted sum of the input parameters and initial weights eq 1 reached the hidden nodes and activated

hec ras software is a computer program developed for modeling river flowing through open natural channels and used for computing water surface profile mapping and field 2017 lamichhane and sharma 2018 duvvuri and narasimhan 2013 hec ras get accepted and being used for river simulation by hydraulic engineers and different researchers marimin et al 2018 because of its capabilities and abilities to simulate unsteady flow and identifies flood prone areas where the surface ground level is lower than the computed water profile and allows the researcher to visualize the flood extent along a river course maidment 2017 timbadiya et al 2011 the river geometries such as centerlines bank lines flow paths and cross sectional lines are the major parameters processed in hec ras to generate flood prone areas a digital elevation model dem of 12 5m 12 5m pixel resolution downloaded from https asf alaska edu li 2010 was used to extract the major parameters the runoff values obtained in the ann model were used to generate flood inundation depths the main objective of generating flood inundation maps is to provide the spatial extent of a flood along baro river which is timely and accurate both in space and time the severity of flood is varied spatially based on the slope and the intensity of rainfall therefore mapping of flood hazard zones along the main river can provides information about the severity of flood depths for the residents of low lying areas particularly the downstream residents and this can safe both human lives and properties a coupled 1d and 2d models in which both water profile computation as 1d and flood inundation as 2d were implemented in this study to generate the depth and prone prone areas along the baro river enea et al 2018 hec ras model used the result runoff from the tested ann hydrological model as input and gave the information on the spatial extent and depth of flooding along the river 2 6 integrated ann and hec ras model the trained and tested

ezzine et al 2020 whenever the ann model receives input parameters rainfall temperature and topographical wetness index and computed runoff the hec ras is ready to accept the result runoff it as input to generate the information on spatial distribution of flood and prone areas along the river fig 5 the final corrected and updated values of weights in the ann model are used to generate the runoff values whenever the input parameters are sent to the input nodes 2 7 model calibration and validation 2 7 1 ann model evaluation the terms training and testing are commonly used instruments for checking of an accuracy and fitness of a model in hydrological modeling parhi 2013 desta and lemma 2017 chuma et al 2013 when ann model is used as hydrological model the performance of ann hydrologic model result was trained with 7 years 1999 2005 climate data rainfall and temperature and topographical wetness index twi with the target data observed daily discharge of the same periods 1999 2005 and also tested with 3 years 2006 2008 observed daily discharge the performances in both periods training and testing were evaluated by nash sutcliffe efficiency nse using eq 4 4 n s e 1 i 1 n q o q s 2 i 1 n q o q m e a n 2 where qo is observed discharge m3 s qs is simulated discharge m3 s and qo is mean discharge m3 s however nash sutcliffe efficiency nse alone cannot give us the information on the model bias the fitness of simulated versus observed evaluated in nse should be supported by additional statistical error index model evaluation method therefore the pbias as statistical error index model evaluation method was also used to check whether the model result was overpredicted or underpredicted and the equation for this model evaluation presented in eq 5 ouali and cannon 2018 pérez sánchez et al 2019 and the corresponding criteria of fit for hydrological modeling for both model evaluation techniques is summarized in table 2 5 p b i a s i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 100 i 1 n y

observed and simulated values with the coefficient of determination r2 the general equation by which this coefficient is computed for the evaluation of a model is presented in eq 6 pérez sánchez et al 2019 and the acceptable range for hydrological modeling is given in the table 2 6 r 2 n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 x 2 2 7 2 hec ras model evaluation the runoff values obtained in ann hydrological model

overlapping areas bagherzadeh and daneshvar 2011 7 n d w i n i r s w i n i r s w i r to get the percentage of overlapping area between the water body delineated in ndwi and hec ras software the intersect tool within the analysis toolbox in arcgis ver 10 4 was used first the raster formats of both results ndwi and hec ras were changed into vector polygons using conversion tool scanlon et al 2005 and then the corresponding shape areas were calculated using geometry calculation algorithms in the arcgis the same geographic coordinate system adindan utm zone 37 n was adjusted for both polygons and the percentage overlapping areas was calculated as shown in eq 8 potential 2020 yong wang et al 2017b 8 o v e r l a p p i n g p e r c e n t a g e l a y e r 1 k m 2 l a y e r 2 k m 2 where

the daily stream flow runoff values generated by ann for the training and testing results are presented in figs 6 and 7 as indicated fig 6 the daily runoff values computed in ann model and the corresponding daily discharges of 7 years during the training periods 1999 2005 was evaluated at nse 0 86 and pbias 8 2 respectively and whereas as we can see from fig 7 the nse 0 88 and pbias 8 5 were found during the 3 years testing periods 2006 2008 and similar model evaluation agreement were made by the studies conducted in kumar et al 2020 tsakiri et al 2018 kan et al 2020 as shown the fig 8 a g the ann model results were further evaluated using coefficient of determination or regression r2 with scatter plot for each year and values of 0 96 0 96 0 93 0 93 0 89 0 93 and 0 92 respectively were obtained during the training periods and the results are very good kan et al 2020 the fitness curves for each of ann results are presented in fig 8 the visualized plot for each year 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 and 2005 is presented in fig 8a g and whereas the average simulated daily ann results and the corresponding observed discharges of the entire periods of 7 yrs 1999 2005 was demonstrated in fig 8h and this result revealed a bit better than the individual scatter plot the visualized scatter plot for each year is not concentrated along the regression line however the goodness for fit and the performance rating scale for the r2 is very good the model evaluation performed at training periods is poorer that the testing periods as we can see from table 3 the 7 years hydrological model and actual daily discharge gauged at the basin outlet and the scatter plot of both values processed in rstudio is presented in fig 8 g showing that the values were evaluated at regression r2 0 89 similar results were obtained in tayfur et al 2018 pérez sánchez et al 2019 that the r2 values ranges between 0 85 and 1 is a very good model artificial neural networks applied as hydrological modeling presented in villada et al 2012 lateef ahmad dar 2017 dibaba et al 2020 was acceptable with the values summarized in table 3 3 2 hec ras model result figs 9 and 10 presents the

of 2005 are presented in fig 8 a and b respectively the blue color in both figures is the water body in the area of interest the hec ras result was further evaluated with the ann hydrological model result obtained during the validation periods of 2006 2008 and the water body delineated in ndwi from the flood event of 2008 were presented in fig 9 a and b respectively from the overlapping percentage areas computed in arcgis ver 10 4 94 6 and 96 of intersected areas were counted from the inundation map generated in hec ras and water body delineated in ndwi during the calibration and validation periods according to the studies conducted by bagherzadeh and daneshvar 2011 mai and de smedt 2017 the inundation map was evaluated based on the overlapping areas and if more than 85 counted percentage of overlapped it is considered as a good agreement the ability of an integrated data driven approach and hec ras model in improving the accuracy of prediction and generation of flood depths is clearly seen in this study the severity of the depth of flood inundated is very serious for the river beach residents 4 conclusion in this study an application of the ann approach and hec ras model for flood inundation mapping in lower baro river basin ethiopia is presented ann as a predictive hydrological model and hec ras as hydraulic model were integrated and accurate flood

determination r2 the nse values of 0 86 and 0 88 pbias of 8 2 and 8 5 were obtained during training and testing periods respectively the ann model result of each year 1999 2005 was further evaluated graphically at r2 values of 0 96 0 96 0 93 0 93 0 89 0 93 and 0 92 respectively accordingly the hec ras model and ndwi results were overlapped at 94 6 and 96 during the calibration and validation periods the results of this integrated ann and hec ras model were successful in improving the quality of flood prediction and in flood inundation mapping therefore the application of an integrated ann approach with the hec ras model has improved the prediction accuracy in traditional flood forecasting methods finally it was concluded that an integrated ann approach and hec ras model for flood inundation mapping is an appropriate tool for flood risk management and early warning systems and this paper will recommend that the future research will focus on the real time application of ann

2015 asadi 2013 dogan et al 2007 and the selection of a specific model and its accuracy is generally governed by factors such as availability of input parameters the skills of the forecaster and the knowledge with the watershed the application of ann as a hydrologic prediction technique for the improvement of flood forecasting accuracy in the areas of hydrologic modeling has a paramount role in flood risk management strategies idai 2020 mustafa et al 2012 sarchani et al 2020 flood inundation mapping is a difficult task that needs a combination of high quality and observed data to verify the performance of the models lohani et al 2012 seenu 2019 duvvuri and narasimhan 2013 the application of machine learning ann in areas of hydrologic processes is a recently evolving approaches and has been applied in rainfall runoff modeling riad et al 2004 daily water supply demand akhtar et al 2009 streamflow computation veintimilla reyes et al 2016 poonia 2018 extreme hydrologic event analysis and generation of the unit hydrograph mengistu et al 2016 a feedforward ann network structure is commonly used in the one way computation of the hydrologic process in which inputs are pushed forward until the rough result is obtained the main objective of this study is to integrate the ann flood prediction technique with hec ras model to generate flood hazard areas by developing flood inundation depths in this integrated modeling approach a time series runoff values were generated in ann model at the outlet of the baro basin and these runoff values were received by hec ras model to generate flood inundation areas along the main river the two models are integrated to improve the prediction accuracy in traditional flood forecasting models thus the improvement of accuracy of flood prediction related to space and time is presented as the novelty of this integrated ann approach and hec ras model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the baro akobo basin is located in the southwestern part of ethiopia geographically it is located between latitudes 5 31 and 10 54 north and longitude 33 and 36 17 east the river basin fig 1 is the fourth largest basin in the country covering an approximate area of 74 100 km2 the western northwestern and southwestern side of the basin is bordered with south sudan the northern and northeast side is bordered with the abay river basin and the east and southeast are bordered by the omo gibe river basin the river originates from the highlands in the southwest part of ethiopia and flows across the low lying plains the most recent 2015 flood event occurred in the river basin forced eviction of around 2 000 peoples out of their homes alemayehu 2016 thiemig et al 2013 woube 1999 abaya 2008 baro akobo basin is characterized as a hot tropical zone when compared with other basins in the country as a result of topographic characteristic the lower baro akobo river is extensively drained waterlogged in itang and alwero districts lower baro river is characterized by high rainfall and waterlogging and it is very sensitive to flooding 2 2 data and software used in this study arcgis ver 10 4 rstudio and hec ras ver 5 0

and open source privileges for the predictive ann hydrological model training both spatial topographical wetness index and temporal 7 years daily rainfall and temperature data table 1 were used the spatial resolution of 30 30 m pixel size was implemented and all input parameters were prepared based on the fixed grid in general the types of data used in this paper and the methods applied for the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling is clearly shown in fig 2 however the detailed steps for each method were presented in its own section the hydrologic modeling in ann model how the ann model is connected into hec ras model were also presented in detail under section 2 3 and 2 6 respectively 2 3 hydrologic modelling using ann artificial neural networks ann is an empirical model which takes only the information of few ground based hydrologic variables such as rainfall temperatures humidity topographic wetness index twi and gauged discharges without considering the physical properties of a catchment to undertake hydrologic processes and hence ann model is called data driven model kumar et al 2020 daliakopoulos and tsanis 2016 the hydrological modeling technique used to perform the runoff generation in this study consist of the ann model development and training processes model performance evaluation using statistical metrics and the connection between ann model and hec ras

using gradient descent gd training algorithm is implemented moreno et al 2020 kan et al 2020 dtissibe et al 2020 c chen et al 2021 based on the number of selected input parameters rainfall temperatures observed discharge and topographic wetness index twi and the required output runoff values a neural networks nn structure with 3 input nodes 4 hidden node and 1 output node was selected fig 3 the optimum number of input nodes hidden nodes and output node was selected according to the study conducted in lv et al 2020 to begin with the modeling the input parameters such as rainfall r temperatures t observed discharge q data of fourteen 14 stations on daily basis for 1999 2005 timescales and topographic wetness index twi were distributed over 30m 30m spatial resolution before using as training data in the ann model inverse distance weighted idw was used to convert point based input data into spatial data 30m 30m and topographical wetness index twi was also generated on the same spatial resolution the prepared input parameters were normalized and squashed in between 0 and 1 chan and chan 2020 a feedforward neural network nn is selected in this study based on the studies conducted by mashhadimoslem et al 2020 kan et al 2020 for this class of ann architecture rainfall r temperature t observed discharge q and topographical wetness index twi were assigned to the networks according to dolling and varas 2002 tayebiyan et al 2016 random initial weights were generated and assigned to the ann networks between input and hidden nodes hidden and output nodes van et al 2020 ouma et al 2020 the input parameters were assigned to the input nodes and linked with hidden nodes the synoptic connection between the input and hidden nodes and the hidden and output nodes were assigned by initial weights as we can see from eq 1 the random values of weights were assigned to each synoptic connection between nodes to begin with the training processes the input nodes labelled as 1 2 and 3 receive the values of input parameters normalized using eq 2 and send to hidden nodes labeled as 4 5 and 6 lv et al 2020 the total sum of the multiplied input parameters with the corresponding initial weights is activated using the eq 3 to develop a multi regression model chan and chan 2020 the synoptic links weights between the input and hidden nodes were assigned with weights labeled as the 1st 2nd and 3rd rows of the weight matrix in eq 1 and as well as the weights between hidden and output nodes were assigned with the weights labeled as the 4th row of the matrix once the input nodes receive the normalized input parameters rainfall temperature and twi then the weighted sum of the input parameters and initial weights eq 1 reached the hidden nodes and activated using sigmoid activation function veintimilla reyes et al 2016 napolitano 2011 abdulkadir et al 2012 a sigmoid function arun and baskaran 2013 šimor et al 2012 agatonovic kustrin and beresford 2000 eq 3 is used to activate the values in the hidden nodes and then multiplied and summed up with the assigned random weights between hidden and output layers labeled as 8 1 w e i g h t s w 11 w 21 w 31 w

2 4 1 back propagation in the feedforward propagation the input parameters are pushed forward to get the rough solution at the output node and doesn t take any account to minimize the error between the result obtained from network and target output dar 2017 tayebiyan et al 2016 the initial weight values assigned in the feedforward processes are just to start the modeling and the accuracy of the model is very low at this stage asaad y shamseldin and o connor 2003 the main importance of backpropagation fig 4 is to spread the error back into the networks to minimize the error obtained in the feedforward process sattari et al 2017 timbadiya et al 2011 the overall error obtained at the output layer starts to propagate back into the networks from the output node to the entire networks mai and de smedt 2017 training in a sense meaning that the network learns from the mistakes through the built in learning algorithm in ann networks abhishek et al 2012 hawkin 2014 2 5 hec ras model the hec ras software is a computer program developed for modeling river flowing through open natural channels and used for computing water surface profile mapping and field 2017 lamichhane and sharma 2018 duvvuri and narasimhan 2013 hec ras get accepted and being used for river simulation by hydraulic engineers and different researchers marimin et al 2018 because of its capabilities and abilities to simulate unsteady flow and identifies flood prone areas where the surface ground level is lower than the computed water profile and allows the researcher to visualize the flood extent along a river course maidment 2017 timbadiya et al 2011 the river geometries such as centerlines bank lines flow paths and cross sectional lines are the major parameters processed in hec ras to generate flood prone areas a digital elevation model dem of 12 5m 12 5m pixel resolution downloaded from https asf alaska edu li 2010 was used to extract the major parameters the runoff values obtained in the ann model were used to generate flood inundation depths the main objective of generating flood inundation maps is to provide the spatial extent of a flood along baro river which is timely and accurate both in space and time the severity of flood is varied spatially based on the slope and the intensity of rainfall therefore mapping of flood hazard zones along the main river can provides information about the severity of flood depths for the residents of low lying areas particularly the downstream residents and this can safe both human lives and properties a coupled 1d and 2d models in which both water profile computation as 1d and flood inundation as 2d were implemented in this study to generate the depth and prone prone areas along the baro river enea et al 2018 hec ras model used the result runoff from the tested ann hydrological model as input and gave the information on the spatial extent and depth of flooding along the river 2 6 integrated ann and hec ras model the trained and tested ann predictive hydrological model developed in this paper was used to generate runoff dawson and wilby 2010 biragani 2016 and linked to the hec ras model to generate the flood extent along the river ezzine et al 2020 whenever the ann model receives input parameters rainfall temperature and topographical wetness index and computed runoff the hec ras is ready to accept the result runoff it as input to generate the information on spatial distribution of flood and prone areas along the river fig 5 the final corrected and updated values of weights in the ann model are used to generate the runoff values whenever the input parameters are sent to the input nodes 2 7 model calibration and validation 2 7 1 ann model evaluation the terms training and testing are commonly used instruments for checking of an accuracy and fitness of a model in hydrological modeling parhi 2013 desta and lemma 2017 chuma et al 2013 when ann model is used as hydrological model the performance of ann hydrologic model result was trained with 7 years 1999 2005 climate data rainfall and temperature and topographical wetness index twi with the target data observed daily discharge of the same periods 1999 2005 and also tested with 3 years 2006 2008 observed daily discharge the performances in both periods training and testing were evaluated by nash sutcliffe efficiency nse using eq 4 4 n s e 1 i 1 n q o q s 2 i 1 n q o q m e a n 2 where qo is observed discharge m3 s qs is simulated discharge m3 s and qo is mean discharge m3 s however nash sutcliffe efficiency nse alone cannot give us the information on the model bias the fitness of simulated versus observed evaluated in nse should be supported by additional statistical error index model evaluation method therefore the pbias as statistical error index model evaluation method was also used to check whether the model result was overpredicted or underpredicted and the equation for this model evaluation presented in eq 5 ouali and cannon 2018 pérez sánchez et al 2019 and the corresponding criteria of fit for hydrological modeling for both model evaluation techniques is summarized in table 2 5 p b i a s i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 100 i 1 n y i o b s where y i o b s and y i s i m are observed and simulated respectively further the ann predictive hydrological model result was evaluated to describe the proportion of the variance between the observed and simulated values with the coefficient of determination r2 the general equation by which this coefficient is computed for the evaluation of a model is presented in eq 6 pérez sánchez et al 2019 and the acceptable range for hydrological modeling is given in the table 2 6 r 2 n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 x 2 2 7 2 hec ras model evaluation the runoff values obtained in ann hydrological model was used as input in hec ras to generate flood inundation areas the inundation map generated in hec ras during training 1999 2005 and testing 2006 2008 periods were checked with the water body delineated using normalized difference water index ndwi the flood events of 2005 and 2008 were detected while delineating the water body in ndwi ali et al 2016 enea et al 2018 ndwi eq 7 uses green band 2 and near infra red band 4 bands of remote sensing images to extract a water body in which near infrared nir and short wave infrared swi are used as the main input the performance evaluation between the inundation map generated in hec ras and the water bodies delineated from remotely sensed landsat 8 imagery downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov in ndwi were compared based on overlapping areas bagherzadeh and daneshvar 2011 7 n d w i n i r s w i n i r s w i r to get the percentage of overlapping area between the water body delineated in ndwi and hec ras software the intersect tool within the analysis toolbox in arcgis ver 10 4 was used first the raster formats of both results ndwi and hec ras were changed into vector polygons using conversion tool scanlon et al 2005 and then the corresponding shape areas were calculated using geometry calculation algorithms in the arcgis the same geographic coordinate system adindan utm zone 37 n was adjusted for both polygons and the percentage overlapping areas was calculated as shown in eq 8 potential 2020 yong wang et al 2017b 8 o v e r l a p p i n g p e r c e n t a g e l a y e r 1 k m 2 l a y e r 2 k m 2 where layer 1 is the area of the water body delineated in ndwi from flood events and layer 2 is the area of the inundation map generated in hec ras 3 results and discussion 3 1 ann hydrological model result the daily stream flow runoff values generated by ann for the training and testing results are presented in figs 6 and 7 as indicated fig 6 the daily runoff values computed in ann model and the corresponding daily discharges of 7 years during the training periods 1999 2005 was evaluated at nse 0 86 and pbias 8 2 respectively and whereas as we can see from fig 7 the nse 0 88 and pbias 8 5 were found during the 3 years testing periods 2006 2008 and similar model evaluation agreement were made by the studies conducted in kumar et al 2020 tsakiri et al 2018 kan et al 2020 as shown the fig 8 a g the ann model results were further evaluated using coefficient of determination or regression r2 with scatter plot for each year and values of 0 96 0 96 0 93 0 93 0 89 0 93 and 0 92 respectively were obtained during the training periods and the results are very good kan et al 2020 the fitness curves for each of ann results are presented in fig 8 the visualized plot for each year 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 and 2005 is presented in fig 8a g and whereas the average simulated daily ann results and the corresponding observed discharges of the entire periods of 7 yrs 1999 2005 was demonstrated in fig 8h and this result revealed a bit better than the individual scatter plot the visualized scatter plot for each year is not concentrated along the regression line however the goodness for fit and the performance rating scale for the r2 is very good the model evaluation performed at training periods is poorer that the testing periods as we can see from table 3 the 7 years hydrological model and actual daily discharge gauged at the basin outlet and the scatter plot of both values processed in rstudio is presented in fig 8 g showing that the values were evaluated at regression r2 0 89 similar results were obtained in tayfur et al 2018 pérez sánchez et al 2019 that the r2 values ranges between 0 85 and 1 is a very good model artificial neural networks applied as hydrological modeling presented in villada et al 2012 lateef ahmad dar 2017 dibaba et al 2020 was acceptable with the values summarized in table 3 3 2 hec ras model result figs 9 and 10 presents the hec ras model results during the calibration and validation periods the visualized inundation map in hec ras was further checked with historical flood events of 2005 and 2008 for calibration fig 8 and validation fig 9 periods the inundated map generated in hec ras software for the ann hydrological results of 7 years for the periods of 1999 2005 and the water body delineated in ndwi from flood event of 2005 are presented in fig 8 a and b respectively the blue color in both figures is the water body in the area of interest the hec ras result was further evaluated with the ann hydrological model result obtained during the validation periods of 2006 2008 and the water body delineated in ndwi from the flood event of 2008 were presented in fig 9 a and b respectively from the overlapping percentage areas computed in arcgis ver 10 4 94 6 and 96 of intersected areas were counted from the inundation map generated in hec ras and water body delineated in ndwi during the calibration and validation periods according to the studies conducted by bagherzadeh and daneshvar 2011 mai and de smedt 2017 the inundation map was evaluated based on the overlapping areas and if more than 85 counted percentage of overlapped it is considered as a good agreement the ability of an integrated data driven approach and hec ras model in improving the accuracy of prediction and generation of flood depths is clearly seen in this study the severity of the depth of flood inundated is very serious for the river beach residents 4 conclusion in this study an application of the ann approach and hec ras model for flood inundation mapping in lower baro river basin ethiopia is presented ann as a predictive hydrological model and hec ras as hydraulic model were integrated and accurate flood inundation areas were identified the performance of ann model for training 1999 2005 and testing 2006 2008 periods were evaluated with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse pbias and coefficient of determination r2 the nse values of 0 86 and 0 88 pbias of 8 2 and 8 5 were obtained during training and testing periods respectively the ann model result of each year 1999 2005 was further evaluated graphically at r2 values of 0 96 0 96 0 93 0 93 0 89 0 93 and 0 92 respectively accordingly the hec ras model and ndwi results were overlapped at 94 6 and 96 during the calibration and validation periods the results of this integrated ann and hec ras model were successful in improving the quality of flood prediction and in flood inundation mapping therefore the application of an integrated ann approach with the hec ras model has improved the prediction accuracy in traditional flood forecasting methods finally it was concluded that an integrated ann approach and hec ras model for flood inundation mapping is an appropriate tool for flood risk management and early warning systems and this paper will recommend that the future research will focus on the real time application of ann model since the current study is limited to the time series hydrological modeling credit authorship contribution statement habtamu tamiru proposed the research title designed the methodology analyzed
