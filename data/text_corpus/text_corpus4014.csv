20070,understanding land use and land cover lulc change dynamics and their contributing factors are critical for developing sustainable land management strategies therefore this paper assesses the trends and patterns of lulc changes and their drivers in the migori river watershed in kenya from 1980 to 2020 the spatial analysis is based on remote sensing data based on the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm whereas the analysis of the drivers is based on index based ranking and logistic regression of 318 households survey data the results show that between 1980 and 2020 the watershed experienced a considerable decline in shrub lands by 40 63 235 97 km2 grasslands by 84 86 59 14 km2 forests by 52 90 98 36 km2 water by 82 03 39 27 km2 and wetlands by 38 44 3 69 km2 whereas cultivated land bare land and built up areas expanded over the same period by 34 25 347 42 km2 132 28 60 95 km2 and 461 20 25 32 km2 respectively the results of the household survey revealed that the perceptions of the locals tended to corroborate these observed lulc patterns obtained from spatial analysis with 60 50 n 192 of the respondents reporting a significant expansion in agricultural land use at p 0 05 and 75 80 n 241 observing a significant decline in forest areas in the watershed at p 0 05 fuel wood collection timber poles production agricultural expansion population pressure and high poverty are the major drivers of these lulc changes the findings also revealed that educational level significantly influenced the survey participants perceptions concerning these drivers the paper concludes that the watershed s natural landscapes have been undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments driven by anthropogenic activities therefore there is a need among others for land use zoning to regulate conflicting land uses on the watershed between settlement conservation and agricultural lands keywords change detection watershed management remote sensing geographical information system community perceptions introduction since the 1970s land use and land cover lulc change has been an important research topic receiving significant attentionfrom the scientific world brown et al 2013 this is attributed to the global recognition of land use and land cover change as a major factor impacting various environments in the world and its escalation from local regional to global scales over the last decades oliver and morecroft 2014 xu et al 2020 these changes can be gradual or abrupt such as the ones influenced by natural catastrophes or even political intrigues kariyeva van leeuwen 2012 in the pursuit of livelihoods the competing human demands for exploitation management and conservation of land resources drive changes in land use and land cover magige 2018 human induced causes of lulc are classified into two major groups namely proximate drivers and underlying drivers munthali et al 2019 the proximate drivers are factors linked to human undertakings that directly transform the land cover e g urbanization or agriculture while the underlying drivers are forces that trigger the proximate causes and indirectly increase their effect on the environment e g government policies and technological advancement kindu et al 2015 song et al 2018 the underlying drivers cut across the biophysical demographic social cultural technological economic political and institutional factors xu et al 2020 several studies indicate that it is the synergy of several drivers that results in land use and land cover changes dewan et al 2012 meshesha et al 2016 munthali et al 2019 du et al 2014 opined that the drivers of land use and land cover are dynamic and their impact depends on the context which could be socio economic ecological historical and political land use and land cover change have significant effects on the functioning of socio economic and ecosystems with important tradeoffs for sustainability biodiversity food security and socio economic vulnerability of communities and ecological systems guzha et al 2018 alawamy et al 2020 a growing volume of the literature shows that lulc change has devastating impacts on natural resources food security climate change and energy rutten et al 2014 de castro et al 2016 xu et al 2016 watersheds are one of the fragile natural resources most impacted by changes in lulc over the last few decades hassen assen 2018 de castro et al 2016 observe that the effects of pervasive lulc on watersheds are multi faceted and cut across hydrology water chemistry and biodiversity among others researchers have shown that changes in the condition and composition of land cover in watersheds affect the quantity and quality of water resources available in the watershed altering the sediment regime the volume of runoff discharge and the rate of the peak flow of the runoff and the way pollutants move through the drainage basin chiwa 2012 mekonnen et al 2015 kipkorir 2017 like any other country in sub saharan africa kenya s watersheds face immense pressure from rapid and extensive lulc changes caused by human environment interactions muriithi 2016 onyango et al 2021 even though various studies on lulc changes in a diversified range of landscapes have been done in kenya research on lulc dynamics of watersheds within the larger lake victoria basin as well as the factors contributing to these changes remains scanty the present study focuses on the migori river watershed one of the hotspots of biodiversity situated in the kenyan lake victoria basin this region has been continuously experiencing extensive vegetation loss and fragmentation of its natural landscapes over the last few decades due to agricultural expansion infrastructural development and increased occurrence of natural hazards such as floods and landslides magige 2014 sirengo et al 2018 onyango opiyo 2022 but data and documentation detailing the nature and extent of these landscape changes are limited estimating the rate nature type and pattern of lulc changes in any landscape as well as understanding factors that influence these changes are fundamental for decision making by policymakers planners and other stakeholders kamwi et al 2015 liping et al 2018 therefore this study aims at quantifying lulc changes and assessing the key drivers contributing to these changes in the migori river watershed between 1980 and 2020 thus the study captured local communities perceptions of lulc change trends and the drivers of these changes in the study area various studies have pointed out that lulc change dynamics observed on any landscape are a reflection of aggregated decisions at the household level in response to policy and an institutional background over a particular period hassen assen 2017 munthali et al 2018 the findings of this study are envisioned to offer a foundation for systematic and effective land use planning management and ecological restoration for socio economic development in the migori river watershed materials and methods description of the study area the migori river watershed fig 1 hereafter referred to as the watershed is located within migori county and covers approximately 2 597 km2 of land area in the western kenya region migori river originates from chepalungu forest in emuria dikiri sub county of narok county from where it flows 70 km through migori county to lake victoria the entire catchment for the migori river is found at an altitude of 1500 m above sea level it enjoys an inland equatorial climate that is heavily influenced by its proximity to lake victoria it receives mean annual rainfall in the range of 700 mm to 1800 mm with two wet seasons and two dry seasons average temperatures in the region range from 13 c to 24 c depending on the seasons the watershed is divided into six agro ecological areas ranging from upper midland 1 3 which covers sections of rongo uriri kuria east and kuria west sub counties to lower midland 1 5 which covers sections of rongo uriri nyatike and suna east sub counties sirengo 2018 this watershed s land use is dominated by extensive agricultural and deforestation practices for charcoal production in the upstream urbanization and agricultural practices especially tobacco cotton maize and sugarcane farming among others in the midstream and mining and urban development activities are rampant in the downstream region because of its arid and semi arid climatic conditions consisting of extensive savanna grasslands geologically the watershed lies within the migori greenstone belt which is a system of archaean rocks containing mineral deposits such as gold copper zinc and galena which are being mined artisanally in the region odumo et al 2011 satellite imagery data acquisition a combination of remote sensing and geographical information system gis is used to assess the trends and patterns of land use and land cover changes in the migori river watershed between 1980 and 2020 at the recommended 10 year intervals alawamy et al 2020 the paper utilizes datasets of multi temporal and spectral satellite imageries of landsat 3 multispectral scanner 1980 landsat 4 5 thematic mapper 1990 2000 and 2010 and operational land satellite thematic infrared sensor 2020 obtained from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer website https www earthexplorer usgs gov the features of these imageries are summarized in table 1 to minimize phonological variations all images selected were for the dry month of december when both the moisture content and cloud coverage in migori county are at their lowest data pre processing after the acquisition the raw satellite images were imported into erdas imagine 2020 version by hexagon geospatial for standard pre processing procedures undertaken before classification to improve their visualization and interpretability first radiometric atmospheric correction was performed to reduce the effects of haze captured on the landsat images following the approach described by lillesand and keifer 2015 in this procedure the metadata of the raw landsat imageries of the five years under investigation was exported into the erdas imagine software which then utilized the information contained in the metadata to automatically correct the datasets eliminating all the atmospheric impurities such as cloud cover that might adversely impact image classification onyango et al 2021 the radiometrically corrected images were then subjected to an image mosaicking procedure whereby images of similar paths but different rows were joined together into one single image so as to retrieve the exact area of the imageries covered by the watershed nguyen et al 2019 due to the vastness of the migori river watershed the entire shape of the watershed could not be captured in a single satellite row hence separate landsat images that hold portions of the watershed had to be joined mosaicked into one single image covering the entire watershed in order to ease processing image sub setting described by samrat et al 2022 was then performed to extract and clip the area of interest i e the migori river watershed from the mosaic using the extent of the migori county in kenya noteworthy satellite images usually cover extensive landscapes that often extend beyond the region required for the project research hence the need for sub setting samrat et al 2022 after sub setting layer stacking was performed in which appropriate bands with exception of the thermal bands were layer stacked combined together to form one single composite image to bring out the true color image of the scene lillesand keifer 2015 finally the images were subjected to pan sharpening to enhance the visualization of panchromatic images usgs 2020 data processing and analysis after successful pre processing and prior to classification the training and validation datasets of different periods used for classification and accuracy assessment respectively were collected from the google earth desktop application as described by doyog et al 2021 google earth is available free of charge and offers very high spatial resolution images with historical and up to date details of the earth s surface midekisa et al 2017 doyog et al 2021 allowing multi temporal analysis of landscape changes over time eggen et al 2016 sidhu et al 2018 next the corrected images were subjected to a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood classification mlc algorithm to define lulc classes munthali et al 2019 previous studies have shown that mlc is the most common successful and widely adopted algorithm for lulc classification ikiel et al 2013 ariti et al 2015 onyango opiyo 2022 eight classes were developed based on ancillary data visual analysis of the locations on google earth pro maps and ground truthing anwar et al 2022 the lulc classes of interest were therefore defined as cultivated land shrub land grasslands forests bare land built up areas water and wetlands table 2 for each class 6 ground truth polygons were sampled randomly and digitized using aerial photographs and visual inspection of the locations on google earth maps in line with jensen 2007 each training sample polygon used in the classification process contained not 50 pixels the training sample polygons which were found with unwanted pixels were thrown out and replaced with the new ones with desired spectral signatures after successful image training with the signature editor the maximum likelihood algorithm was run a couple of times to produce class signatures and classify the imageries into meaningful land use and land cover categories finally the arcgis desktop by esri version 10 2 was used to generate cartographically appropriate lulc maps for the years 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 post processing analysis accuracy assessment was done through the generation of confusion error matrices in which the data from lulc classification are compared to the ground truthing data acquired from fieldwork this study used 160 ground reference points 20 reference points for each lulc class and reference data extracted from google earth images for accuracy assessment the positions of the reference points were automatically identified on the classified images and their class values were defined to determine the accuracy of a pixel the statistical components of the confusion matrix namely producer s accuracy user s accuracy overall accuracy kappa statistics and overall kappa coefficient were calculated for all the classified lulc images based on the algorithms provided in congalton and green 2019 change detection analysis was then carried out using the change matrix tool during this automated process classified lulc data of the initial year under consideration is compared to the one for the final year under consideration once the areal coverages are computed the software produces a change detection matrix that shows the net changes for the respective classes over a given period the data for 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 obtained from the change matrix is expressed in square kilometers and percentages finally the lulc change transition matrix through the overlay technique in arcgis to estimate the area converted from every lulc category to the other over the period between 1980 and 2020 moreover the annual rate of change of each lulc category was computed as percentages using equation 1 proposed by puyravaud 2003 1 r 1 t 2 t 1 i n a 2 a 1 where r is the annual rate of change for each lulc category in percentage and a2 and a1 are areas of each lulc category at the end t2 and the beginning t1 respectively for the period under review household survey sample size and sampling procedure a descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted between january and february 2022 among 318 randomly selected households in the migori river watershed using pre tested interviewer administered semi structured questionnaires the household questionnaires consisted of various questions designed to get information on the perceptions of the local communities on lulc changes and the drivers in the migori river watershed from 1980 to 2020 the questionnaire was initially pretested in 30 households in the awendo sub county which neighbors the watershed and isn t part of the actual survey after which the adjustments were effected before the actual household survey prior to the survey village elders and local administration officials were consulted to explain the purpose of the study understand the local realities which helped in developing questionnaire items and obtain permission to visit the selected households during the exercise the questionnaires were administered to household heads or other senior members of the selected households who had lived in the watershed for at least ten years upon obtaining verbal consent cultural norms dictated that the male be interviewed as the head of the household unless absent then the spouse or adult over 21 years family member who understands the family and area well each interview lasted about 35 min on average characteristics of the sampled households a summary of the socio economic characteristics of the respondents is presented in table 3 the age of the participants ranges from 21 to 83 years with an average of 38 60 approximately 57 80 lived in the watershed throughout the period under review for lulc changes the majority 77 70 is married 70 80 of the households are male headed and 29 20 are female headed household sizes in the watershed range from 1 to 12 persons with an average of 6 10 about 84 30 own land and 15 70 are landless with landholding size ranging from 0 50 to 9 00 acres with an average of 2 91 acres regarding educational attainment 72 10 are literate 23 00 25 50 and 23 60 had attained primary education secondary education and college education respectively with 27 90 having no formal schooling about 80 00 of the surveyed households were involved in crop farming and a small proportion of the participants 20 00 were engaged in various off farm and non farm activities the average household income of the participants was usd 498 72 kshs 57 552 29 per annum agriculture is ranked as an important income source for households in the watershed followed by non farm activities employment in non farm sectors like healthcare education mining and tourism which are ranked second then off farm self employment activities such as processing packaging transport or sale of farm produce and lastly remittances statistical analyses the lulc change analysis was conducted using arcgis desktop by esri version 10 2 and erdas imagine 2020 by hexagon geospatial in a process that combined gis and remote sensing techniques the socio economic survey data was analyzed using the ibm spss statistics for windows version 24 0 in which both descriptive statistics and regression analyses were conducted after obtaining the descriptive statistics ranking the lulc change drivers for the watershed based on the weighted average was computed using the relative importance index rii equation 2 adopted by previous studies musa et al 2006 aziz et al 2016 2 rii r n c 1 r n 1 c 2 r 1 c n a n where rn value of the lowest last rank e g if the lowest last rank is 5 in the likert scale used then rn 5 and rn 1 4 r1 value of the highest first rank in the likert scale used usually 1 cn counts number of observations on lowest last rank c1 counts number of observations on highest first rank a the highest value in the overall ranking scale and n total number of respondents logistic regression analysis is carried out using equation 3 to determine the drivers of lulc changes at the household level in the migori river watershed in this model the independent variables comprised the socio economic attributes whereas the dependent variables are the respondent s perceptions of the driving forces of lulc change the logistic regression analysis at the household level approximated the probability of the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables munthali et al 2019 3 logit y α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β n x n where y dependent variable indicating the likelihood that y 1 α the intercept β1 βnn coefficients of associated independent variables and x1 xn independent variables results and discussion accuracy assessment of the lulc classification the classified imageries have an overall accuracy of over 86 00 table 4 since an overall accuracy of over 80 00 is acceptable and recommended turan günlü 2010 the lulc classification is thus acceptable and hence reliable furthermore the overall kappa coefficient for all the classified images ranged between 0 77 and 0 81 which when compared to the landis and koch 1977 ratings shows that the classification carried out for the study has a strong agreement with the ground truthing reference data the kappa coefficient is a measurement of the precision or agreement between data from classified imageries and data from ground reference locations ikiel et al 2013 although there are small differences in producer and user accuracies of specific lulc categories the classification registered high overall accuracy table 4 these accuracy assessment results provided the basis for subsequent examination of lulc changes lulc change dynamics in migori river watershed from 1980 to 2020 lulc changes have been investigated for the years 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 using three generation landsat time series data considering eight different classes namely cultivated land shrub land grasslands forests bare land built up areas water and wetlands the classified lulc maps for the corresponding years showing the spatial representation of these lulc types are shown in fig 2 overall trend analysis of lulc changes 1980 2020 the proportionate coverage area of each of the eight classes extracted in the watershed from 1980 to 2020 of lulc change trends is summarized in table 5 and fig 3 table 5 indicates that shrub land grassland forests water and wetland shrunk while cultivated land bare land and built up area expanded over the past 40 years in the watershed the cultivated land was the most dominant lulc class in the watershed in 1980 accounting for approximately 51 86 of the total landscape but it has since then increased by about 347 42 km2 8 69 km2 year since the 1980s cultivated land initially fell sharply in 1990 before taking a steady increasing trend over the following decades while the cause of the decline in cultivated land in 1990 is unknown the trend of farmland expansion over the years could be attributed to the high rate of population increase un department of economic and social affairs 2019 which might have increased the demand for food and consequently resulted in the conversion of other natural landscapes like grasslands wetlands and forests and shrub lands into farmlands bare land accounted for 2 of the watershed in 1980 but has since risen by 132 28 0 1 km2 year this is a reflection of the effect of increased unsustainable utilization of grasslands and forests through overgrazing and deforestation this is consistent with the conclusions of hassen and assen 2018 about land use change in the lake tana watershed in ethiopia the built up area constituted 3 of the watershed in 1980 but has since expanded by 461 20 0 6 km2 year this exponential expansion demonstrates the rapid rate of conversion of natural landscapes into settlement areas to accommodate the ever burgeoning population forest cover in the watershed seems to have declined by about 52 90 1 48 km2 year notwithstanding the forest conservation efforts since the 1980s championed by the permanent presidential commission on soil conservation and afforestation this can be attributed to the expansion of rural and urban settlements and farmlands weak enforcement of conservation laws and increased demand for timber as raw materials for construction and fuel wood for household usage although grasslands exhibited an irregular pattern of spatio temporal changes across the five reference periods it has experienced a decline of approximately 84 86 1 48 km2 year over the past 40 years this substantial decline in grasslands is an indication of the increasing demand for agricultural lands and the development of forests in some of the grasslands moreover the irregular pattern of changes observed in grasslands from 1980 to 2020 can be attributed to the destruction by constant incidences of fire outbreaks that usually occur in the area during periods of droughts odeny 2015 or by the droughts themselves oyugi 2016 the entire migori county where the watershed lies is a drought prone region characterized by unreliable rainfalls poorly distributed throughout the year and constantly fluctuating temperatures oyugi 2016 and has been known to be constantly threatened by fire outbreaks following prolonged drought conditions odeny 2015 the frequent destruction of grasslands by both fire or drought incidences and the successive regenerations contributes to the irregular pattern of spatio temporal changes over time similar to grasslands the patterns of spatio temporal changes in shrub lands showed that it has declined by 40 63 5 90 km2 year over the four decade period which was largely attributed to the conversion to cultivated lands and settlements due to population pressure since 1980 water declined by 82 03 0 98 km2 year while the wetlands shrunk by 38 44 0 1 km2 year this declining trend in areas under water and wetlands could be attributed to the emergence and growth of aquatic vegetation and invasive species in these areas frequent occurrence of droughts in the area magige 2014 and probably the depletion of water through domestic usage canal irrigation and livestock watering further the decline suggests the existence of unsustainable land management practices like the reclamation of these lands to create spaces for agriculture and settlement coupled with mining in the area decadal trend analysis of lulc changes a decade by decade analysis of the rates of change in lulc between 1980 and 2020 in the watershed revealed specific net changes in the form of gains and losses for each class during the 1st period 1980 1990 2nd period 1990 2000 3rd period 2000 2010 and 4th period 2010 2020 as shown in table 6 and fig 4 i the pattern of lulc changes between 1980 and 1990 from 1980 to 1990 the watershed experienced considerable positive and negative transformations in the lulc coverage table 6 and fig 4 spatial analysis indicated that cultivated land was the dominant lulc in the watershed in 1980 covering around 1014 36 km2 51 86 of the entire land area table 5 however it decreased to 766 54 km2 39 19 in 1990 table 5 resulting in a net loss in coverage of about 24 43 over that decade table 6 shrub lands water and wetlands also showed negative trends during this decade with net losses of 15 86 56 11 and 69 27 from their original coverage respectively table 6 on the contrary the remaining lulc categories experienced positive trends from 1980 to 1990 i e there is an increase in grasslands by 201 03 forests by 63 71 bare land by 252 00 and built up area by 18 40 these findings imply that during this era the land areas under cultivation shrubs water and wetlands shrunk because they became bare got covered by grasslands and forests or were converted to settlements for the growing population this phenomenon could be attributed to a government policy by the new government in the early 1980s which established the permanent presidential commission on soil conservation and afforestation ppcsca in 1981 to champion environmental conservation efforts in the entire country nasong o 2012 this policy instituted protective and preservation measures for natural forests and grasslands with farmlands inside forested areas being reclaimed by the government leading to the encroachment of wetlands and shrub lands due to increased demand for new farmlands and settlement areas nasong o 2012 ii the pattern of lulc changes between 1990 and 2000 in this decade the lulc categories of cultivated land water and wetlands which had recorded net losses during the previous decade showed substantial gains in their land coverage whereas those of grasslands forests and bare land which had registered substantial net gains recorded net losses table 6 cultivated land increased by 85 40 the water rose by 5 43 and wetlands grew twofold 202 20 conversely grasslands were reduced by 73 98 forests by 58 76 and bare land by 32 07 during the same period shrub land continued to show a negative trend with a 58 38 net loss while built up lands continued to experience a positive trend with a net gain of 51 23 these environmental transformations could generally be attributed to the high rate of population growth observed in kenya from the late 1980s towards the new millennium which was estimated to be between 3 20 and 3 60 per annum un department of economic and social affairs 2019 during the same period the population growth rate of the entire lake victoria basin under which the watershed is located was touted to be among the highest in the country at 2 85 per year rakama et al 2017 this massive population growth might have led to the conversion of bare lands to settlement areas or farms and the destruction of forests and grasslands in the quest for new croplands or settlement areas raw materials for construction works and fuel wood for domestic consumption iii the pattern of lulc changes between 2000 and 2010 fig 4 and table 6 reveal that five of the lulc categories recorded net losses with two recording net gains forests bare land water wetland and built up registered net losses of 17 00 42 63 22 21 40 20 and 15 87 respectively whereas shrub land and grassland grew by 14 91 and 48 17 respectively unlike the previous decades cultivated land remained relatively constant during this decade 2000 2010 only rising by 1 69 generally the transformations suggest that during this period grasslands and shrub lands expanded largely at the expense of other natural landscapes forests bare land water and wetlands due to the existence of unsustainable land management practices the built up area lost a small portion as cultivated lands saw little change in their coverage which indicates no acquisition of new lands for settlement or farming these occurrences could be attributed to the coming to power of a new regime that oversaw policies that not only spurred strong economic development and created employment opportunities in urban areas of the country but also enacted new conservation laws and policies like the environmental management and coordination act of 1999 and forest act of 2005 that may have impacted land management approaches causing an uncoordinated transition from old practices iv the pattern of lulc changes between 2010 and 2020 between 2010 and 2020 grasslands declined by 86 95 forests by 17 91 and water by 50 09 unlike other categories that increased shrub land by 47 56 bare land by 69 15 built up area by 272 55 and wetlands by 10 67 with cultivated land remaining fairly constant table 6 the substantial expansion of bare lands and shrub lands is a reflection of the effect of unsustainable utilization of grasslands and forests through overgrazing and deforestation respectively moreover the substantial increment of the built up areas reflects the high rate of conversion of natural landscapes like forests and grasslands into settlement areas for the burgeoning population of the four epochs this period stands out as the one in which the environment of the watershed suffered considerable negative transformation land use and land cover change matrix table 7 present the cross tabulation change matrix illustrating how the coverages of various lulc classes have changed over time from one class to another from 1980 to 2020 conversions of one lulc to the other occurred across the entire watershed results show that during the period between 1980 and 2020 81 41 of built up areas 12 61 km2 74 34 of cultivated land 756 84 km2 56 26 of water 26 93 km2 22 59 of bare land 10 40 km2 20 33 of shrub lands 118 09 km2 15 96 of forests 29 08 km2 4 08 of grasslands 2 84 km2 and 0 60 of wetlands 0 06 km2 remained unchanged this demonstrates that while the original areas of built up lands cultivated lands and water remained largely unchanged the rest of the lulc categories experienced high conversion with over 80 of their total land areas converted to other lulc classes a large portion of cultivated land was converted to shrub land 15 30 whereas a large proportion of bare land became cultivated land 58 36 also the majority of shrub lands turned into cultivated land 66 12 whilst major sections covered by grasslands became either cultivated land 68 59 or shrub land 18 12 forests lost a large part of their coverage to cultivated land 54 95 as water and wetland lost large chunks to shrub land 18 70 and cultivated land 66 20 respectively although the original built up areas remained largely unchanged 18 16 km2 and 6 69 km2 were gained from cultivated land and shrub land respectively watershed community perceptions on trends and drivers of lulc changes local community perceptions concerning the trends of lulc changes and distances to infrastructure survey participants perceptions of lulc trends in the migori river watershed are presented in fig 5 the study observed significant differences p 0 05 among the surveyed households in perceptions concerning the trends of lulc changes and proximity to various infrastructures like commercial centers and markets educational centers health facilities and roads the study participants perceived that farmlands have significantly expanded p 0 05 in the watershed while forests and vegetation cover have significantly declined p 0 05 over the years under review a confirmation of the observed lulc trends interpreted from remotely sensed data in the period of 1980 2020 about 60 50 and 75 80 of watershed communities accurately perceived that farmlands and forests had expanded and shrunk respectively fig 5 this is consistent with the fact that 80 00 of the households in the watershed are involved in crop farming and that agriculture is considered the most important source of income for the watershed community table 3 farming of crops like tobacco cotton maize and sugarcane is widely practiced in the watershed and this expands farmlands while reducing forest cover through the clearing of vegetation nearly two thirds of the households 65 20 perceived that the distance to natural water sources didn t change from 1980 to 2020 also the distances to infrastructures like health facilities and major roads largely remained unchanged over the same period on the other hand distances to commercial centers and markets portable drinking water and education centers were perceived to have significantly decreased over the same period p 0 05 these results are consistent with the findings of munthali et al 2019 in the dedza watershed of malawi and they show that the accelerated urban development observed in the spatial analysis prioritized the expansion of residential areas for commercial settlement and academic purposes at the expense of health centers and road networks this perceived expansion of infrastructure in the study area confirms the observed built up area trends in the period of 1980 2020 interpreted from remotely sensed data in general the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development moreover the usage of older respondents 21 years of which half had lived in the watershed throughout the period under review for lulc changes yielded an accurate historical account of lulc changes in the watershed corroborating the observed lulc trends interpreted from remotely sensed data in the period of 1980 2020 this local attention to lulc changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed combining lulc maps with local perceptions of lulc changes enables enhanced interpretation of the land use information which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision making ranked drivers of land use and land cover changes in the watershed the survey identified 11 major proximate direct drivers of lulc change in the watershed table 8 these are factors linked to human undertakings that directly transform the land cover lambin meyfroidt 2011 fuel wood collection timber poles production shifting cultivation agricultural expansion and charcoal production were the top five ranked proximate causes of lulc changes in the watershed with fuel wood collection and timber poles production ranking first and second respectively other notable factors included settlements and artisanal mining the results of this study resonate with other similar studies in the developing world where anthropogenic activities were reported as the contributory factors for lulc changes for instance munthali et al 2019 study identified firewood collection charcoal production settlement construction and agricultural expansion as the four major proximate drivers of lulc changes in the dedza watershed in malawi a study by kleemann et al 2017 identified agricultural intensification and extensification livestock production fuel wood utilization mining and bushfire as the top proximate drivers of lulc trends in the upper eastern region of ghana in indonesia juniyanti et al 2021 show that direct causes of lulc in most watersheds in the country include the expansion of agricultural areas wood extraction for fuel and timber production however the study found that shifting cultivation is not a dominant direct cause guarderas et al 2022 study in ecuador shows that the major pressure on watershed ecosystems in northern ecuador is the continued expansion upwards of the agricultural livestock frontier and deforestation however contrary to our findings it also ranked unplanned urbanization expansion and natural reforestation as one of the most important lulc drivers concerning the underlying indirect drivers that is the forces that indirectly trigger the proximate causes geist lambin 2002 the survey participants perceived population growth and poverty as the two main drivers of lulc change in the watershed followed by limited access to alternative sources of energy demand for timber and lack of law enforcement table 9 this essentially means that the top five proximate causes of lulc changes in the watershed i e fuel wood collection timber poles production shifting cultivation agricultural expansion and charcoal production are triggered by population pressure and high poverty levels this is consistent with similar studies conducted in the developing world for instance in sub saharan africa population growth and high poverty levels have been reported to be the main contributory factors for lulc changes in natural ecosystems in the zambezi region of namibia kamwi et al 2015 dedza watershed in malawi munthali et al 2019 rangelands in the afar region of ethiopia mekuyie et al 2018 pugu and kazimzumbwi forest reserves in tanzania mdemu et al 2012 the same trend has also been observed in the destruction of natural ecosystems in the highlands of northern ecuador guarderas et al 2022 and the deforestation of deciduous and mangrove forests in bangladesh reza hasan 2019 contrary to our study and the mentioned studies a study by juniyanti et al 2021 found that the institutional political driver is by far the leading underlying cause of lulc in various ecosystems in indonesia as opposed to population growth or high poverty levels in the survey approximately 95 agreed that the population of the area has increased over the period under review which corroborated with population data that indicate that the population of the migori county where the watershed is situated has grown by 180 between 1980 and 2019 knbs 2019 earlier studies in the larger lake victoria basin the region which encompasses the migori river watershed had also identified population pressure as one of the drivers of landscape alterations odada et al 2009 onyango et al 2021 indirectly population growth in the watershed leads to lulc changes by causing increased local demand for food which drives agriculture expansion increased timber and energy fuel wood and charcoal consumption which drives deforestation and increased demand for settlement and associated amenities which drives deforestation to create space for housing units and infrastructure development in terms of residential commercial health transport and educational facilities kamwi et al 2015 reza hasan 2019 munthali et al 2019 poverty is pervasive in the kenyan lake victoria basin in which the migori river watershed occurs as most households live below the poverty line onyango opiyo 2021 evidence of the widespread poverty in the watershed was observed in the survey results which revealed that the average household daily income in the watershed is 2 usd table 3 this low level of income obtained majorly from agricultural activities is what the watershed household heads rely on to sustain and support an average family of 6 persons table 3 a household size that is beyond the 4 members national average knbs 2019 poverty in the watershed is exacerbated by the landlessness of some households who are unable to engage in the most important source of income in the study area agriculture table 3 also noteworthy is that the low level of participation in non farm and off farm activities table 3 also contributes to the high poverty levels in the watershed as it exposes them to livelihood vulnerabilities associated with overreliance on climate sensitive rainfed agriculture due to the high poverty levels about 93 of the watershed households use three stone open fire for cooking table 3 resulting in increased utilization of fuel wood which not only causes indoor air pollution but also accelerates deforestation an association between poverty and the usage of three stone open fire has been established in the western kenya region by njenga et al 2017 also poverty has made watershed communities to be involved in charcoal burning as a source of income they seem to burn the charcoal and sell it in urban areas rather than use it in their households the over dependence of rural communities on fuel wood and urban dwellers on charcoal has been widely documented in kenya by previous studies kituyi 2004 njenga et al 2017 timber pole production was identified as one of the drivers because it is used by the rural communities for constructing settlements for the ever burgeoning population the high utilization of fuel wood charcoal and timber poles for construction in this region explains the decline in forest cover between 1980 and 2020 overall the findings imply that the watershed community derives its income from shifting cultivation and the extraction and sale of forest products like poles lumber firewood and charcoal and that they are also driven to clear forested areas for additional farmlands or settlement areas to accommodate the growing population although weak government policies regarding natural resources conservation didn t come out strongly among the top underlying drivers of lulc changes in the watershed identified by the survey weak law enforcement did which implies that appropriate government policies are in place but their enforcement is weak and ineffective and therefore may not curtail unsustainable land management practices the various protected areas such as forest blocks wetlands cultural sites and water sources in the watershed are governed by various government policies developed over the years such as the environmental management and conservation act 1999 which mandates environmental management with the goal of attaining sustainable land based natural resources like forests wetlands and water catchment landscapes forest conservation and management act 2016 which provides for the establishment protection conservation and sustainable utilization and management of forests and forest resources for maintenance and conservation of water catchment areas water act 2016 which tackles the utilization of water resources to meet human and animal needs the sustainable management protection of watershed ecosystems and land act 2012 which emphasizes sustainable conservation management and protection of land resources including critical biodiversity forests and fragile ecosystems and wildlife conservation and management act 2013 provides for the sustainable protection conservation and management of water catchment areas including forests and wetlands existing within the game parks reserves and protected areas these government policies generally prohibit logging for timber or deforestation for fuel wood collection settlement or agricultural expansion within these protected areas the government has been lax in providing the enforcement required to curtail such practices from continuing in the watershed which may be due to the recognition of the high poverty levels experienced by the rapidly growing population therefore law enforcement continues to be an important trigger for these anthropogenic induced causes of lulc changes household level logistic regression of perceived drivers of land use and land cover changes logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the drivers of lulc changes at the household level in the migori river watershed table 10 according to munthali et al 2019 the logistic regression analysis of lulc drivers at the household level approximates the probability of the effects of the respondents socio economic attributes independent variables on the respondent s perceptions of the driving forces of lulc change dependent variables regression analysis table 10 showed that education attainment level significantly and negatively impacted at p 0 05 the perceptions of watershed households on timber poles production agricultural expansion and poverty as drivers of lulc change this finding is consistent with the conclusions reached by munthali et al 2019 and anwar et al 2022 studies which both generally showed that among main socio economic determinants the education level of rural communities has a significant influence on their perceptions of lulc change and its drivers this implies that education can be used to bring behavior change among rural communities in terms of their interaction and utilization of natural resources onyango opiyo 2021 the results also revealed that the landholding size educational level and duration of residency in the watershed significantly influenced the perceptions of the watershed community concerning fuel wood collection timber poles production population growth and poverty table 10 shifting cultivation was not significantly influenced by any of the determinants the age of household heads significantly influenced their perceptions of fuel wood collection population growth and poverty conclusions and recommendations the study established that the major land use in the watershed during the period under review is cultivated land with an average of 61 44 overall coverage of the total land area during the entire period hence the livelihoods of the watershed inhabitants have been historically agriculture dependent the decline in shrub lands by 40 63 grasslands by 84 86 forests by 52 90 water by 82 03 and wetlands by 38 44 coupled with increased cultivated land by 34 25 bare land by 132 28 and built up areas by 461 20 over the period under review indicate that the natural landscapes in the watershed are undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments fuel wood collection timber pole production shifting cultivation agricultural expansion charcoal production population pressure and high poverty level are the topmost drivers perceived by the watershed communities to be contributing to the land use and land cover changes in the watershed since all these identified drivers are still active in the watershed the natural landscapes are likely to decline further with negative implications on watershed ecosystem services biodiversity and community livelihoods generally the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development this local attention to land use and land cover changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed integration of spatial lulc analysis with local perceptions of lulc changes enables enhanced interpretation of the land use information which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision making the paper recommends land use zoning on the watershed area to demarcate land areas into settlement areas conservation and protected areas and agricultural lands as well as regulate physical development and use of fragile conservation areas like forests wetlands and water sources efforts should be directed towards the adoption of alternative cooking energy types by watershed households to reduce the overall demand for fuel wood and consequently ease pressure on forests the government should also harmonize the existing conservation policies to align them with the interests and priorities of the local watershed communities to balance competing goals for effective management and conservation of the watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the authors would like to thank daad for financing this study the authors also wish to the

20070,understanding land use and land cover lulc change dynamics and their contributing factors are critical for developing sustainable land management strategies therefore this paper assesses the trends and patterns of lulc changes and their drivers in the migori river watershed in kenya from 1980 to 2020 the spatial analysis is based on remote sensing data based on the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm whereas the analysis of the drivers is based on index based ranking and logistic regression of 318 households survey data the results show that between 1980 and 2020 the watershed experienced a considerable decline in shrub lands by 40 63 235 97 km2 grasslands by 84 86 59 14 km2 forests by 52 90 98 36 km2 water by 82 03 39 27 km2 and wetlands by 38 44 3 69 km2 whereas cultivated land bare land and built up areas expanded over the same period by 34 25 347 42 km2 132 28 60 95 km2 and 461 20 25 32 km2 respectively the results of the household survey revealed that the perceptions of the locals tended to corroborate these observed lulc patterns obtained from spatial analysis with 60 50 n 192 of the respondents reporting a significant expansion in agricultural land use at p 0 05 and 75 80 n 241 observing a significant decline in forest areas in the watershed at p 0 05 fuel wood collection timber poles production agricultural expansion population pressure and high poverty are the major drivers of these lulc changes the findings also revealed that educational level significantly influenced the survey participants perceptions concerning these drivers the paper concludes that the watershed s natural landscapes have been undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments driven by anthropogenic activities therefore there is a need among others for land use zoning to regulate conflicting land uses on the watershed between settlement conservation and agricultural lands keywords change detection watershed management remote sensing geographical information system community perceptions introduction since the 1970s land use and land cover lulc change has been an important research topic receiving significant attentionfrom the scientific world brown et al 2013 this is attributed to the global recognition of land use and land cover change as a major factor impacting various environments in the world and its escalation from local regional to global scales over the last decades oliver and morecroft 2014 xu et al 2020 these changes can be gradual or abrupt such as the ones influenced by natural catastrophes or even political intrigues kariyeva van leeuwen 2012 in the pursuit of livelihoods the competing human demands for exploitation management and conservation of land resources drive changes in land use and land cover magige 2018 human induced causes of lulc are classified into two major groups namely proximate drivers and underlying drivers munthali et al 2019 the proximate drivers are factors linked to human undertakings that directly transform the land cover e g urbanization or agriculture while the underlying drivers are forces that trigger the proximate causes and indirectly increase their effect on the environment e g government policies and technological advancement kindu et al 2015 song et al 2018 the underlying drivers cut across the biophysical demographic social cultural technological economic political and institutional factors xu et al 2020 several studies indicate that it is the synergy of several drivers that results in land use and land cover changes dewan et al 2012 meshesha et al 2016 munthali et al 2019 du et al 2014 opined that the drivers of land use and land cover are dynamic and their impact depends on the context which could be socio economic ecological historical and political land use and land cover change have significant effects on the functioning of socio economic and ecosystems with important tradeoffs for sustainability biodiversity food security and socio economic vulnerability of communities and ecological systems guzha et al 2018 alawamy et al 2020 a growing volume of the literature shows that lulc change has devastating impacts on natural resources food security climate change and energy rutten et al 2014 de castro et al 2016 xu et al 2016 watersheds are one of the fragile natural resources most impacted by changes in lulc over the last few decades hassen assen 2018 de castro et al 2016 observe that the effects of pervasive lulc on watersheds are multi faceted and cut across hydrology water chemistry and biodiversity among others researchers have shown that changes in the condition and composition of land cover in watersheds affect the quantity and quality of water resources available in the watershed altering the sediment regime the volume of runoff discharge and the rate of the peak flow of the runoff and the way pollutants move through the drainage basin chiwa 2012 mekonnen et al 2015 kipkorir 2017 like any other country in sub saharan africa kenya s watersheds face immense pressure from rapid and extensive lulc changes caused by human environment interactions muriithi 2016 onyango et al 2021 even though various studies on lulc changes in a diversified range of landscapes have been done in kenya research on lulc dynamics of watersheds within the larger lake victoria basin as well as the factors contributing to these changes remains scanty the present study focuses on the migori river watershed one of the hotspots of biodiversity situated in the kenyan lake victoria basin this region has been continuously experiencing extensive vegetation loss and fragmentation of its natural landscapes over the last few decades due to agricultural expansion infrastructural development and increased occurrence of natural hazards such as floods and landslides magige 2014 sirengo et al 2018 onyango opiyo 2022 but data and documentation detailing the nature and extent of these landscape changes are limited estimating the rate nature type and pattern of lulc changes in any landscape as well as understanding factors that influence these changes are fundamental for decision making by policymakers planners and other stakeholders kamwi et al 2015 liping et al 2018 therefore this study aims at quantifying lulc changes and assessing the key drivers contributing to these changes in the migori river watershed between 1980 and 2020 thus the study captured local communities perceptions of lulc change trends and the drivers of these changes in the study area various studies have pointed out that lulc change dynamics observed on any landscape are a reflection of aggregated decisions at the household level in response to policy and an institutional background over a particular period hassen assen 2017 munthali et al 2018 the findings of this study are envisioned to offer a foundation for systematic and effective land use planning management and ecological restoration for socio economic development in the migori river watershed materials and methods description of the study area the migori river watershed fig 1 hereafter referred to as the watershed is located within migori county and covers approximately 2 597 km2 of land area in the western kenya region migori river originates from chepalungu forest in emuria dikiri sub county of narok county from where it flows 70 km through migori county to lake victoria the entire catchment for the migori river is found at an altitude of 1500 m above sea level it enjoys an inland equatorial climate that is heavily influenced by its proximity to lake victoria it receives mean annual rainfall in the range of 700 mm to 1800 mm with two wet seasons and two dry seasons average temperatures in the region range from 13 c to 24 c depending on the seasons the watershed is divided into six agro ecological areas ranging from upper midland 1 3 which covers sections of rongo uriri kuria east and kuria west sub counties to lower midland 1 5 which covers sections of rongo uriri nyatike and suna east sub counties sirengo 2018 this watershed s land use is dominated by extensive agricultural and deforestation practices for charcoal production in the upstream urbanization and agricultural practices especially tobacco cotton maize and sugarcane farming among others in the midstream and mining and urban development activities are rampant in the downstream region because of its arid and semi arid climatic conditions consisting of extensive savanna grasslands geologically the watershed lies within the migori greenstone belt which is a system of archaean rocks containing mineral deposits such as gold copper zinc and galena which are being mined artisanally in the region odumo et al 2011 satellite imagery data acquisition a combination of remote sensing and geographical information system gis is used to assess the trends and patterns of land use and land cover changes in the migori river watershed between 1980 and 2020 at the recommended 10 year intervals alawamy et al 2020 the paper utilizes datasets of multi temporal and spectral satellite imageries of landsat 3 multispectral scanner 1980 landsat 4 5 thematic mapper 1990 2000 and 2010 and operational land satellite thematic infrared sensor 2020 obtained from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer website https www earthexplorer usgs gov the features of these imageries are summarized in table 1 to minimize phonological variations all images selected were for the dry month of december when both the moisture content and cloud coverage in migori county are at their lowest data pre processing after the acquisition the raw satellite images were imported into erdas imagine 2020 version by hexagon geospatial for standard pre processing procedures undertaken before classification to improve their visualization and interpretability first radiometric atmospheric correction was performed to reduce the effects of haze captured on the landsat images following the approach described by lillesand and keifer 2015 in this procedure the metadata of the raw landsat imageries of the five years under investigation was exported into the erdas imagine software which then utilized the information contained in the metadata to automatically correct the datasets eliminating all the atmospheric impurities such as cloud cover that might adversely impact image classification onyango et al 2021 the radiometrically corrected images were then subjected to an image mosaicking procedure whereby images of similar paths but different rows were joined together into one single image so as to retrieve the exact area of the imageries covered by the watershed nguyen et al 2019 due to the vastness of the migori river watershed the entire shape of the watershed could not be captured in a single satellite row hence separate landsat images that hold portions of the watershed had to be joined mosaicked into one single image covering the entire watershed in order to ease processing image sub setting described by samrat et al 2022 was then performed to extract and clip the area of interest i e the migori river watershed from the mosaic using the extent of the migori county in kenya noteworthy satellite images usually cover extensive landscapes that often extend beyond the region required for the project research hence the need for sub setting samrat et al 2022 after sub setting layer stacking was performed in which appropriate bands with exception of the thermal bands were layer stacked combined together to form one single composite image to bring out the true color image of the scene lillesand keifer 2015 finally the images were subjected to pan sharpening to enhance the visualization of panchromatic images usgs 2020 data processing and analysis after successful pre processing and prior to classification the training and validation datasets of different periods used for classification and accuracy assessment respectively were collected from the google earth desktop application as described by doyog et al 2021 google earth is available free of charge and offers very high spatial resolution images with historical and up to date details of the earth s surface midekisa et al 2017 doyog et al 2021 allowing multi temporal analysis of landscape changes over time eggen et al 2016 sidhu et al 2018 next the corrected images were subjected to a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood classification mlc algorithm to define lulc classes munthali et al 2019 previous studies have shown that mlc is the most common successful and widely adopted algorithm for lulc classification ikiel et al 2013 ariti et al 2015 onyango opiyo 2022 eight classes were developed based on ancillary data visual analysis of the locations on google earth pro maps and ground truthing anwar et al 2022 the lulc classes of interest were therefore defined as cultivated land shrub land grasslands forests bare land built up areas water and wetlands table 2 for each class 6 ground truth polygons were sampled randomly and digitized using aerial photographs and visual inspection of the locations on google earth maps in line with jensen 2007 each training sample polygon used in the classification process contained not 50 pixels the training sample polygons which were found with unwanted pixels were thrown out and replaced with the new ones with desired spectral signatures after successful image training with the signature editor the maximum likelihood algorithm was run a couple of times to produce class signatures and classify the imageries into meaningful land use and land cover categories finally the arcgis desktop by esri version 10 2 was used to generate cartographically appropriate lulc maps for the years 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 post processing analysis accuracy assessment was done through the generation of confusion error matrices in which the data from lulc classification are compared to the ground truthing data acquired from fieldwork this study used 160 ground reference points 20 reference points for each lulc class and reference data extracted from google earth images for accuracy assessment the positions of the reference points were automatically identified on the classified images and their class values were defined to determine the accuracy of a pixel the statistical components of the confusion matrix namely producer s accuracy user s accuracy overall accuracy kappa statistics and overall kappa coefficient were calculated for all the classified lulc images based on the algorithms provided in congalton and green 2019 change detection analysis was then carried out using the change matrix tool during this automated process classified lulc data of the initial year under consideration is compared to the one for the final year under consideration once the areal coverages are computed the software produces a change detection matrix that shows the net changes for the respective classes over a given period the data for 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 obtained from the change matrix is expressed in square kilometers and percentages finally the lulc change transition matrix through the overlay technique in arcgis to estimate the area converted from every lulc category to the other over the period between 1980 and 2020 moreover the annual rate of change of each lulc category was computed as percentages using equation 1 proposed by puyravaud 2003 1 r 1 t 2 t 1 i n a 2 a 1 where r is the annual rate of change for each lulc category in percentage and a2 and a1 are areas of each lulc category at the end t2 and the beginning t1 respectively for the period under review household survey sample size and sampling procedure a descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted between january and february 2022 among 318 randomly selected households in the migori river watershed using pre tested interviewer administered semi structured questionnaires the household questionnaires consisted of various questions designed to get information on the perceptions of the local communities on lulc changes and the drivers in the migori river watershed from 1980 to 2020 the questionnaire was initially pretested in 30 households in the awendo sub county which neighbors the watershed and isn t part of the actual survey after which the adjustments were effected before the actual household survey prior to the survey village elders and local administration officials were consulted to explain the purpose of the study understand the local realities which helped in developing questionnaire items and obtain permission to visit the selected households during the exercise the questionnaires were administered to household heads or other senior members of the selected households who had lived in the watershed for at least ten years upon obtaining verbal consent cultural norms dictated that the male be interviewed as the head of the household unless absent then the spouse or adult over 21 years family member who understands the family and area well each interview lasted about 35 min on average characteristics of the sampled households a summary of the socio economic characteristics of the respondents is presented in table 3 the age of the participants ranges from 21 to 83 years with an average of 38 60 approximately 57 80 lived in the watershed throughout the period under review for lulc changes the majority 77 70 is married 70 80 of the households are male headed and 29 20 are female headed household sizes in the watershed range from 1 to 12 persons with an average of 6 10 about 84 30 own land and 15 70 are landless with landholding size ranging from 0 50 to 9 00 acres with an average of 2 91 acres regarding educational attainment 72 10 are literate 23 00 25 50 and 23 60 had attained primary education secondary education and college education respectively with 27 90 having no formal schooling about 80 00 of the surveyed households were involved in crop farming and a small proportion of the participants 20 00 were engaged in various off farm and non farm activities the average household income of the participants was usd 498 72 kshs 57 552 29 per annum agriculture is ranked as an important income source for households in the watershed followed by non farm activities employment in non farm sectors like healthcare education mining and tourism which are ranked second then off farm self employment activities such as processing packaging transport or sale of farm produce and lastly remittances statistical analyses the lulc change analysis was conducted using arcgis desktop by esri version 10 2 and erdas imagine 2020 by hexagon geospatial in a process that combined gis and remote sensing techniques the socio economic survey data was analyzed using the ibm spss statistics for windows version 24 0 in which both descriptive statistics and regression analyses were conducted after obtaining the descriptive statistics ranking the lulc change drivers for the watershed based on the weighted average was computed using the relative importance index rii equation 2 adopted by previous studies musa et al 2006 aziz et al 2016 2 rii r n c 1 r n 1 c 2 r 1 c n a n where rn value of the lowest last rank e g if the lowest last rank is 5 in the likert scale used then rn 5 and rn 1 4 r1 value of the highest first rank in the likert scale used usually 1 cn counts number of observations on lowest last rank c1 counts number of observations on highest first rank a the highest value in the overall ranking scale and n total number of respondents logistic regression analysis is carried out using equation 3 to determine the drivers of lulc changes at the household level in the migori river watershed in this model the independent variables comprised the socio economic attributes whereas the dependent variables are the respondent s perceptions of the driving forces of lulc change the logistic regression analysis at the household level approximated the probability of the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables munthali et al 2019 3 logit y α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β n x n where y dependent variable indicating the likelihood that y 1 α the intercept β1 βnn coefficients of associated independent variables and x1 xn independent variables results and discussion accuracy assessment of the lulc classification the classified imageries have an overall accuracy of over 86 00 table 4 since an overall accuracy of over 80 00 is acceptable and recommended turan günlü 2010 the lulc classification is thus acceptable and hence reliable furthermore the overall kappa coefficient for all the classified images ranged between 0 77 and 0 81 which when compared to the landis and koch 1977 ratings shows that the classification carried out for the study has a strong agreement with the ground truthing reference data the kappa coefficient is a measurement of the precision or agreement between data from classified imageries and data from ground reference locations ikiel et al 2013 although there are small differences in producer and user accuracies of specific lulc categories the classification registered high overall accuracy table 4 these accuracy assessment results provided the basis for subsequent examination of lulc changes lulc change dynamics in migori river watershed from 1980 to 2020 lulc changes have been investigated for the years 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 using three generation landsat time series data considering eight different classes namely cultivated land shrub land grasslands forests bare land built up areas water and wetlands the classified lulc maps for the corresponding years showing the spatial representation of these lulc types are shown in fig 2 overall trend analysis of lulc changes 1980 2020 the proportionate coverage area of each of the eight classes extracted in the watershed from 1980 to 2020 of lulc change trends is summarized in table 5 and fig 3 table 5 indicates that shrub land grassland forests water and wetland shrunk while cultivated land bare land and built up area expanded over the past 40 years in the watershed the cultivated land was the most dominant lulc class in the watershed in 1980 accounting for approximately 51 86 of the total landscape but it has since then increased by about 347 42 km2 8 69 km2 year since the 1980s cultivated land initially fell sharply in 1990 before taking a steady increasing trend over the following decades while the cause of the decline in cultivated land in 1990 is unknown the trend of farmland expansion over the years could be attributed to the high rate of population increase un department of economic and social affairs 2019 which might have increased the demand for food and consequently resulted in the conversion of other natural landscapes like grasslands wetlands and forests and shrub lands into farmlands bare land accounted for 2 of the watershed in 1980 but has since risen by 132 28 0 1 km2 year this is a reflection of the effect of increased unsustainable utilization of grasslands and forests through overgrazing and deforestation this is consistent with the conclusions of hassen and assen 2018 about land use change in the lake tana watershed in ethiopia the built up area constituted 3 of the watershed in 1980 but has since expanded by 461 20 0 6 km2 year this exponential expansion demonstrates the rapid rate of conversion of natural landscapes into settlement areas to accommodate the ever burgeoning population forest cover in the watershed seems to have declined by about 52 90 1 48 km2 year notwithstanding the forest conservation efforts since the 1980s championed by the permanent presidential commission on soil conservation and afforestation this can be attributed to the expansion of rural and urban settlements and farmlands weak enforcement of conservation laws and increased demand for timber as raw materials for construction and fuel wood for household usage although grasslands exhibited an irregular pattern of spatio temporal changes across the five reference periods it has experienced a decline of approximately 84 86 1 48 km2 year over the past 40 years this substantial decline in grasslands is an indication of the increasing demand for agricultural lands and the development of forests in some of the grasslands moreover the irregular pattern of changes observed in grasslands from 1980 to 2020 can be attributed to the destruction by constant incidences of fire outbreaks that usually occur in the area during periods of droughts odeny 2015 or by the droughts themselves oyugi 2016 the entire migori county where the watershed lies is a drought prone region characterized by unreliable rainfalls poorly distributed throughout the year and constantly fluctuating temperatures oyugi 2016 and has been known to be constantly threatened by fire outbreaks following prolonged drought conditions odeny 2015 the frequent destruction of grasslands by both fire or drought incidences and the successive regenerations contributes to the irregular pattern of spatio temporal changes over time similar to grasslands the patterns of spatio temporal changes in shrub lands showed that it has declined by 40 63 5 90 km2 year over the four decade period which was largely attributed to the conversion to cultivated lands and settlements due to population pressure since 1980 water declined by 82 03 0 98 km2 year while the wetlands shrunk by 38 44 0 1 km2 year this declining trend in areas under water and wetlands could be attributed to the emergence and growth of aquatic vegetation and invasive species in these areas frequent occurrence of droughts in the area magige 2014 and probably the depletion of water through domestic usage canal irrigation and livestock watering further the decline suggests the existence of unsustainable land management practices like the reclamation of these lands to create spaces for agriculture and settlement coupled with mining in the area decadal trend analysis of lulc changes a decade by decade analysis of the rates of change in lulc between 1980 and 2020 in the watershed revealed specific net changes in the form of gains and losses for each class during the 1st period 1980 1990 2nd period 1990 2000 3rd period 2000 2010 and 4th period 2010 2020 as shown in table 6 and fig 4 i the pattern of lulc changes between 1980 and 1990 from 1980 to 1990 the watershed experienced considerable positive and negative transformations in the lulc coverage table 6 and fig 4 spatial analysis indicated that cultivated land was the dominant lulc in the watershed in 1980 covering around 1014 36 km2 51 86 of the entire land area table 5 however it decreased to 766 54 km2 39 19 in 1990 table 5 resulting in a net loss in coverage of about 24 43 over that decade table 6 shrub lands water and wetlands also showed negative trends during this decade with net losses of 15 86 56 11 and 69 27 from their original coverage respectively table 6 on the contrary the remaining lulc categories experienced positive trends from 1980 to 1990 i e there is an increase in grasslands by 201 03 forests by 63 71 bare land by 252 00 and built up area by 18 40 these findings imply that during this era the land areas under cultivation shrubs water and wetlands shrunk because they became bare got covered by grasslands and forests or were converted to settlements for the growing population this phenomenon could be attributed to a government policy by the new government in the early 1980s which established the permanent presidential commission on soil conservation and afforestation ppcsca in 1981 to champion environmental conservation efforts in the entire country nasong o 2012 this policy instituted protective and preservation measures for natural forests and grasslands with farmlands inside forested areas being reclaimed by the government leading to the encroachment of wetlands and shrub lands due to increased demand for new farmlands and settlement areas nasong o 2012 ii the pattern of lulc changes between 1990 and 2000 in this decade the lulc categories of cultivated land water and wetlands which had recorded net losses during the previous decade showed substantial gains in their land coverage whereas those of grasslands forests and bare land which had registered substantial net gains recorded net losses table 6 cultivated land increased by 85 40 the water rose by 5 43 and wetlands grew twofold 202 20 conversely grasslands were reduced by 73 98 forests by 58 76 and bare land by 32 07 during the same period shrub land continued to show a negative trend with a 58 38 net loss while built up lands continued to experience a positive trend with a net gain of 51 23 these environmental transformations could generally be attributed to the high rate of population growth observed in kenya from the late 1980s towards the new millennium which was estimated to be between 3 20 and 3 60 per annum un department of economic and social affairs 2019 during the same period the population growth rate of the entire lake victoria basin under which the watershed is located was touted to be among the highest in the country at 2 85 per year rakama et al 2017 this massive population growth might have led to the conversion of bare lands to settlement areas or farms and the destruction of forests and grasslands in the quest for new croplands or settlement areas raw materials for construction works and fuel wood for domestic consumption iii the pattern of lulc changes between 2000 and 2010 fig 4 and table 6 reveal that five of the lulc categories recorded net losses with two recording net gains forests bare land water wetland and built up registered net losses of 17 00 42 63 22 21 40 20 and 15 87 respectively whereas shrub land and grassland grew by 14 91 and 48 17 respectively unlike the previous decades cultivated land remained relatively constant during this decade 2000 2010 only rising by 1 69 generally the transformations suggest that during this period grasslands and shrub lands expanded largely at the expense of other natural landscapes forests bare land water and wetlands due to the existence of unsustainable land management practices the built up area lost a small portion as cultivated lands saw little change in their coverage which indicates no acquisition of new lands for settlement or farming these occurrences could be attributed to the coming to power of a new regime that oversaw policies that not only spurred strong economic development and created employment opportunities in urban areas of the country but also enacted new conservation laws and policies like the environmental management and coordination act of 1999 and forest act of 2005 that may have impacted land management approaches causing an uncoordinated transition from old practices iv the pattern of lulc changes between 2010 and 2020 between 2010 and 2020 grasslands declined by 86 95 forests by 17 91 and water by 50 09 unlike other categories that increased shrub land by 47 56 bare land by 69 15 built up area by 272 55 and wetlands by 10 67 with cultivated land remaining fairly constant table 6 the substantial expansion of bare lands and shrub lands is a reflection of the effect of unsustainable utilization of grasslands and forests through overgrazing and deforestation respectively moreover the substantial increment of the built up areas reflects the high rate of conversion of natural landscapes like forests and grasslands into settlement areas for the burgeoning population of the four epochs this period stands out as the one in which the environment of the watershed suffered considerable negative transformation land use and land cover change matrix table 7 present the cross tabulation change matrix illustrating how the coverages of various lulc classes have changed over time from one class to another from 1980 to 2020 conversions of one lulc to the other occurred across the entire watershed results show that during the period between 1980 and 2020 81 41 of built up areas 12 61 km2 74 34 of cultivated land 756 84 km2 56 26 of water 26 93 km2 22 59 of bare land 10 40 km2 20 33 of shrub lands 118 09 km2 15 96 of forests 29 08 km2 4 08 of grasslands 2 84 km2 and 0 60 of wetlands 0 06 km2 remained unchanged this demonstrates that while the original areas of built up lands cultivated lands and water remained largely unchanged the rest of the lulc categories experienced high conversion with over 80 of their total land areas converted to other lulc classes a large portion of cultivated land was converted to shrub land 15 30 whereas a large proportion of bare land became cultivated land 58 36 also the majority of shrub lands turned into cultivated land 66 12 whilst major sections covered by grasslands became either cultivated land 68 59 or shrub land 18 12 forests lost a large part of their coverage to cultivated land 54 95 as water and wetland lost large chunks to shrub land 18 70 and cultivated land 66 20 respectively although the original built up areas remained largely unchanged 18 16 km2 and 6 69 km2 were gained from cultivated land and shrub land respectively watershed community perceptions on trends and drivers of lulc changes local community perceptions concerning the trends of lulc changes and distances to infrastructure survey participants perceptions of lulc trends in the migori river watershed are presented in fig 5 the study observed significant differences p 0 05 among the surveyed households in perceptions concerning the trends of lulc changes and proximity to various infrastructures like commercial centers and markets educational centers health facilities and roads the study participants perceived that farmlands have significantly expanded p 0 05 in the watershed while forests and vegetation cover have significantly declined p 0 05 over the years under review a confirmation of the observed lulc trends interpreted from remotely sensed data in the period of 1980 2020 about 60 50 and 75 80 of watershed communities accurately perceived that farmlands and forests had expanded and shrunk respectively fig 5 this is consistent with the fact that 80 00 of the households in the watershed are involved in crop farming and that agriculture is considered the most important source of income for the watershed community table 3 farming of crops like tobacco cotton maize and sugarcane is widely practiced in the watershed and this expands farmlands while reducing forest cover through the clearing of vegetation nearly two thirds of the households 65 20 perceived that the distance to natural water sources didn t change from 1980 to 2020 also the distances to infrastructures like health facilities and major roads largely remained unchanged over the same period on the other hand distances to commercial centers and markets portable drinking water and education centers were perceived to have significantly decreased over the same period p 0 05 these results are consistent with the findings of munthali et al 2019 in the dedza watershed of malawi and they show that the accelerated urban development observed in the spatial analysis prioritized the expansion of residential areas for commercial settlement and academic purposes at the expense of health centers and road networks this perceived expansion of infrastructure in the study area confirms the observed built up area trends in the period of 1980 2020 interpreted from remotely sensed data in general the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development moreover the usage of older respondents 21 years of which half had lived in the watershed throughout the period under review for lulc changes yielded an accurate historical account of lulc changes in the watershed corroborating the observed lulc trends interpreted from remotely sensed data in the period of 1980 2020 this local attention to lulc changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed combining lulc maps with local perceptions of lulc changes enables enhanced interpretation of the land use information which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision making ranked drivers of land use and land cover changes in the watershed the survey identified 11 major proximate direct drivers of lulc change in the watershed table 8 these are factors linked to human undertakings that directly transform the land cover lambin meyfroidt 2011 fuel wood collection timber poles production shifting cultivation agricultural expansion and charcoal production were the top five ranked proximate causes of lulc changes in the watershed with fuel wood collection and timber poles production ranking first and second respectively other notable factors included settlements and artisanal mining the results of this study resonate with other similar studies in the developing world where anthropogenic activities were reported as the contributory factors for lulc changes for instance munthali et al 2019 study identified firewood collection charcoal production settlement construction and agricultural expansion as the four major proximate drivers of lulc changes in the dedza watershed in malawi a study by kleemann et al 2017 identified agricultural intensification and extensification livestock production fuel wood utilization mining and bushfire as the top proximate drivers of lulc trends in the upper eastern region of ghana in indonesia juniyanti et al 2021 show that direct causes of lulc in most watersheds in the country include the expansion of agricultural areas wood extraction for fuel and timber production however the study found that shifting cultivation is not a dominant direct cause guarderas et al 2022 study in ecuador shows that the major pressure on watershed ecosystems in northern ecuador is the continued expansion upwards of the agricultural livestock frontier and deforestation however contrary to our findings it also ranked unplanned urbanization expansion and natural reforestation as one of the most important lulc drivers concerning the underlying indirect drivers that is the forces that indirectly trigger the proximate causes geist lambin 2002 the survey participants perceived population growth and poverty as the two main drivers of lulc change in the watershed followed by limited access to alternative sources of energy demand for timber and lack of law enforcement table 9 this essentially means that the top five proximate causes of lulc changes in the watershed i e fuel wood collection timber poles production shifting cultivation agricultural expansion and charcoal production are triggered by population pressure and high poverty levels this is consistent with similar studies conducted in the developing world for instance in sub saharan africa population growth and high poverty levels have been reported to be the main contributory factors for lulc changes in natural ecosystems in the zambezi region of namibia kamwi et al 2015 dedza watershed in malawi munthali et al 2019 rangelands in the afar region of ethiopia mekuyie et al 2018 pugu and kazimzumbwi forest reserves in tanzania mdemu et al 2012 the same trend has also been observed in the destruction of natural ecosystems in the highlands of northern ecuador guarderas et al 2022 and the deforestation of deciduous and mangrove forests in bangladesh reza hasan 2019 contrary to our study and the mentioned studies a study by juniyanti et al 2021 found that the institutional political driver is by far the leading underlying cause of lulc in various ecosystems in indonesia as opposed to population growth or high poverty levels in the survey approximately 95 agreed that the population of the area has increased over the period under review which corroborated with population data that indicate that the population of the migori county where the watershed is situated has grown by 180 between 1980 and 2019 knbs 2019 earlier studies in the larger lake victoria basin the region which encompasses the migori river watershed had also identified population pressure as one of the drivers of landscape alterations odada et al 2009 onyango et al 2021 indirectly population growth in the watershed leads to lulc changes by causing increased local demand for food which drives agriculture expansion increased timber and energy fuel wood and charcoal consumption which drives deforestation and increased demand for settlement and associated amenities which drives deforestation to create space for housing units and infrastructure development in terms of residential commercial health transport and educational facilities kamwi et al 2015 reza hasan 2019 munthali et al 2019 poverty is pervasive in the kenyan lake victoria basin in which the migori river watershed occurs as most households live below the poverty line onyango opiyo 2021 evidence of the widespread poverty in the watershed was observed in the survey results which revealed that the average household daily income in the watershed is 2 usd table 3 this low level of income obtained majorly from agricultural activities is what the watershed household heads rely on to sustain and support an average family of 6 persons table 3 a household size that is beyond the 4 members national average knbs 2019 poverty in the watershed is exacerbated by the landlessness of some households who are unable to engage in the most important source of income in the study area agriculture table 3 also noteworthy is that the low level of participation in non farm and off farm activities table 3 also contributes to the high poverty levels in the watershed as it exposes them to livelihood vulnerabilities associated with overreliance on climate sensitive rainfed agriculture due to the high poverty levels about 93 of the watershed households use three stone open fire for cooking table 3 resulting in increased utilization of fuel wood which not only causes indoor air pollution but also accelerates deforestation an association between poverty and the usage of three stone open fire has been established in the western kenya region by njenga et al 2017 also poverty has made watershed communities to be involved in charcoal burning as a source of income they seem to burn the charcoal and sell it in urban areas rather than use it in their households the over dependence of rural communities on fuel wood and urban dwellers on charcoal has been widely documented in kenya by previous studies kituyi 2004 njenga et al 2017 timber pole production was identified as one of the drivers because it is used by the rural communities for constructing settlements for the ever burgeoning population the high utilization of fuel wood charcoal and timber poles for construction in this region explains the decline in forest cover between 1980 and 2020 overall the findings imply that the watershed community derives its income from shifting cultivation and the extraction and sale of forest products like poles lumber firewood and charcoal and that they are also driven to clear forested areas for additional farmlands or settlement areas to accommodate the growing population although weak government policies regarding natural resources conservation didn t come out strongly among the top underlying drivers of lulc changes in the watershed identified by the survey weak law enforcement did which implies that appropriate government policies are in place but their enforcement is weak and ineffective and therefore may not curtail unsustainable land management practices the various protected areas such as forest blocks wetlands cultural sites and water sources in the watershed are governed by various government policies developed over the years such as the environmental management and conservation act 1999 which mandates environmental management with the goal of attaining sustainable land based natural resources like forests wetlands and water catchment landscapes forest conservation and management act 2016 which provides for the establishment protection conservation and sustainable utilization and management of forests and forest resources for maintenance and conservation of water catchment areas water act 2016 which tackles the utilization of water resources to meet human and animal needs the sustainable management protection of watershed ecosystems and land act 2012 which emphasizes sustainable conservation management and protection of land resources including critical biodiversity forests and fragile ecosystems and wildlife conservation and management act 2013 provides for the sustainable protection conservation and management of water catchment areas including forests and wetlands existing within the game parks reserves and protected areas these government policies generally prohibit logging for timber or deforestation for fuel wood collection settlement or agricultural expansion within these protected areas the government has been lax in providing the enforcement required to curtail such practices from continuing in the watershed which may be due to the recognition of the high poverty levels experienced by the rapidly growing population therefore law enforcement continues to be an important trigger for these anthropogenic induced causes of lulc changes household level logistic regression of perceived drivers of land use and land cover changes logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the drivers of lulc changes at the household level in the migori river watershed table 10 according to munthali et al 2019 the logistic regression analysis of lulc drivers at the household level approximates the probability of the effects of the respondents socio economic attributes independent variables on the respondent s perceptions of the driving forces of lulc change dependent variables regression analysis table 10 showed that education attainment level significantly and negatively impacted at p 0 05 the perceptions of watershed households on timber poles production agricultural expansion and poverty as drivers of lulc change this finding is consistent with the conclusions reached by munthali et al 2019 and anwar et al 2022 studies which both generally showed that among main socio economic determinants the education level of rural communities has a significant influence on their perceptions of lulc change and its drivers this implies that education can be used to bring behavior change among rural communities in terms of their interaction and utilization of natural resources onyango opiyo 2021 the results also revealed that the landholding size educational level and duration of residency in the watershed significantly influenced the perceptions of the watershed community concerning fuel wood collection timber poles production population growth and poverty table 10 shifting cultivation was not significantly influenced by any of the determinants the age of household heads significantly influenced their perceptions of fuel wood collection population growth and poverty conclusions and recommendations the study established that the major land use in the watershed during the period under review is cultivated land with an average of 61 44 overall coverage of the total land area during the entire period hence the livelihoods of the watershed inhabitants have been historically agriculture dependent the decline in shrub lands by 40 63 grasslands by 84 86 forests by 52 90 water by 82 03 and wetlands by 38 44 coupled with increased cultivated land by 34 25 bare land by 132 28 and built up areas by 461 20 over the period under review indicate that the natural landscapes in the watershed are undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments fuel wood collection timber pole production shifting cultivation agricultural expansion charcoal production population pressure and high poverty level are the topmost drivers perceived by the watershed communities to be contributing to the land use and land cover changes in the watershed since all these identified drivers are still active in the watershed the natural landscapes are likely to decline further with negative implications on watershed ecosystem services biodiversity and community livelihoods generally the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development this local attention to land use and land cover changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed integration of spatial lulc analysis with local perceptions of lulc changes enables enhanced interpretation of the land use information which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision making the paper recommends land use zoning on the watershed area to demarcate land areas into settlement areas conservation and protected areas and agricultural lands as well as regulate physical development and use of fragile conservation areas like forests wetlands and water sources efforts should be directed towards the adoption of alternative cooking energy types by watershed households to reduce the overall demand for fuel wood and consequently ease pressure on forests the government should also harmonize the existing conservation policies to align them with the interests and priorities of the local watershed communities to balance competing goals for effective management and conservation of the watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

20071,an analytical protocol was developed to quantify six category pharmaceuticals in surface water under paralleling phs using a combination of solid phase extraction spe and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms of 121 compound standards commercially 94 compounds were reliably quantified using a paralleling ph combination at 3 and 9 with a sound recovery rate of 50 150 the quantified compounds covered 6 categories as 37 antibiotics 16 central nervous system drugs cns 14 cardiovascular drugs cvs 12 endocrine and family planning drugs efs 8 antiparasitic

pharmaceutical categories were detected in tidal surface sediments of min river ou river and jiulong river in southeastern china chen et al 2013 it is necessary to focus on the occurrence of multi category pharmaceuticals in the environment in order to assess their potential environmental impacts nowadays not only antibiotics and hormones but various kinds of pharmaceuticals such as non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs central nervous system drugs cardiovascular drugs and antiparasitic drugs were also detected in the aquatic environment especially surface water alder et al 2010

focus on pharmaceutical residuals spectrum and their environmental risks in surface water it is therefore essential to develop a sensitive and reliable analytical method to simultaneously determine multi category pharmaceuticals and screen the priority pharmaceuticals in environmental waters presently solid phase extraction of a large volume sample followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry is an advanced analytical technique being able to simultaneously quantify multi category pharmaceuticals in environmental samples with high selectivity and sensitivity high

solutions before the experiment 2 2 sample collection for validation surface water samples for the protocol validation were collected at the confluence of each functional subwatershed of jiulong river in the wet season august 2016 with three samples along the stream crossing section two liters of surface water were collected at 30 cm below water surface at each sampling point and added with methanol 5 v v to inhibit microbial activities the collected water samples were transported back to laboratory in an iced coller and stored in a dark fridge at 4 oc and processed within 24 hours jiulong river the second longest river in fujian province southeast china is composed of three major tributaries north stream west stream and south stream and a lot of small tributaries with 258 km of river length playing a key role in the region s economic growth and ecological environment besides the three major tributary subwatersheds 20 functional subwatersheds were selected in this study according to an urban land use percentage gradient from 0 1 26 3 of the subwatershed area hong et al 2018 livestock breeding industry is one of the main economic activities in the jiulong river watershed resulting in the incredible number and intensity of pharmaceutical residues in jiulong river chen et al 2013 jiang et al 2013 thus pharmaceutical contamination and its spectrum should be strongly considered here 2 3 extraction and optimization the collected surface water samples were filtered through 0 7 μm gf f to remove suspended particles and then the filtrates were extracted by spe with oasis hlb cartridges the spe method was evaluated by testing water ph values from 2 to 10 and the additions of na2edta 0 g 0 05 g and 0 2 g the optimized pretreatment procedure was described as followed two liters of filtered surface water samples were divided into two aliquots adjusted to ph 3 using 4 mol l 1 h2so4 for group i and ph 9 using 2 mol l 1 nh4oh for group ii respectively and both spiked with 0 2 g na2edta and 100 ng of sixteen internal standards oasis hlb cartridges for spe were preconditioned with 10 ml of methanol followed by 10 ml of ultrapure water then the internal standards spiked filtrates were passed through the spe cartridges at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min 1 after loading the sample bottle was rinsed twice with two aliquots of 50 ml of 5 v v methanol in ultrapure water which also passed through the cartridges then the loaded cartridges were rinsed with 10 ml of ultrapure water and allowed to dry for 2 h to remove excess water under vacuum the target pharmaceutical compounds were eluted from the cartridges using 12 ml of methanol and the extracts were evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of pure n2 gas and re dissolved in 1 ml of methanol ultrapure water v v 1 1 after filtration through a 0 2 μm syringe driven filter the final extract was stored in a freezer at 18 c until hplc ms ms analysis recoveries were determined for surface water matrix at target compound concentrations of 10 ng l 1 and 100 ng l 1 respectively 2 4 instrumental measurement the final extracts were analyzed by a shimadzu liquid chromatography lc coupled with an abi 6500 triple quadruple tandem mass spectrometry ms ms ab sciex usa chromatographic separation was performed using a kinetex c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm 2 6 µm guangzhou flm scientific instrument co ltd china lc and ms parameters were summarized in table 2 all analytes were identified and quantified by multiple reaction monitoring mrm in the positive and negative electrospray ionization esi modes the declustering potentials dp entrance potentials ep collision energies ce and collision cell exit potentials cxp were optimized and two precursor ion product ion transition pairs were used for all analytes table 3 the typical reconstructed hplc ms ms chromatograms for the target pharmaceutical compounds in the positive and negative esi modes in the standard solution at 100 ng l 1 were presented in fig 1 2 5 data analysis identification of the analytes was performed by comparing the retention times within 2 and the ratios within 20 of the two selected precursor ion product ion transition pairs with those of the standards quantification of the target compounds was performed by calculating the response of quantitative ion based on the internal standard method and their concentrations were determined using linear regression analysis of the peak area this six point calibration curve r2 0 99 covered the range 30 300 µg l 1 of the standard solution laboratory blanks were also analyzed along with the samples to assess potential background contamination recovery experiments were done by spiking the standard solutions to surface water samples data acquisition was performed under analyst software 1 6 3 a two sample paired t test was performed to determine the difference of residual concentrations of the overlapped pharmaceuticals in surface water of the wet season under the combined spe conditions at a significant level of p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted using sas 9 2 for windows sas institute inc cary usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of hplc ms ms 3 1 1 mass spectrometry for the mass spectrometric parameter optimization a standard solution 1 mg l 1 of each analyte and their corresponding internal standards were prepared in methanol ultrapure water v v 1 1 and directly infused into the ms ms system by a syringe pump the precursor ion of each analyte was selected by recording chromatograms in full scan mode and then the single protonated or deprotonated molecule mass was chosen as precursor ion mass with the optimal declustering potential and entrance potential after optimizing collision energies and collision cell exit potentials two multiple reaction monitoring ion pairs were monitored between the precursor ion and the most abundant product ions for each compound with the first transition used for quantification and the second one for identification purposes table 3 for the target 121 pharmaceuticals in this study 101 and 18 pharmaceutical compounds showed higher responses in the positive and negative electrospray ionization modes respectively while polymyxin b pmb and colistin pme detected with complex and poor fragmentation patterns were excluded table 3 in general the protonated m h and deprotonated m h molecules were chosen for precursor ion for positive and negative ionizations respectively while m 2h represented the positive mode of lorazepam lzp and m 2h represented the negative mode of niclosamide ncs and chloramphenicols cps i e chloramphenicol cpc thiamphenicol tpc and florfenicol ffc together with their internal standard chloramphenicol d5 d5 cpc detailed analytical parameters of the selected compounds were shown in table 3 ionization parameters were optimized as shown in table 2 ionspray voltages were 5 5 kv and 4 5 kv for positive and negative electrospray ionization modes respectively ion source temperature was 650 c air was used as nebulizer 50 psi and drying gas 60 psi while n2 gas was used for curtain 25 psi and collision 9 psi data were acquired using analyst 1 6 3 3 1 2 chromatographic separation considering the ionization competition between co eluting polar and non retained matrix components in a chromatographic system matrix suppression or enhancement effects were ubiquitous during lc ms ms analysis with esi mode which were depended on the mobile phase and sample matrix huang et al 2013 sun et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 in the present study two organic solvents solvent b methanol and acetonitrile and different aqueous phases solvent a non buffer ultrapure water and buffers such as ammonia acetate and formic acid with different ratios were conducted to optimize the chromatographic separation and sensitivity of the studied analytes in both the positive and negative electrospray ionization modes the optimal operating conditions were achieved using a mixture of 0 1 formic acid and 2 mmol l 1 ammonia acetate in ultrapure water solvent a and methanol solvent b since they provided better chromatographic resolution peak shape and sensitivity for the target pharmaceuticals table 2 and fig 1 which were similar to those used for 11 compounds of human and veterinary antibiotics zhou et al 2012 28 steroids compounds liu et al 2011 33 compounds of pharmaceuticals and personal care products with emphasis on anthelmintics and their metabolites sim et al 2013 and 23 compounds of 51 pharmaceuticals and personal care products sun et al 2014 furthermore the gradient elution procedure and flow rate were optimized to improve chromatographic resolution and simultaneously to reduce total analysis time as shown in table 2 the optimal gradient elution program of lc was initiated by maintaining the solvent a with 15 the solvent b for 1 min and then gradually increased to 30 solvent b in 2 min to 40 in 5 min to 50 in 10 min to 70 in 14 min to 100 in 16 min and maintained for 4 min and finally back to the initial condition in 20 min and maintained for 5 min the optimum overall flow rate was maintained at 0 30 ml min 1 finally hplc ms ms chromatograms for 101 pharmaceutical compounds under the positive mode and 18 compounds under the negative mode and their internal standards in standard solution at the concentration each of 100 ng l 1 under the optimized conditions were presented in fig 1 respectively successful separation of each analyte was achieved under the selective hplc ms ms detection 3 2 solid phase extraction optimization solid phase extraction spe was the most common method for extracting pharmaceuticals from water samples after the removal of particles by filtration englert 2007 hong et al 2018 liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 considering the diverse physicochemical properties of the target pharmaceuticals in this study table 1 sample enrichment and cleanup by spe required careful selections of spe cartridges and conditions previous studies suggested that hydrophilic lipophilic balance cartridges hlb could be successfully applied to the analysis of a variety of chemicals such as antibiotics huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 steroids liu et al 2011 pharmaceuticals and personal care products englert 2007 klosterhaus et al 2013 therefore hlb cartridge was chosen for the enrichment and cleanup of the studied compounds in water samples without testing different types of spe cartridges the spe conditions were optimized for sample ph and the addition of na2edta which were the key factors influencing extraction recovery of the target pharmaceuticals in water samples englert 2007 zhou et al 2012 preliminary studies were conducted by spiking the standard solutions of 100 ng l 1 to 1 l ultrapure water to evaluate the performance of sample ph from 2 to 10 regardless of chelating effects of metal cations in water samples results showed that there were 72 73 70 73 83 75 71 64 and 56 compounds having recoveries in a range of 50 150 when ph integrally ranged from 2 to 10 respectively fig 2 most β lactams βls e g amoxicillin amc ampicillin apc cephalexin cpl and cefradine cfd had low and even no recoveries in the spiked samples regardless of ph due to their instability and easy degradation in aqueous solution thiele bruhn 2003 macrolides mls had low recoveries 50 in the spiked samples with ph ranging from 2 to 5 that was because mls were basic antibiotics and should be extracted under neutral and basic conditions mcardell et al 2003 while tetracyclines tcs only had high recoveries in the spiked samples of ph 2 and ph 3 which were relatively stable in acidic solution and easily degraded in basic solution halling sørensen et al 2002 additionally sulfaguanidine sgd bacitracin btc captopril ctp and chorionic gonadotrophin cgt had no recoveries in all the spiked samples might be due to their instability in aqueous solution anaizi and swenson 1993 gaugain et al 2013 lempiäinen et al 2012 tsuji et al 1974 while the low recoveries of metronidazole mnz and gabapentin gpt were resulted from low water solubility kriel et al 1997 mahfouz and hassan 2001 therefore given the wide range of pka diverse physicochemical properties of the target pharmaceuticals and ph of natural waters ph values of 3 6 and 9 were optimal to provide wider coverage and better recoveries secondly the optimization of na2edta addition 0 g 0 05 g and 0 2 g was performed on the basis of the optimized ph values 3 6 and 9 by spiking the standard solutions of 100 ng l 1 to 1 l filtered surface water of bantou river watershed xiamen china as shown in table 4 there were 60 71 76 69 69 74 62 71 and 78 compounds having recoveries in the range of 50 150 under the combined conditions of ph 3 6 and 9 and the additions of na2edta 0 g 0 05 g and 0 2 g respectively tcs and fluoroquinolones fqs recoveries were severely affected by matrix effects due to high binding with metal cations halling sørensen et al 2002 huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 therefore na2edta was necessary to be added before spe to chelate metal cations and make tcs and fqs free in our study the numbers of the target pharmaceutical compounds with recovery at 50 150 and 80 120 generally increased after the addition of na2edta respectively table 4 tcs recoveries increased with increasing na2edta addition from 0 5 g to 1 g shao et al 2009 considering that several pharmaceutical compounds could only be efficiently extracted under the special spe conditions such as nsaids acidic atenolol atl basic tcs na2edta addition and fqs basic and na2edta addition the combination of different spe conditions was essential to simultaneously determine more pharmaceutical compounds in water samples thus we found that the optimum numbers of the quantified pharmaceuticals were acquired under the spe conditions combining ph 3 and 0 2 g na2edta and ph 9 and 0 2 g na2edta up to 94 and 73 compounds with the recoveries of 50 150 and 80 120 respectively table 4 the spe condition of ph 3 and 0 2 g na2edta was also successfully applied to simultaneous determination of 11 compounds of human and veterinary antibiotics in various water samples surface water lagoon wastewater influent and effluent of waste water treatment plants zhou et al 2012 additionally it was worth noting that 32 pharmaceutical compounds fit both two spe conditions and could be served for self validation table 5 briefly the recoveries of 76 and 78 compounds fell in the acceptable range of 50 150 at ph 3 and ph 9 with the addition of 0 2 g na2edta respectively it summed up 94 compounds with recovery in the range of 50 150 under the combined spe conditions i e ph 3 0 2g na2edta and ph 9 0 2g na2edta 3 3 quantification and method validation for lc ms ms quantification the internal standard method with isotope labeled analog was desirable to compensate for matrix effect and potential experimental errors in the analysis of trace organic contaminants huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 in the present study a total of 16 internal isotope labeled standards were selected and shown in table 5 the quality assurance and quality control qa qc were strictly conducted for the analytical procedures a solvent blank a procedural blank and standards were successively run for each sample batch to check background pollution and instrument performance a six point calibration curve 30 300 μg l 1 was conducted for each selected pharmaceutical compound linearity was confirmed by square of correlation coefficient r2 achieving above 0 99 for all selected compounds using the optimized extraction and instrumental methods 94 out of 121 pharmaceutical compounds had the recoveries ranging from 52 to 137 at 10 ng l 1 spiking and from 51 to 147 at 100 ng l 1 spiking with relative standard deviations rsd less than 23 table 5 the limit of detection lod was determined as the lowest concentration resulting in a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 while limit of quantitation loq was calculated as the lowest concentration with the s n ratio of 10 ranges of lod and loq of the available 94 pharmaceutical compounds in surface water were from 0 001 to 11 9 ng l 1 and from 0 003 to 39 7 ng l 1 respectively table 5 3 4 matrix effects matrix effect commonly occurred in lc ms ms analysis with esi mode resulting in signal suppression or enhancement of analyte responses by co extracted matrix components huang et al 2013 liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 in this study matrix effects were calculated by spiking standard solutions 100 ng l 1 into surface water samples and comparing the obtained concentration in matrix to that in solvent and the values less or greater than 100 indicated signal suppression or enhancement respectively the results in table 5 showed that matrix components in surface water had no or only slight matrix effects on the target pharmaceutical compounds due to the fact that the results were automatically corrected by their isotope labeled internal standards however obvious signal enhancement was observed for three βls in spiked surface water 297 501 one mls i e

effect of complex co extracted components the optimized method in this study provided acceptable recoveries for 94 pharmaceutical compounds table 5 for simultaneous determination of six category pharmaceutical residues in environmental waters 3 5 protocol validation the developed protocol was applied to determine pharmaceutical residues in surface water of jiulong river in the wet season august 2016 as shown in table 6 41 out of 94 compounds from six category pharmaceuticals consisting 24 of 37 antibiotics 6 of 16 cns 4 of 7 nsaids 4 of 8 aps 2 of 14 cvs and 1 of 12 efs were quantified in surface water and their residual concentrations ranged from below the detection limits to 1 389 ng l 1 comparable or lower than those in other watersheds of china and elsewhere bu et al 2013 kolpin et al 2002 li et al 2018 luo et al 2011 as a biomarker for anthropogenic input into the aquatic environment kolpin et al 2002 wu et al 2014 caffeine caf was detected at the highest concentration in surface water of the subwatershed n 15 table 6 which might be due to the highest urban land use percentage 26 3 an indicator of anthropogenic activities it could be confirmed in our previous study that urban land use in jiulong river watershed was identified as the main factor influencing concentrations and compositions of 33 pharmaceutical residues regardless of season hong et al 2018 additionally except for mebendazole mbz residual concentrations of 12 overlapped pharmaceuticals under the combined spe conditions in surface water had no significant differences p 0 05 table 6 indicating that this optimized protocol for simultaneous quantification of multi category pharmaceutical compounds was practicable 4 conclusion a sensitive and reliable analytical protocol on the basis of spe and hplc ms ms was soundly developed for the simultaneous analysis of six category pharmaceutical residues in surface water the analytical protocol integrates spe with hlb cartridges for water samples and showed low lods at sub ng l 1 sound recovery 51 147 and no significant matrix effects for 94 compounds under the combined spe conditions it provided a robust tool to screen multi

20071,an analytical protocol was developed to quantify six category pharmaceuticals in surface water under paralleling phs using a combination of solid phase extraction spe and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms of 121 compound standards commercially 94 compounds were reliably quantified using a paralleling ph combination at 3 and 9 with a sound recovery rate

antiepileptics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs blood lipid regulators antihistamines β blockers anti ulcer agents anti asthma drugs and steroidal hormones etc patel et al 2019 taylor and senac 2014 which have been developed for widely uses as human and veterinary medicines and as growth promoters in bee keeping livestock and aquaculture productions and led to increasing productions kümmerer 2009 liu and wong 2013 after consumption large amounts of pharmaceutical residuals were excreted in the parent or metabolite forms giger et al 2003 directly or indirectly into the receiving aquatic

pharmaceutical categories were detected in tidal surface sediments of min river ou river and jiulong river in southeastern china chen et al 2013 it is necessary to focus on the occurrence of multi category pharmaceuticals in the environment in order to assess their potential environmental impacts nowadays not only antibiotics and hormones but various kinds of pharmaceuticals such as non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs central nervous system drugs cardiovascular drugs and antiparasitic drugs were also detected in the aquatic environment especially surface water alder et al 2010 arlos et al 2015 aus der beek et al 2016 bu et al 2013 hong et al 2020 li et al 2018 liu et al 2011 sim et al 2013 posing potential risks to ecosystem and human health kemper 2008 su et al 2017

focus on pharmaceutical residuals spectrum and their environmental risks in surface water it is therefore essential to develop a sensitive and reliable analytical method to simultaneously determine multi category pharmaceuticals and screen the priority pharmaceuticals in environmental waters presently solid phase extraction of a large volume sample followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry is an advanced analytical technique being able to simultaneously quantify multi category pharmaceuticals in environmental samples with high selectivity and sensitivity high

dissolved in methanol or acetonitrile or their combination with ultrapure water and stored in a freezer at 18 c and working solutions were prepared immediately by gradient dilution of the stock solutions before the experiment 2 2 sample collection for validation surface water samples for the protocol validation were collected at the confluence of each functional subwatershed of jiulong river in the wet season august 2016 with three samples along the stream crossing section two liters of surface water were collected at 30 cm below water surface at each sampling point and added with methanol 5 v v to inhibit microbial activities the collected water samples were transported back to laboratory in an iced coller and stored in a dark fridge at 4 oc and processed within 24 hours jiulong river the second longest river in fujian province southeast china is composed of three major tributaries north stream west stream and south stream and a lot of small tributaries with 258 km of river length playing a key role in the region s economic growth and ecological environment besides the three major tributary subwatersheds 20 functional subwatersheds were selected in this study according to an urban land use percentage gradient from 0 1 26 3 of the subwatershed area hong et al 2018 livestock breeding industry is one of the main economic activities in the jiulong river watershed resulting in the incredible number and intensity of pharmaceutical residues in jiulong river chen et al 2013 jiang et al 2013 thus pharmaceutical contamination and its spectrum should be strongly considered here 2 3 extraction and optimization the collected surface water samples were filtered through 0 7 μm gf f to remove suspended particles and then the filtrates were extracted by

ultrapure water which also passed through the cartridges then the loaded cartridges were rinsed with 10 ml of ultrapure water and allowed to dry for 2 h to remove excess water under vacuum the target pharmaceutical compounds were eluted from the cartridges using 12 ml of methanol and the extracts were evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of pure n2 gas and re dissolved in 1 ml of methanol ultrapure water v v 1 1 after filtration through a 0 2 μm syringe driven filter the final extract was stored in a freezer at 18 c until hplc ms ms analysis recoveries were determined for surface water matrix at target compound concentrations of 10 ng l 1 and 100 ng l 1 respectively 2 4 instrumental measurement the final extracts were analyzed by a shimadzu liquid chromatography lc

instrument co ltd china lc and ms parameters were summarized in table 2 all analytes were identified and quantified by multiple reaction monitoring mrm in the positive and negative electrospray ionization esi modes the declustering potentials dp entrance potentials ep collision energies ce and collision cell exit potentials cxp were optimized and two precursor ion product ion transition pairs were used for all analytes table 3 the typical reconstructed hplc ms ms chromatograms for the target pharmaceutical compounds in the positive and negative esi modes in the standard solution at 100 ng l 1 were presented in fig 1 2 5 data analysis identification of the analytes was performed by comparing the retention times within 2 and the ratios within 20 of the two selected precursor ion product ion transition pairs with those of the standards quantification of the target compounds was performed by calculating the response of quantitative ion based on the internal standard method and their concentrations were determined using linear regression analysis of the peak area this six point calibration curve r2 0 99 covered the range 30 300 µg l 1 of the standard solution laboratory blanks were also analyzed along with the samples to assess potential background contamination recovery experiments were done by spiking the standard solutions to surface water samples data acquisition was performed under analyst software 1 6 3 a two sample paired t test was performed to determine the difference of residual concentrations of the overlapped pharmaceuticals in surface water of the wet season under the combined spe conditions at a significant level of p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted using sas 9 2 for windows sas institute inc cary usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of hplc ms ms 3 1 1 mass spectrometry for the mass spectrometric parameter optimization a standard solution 1 mg l 1 of each analyte and their corresponding internal standards were prepared in methanol ultrapure water v v 1 1 and directly infused into the ms ms system by a syringe pump the precursor ion of each analyte was selected by recording chromatograms in full scan mode and then the single protonated or deprotonated molecule mass was chosen as precursor ion mass with the optimal declustering potential and entrance potential after optimizing collision energies and collision cell exit potentials two multiple reaction monitoring ion pairs were monitored between the precursor ion and the most abundant product ions for each compound with the first transition used for quantification and the second one for identification purposes table 3 for the target 121 pharmaceuticals in this study 101 and 18 pharmaceutical compounds showed higher responses in the positive and negative electrospray ionization modes respectively while polymyxin b pmb and colistin pme detected with complex and poor fragmentation patterns were excluded table 3 in general the protonated m h and deprotonated m h molecules were chosen for precursor ion for positive and negative ionizations respectively while m 2h represented the positive mode of lorazepam lzp and m 2h represented the negative mode of niclosamide ncs and chloramphenicols cps i e chloramphenicol cpc thiamphenicol tpc and florfenicol ffc together with their internal standard chloramphenicol d5 d5 cpc detailed analytical parameters of the selected compounds were shown in table 3 ionization parameters were optimized as shown in table 2 ionspray voltages were 5 5 kv and 4 5 kv for positive and negative electrospray ionization modes respectively ion source temperature was 650 c air was used as nebulizer 50 psi and drying gas 60 psi while n2 gas was used for curtain 25 psi and collision 9 psi data were acquired using analyst 1 6 3 3 1 2 chromatographic separation considering the ionization competition between co eluting polar and non retained matrix components in a chromatographic system matrix suppression or enhancement effects were ubiquitous during lc ms ms analysis with esi mode which were depended on the mobile phase and sample matrix huang et al 2013 sun et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 in the present study two organic solvents solvent b methanol and acetonitrile and different aqueous phases solvent a non buffer ultrapure water and buffers such as ammonia acetate and formic acid with different ratios were conducted to optimize the chromatographic separation and sensitivity of the studied analytes in both the positive and negative electrospray ionization modes the optimal operating conditions were achieved using a mixture of 0 1 formic acid and 2 mmol l 1 ammonia acetate in ultrapure water solvent a and methanol solvent b since they provided better chromatographic resolution peak shape and sensitivity for the target pharmaceuticals table 2 and fig 1 which were similar to those used for 11 compounds of human and veterinary antibiotics zhou et al 2012 28 steroids compounds liu et al 2011 33 compounds of pharmaceuticals and personal care products with emphasis on anthelmintics and their metabolites sim et al 2013 and 23 compounds of 51 pharmaceuticals and personal care products sun et al 2014 furthermore the gradient elution procedure and flow rate were optimized to improve chromatographic resolution and simultaneously to reduce total analysis time as shown in table 2 the optimal gradient elution program of lc was initiated by maintaining the solvent a with 15 the solvent b for 1 min and then gradually increased to 30 solvent b in 2 min to 40 in 5 min to 50 in 10 min to 70 in 14 min to 100 in 16 min and maintained for 4 min and finally back to the initial condition in 20 min and maintained for 5 min the optimum overall flow rate was maintained at 0 30 ml min 1 finally hplc ms ms chromatograms for 101 pharmaceutical compounds under the positive mode and 18 compounds under the negative mode and their internal standards in standard solution at the concentration each of 100 ng l 1 under the optimized conditions were presented in fig 1 respectively successful separation of each analyte was achieved under the selective hplc ms ms detection 3 2 solid phase extraction optimization solid phase extraction spe was the most common method for extracting pharmaceuticals from water samples after the removal of particles by filtration englert 2007 hong et al 2018 liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 considering the diverse physicochemical properties of the target pharmaceuticals in this study table 1 sample enrichment and cleanup by spe required careful selections of spe cartridges and conditions previous studies suggested that hydrophilic lipophilic balance cartridges hlb could be successfully applied to the analysis of a variety of chemicals such as antibiotics huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 steroids liu et al 2011 pharmaceuticals and personal care products englert 2007 klosterhaus et al 2013 therefore hlb cartridge was chosen for the enrichment and cleanup of the studied compounds in water samples without testing different types of spe cartridges the spe conditions were optimized for sample ph and the addition of na2edta which were the key factors influencing extraction recovery of the target pharmaceuticals in water samples englert 2007 zhou et al 2012 preliminary studies were conducted by spiking the standard solutions of 100 ng l 1 to 1 l ultrapure water to evaluate the performance of sample ph from 2 to 10 regardless of chelating effects of metal cations in water samples results showed that there were 72 73 70 73 83 75 71 64 and 56 compounds having recoveries in a range of 50 150 when ph integrally ranged from 2 to 10 respectively fig 2 most β lactams βls e g amoxicillin amc ampicillin apc cephalexin cpl and cefradine cfd had low and even no recoveries in the spiked samples regardless of ph due to their instability and easy degradation in aqueous solution thiele bruhn 2003 macrolides mls had low recoveries 50 in the spiked samples with ph ranging from 2 to 5 that was because mls were basic antibiotics and should be extracted under neutral and basic conditions mcardell et al 2003 while tetracyclines tcs only had high recoveries in the spiked samples of ph 2 and ph 3 which were relatively stable in acidic solution and easily degraded in basic solution halling sørensen et al 2002 additionally sulfaguanidine sgd bacitracin btc captopril ctp and chorionic gonadotrophin cgt had no recoveries in all the spiked samples might be due to their instability in aqueous solution anaizi and swenson 1993 gaugain et al 2013 lempiäinen et al 2012 tsuji et al 1974 while the low recoveries of metronidazole mnz and gabapentin gpt were resulted from low water solubility kriel et al 1997 mahfouz and hassan 2001 therefore given the wide range of pka diverse physicochemical properties of the target pharmaceuticals and ph of natural waters ph values of 3 6 and 9 were optimal to provide wider coverage and better recoveries secondly the optimization of na2edta addition 0 g 0 05 g and 0 2 g was performed on the basis of the optimized ph values 3 6 and 9 by spiking the standard solutions of 100 ng l 1 to 1 l filtered surface water of bantou river watershed xiamen china as shown in table 4 there were 60 71 76 69 69 74 62 71 and 78 compounds having recoveries in the range of 50 150 under the combined conditions of ph 3 6 and 9 and the additions of na2edta 0 g 0 05 g and 0 2 g respectively tcs and fluoroquinolones fqs recoveries were severely affected by matrix effects due to high binding with metal cations halling sørensen et al 2002 huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 therefore na2edta was necessary to be added before spe to chelate metal cations and make tcs and fqs free in our study the numbers of the target pharmaceutical compounds with recovery at 50 150 and 80 120 generally increased after the addition of na2edta respectively table 4 tcs recoveries increased with increasing na2edta addition from 0 5 g to 1 g shao et al 2009 considering that several pharmaceutical compounds could only be efficiently extracted under the special spe conditions such as nsaids acidic atenolol atl basic tcs na2edta addition and fqs basic and na2edta addition the combination of different spe conditions was essential to simultaneously determine more pharmaceutical compounds in water samples thus we found that the optimum numbers of the quantified pharmaceuticals were acquired under the spe conditions combining ph 3 and 0 2 g na2edta and ph 9 and 0 2 g na2edta up to 94 and 73 compounds with the recoveries of 50 150 and 80 120 respectively table 4 the spe condition of ph 3 and 0 2 g na2edta was also successfully applied to simultaneous determination of 11 compounds of human and veterinary antibiotics in various water samples surface water lagoon wastewater influent and effluent of waste water treatment plants zhou et al 2012 additionally it was worth noting that 32 pharmaceutical compounds fit both two spe conditions and could be served for self validation table 5 briefly the recoveries of 76 and 78 compounds fell in the acceptable range of 50 150 at ph 3 and ph 9 with the addition of 0 2 g na2edta respectively it summed up 94 compounds with recovery in the range of 50 150 under the combined spe conditions i e ph 3 0 2g na2edta and ph 9 0 2g na2edta 3 3 quantification and method validation for lc ms ms quantification the internal standard method with isotope labeled analog was desirable to compensate for matrix effect and potential experimental errors in the analysis of trace organic contaminants huang et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 in the present study a total of 16 internal isotope labeled standards were selected and shown in table 5 the quality assurance and quality control qa qc were strictly conducted for the analytical procedures a solvent blank a procedural blank and standards were successively run for each sample batch to check background pollution and instrument performance a six point calibration curve 30 300 μg l 1 was conducted for each selected pharmaceutical compound linearity was confirmed by square of correlation coefficient r2 achieving above 0 99 for all selected compounds using the optimized extraction and instrumental methods 94 out of 121 pharmaceutical compounds had the recoveries ranging from 52 to 137 at 10 ng l 1 spiking and from 51 to 147 at 100 ng l 1 spiking with relative standard deviations rsd less than 23 table 5 the limit of detection lod was determined as the lowest concentration resulting in a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 while limit of quantitation loq was calculated as the lowest concentration with the s n ratio of 10 ranges of lod and loq of the available 94 pharmaceutical compounds in surface water were from 0 001 to 11 9 ng l 1 and from 0 003 to 39 7 ng l 1 respectively table 5 3 4 matrix effects matrix effect commonly occurred in lc ms ms analysis with esi mode resulting in signal suppression or enhancement of analyte responses by co extracted matrix components huang et al 2013 liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 in this study matrix effects were calculated by spiking standard solutions 100 ng l 1 into surface water samples and comparing the obtained concentration in matrix to that in solvent and the values less or greater than 100 indicated signal suppression or enhancement respectively the results in table 5 showed that matrix components in surface water had no or only slight matrix effects on the target pharmaceutical compounds due to the fact that the results were automatically corrected by their isotope labeled internal standards however obvious signal enhancement was observed for three βls in spiked surface water 297 501 one mls i e azithromycin atm 237 two sulfonamides sas i e sulfathiazole stz 173 and sulfadiazine sdz 178 two nsaids i e naproxen npx 172 and diclofenac dcf 196 seven cvs i e lovastatin lvt 170 valsartan vst 190

effect of complex co extracted components the optimized method in this study provided acceptable recoveries for 94 pharmaceutical compounds table 5 for simultaneous determination of six category pharmaceutical residues in environmental waters 3 5 protocol validation the developed protocol was applied to determine pharmaceutical residues in surface water of jiulong river in the wet season august 2016 as shown in table 6 41 out of 94 compounds from six category pharmaceuticals consisting 24 of 37 antibiotics 6 of 16 cns 4 of 7 nsaids 4 of 8 aps 2 of 14 cvs and 1 of 12 efs were quantified in surface water and their residual concentrations ranged from below the detection limits to 1 389 ng l 1 comparable or lower than those in other watersheds of china and elsewhere bu et al 2013 kolpin et al 2002 li et al 2018 luo et al 2011 as a biomarker for anthropogenic input into the aquatic environment kolpin et al 2002 wu et al 2014 caffeine caf was detected at the highest concentration in surface water of the subwatershed n 15 table 6 which might be due to the highest urban land use percentage 26 3 an indicator of anthropogenic activities it could be confirmed in our previous study that urban land use in jiulong river watershed was identified as the main factor influencing concentrations and compositions of 33 pharmaceutical residues regardless of season hong et al 2018 additionally except for mebendazole mbz residual concentrations of 12 overlapped pharmaceuticals under the combined spe conditions in surface water had no significant differences p 0 05 table 6 indicating that this optimized protocol for simultaneous quantification of multi category pharmaceutical compounds was practicable 4 conclusion a sensitive and reliable analytical protocol on the basis of spe and hplc ms ms was soundly developed for the simultaneous analysis of six category pharmaceutical residues in surface water the analytical protocol integrates spe with hlb cartridges for water samples and showed low lods at sub ng l 1 sound recovery 51 147 and no significant matrix effects for 94 compounds under the combined spe conditions it provided a robust tool to screen multi category pharmaceutical residues in the environmental waters this optimized protocol was successfully validated by field surface water samples under various anthropogenic impacts furthermore this optimized protocol was practicable for self validation by the overlapped pharmaceuticals under the two combined spe conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

20072,interactions between surface water sw and groundwater gw have been a focus of watershed hydrology research for a long time a holistic perspective on integrated sw gw modeling approach is necessary to understand the hydrological and biogeochemical processes of these two interconnected systems within the watershed this paper reviewed the progress and coupling strategy of one important sw model soil and water assessment tool swat and gw model modular finite difference groundwater flow modflow since 1999 three main stages of development of coupled swat modflow model are reflected by the high citation of publications by three pioneer studies which are sophocleous et al 1999 kim et al 2008 and bailey et al 2016 currently the research scope of coupled swat modflow models is focused on hydrologic processes solute transport and the effects of climate change and human activity on water resources major uncertainties of swat modflow from model structure database and parameterization are discussed in an era of big data the coupled swat modflow model has great potential to improve understanding of hydro biogeochemical processes and support sustainable water and ecological management in the watershed keywords surface groundwater interaction swat modflow solute transport climate change watershed management 1 introduction the interaction between surface water sw and groundwater gw is an important process during water circulation in watersheds bailey et al 2020 deb et al 2019 markovic and koch 2015 this process is widespread in natural water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands and estuaries deb et al 2019 kamali and niksokhan 2017 ke 2014 pulido velazquez et al 2015 however sw and gw were traditionally regarded as two separated systems because they exist in different media with varying motion states bailey et al 2016 kim et al 2008 sw and gw research has developed in respective fields for a long time and the lack of interdisciplinary studies has limited the development of sustainable watershed management strategies and policies in particular various human activities and climate perturbations have greatly increased the burden on watershed ecology and water supplies izady et al 2015 kamali and niksokhan 2017 surinaidu et al 2016 recent studies suggest that sw gw interaction impacts water quantity and quality surinaidu et al 2016 diffusion of pollutants ehtiat et al 2018 sith et al 2019 and associated biogeochemical cycles liu et al 2020a 2020b therefore a holistic perspective on integrated sw gw modeling approach is essential to understand the hydrological and biogeochemical processes of these two interconnected systems to meet the requirement of watershed sustainability numerical modeling is an effective tool for simulating sw gw interactions menking et al 2003 2004 ridwansyah et al 2020 sophocleous and perkins 2000 hydrologic numerical models are usually divided into single model and coupled models park et al 2019 qi et al 2019 triana et al 2019 wei et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 aliyari et al 2019 divide single hydrological models into two categories 1 sw models that consider gw in a simple way e g topmodel a topography based hydrological model beven and kirkby 1979 hl rms hydrology laboratory research modeling system koren et al 2004 and swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and 2 gw models that consider sw in a simple way e g microfem microcomputer package for multiple aquifer gw flow modeling diodato 2000 zoomq3d object oriented quasi 3 d regional gw model jackson 2001 and modflow modular finite difference groundwater flow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 however these two categories of models usually take into account only a single sw or gw flow ignoring the interactions between sw and gw triana et al 2019 stated that modeling sw or gw in this way may not be sufficient to reflect accurately the nature of hydrological systems and may lead to wrong conclusions thus the development of coupled sw gw models is of increasing concern in recent years coupled models can be divided into completely and loosely coupled according to their coupling strategies guevara ochoa et al 2020a examples of completely coupled models include cathy catchment hydrology model paniconi and wood 1993 parflow parallel flow model kollet and maxwell 2006 and hgs hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 completely coupled models simulate sw and gw flow simultaneously aliyari et al 2019 this adds complexity to modeling and leads to over parameterization cornelissen et al 2016 also the lack of free source code and necessary modules e g crop growth and rotation reservoirs and so on limit its application especially at a regional scale guevara ochoa et al 2020a in contrast loosely coupled models seem a better choice in practice liu et al 2020a aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 wei et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 e g gsflow coupled gw and sw flow model markstrom et al 2008 modbranch coupled modflow and branch model swain and wexler 1996 and swat modflow kim et al 2008 the coupled swat and modflow model have been widely used to simulate sw and gw interaction akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 eshtawi et al 2015 2016 surinaidu et al 2016 wei et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 and have proved to have advantages in terms of simple operation good visualization and low data requirements qi et al 2019 in this paper we review sw gw model development applications and potential in watershed hydro biogeochemical process studies the main objectives were to 1 retrace the evolution of swat modflow and coupling strategies 2 identify the research scope of swat modflow 3 discern major uncertainties in swat modflow applications 4 explore future perspectives of swat modflow modeling and its potential to support sustainable water and ecology management 2 recent progress of swat modflow a comprehensive literature search using keywords swat and modflow in the thomson reuters web of science databases was carried out before september 30 2020 after screening a total of 64 peer reviewed articles were selected for the review since 1999 the number of publications on swat modflow shows a significant increasing trend fig 1 a in particular articles published in 2019 and 2020 account for 42 of the total publications the top four countries with the most published articles are usa n 18 iran n 8 south korea n 6 and china mainland and taiwan n 5 fig 1b globally the majority of publications on swat modflow are in asia n 25 north america n 20 and europe n 16 fig 1d 2 1 swat model swat is a continuous time physically based semi distributed model that operates on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 2012 the model is primarily used to evaluate the effects of land management practices on water resources and non point source pollution within basins the movements of water sediments nutrients and pesticides are the main simulation objects for the model menking et al 2004 narula and gosain 2013 main model components include climate hydrology soil temperature and properties plant growth nutrients pesticides land management water routing bacteria and pathogens kim et al 2008 in the swat model framework a watershed is usually divided into multiple sub basins each of which is further divided into a series of hydrologic response units hrus chung et al 2010 aliyari et al 2019 hrus are the simulation unit of swat which are delineated according to similarity of soil types land use and slope characteristics arnold et al 1998 2012 guzman et al 2015 swat is a lumped model arnold et al 1998 2012 kim et al 2008 and does not express in detail the spatial distribution of aquifer parameters e g hydraulic conductivity porosity specific yield and specific storage kim et al 2008 wei et al 2019 despite having its own gw module in addition swat cannot simulate sw gw interactions i e runoff recharge and gw discharge and gw level liu et al 2020c suggested that the two ways to make swat perform better in simulating gw are modifying the gw module code and coupling swat with a gw model some studies achieved a good result in simulating gw flow by changing swat module codes pfannerstill et al 2013 nguyen and dietrich 2018 however the modified gw code only improves a part of aquifer system simulation liu et al 2020c and the professional skills required to carry out the modification limit the application of this approach as a result the latter coupling approach is usually preferred and of all the gw models modflow has been developing more quickly and is widely used chung et al 2015 gao et al 2019 izady et al 2015 kim et al 2017 2 2 modflow model modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 is a modular three dimensional finite difference gw flow model proposed by the u s geological survey the model uses the finite difference method to simultaneously solve the differential equations of gw flow guzman et al 2015 modflow is a physically based model because it combines darcy s law and the mass balance for subsurface flow kim et al 2008 the model is designed to simulate a variety of natural or artificially induced hydrologic processes under steady and transient states for different types of aquifers mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 kasahara and wondzell 2003 ke 2014 in modflow the gw flow processes are simulated using a series of boundary condition packages e g recharge well drain lake reservoir and streamflow routing packages bailey et al 2016 aliyari et al 2019 however as mentioned earlier this specialized gw model modflow considers sw in a simplistic manner aliyari et al 2019 and ignores the accuracy of sw recharge rates this may cause a considerable uncertainty in the simulated gw flow kim et al 2008 therefore the combination of modflow and swat fully plays each of the two patterns while overcoming the potential disadvantages when used alone taie semiromi and koch 2020 2 3 swat modflow the model linking swat and modflow i e swat modflow was first proposed by sophocleous et al 1999 and has recently been further developed by kim et al 2008 and bailey et al 2016 in the last two decades swat modflow has been continuously updated and widely applied to watersheds to simulate sw gw interactions sophocleous and perkins 2000 conan et al 2003 galbiati et al 2006 narula and gosain 2013 guzman et al 2015 deb et al 2019 wei et al 2019 liu et al 2020a 2020b 2020c sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 the hydrologic processes of sw and gw are main topic of these studies for instance eshtawi et al 2015 used swat modflow to analyse the interrelation between gw level and built up area in the gaza strip palestine izady et al 2015 simulated the flow of sw and gw and estimated gw recharge and water budget in the neishaboor watershed iran to support water resources decision making overall the development of the swat modflow model since 1999 can be divided into three main stages table 1 in the first stage sophocleous et al 1999 developed the first integration to link swat and modflow called swatmod the model codes were written by c and applied to the rattlesnake creek basin in south central kansas usa in the following years before 2008 the model was constantly developed and applied to france conan et al 2003 italy galbiati et al 2006 and other regions in the united states sophocleous and perkins 2000 menking et al 2003 to clarify a number of different scientific hypotheses in the next stage kim et al 2008 developed a new version of integrated swat and modflow called swat modflow this proposed an innovative hydrological response unit hru cell conversion interface which could exchange daily flow data between hrus in swat and cells in modflow including recharge rate river aquifer interaction evapotranspiration and pumping rate swat modflow was applied to the musimcheon basin in south korea and showed a better result in simulating daily streamflow than swat alone subsequently a series of new practice based on kim et al 2008 developed swat modflow these included a multi reservoir storage routing module chung et al 2010 considering both climate change scenarios and solute transport in swat modflow narula and gosain 2013 md swat modflow ke 2014 swat modflow usg eshtawi et al 2015 swatmf guzman et al 2015 swat seawat chang et al 2016 and swat modflow mt3dms eshtawi et al 2016 finally bailey et al 2016 developed a swat modflow model using new code in python in the new version a hru disaggregation dhru technique was proposed which can represent hru deep percolation spatially for linkage to modflow grid cells meanwhile the model offered a graphical user interface gui could identify locations of nutrient loading and enhanced understanding of spatial patterns of gw influence on sw flow in the following year bailey et al 2017 developed a gui for preparing coupled swat modflow simulations called swatmod prep however swatmod prep has some disadvantages including the inability to provide geographical context with maps not allowing linkage between swat and an existing modflow model and not displaying results or comparing model results park et al 2019 developed a qgis based gui based on bailey et al 2016 2017 called qswatmod which facilitated model preparation and model results viewing for the broad swat modflow users the swat modflow and qswatmod executables are available at http swat tamu edu software swat modflow after a two year development period a total of 5 articles in 2017 2018 fig 1a the application of swat modflow bailey et al 2016 ushered in a period of rapid development 2019 2020 the following research mainly focused on the improvement of model code aliyari et al 2019 linking a new version of swat to modflow swat grid modflow deb et al 2019 swat plus modflow bailey et al 2020 use of high frequency hourly data in swat modflow sith et al 2019 and coupled swat modflow and other models or methods triana et al 2019 wei et al 2019 dybowski et al 2020 liu et al 2020a 2020b sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 the three main stages are also reflected by the high citation of publications by three pioneer studies sophocleous et al 1999 kim et al 2008 and bailey et al 2016 were cited 151 162 and 56 times respectively table 1 in table 1 n 27 swat modflow studies were mainly published in high impact international journals e g environmental modelling software n 5 if2019 4 807 journal of hydrology n 5 if2019 4 500 science of the total environment n 2 if2019 6 551 and hydrological processes n 2 if2019 3 256 some studies have also been published in water research eshtawi et al 2016 and water resources research taie semiromi and koch 2020 these journals have a high degree of recognition indicating that the swat modflow model was of considerable interest in the scientific community 2 4 coupling strategy initially sophocleous et al 1999 developed a subroutine to transfer information between swat and modflow as a way of coupling sw and gw kim et al 2008 proposed a conversion interface of hrus cells to exchange data between swat and modflow which improved the efficiency and accuracy of coupling recently a new dhru technique based on kim et al 2008 was proposed by bailey et al 2016 and has a wide application due to its advantages of good gui hot spots identification and free code according to bailey et al 2016 three main steps for coupling swat modflow are 1 disaggregating swat hrus and attaching geographical location information for each hru 2 linking disaggregated hrus dhrus to modflow grid cells in space which ensures swat transfers its deep percolation into modflow cells as recharge for each time step of the simulation 3 linking modflow river cells to the channel of swat sub basins which enables modflow calculated gw sw exchange rates can be transferred to the correct sub basin channel the flow chart of the swat modflow model is shown in fig 2 table 2 shows the swat modflow evaluation results of previous studies petpongpan et al 2020 guevara ochoa et al 2020b taie semiromi and koch 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 gao et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 a good model performance evaluation may be based on nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and r2 coefficient of determination close to 1 and a rmse root mean square error and pbias the percent bias close to 0 the coupled swat modflow models usually get a lower value for rmse pbias and about 0 5 acceptable level for nse r2 in simulating streamflow and gw level some studies have an nse r2 value of more than 0 75 very good level in addition previous studies have shown a good performance in simulating streamflow using the coupled swat modflow rather than the swat alone kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 3 research scope of swat modflow 3 1 hydrologic process existing studies on hydrological processes by swat modflow can be grouped into non situational simulation and situational simulation table 3 in non situational scenario previous studies were mainly concerned with streamflow simulation gw discharge sw gw interaction and regional water balance guevara ochoa et al 2020a bailey et al 2020 2016 taie semiromi and koch 2019 gao et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 kim et al 2017 dowlatabadi and zomorodian 2016 guzman et al 2015 eshtawi et al 2015 lin et al 2013 luo and sophocleous 2011 ke 2014 chung et al 2010 for instance guevara ochoa et al 2020a indicated that an annual average of 34 mm gw discharge to stream and 1 4 mm stream recharge to aquifer were determined by swat modflow in the upper creek basin of del azul argentina furthermore the results of annual water balances showed that recharge 80 mm accounted for 10 2 surface runoff 37 mm for 4 8 and total rainfall 776 mm and evapotranspiration 659 mm for 85 bailey et al 2016 indicated that gw discharge has a high spatial variability in sprague river watershed usa with an average annual gw discharge of 20 5 m3 s 1 luo and sophocleous 2011 pointed out that the amount of annual recharge to shallow gw is 29 108 m3 in hetao irrigation district china while shallow gw evaporation is 23 108 m3 however the quantified analysis of sw gw interactions still requires consideration of multiple scenarios to support policy formulation in situational scenarios the impacts of gw pumping and irrigation on the environment have been considered by several swat modflow users wei and bailey 2019 surinaidu et al 2016 izady et al 2015 chung et al 2011 2015 liu et al 2020b assessed the effects of current state no drinking water wells and extreme abstraction scenarios on gw discharge and stream biota by swat modflow in the uggerby river catchment denmark the results showed that extreme abstract scenarios have significant effects on small streams especially on fish and macrophyte indices this research has improved the understanding of watershed water ecology by swat modflow and scenario simulation considering the characteristics of aquifers high transmissivity and percolation rates in the ganges river basin surinaidu et al 2016 combined swat modflow with climate scenarios and proposed more pre monsoon pumping of gw from aquifers for irrigation and other uses this allows gw to be recharged during the monsoon thus creating additional subsurface storage to alleviate the water shortage chung et al 2015 analyzed the changes of hydrological composition caused by various gw pumping scenarios in mihocheon basins south korea the results indicated an optimal total of 104 mm gw abstraction would only reduce 16 mm gw storage providing a powerful reference for local policymakers several other studies have also demonstrated that swat modflow has a good performance in evaluating the impact of irrigation and gw extraction on sw liu et al 2020b wei and bailey 2019 izady et al 2015 chung et al 2011 overall these quantitative analyses of sw gw interaction improved understanding of complicated hydrologic processes in addition the integrated model is a powerful tool for sustainable water resource planning and management in areas with high aquifer pressure 3 2 solute transport anthropogenic development has caused the application of large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides to the environment thus increasing the concentration of pollutants in the watershed ehtiat et al 2018 eshtawi et al 2016 narula and gosain 2013 sith et al 2019 in recent decades the interaction of sw gw was more frequent in the basin due to urbanization and climate change akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 chang et al 2016 eshtawi et al 2015 these high intensity human activities as well as extreme weather events increase pollutants exported from the agricultural watershed eshtawi et al 2016 narula and gosain 2013 wei et al 2019 especially in subtropical areas with frequent typhoons and storm events sith et al 2019 with the development of solute transport modules e g rt3d reactive transport in three dimensions clement 1997 and mt3dms modular 3 dimensional multi species transport zheng and wang 1999 and a recently developed swat modflow model bailey et al 2016 the combination of both models improves assessment capability in the watershed aquatic environment a spatial interaction map of sw gw can also be obtained helping to identify and control pollutant discharge from sources in the watershed wei et al 2019 until the present nitrate nitrogen no3 n has been the most popular simulation subject e g szymkiewicz et al 2020 wei et al 2019 eshtawi et al 2016 narula and gosain 2013 conan et al 2003 at the initial stage of model coupling conan et al 2003 first simulated no3 n and assessed the impacts of intensive pig farms on the water environment using swat modflow mt3dms in the coet dan watershed france narula and gosain 2013 further evaluated the sw gw hydrologic processes and the fate of no3 n under climate change in the himalayan upper yamuna basin however the spatial positioning of pollutants loading was unexplored until wei et al 2019 identified the loading of no3 n in space during the process of sw gw interaction in the sprague river watershed usa by coupled swat modflow bailey et al 2016 and rt3d clement 1997 swat modflow rt3d executables are available from http swat tamu edu software swat modflow besides no3 n other constituents have also been addressed including nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n phosphate po4 p chloridion cl and total dissolved solids tds galbiati et al 2006 developed an issm model to predict the influence of anthropogenic activities on water quality no3 n no2 n and nh4 n of both sw and gw in the bonello watershed italy the issm model was composed of swat modflow mt3dms and qual2e in stream water quality model sith et al 2019 combined high resolution data swat modflow and best management practices bmps to assess the reduction of non point source pollution tds no3 n po4 p in the todoroki river watershed in ishigaki island japan cl and tds were considered by ehtiat et al 2018 eshtawi et al 2016 and kamali and niksokhan 2017 dybowski et al 2020 coupled the ecopuckbay model ecohydrodynamic predictive model the ecosystem part with swat modflow to provide a decision making service tool which is capable of forecasting seven biochemical indexes no3 n nh4 n po4 p silicate chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen and active ingredient of pesticide these studies integrating swat modflow and solute transport model are helpful to identify hot spots of nitrogen pollution across the stream network and gw aquifer providing a scientific basis for managing non point source pollution in the watershed wei et al 2019 kamali and niksokhan 2017 ehtiat et al 2016 3 3 effects of climate change and human activity climate change is one of the most important global challenges for humanity petpongpan et al 2020 climate change overall increases temperature and evapotranspiration and intensifies seasonal patterns of precipitation in the mediterranean region chaouche et al 2010 molina navarro et al 2019 china meteorological administration climate change centre 2020 reported that annual mean temperature in china rose by 0 24 every 10 years from 1951 to 2019 with a higher temperature rise rate than the global average for the same period meanwhile the occurrence of rain storms i e daily precipitation more than 50 mm increased by 3 8 per decade on average from 1961 to 2019 as reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the climate change causes more frequent floods and droughts and the situation could get worse in the future especially in mid latitude and subtropical regions ipcc 2013 undoubtedly climate change substantially affects watershed hydrological processes akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 guevara ochoa et al 2020a numerous studies have focused on the influence of climate change on surface hydrological processes ficklin et al 2009 du et al 2019 but few studies have addressed subsurface hydrological processes and the gw sw interaction pulido velazquez et al 2015 taie semiromi and koch 2020 currently in existing research two modelling works have been carried out addressing the effects of climate change sometimes combined with human activities on hydrology based on the coupled swat modflow model 1 effects of climate change on hydrological processes qi et al 2019 suggested that the annual streamflow and gw recharge varied by a factor of 17 and 19 times respectively between wet and dry years under rcp 8 5 scenario in the naoli river basin of china petpongpan et al 2020 suggested that the summation of sw water yield and gw recharge water percolation decreased by 443 98 rcp 2 6 and 316 77 rcp 8 5 million m3 yr 1 in the yom river basin thailand similar decreases were found in kathmandu valley nepal in which the gw recharge decreased by a range of 3 3 50 7 mm yr 1 rcp 4 5 and 19 102 1 mm yr 1 rcp 8 5 shrestha et al 2020 however the opposite result was found in buenos aires argentina in which the annual average gw discharge to sw increased by 5 24 guevara ochoa et al 2020a in addition the effects of climate change on hydrological regime and stream biota in a gw dominated catchment was assessed using swat modflow with flow biota empirical models by liu et al 2020a these studies highlight the direct influence of climate change on both sw quantity and gw discharge 2 combined effects of climate change and human activities triana et al 2020 suggested that climate changes would decrease gw level by 99 120 by the end of the 21st century if land use was maintained at current levels but could recover within 7 10 years under mitigation scenarios i e decrease irrigation depth by 50 and transfer 50 of agricultural land area to rangelands with no irrigation chunn et al 2019 pointed out that over exploitation of gw contributes more in the reduction of river flows and gw level than climate change and this statement is also supported by pisinaras 2016 and taie semiromi and koch 2020 akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 further stated that urbanization and future population growth increase pumping rate yield resulting in adverse impacts on unconfined aquifers based on the coupled swat modflow with mt3dms pulido velazquez et al 2015 assessed the fate and transport of nitrate under different climate scenarios and found gw recharge decreases and nitrate content increases chang et al 2016 used swat modflow seawat multi species solute and heat transport to explore the effects of lateral saltwater intrusion on both gw and freshwater quality these studies emphasized anthropogenic disturbances on gw due to land use change water withdrawal and urbanization alongside climate change 4 uncertainty in swat modflow swat modflow has distinct advantages in simulating sw gw interaction e g high precision evaluation for streamflow luo and sophocleous 2011 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 but uncertainty is a normal inherent defect for numerical models yuan et al 2020 the three major sources of uncertainty in swat modflow are outlined below 1 uncertainty from model structure swat e g swat grid swat plus and modflow e g modflow usg modflow nwt are constantly updated and different versions of coupling swat and modflow are being tested but some codes modules are still missing guevara ochoa et al 2020a pointed out that there was no module to link changes between gw levels and soil saturation resulting in swat delivering a higher recharge to modflow rather than creating surface runoff during wet periods newly developed codes are still few in number aliyari et al 2019 developed an integrated hydrologic modeling code to link sw gw canal diversion pumping for large scale mixed agro urban river basins in south platte river basin colorado usa but these codes need more validation 2 uncertainty from database the difficulty in obtaining hydrogeological data results in considerable uncertainty in geological stratification in addition the number and distribution of monitoring wells as well as the frequency of gw observed head may affect the initial conditions and calculation procedures for the model moreover the uncertainty of input data may also come from the heterogeneity of rainfall size of streamflow digital elevation model dem resolution soil land use land cover and so on 3 uncertainty from parameterization calibration of the model usually obtains the best performance by configuring model parameters however different combinations of parameters may produce similar results i e parameter non uniqueness a few efforts have been made to reduce uncertainty for example liu et al 2020b calibrated swat and modflow simultaneously using a pest parameter estimation by sequential testing approach for the uggerby river catchment in northern denmark while zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 calibrated swat modflow by particle swarm optimisation pso algorithm in the ega river basin spain more work is necessary to reduce uncertainties through appropriate parameterization akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 5 perspectives on swat modflow in an era of big data the coupled swat modflow model has been developed well in the past two decades however future work is needed to expand its potential application to the study of watershed hydro biogeochemistry at various temporal and spatial scales 1 adapting the coupled sw gw model to operate at multiple time scales current swat modflow simulation are mostly performed at mid or long term scales e g monthly yearly or decadal assessment table 3 little research has targeted the short term response of sw gw interactions to extreme events largely due to the lack of high temporal resolution monitoring data to calibrate and validate the model under global climate change extreme weather events such as storms and accompanied flooding likely become more frequent and intensive shrestha et al 2020 akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 these events dramatically alter watershed hydrography and cause a short term pulse of nutrient export chen et al 2018a 2018b although hourly data was integrated in modeling by sith et al 2019 it mainly focused on rainfall streamflow sediment and gw head therefore the swat modflow should be adapted to short time scales with high frequency data e g minutely hourly or daily to describe detailed hydrological responses under extreme climate conditions 2 reduce model uncertainties by refining model structure and local parameterization specific codes or modules should be developed and integrated into the current modeling framework to reflect the complicated interactions between surface and subsurface processes particularly in the case of human disturbances in the watershed e g artificial irrigation for a variety of crops crop growth and rotation impoundment or reservoirs and cross basin water diversion wei et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2015 triana et al 2020 liu et al 2020b guevara ochoa et al 2020a furthermore local parameterization is necessary to achieve good model performance in a specific watershed with heterogenetic characteristics meteorology geology soil land use etc bailey et al 2016 wei et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 3 expanding model objects and potential in studies of hydro biogeochemical process numerous studies yielded good results through the use of coupled swat modflow demonstrating the advantages and potential for future research narula and gosain 2013 guzman et al 2015 deb et al 2019 sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 however modeling of solute transport in the sw gw interaction has mainly focused on no3 n wei et al 2019 conan et al 2003 future research should emphasize on hydrology driven biogeochemical processes including the transport and cycling of other major constituents nitrogen and phosphorus species metals pesticides etc in the aquifer system and their interaction between sw and gw in addition previous studies mainly focused on the physical process of unsaturated flow al jaf et al 2020 liu et al 2020d but the effect of unsaturated flow on hydro biogeochemical process is still unclear which could be incorporated into swat modflow in the future work 4 facilitating transfer of model outputs into the decision making process with the rapid development of environmental sensors and auto monitoring techniques acquisition of high frequency measurement will become more convenient in an era of big data the use of internet of things iot and cloud computing techniques will make the swat modflow model more intelligent jiang et al 2011 big data assimilation can be expected to improve the predictability of swat modflow and support more detailed studies of hydrological dynamics this will allow the attainment of a systematic understanding of water and solute transport across surface runoff interflow and gw and downstream river guevara ochoa et al 2020a bailey et al 2020 gao et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 szymkiewicz et al 2020 narula and gosain 2013 to meet the requirement of sustainable water management and ecological restoration swat modflow should be linked with other biogeochemical models and combined into an integrated watershed management information system to assist decision making by non professional users pisinaras et al 2013 ni et al 2020 sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 norouzi khatiri et al 2020 6 conclusions in this paper

20072,interactions between surface water sw and groundwater gw have been a focus of watershed hydrology research for a long time a holistic perspective on integrated sw gw modeling approach is necessary to understand the hydrological and biogeochemical processes of these two interconnected systems within the watershed this paper reviewed the progress and coupling strategy of one important sw model soil and water assessment tool swat and gw model modular finite difference groundwater flow modflow since 1999 three main stages of development of coupled swat modflow model are reflected by the high citation of publications by three pioneer studies which are sophocleous et al 1999 kim et al 2008 and bailey et al 2016 currently the research scope of coupled swat modflow models is focused on hydrologic processes solute transport and the effects of climate change and human activity on water resources major uncertainties of swat modflow from model structure database and parameterization are discussed in an era of big data the coupled swat modflow model has great potential to improve understanding of hydro biogeochemical processes and support sustainable water and ecological management in the watershed keywords surface groundwater interaction swat modflow solute transport climate change watershed management 1 introduction the interaction between surface water sw and groundwater gw is an important process during water circulation in watersheds bailey et al 2020 deb et al 2019 markovic and koch 2015 this process is widespread in natural water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands and estuaries deb et al 2019 kamali and niksokhan 2017 ke 2014 pulido velazquez et al 2015 however sw and gw were traditionally regarded as two separated systems because they exist in different media with varying motion states bailey et al 2016 kim et al 2008 sw and gw research has developed in respective fields for a long time and the lack of interdisciplinary studies has limited the development of sustainable watershed management strategies and policies in particular various human activities and climate perturbations have greatly increased the burden on watershed ecology and water supplies izady et al 2015 kamali and niksokhan 2017 surinaidu et al 2016 recent studies suggest that sw gw interaction impacts water quantity and quality surinaidu et al 2016 diffusion of pollutants ehtiat et al 2018 sith et al 2019 and associated biogeochemical cycles liu et al 2020a 2020b therefore a holistic perspective on integrated sw gw modeling approach is essential to understand the hydrological and biogeochemical processes of these two interconnected systems to meet the requirement of watershed sustainability numerical modeling is an effective tool for simulating sw gw interactions menking et al 2003 2004 ridwansyah et al 2020 sophocleous and perkins 2000 hydrologic numerical models are usually divided into single model and coupled models park et al 2019 qi et al 2019 triana et al 2019 wei et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 aliyari et al 2019 divide single hydrological models into two categories 1 sw models that consider gw in a simple way e g topmodel a topography based hydrological model beven and kirkby 1979 hl rms hydrology laboratory research modeling system koren et al 2004 and swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and 2 gw models that consider sw in a simple way e g microfem microcomputer package for multiple aquifer gw flow modeling diodato 2000 zoomq3d object oriented quasi 3 d regional gw model jackson 2001 and modflow modular finite difference groundwater flow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 however these two categories of models usually take into account only a single sw or gw flow ignoring the interactions between sw and gw triana et al 2019 stated that modeling sw or gw in this way may not be sufficient to reflect accurately the nature of hydrological systems and may lead to wrong conclusions thus the development of coupled sw gw models is of increasing concern in recent years coupled models can be divided into completely and loosely coupled according to their coupling strategies guevara ochoa et al 2020a examples of completely coupled models include cathy catchment hydrology model paniconi and wood 1993 parflow parallel flow model kollet and maxwell 2006 and hgs hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 completely coupled models simulate sw and gw flow simultaneously aliyari et al 2019 this adds complexity to modeling and leads to over parameterization cornelissen et al 2016 also the lack of free source code and necessary modules e g crop growth and rotation reservoirs and so on limit its application especially at a regional scale guevara ochoa et al 2020a in contrast loosely coupled models seem a better choice in practice liu et al 2020a aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 wei et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 e g gsflow coupled gw and sw flow model markstrom et al 2008 modbranch coupled modflow and branch model swain and wexler 1996 and swat modflow kim et al 2008 the coupled swat and modflow model have been widely used to simulate sw and gw interaction akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 eshtawi et al 2015 2016 surinaidu et al 2016 wei et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 and have proved to have advantages in terms of simple operation good visualization and low data requirements qi et al 2019 in this paper we review sw gw model development applications and potential in watershed hydro biogeochemical process studies the main objectives were to 1 retrace the evolution of swat modflow and coupling strategies 2 identify the research scope of swat modflow 3 discern major uncertainties in swat modflow applications 4 explore future perspectives of swat modflow modeling and its potential to support sustainable water and ecology management 2 recent progress of swat modflow a comprehensive literature search using keywords swat and modflow in the thomson reuters web of science databases was carried out before september 30 2020 after screening a total of 64 peer reviewed articles were selected for the review since 1999 the number of publications on swat modflow shows a significant increasing trend fig 1 a in particular articles published in 2019 and 2020 account for 42 of the total publications the top four countries with the most published articles are usa n 18 iran n 8 south korea n 6 and china mainland and taiwan n 5 fig 1b globally the majority of publications on swat modflow are in asia n 25 north america n 20 and europe n 16 fig 1d 2 1 swat model swat is a continuous time physically based semi distributed model that operates on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 2012 the model is primarily used to evaluate the effects of land management practices on water resources and non point source pollution within basins the movements of water sediments nutrients and pesticides are the main simulation objects for the model menking et al 2004 narula and gosain 2013 main model components include climate hydrology soil temperature and properties plant growth nutrients pesticides land management water routing bacteria and pathogens kim et al 2008 in the swat model framework a watershed is usually divided into multiple sub basins each of which is further divided into a series of hydrologic response units hrus chung et al 2010 aliyari et al 2019 hrus are the simulation unit of swat which are delineated according to similarity of soil types land use and slope characteristics arnold et al 1998 2012 guzman et al 2015 swat is a lumped model arnold et al 1998 2012 kim et al 2008 and does not express in detail the spatial distribution of aquifer parameters e g hydraulic conductivity porosity specific yield and specific storage kim et al 2008 wei et al 2019 despite having its own gw module in addition swat cannot simulate sw gw interactions i e runoff recharge and gw discharge and gw level liu et al 2020c suggested that the two ways to make swat perform better in simulating gw are modifying the gw module code and coupling swat with a gw model some studies achieved a good result in simulating gw flow by changing swat module codes pfannerstill et al 2013 nguyen and dietrich 2018 however the modified gw code only improves a part of aquifer system simulation liu et al 2020c and the professional skills required to carry out the modification limit the application of this approach as a result the latter coupling approach is usually preferred and of all the gw models modflow has been developing more quickly and is widely used chung et al 2015 gao et al 2019 izady et al 2015 kim et al 2017 2 2 modflow model modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 is a modular three dimensional finite difference gw flow model proposed by the u s geological survey the model uses the finite difference method to simultaneously solve the differential equations of gw flow guzman et al 2015 modflow is a physically based model because it combines darcy s law and the mass balance for subsurface flow kim et al 2008 the model is designed to simulate a variety of natural or artificially induced hydrologic processes under steady and transient states for different types of aquifers mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 kasahara and wondzell 2003 ke 2014 in modflow the gw flow processes are simulated using a series of boundary condition packages e g recharge well drain lake reservoir and streamflow routing packages bailey et al 2016 aliyari et al 2019 however as mentioned earlier this specialized gw model modflow considers sw in a simplistic manner aliyari et al 2019 and ignores the accuracy of sw recharge rates this may cause a considerable uncertainty in the simulated gw flow kim et al 2008 therefore the combination of modflow and swat fully plays each of the two patterns while overcoming the potential disadvantages when used alone taie semiromi and koch 2020 2 3 swat modflow the model linking swat and modflow i e swat modflow was first proposed by sophocleous et al 1999 and has recently been further developed by kim et al 2008 and bailey et al 2016 in the last two decades swat modflow has been continuously updated and widely applied to watersheds to simulate sw gw interactions sophocleous and perkins 2000 conan et al 2003 galbiati et al 2006 narula and gosain 2013 guzman et al 2015 deb et al 2019 wei et al 2019 liu et al 2020a 2020b 2020c sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 the hydrologic processes of sw and gw are main topic of these studies for instance eshtawi et al 2015 used swat modflow to analyse the interrelation between gw level and built up area in the gaza strip palestine izady et al 2015 simulated the flow of sw and gw and estimated gw recharge and water budget in the neishaboor watershed iran to support water resources decision making overall the development of the swat modflow model since 1999 can be divided into three main stages table 1 in the first stage sophocleous et al 1999 developed the first integration to link swat and modflow called swatmod the model codes were written by c and applied to the rattlesnake creek basin in south central kansas usa in the following years before 2008 the model was constantly developed and applied to france conan et al 2003 italy galbiati et al 2006 and other regions in the united states sophocleous and perkins 2000 menking et al 2003 to clarify a number of different scientific hypotheses in the next stage kim et al 2008 developed a new version of integrated swat and modflow called swat modflow this proposed an innovative hydrological response unit hru cell conversion interface which could exchange daily flow data between hrus in swat and cells in modflow including recharge rate river aquifer interaction evapotranspiration and pumping rate swat modflow was applied to the musimcheon basin in south korea and showed a better result in simulating daily streamflow than swat alone subsequently a series of new practice based on kim et al 2008 developed swat modflow these included a multi reservoir storage routing module chung et al 2010 considering both climate change scenarios and solute transport in swat modflow narula and gosain 2013 md swat modflow ke 2014 swat modflow usg eshtawi et al 2015 swatmf guzman et al 2015 swat seawat chang et al 2016 and swat modflow mt3dms eshtawi et al 2016 finally bailey et al 2016 developed a swat modflow model using new code in python in the new version a hru disaggregation dhru technique was proposed which can represent hru deep percolation spatially for linkage to modflow grid cells meanwhile the model offered a graphical user interface gui could identify locations of nutrient loading and enhanced understanding of spatial patterns of gw influence on sw flow in the following year bailey et al 2017 developed a gui for preparing coupled swat modflow simulations called swatmod prep however swatmod prep has some disadvantages including the inability to provide geographical context with maps not allowing linkage between swat and an existing modflow model and not displaying results or comparing model results park et al 2019 developed a qgis based gui based on bailey et al 2016 2017 called qswatmod which facilitated model preparation and model results viewing for the broad swat modflow users the swat modflow and qswatmod executables are available at http swat tamu edu software swat modflow after a two year development period a total of 5 articles in 2017 2018 fig 1a the application of swat modflow bailey et al 2016 ushered in a period of rapid development 2019 2020 the following research mainly focused on the improvement of model code aliyari et al 2019 linking a new version of swat to modflow swat grid modflow deb et al 2019 swat plus modflow bailey et al 2020 use of high frequency hourly data in swat modflow sith et al 2019 and coupled swat modflow and other models or methods triana et al 2019 wei et al 2019 dybowski et al 2020 liu et al 2020a 2020b sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 the three main stages are also reflected by the high citation of publications by three pioneer studies sophocleous et al 1999 kim et al 2008 and bailey et al 2016 were cited 151 162 and 56 times respectively table 1 in table 1 n 27 swat modflow studies were mainly published in high impact international journals e g environmental modelling software n 5 if2019 4 807 journal of hydrology n 5 if2019 4 500 science of the total environment n 2 if2019 6 551 and hydrological processes n 2 if2019 3 256 some studies have also been published in water research eshtawi et al 2016 and water resources research taie semiromi and koch 2020 these journals have a high degree of recognition indicating that the swat modflow model was of considerable interest in the scientific community 2 4 coupling strategy initially sophocleous et al 1999 developed a subroutine to transfer information between swat and modflow as a way of coupling sw and gw kim et al 2008 proposed a conversion interface of hrus cells to exchange data between swat and modflow which improved the efficiency and accuracy of coupling recently a new dhru technique based on kim et al 2008 was proposed by bailey et al 2016 and has a wide application due to its advantages of good gui hot spots identification and free code according to bailey et al 2016 three main steps for coupling swat modflow are 1 disaggregating swat hrus and attaching geographical location information for each hru 2 linking disaggregated hrus dhrus to modflow grid cells in space which ensures swat transfers its deep percolation into modflow cells as recharge for each time step of the simulation 3 linking modflow river cells to the channel of swat sub basins which enables modflow calculated gw sw exchange rates can be transferred to the correct sub basin channel the flow chart of the swat modflow model is shown in fig 2 table 2 shows the swat modflow evaluation results of previous studies petpongpan et al 2020 guevara ochoa et al 2020b taie semiromi and koch 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 gao et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 a good model performance evaluation may be based on nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and r2 coefficient of determination close to 1 and a rmse root mean square error and pbias the percent bias close to 0 the coupled swat modflow models usually get a lower value for rmse pbias and about 0 5 acceptable level for nse r2 in simulating streamflow and gw level some studies have an nse r2 value of more than 0 75 very good level in addition previous studies have shown a good performance in simulating streamflow using the coupled swat modflow rather than the swat alone kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 3 research scope of swat modflow 3 1 hydrologic process existing studies on hydrological processes by swat modflow can be grouped into non situational simulation and situational simulation table 3 in non situational scenario previous studies were mainly concerned with streamflow simulation gw discharge sw gw interaction and regional water balance guevara ochoa et al 2020a bailey et al 2020 2016 taie semiromi and koch 2019 gao et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 kim et al 2017 dowlatabadi and zomorodian 2016 guzman et al 2015 eshtawi et al 2015 lin et al 2013 luo and sophocleous 2011 ke 2014 chung et al 2010 for instance guevara ochoa et al 2020a indicated that an annual average of 34 mm gw discharge to stream and 1 4 mm stream recharge to aquifer were determined by swat modflow in the upper creek basin of del azul argentina furthermore the results of annual water balances showed that recharge 80 mm accounted for 10 2 surface runoff 37 mm for 4 8 and total rainfall 776 mm and evapotranspiration 659 mm for 85 bailey et al 2016 indicated that gw discharge has a high spatial variability in sprague river watershed usa with an average annual gw discharge of 20 5 m3 s 1 luo and sophocleous 2011 pointed out that the amount of annual recharge to shallow gw is 29 108 m3 in hetao irrigation district china while shallow gw evaporation is 23 108 m3 however the quantified analysis of sw gw interactions still requires consideration of multiple scenarios to support policy formulation in situational scenarios the impacts of gw pumping and irrigation on the environment have been considered by several swat modflow users wei and bailey 2019 surinaidu et al 2016 izady et al 2015 chung et al 2011 2015 liu et al 2020b assessed the effects of current state no drinking water wells and extreme abstraction scenarios on gw discharge and stream biota by swat modflow in the uggerby river catchment denmark the results showed that extreme abstract scenarios have significant effects on small streams especially on fish and macrophyte indices this research has improved the understanding of watershed water ecology by swat modflow and scenario simulation considering the characteristics of aquifers high transmissivity and percolation rates in the ganges river basin surinaidu et al 2016 combined swat modflow with climate scenarios and proposed more pre monsoon pumping of gw from aquifers for irrigation and other uses this allows gw to be recharged during the monsoon thus creating additional subsurface storage to alleviate the water shortage chung et al 2015 analyzed the changes of hydrological composition caused by various gw pumping scenarios in mihocheon basins south korea the results indicated an optimal total of 104 mm gw abstraction would only reduce 16 mm gw storage providing a powerful reference for local policymakers several other studies have also demonstrated that swat modflow has a good performance in evaluating the impact of irrigation and gw extraction on sw liu et al 2020b wei and bailey 2019 izady et al 2015 chung et al 2011 overall these quantitative analyses of sw gw interaction improved understanding of complicated hydrologic processes in addition the integrated model is a powerful tool for sustainable water resource planning and management in areas with high aquifer pressure 3 2 solute transport anthropogenic development has caused the application of large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides to the environment thus increasing the concentration of pollutants in the watershed ehtiat et al 2018 eshtawi et al 2016 narula and gosain 2013 sith et al 2019 in recent decades the interaction of sw gw was more frequent in the basin due to urbanization and climate change akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 chang et al 2016 eshtawi et al 2015 these high intensity human activities as well as extreme weather events increase pollutants exported from the agricultural watershed eshtawi et al 2016 narula and gosain 2013 wei et al 2019 especially in subtropical areas with frequent typhoons and storm events sith et al 2019 with the development of solute transport modules e g rt3d reactive transport in three dimensions clement 1997 and mt3dms modular 3 dimensional multi species transport zheng and wang 1999 and a recently developed swat modflow model bailey et al 2016 the combination of both models improves assessment capability in the watershed aquatic environment a spatial interaction map of sw gw can also be obtained helping to identify and control pollutant discharge from sources in the watershed wei et al 2019 until the present nitrate nitrogen no3 n has been the most popular simulation subject e g szymkiewicz et al 2020 wei et al 2019 eshtawi et al 2016 narula and gosain 2013 conan et al 2003 at the initial stage of model coupling conan et al 2003 first simulated no3 n and assessed the impacts of intensive pig farms on the water environment using swat modflow mt3dms in the coet dan watershed france narula and gosain 2013 further evaluated the sw gw hydrologic processes and the fate of no3 n under climate change in the himalayan upper yamuna basin however the spatial positioning of pollutants loading was unexplored until wei et al 2019 identified the loading of no3 n in space during the process of sw gw interaction in the sprague river watershed usa by coupled swat modflow bailey et al 2016 and rt3d clement 1997 swat modflow rt3d executables are available from http swat tamu edu software swat modflow besides no3 n other constituents have also been addressed including nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n phosphate po4 p chloridion cl and total dissolved solids tds galbiati et al 2006 developed an issm model to predict the influence of anthropogenic activities on water quality no3 n no2 n and nh4 n of both sw and gw in the bonello watershed italy the issm model was composed of swat modflow mt3dms and qual2e in stream water quality model sith et al 2019 combined high resolution data swat modflow and best management practices bmps to assess the reduction of non point source pollution tds no3 n po4 p in the todoroki river watershed in ishigaki island japan cl and tds were considered by ehtiat et al 2018 eshtawi et al 2016 and kamali and niksokhan 2017 dybowski et al 2020 coupled the ecopuckbay model ecohydrodynamic predictive model the ecosystem part with swat modflow to provide a decision making service tool which is capable of forecasting seven biochemical indexes no3 n nh4 n po4 p silicate chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen and active ingredient of pesticide these studies integrating swat modflow and solute transport model are helpful to identify hot spots of nitrogen pollution across the stream network and gw aquifer providing a scientific basis for managing non point source pollution in the watershed wei et al 2019 kamali and niksokhan 2017 ehtiat et al 2016 3 3 effects of climate change and human activity climate change is one of the most important global challenges for humanity petpongpan et al 2020 climate change overall increases temperature and evapotranspiration and intensifies seasonal patterns of precipitation in the mediterranean region chaouche et al 2010 molina navarro et al 2019 china meteorological administration climate change centre 2020 reported that annual mean temperature in china rose by 0 24 every 10 years from 1951 to 2019 with a higher temperature rise rate than the global average for the same period meanwhile the occurrence of rain storms i e daily precipitation more than 50 mm increased by 3 8 per decade on average from 1961 to 2019 as reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the climate change causes more frequent floods and droughts and the situation could get worse in the future especially in mid latitude and subtropical regions ipcc 2013 undoubtedly climate change substantially affects watershed hydrological processes akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 guevara ochoa et al 2020a numerous studies have focused on the influence of climate change on surface hydrological processes ficklin et al 2009 du et al 2019 but few studies have addressed subsurface hydrological processes and the gw sw interaction pulido velazquez et al 2015 taie semiromi and koch 2020 currently in existing research two modelling works have been carried out addressing the effects of climate change sometimes combined with human activities on hydrology based on the coupled swat modflow model 1 effects of climate change on hydrological processes qi et al 2019 suggested that the annual streamflow and gw recharge varied by a factor of 17 and 19 times respectively between wet and dry years under rcp 8 5 scenario in the naoli river basin of china petpongpan et al 2020 suggested that the summation of sw water yield and gw recharge water percolation decreased by 443 98 rcp 2 6 and 316 77 rcp 8 5 million m3 yr 1 in the yom river basin thailand similar decreases were found in kathmandu valley nepal in which the gw recharge decreased by a range of 3 3 50 7 mm yr 1 rcp 4 5 and 19 102 1 mm yr 1 rcp 8 5 shrestha et al 2020 however the opposite result was found in buenos aires argentina in which the annual average gw discharge to sw increased by 5 24 guevara ochoa et al 2020a in addition the effects of climate change on hydrological regime and stream biota in a gw dominated catchment was assessed using swat modflow with flow biota empirical models by liu et al 2020a these studies highlight the direct influence of climate change on both sw quantity and gw discharge 2 combined effects of climate change and human activities triana et al 2020 suggested that climate changes would decrease gw level by 99 120 by the end of the 21st century if land use was maintained at current levels but could recover within 7 10 years under mitigation scenarios i e decrease irrigation depth by 50 and transfer 50 of agricultural land area to rangelands with no irrigation chunn et al 2019 pointed out that over exploitation of gw contributes more in the reduction of river flows and gw level than climate change and this statement is also supported by pisinaras 2016 and taie semiromi and koch 2020 akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 further stated that urbanization and future population growth increase pumping rate yield resulting in adverse impacts on unconfined aquifers based on the coupled swat modflow with mt3dms pulido velazquez et al 2015 assessed the fate and transport of nitrate under different climate scenarios and found gw recharge decreases and nitrate content increases chang et al 2016 used swat modflow seawat multi species solute and heat transport to explore the effects of lateral saltwater intrusion on both gw and freshwater quality these studies emphasized anthropogenic disturbances on gw due to land use change water withdrawal and urbanization alongside climate change 4 uncertainty in swat modflow swat modflow has distinct advantages in simulating sw gw interaction e g high precision evaluation for streamflow luo and sophocleous 2011 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 but uncertainty is a normal inherent defect for numerical models yuan et al 2020 the three major sources of uncertainty in swat modflow are outlined below 1 uncertainty from model structure swat e g swat grid swat plus and modflow e g modflow usg modflow nwt are constantly updated and different versions of coupling swat and modflow are being tested but some codes modules are still missing guevara ochoa et al 2020a pointed out that there was no module to link changes between gw levels and soil saturation resulting in swat delivering a higher recharge to modflow rather than creating surface runoff during wet periods newly developed codes are still few in number aliyari et al 2019 developed an integrated hydrologic modeling code to link sw gw canal diversion pumping for large scale mixed agro urban river basins in south platte river basin colorado usa but these codes need more validation 2 uncertainty from database the difficulty in obtaining hydrogeological data results in considerable uncertainty in geological stratification in addition the number and distribution of monitoring wells as well as the frequency of gw observed head may affect the initial conditions and calculation procedures for the model moreover the uncertainty of input data may also come from the heterogeneity of rainfall size of streamflow digital elevation model dem resolution soil land use land cover and so on 3 uncertainty from parameterization calibration of the model usually obtains the best performance by configuring model parameters however different combinations of parameters may produce similar results i e parameter non uniqueness a few efforts have been made to reduce uncertainty for example liu et al 2020b calibrated swat and modflow simultaneously using a pest parameter estimation by sequential testing approach for the uggerby river catchment in northern denmark while zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 calibrated swat modflow by particle swarm optimisation pso algorithm in the ega river basin spain more work is necessary to reduce uncertainties through appropriate parameterization akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 5 perspectives on swat modflow in an era of big data the coupled swat modflow model has been developed well in the past two decades however future work is needed to expand its potential application to the study of watershed hydro biogeochemistry at various temporal and spatial scales 1 adapting the coupled sw gw model to operate at multiple time scales current swat modflow simulation are mostly performed at mid or long term scales e g monthly yearly or decadal assessment table 3 little research has targeted the short term response of sw gw interactions to extreme events largely due to the lack of high temporal resolution monitoring data to calibrate and validate the model under global climate change extreme weather events such as storms and accompanied flooding likely become more frequent and intensive shrestha et al 2020 akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 these events dramatically alter watershed hydrography and cause a short term pulse of nutrient export chen et al 2018a 2018b although hourly data was integrated in modeling by sith et al 2019 it mainly focused on rainfall streamflow sediment and gw head therefore the swat modflow should be adapted to short time scales with high frequency data e g minutely hourly or daily to describe detailed hydrological responses under extreme climate conditions 2 reduce model uncertainties by refining model structure and local parameterization specific codes or modules should be developed and integrated into the current modeling framework to reflect the complicated interactions between surface and subsurface processes particularly in the case of human disturbances in the watershed e g artificial irrigation for a variety of crops crop growth and rotation impoundment or reservoirs and cross basin water diversion wei et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2015 triana et al 2020 liu et al 2020b guevara ochoa et al 2020a furthermore local parameterization is necessary to achieve good model performance in a specific watershed with heterogenetic characteristics meteorology geology soil land use etc bailey et al 2016 wei et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 3 expanding model objects and potential in studies of hydro biogeochemical process numerous studies yielded good results through the use of coupled swat modflow demonstrating the advantages and potential for future research narula and gosain 2013 guzman et al 2015 deb et al 2019 sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 however modeling of solute transport in the sw gw interaction has mainly focused on no3 n wei et al 2019 conan et al 2003 future research should emphasize on hydrology driven biogeochemical processes including the transport and cycling of other major constituents nitrogen and phosphorus species metals pesticides etc in the aquifer system and their interaction between sw and gw in addition previous studies mainly focused on the physical process of unsaturated flow al jaf et al 2020 liu et al 2020d but the effect of unsaturated flow on hydro biogeochemical process is still unclear which could be incorporated into swat modflow in the future work 4 facilitating transfer of model outputs into the decision making process with the rapid development of environmental sensors and auto monitoring techniques acquisition of high frequency measurement will become more convenient in an era of big data the use of internet of things iot and cloud computing techniques will make the swat modflow model more intelligent jiang et al 2011 big data assimilation can be expected to improve the predictability of swat modflow and support more detailed studies of hydrological dynamics this will allow the attainment of a systematic understanding of water and solute transport across surface runoff interflow and gw and downstream river guevara ochoa et al 2020a bailey et al 2020 gao et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 szymkiewicz et al 2020 narula and gosain 2013 to meet the requirement of sustainable water management and ecological restoration swat modflow should be linked with other biogeochemical models and combined into an integrated watershed management information system to assist decision making by non professional users pisinaras et al 2013 ni et al 2020 sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 norouzi khatiri et al 2020 6 conclusions in this paper we reviewed the main progress on coupling strategy between swat and modflow determined the research hotspots discerned major uncertainties and discussed the potential future work regarding swat modflow in summary the coupled surface and ground water models have proven their great potential in hydro biogeochemical studies and support the management of watershed ecology and environment

20073,the contamination of freshwater resource by heavy metals is still a major environmental and human health concern globally the release of these contaminants into the aquatic environment can lead to the pollution of water resources and generate risks for aquatic living organisms and human health the sediments can act as reservoir for heavy metals thereby they are used to assess the pollution status of the rivers in the present investigation surface sediments collected from two urban rivers named n djili and lukaya draining through the city of kinshasa democratic republic of the congo were characterized for grain size organic matter om and heavy metals additionally sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life sqgs enrichment factor ef and geoaccumulation index igeo were performed to determine the river pollution status the results highlight high concentrations of heavy metals in sediment samples mainly from n djili river reaching the values mg kg 1 of 180 3 cu 451 5 zn 185 8 pb and 4 1 hg these values exceed the sqgs based on ef and igeo values the sediments from the two rivers have severe enrichment and polluted with cu zn and pb and moderate enrichment of cr and as in general the positive correlation was observed between some heavy metals and om suggesting that these contaminants could have originated from common sources with a similar transport pathway based on the sqgs ef and igeo n djili river is considered as highly polluted with heavy metals indicating environmental and human health potential risks the results of this study clearly indicate that the pollution of urban rivers in developing countries can be explained by several anthropogenic activities such as urban runoff uncontrolled landfills in riverbanks untreated wastewater from densely populated areas anarchic commercial and industrial settlements and heavy road traffic the approaches used in this study represent a useful tool to assess the river sediment quality of urban river which can be applied to similar environment keywords tropical river watershed river contamination heavy metals anthropogenic activities human and environmental risk introduction the pollution of water resource by inorganic and organic contaminants is still a major environmental and human health issue across the world in the aquatic ecosystem heavy metals participate in numerous biogeochemical mechanisms and constitute serious concern owing to toxicity persistency bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes and their accumulation in the food chain wang and tessier 2009 dassenakis et al 2003 haller et al 2011 ouyang et al 2018 the environmental behavior of heavy metals depends on their specific chemical forms and their binding state which influence in turn their bioavailability mobility and toxicity to organisms wang and tessier 2009 wildi et al 2004 akcay et al 2003 previous studies have highlighted sediments as recipients and reservoirs of toxic heavy metals poté et al 2008 wildi et al 2004 the evaluation of environmental pollution by heavy metals and their environmental and human health adverse effects toxicological have been performed by several researches as summarized in recent review papers e g karaouzas et al 2021 briffa et al 2020 ouyang et al 2018 in developing nations under tropical conditions such as sub saharan countries the discharge of untreated urban effluents into river environments is a major concern kilunga et al 2017 anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to the contamination of urban rivers by organic and inorganic pollutants including heavy metals persistence organic pollutants pops pharmaceutical drugs such as antibiotics and pathogenic organisms which constitute major environmental and human health concerns mubedi et al 2013 kilunga et al 2017 laffite et al 2016 2020 al salah et al 2019 2020 ngweme et al 2021 devarajan et al 2015 consequently many studies have been performed to evaluate the accumulation of heavy metals in river sediments from developing countries and dietary exposure mubedi et al 2013 devarajan et al 2015 tamim et al 2016 laffite et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 although the assessment of heavy metals in the sediments from some urban rivers in kinshasa city has been performed by some studies e g mubedi et al 2013 mwanamoki et al 2014 2015 kilunga et al 2017 kayembe et al 2018a 2018b few data are available on the pollution of heavy metals for both n djili and lukaya rivers tshibanda et al 2014 these rivers flowing through the city of kinshasa serve as main sources of domestic use bathing fishing drinking water supply and irrigation for urban agriculture thus the evaluation of these rivers pollution by heavy metals will help to evaluate the risk to the local population and aquatic living organisms the assessment of heavy metals in freshwater sediments can be useful for the evaluation of the pollution of aquatic ecosystems thevenon et al 2012 2013 consequently the objective of the present study was to assess the pollution status of sediments from n djili and lukaya rivers the assessment was based on the sediment physicochemical characterization including sediment grain size organic matter and heavy metals including cr co ni cu zn as cd sb pb and hg materials and methods study sites and sampling procedure this study was performed in two rivers lukaya r1 and n djili r2 both flowing through the urban city of kinshasa fig 1 n djili river is the biggest tributary of congo river that drains kinshasa lukaya is a tributary

the results are presented in table 4 except for cr and cu the positive mutual correlation was observed between median grain size organic matter and heavy metals with coefficient values ranged between from 0 143 to 0 867 the positive correlation was observed between zn cd as pb and hg suggesting that these heavy metals are more likely to have originated from common sources with an eventual similar transport pathway additionally a positive correlation was observed between metals cu zn cd as pb and hg and om in the sediment samples suggesting that om and these metals have possibly originated from common sources and they are carried to the receiving system by common transporters poté et al 2008 haller et al 2011 conclusion this research constitutes the first assessment of heavy metal in sediments from both lukaya and n djili rivers the main conclusions are as following the obtained values for water physicochemical parameters t ph ec of investigated rivers lukaya and n djili were found to be within the permissible levels set by food and agriculture organization the sediment samples from both studied rivers were found to be sandy silts and unpolluted in om content with the exception of one site in n djili river presented high values of om 11 2 which could be attributed to agricultural and urban streaming found in this site the concentration of heavy metals in sediment samples from investigated rivers considerably varied with sampling sites based on the results of the levels of heavy metals in sediment samples compared with sqgs ef and igeo it can be concluded that sediments from investigated rivers are considered as highly polluted by heavy metals especially cu zn cd pb and hg these metals can have adverse and harmful effects on aquatic organisms and serious human health risk through frequent exposure pathways the rivers pollution may be explained by possible multiple diffuse pollution sources including uncontrolled landfills close to the river artisanal activities located in the riverbanks untreated hospital and industrial effluents water discharge into the river receiving systems and inadequate sewage and urban solid waste disposal that are directly released in water courses additionally the uncontrolled urbanization and rapid population growth in kinshasa city since two last decades cannot be excluded based on the obtained correlation matrix positive correlation was observed between metals cu zn cd as pb and hg and om in sediment samples suggesting that these heavy metals and om are more likely to have originated from common sources with an eventual similar transport pathway further studies with more sediment samples combined with ecotoxicological and persistence organic pollutants analyses in sediments from these two rivers are recommended the kinshasa city such as many large cities of developing countries does not have appropriate systems to control rapid urbanization and lacks wastewater treatment facilities to prevent environmental contamination by urban effluents on other hand there is no legal regulation of solid waste management in the studied city thus the results from this study strongly recommend implantation

20073,the contamination of freshwater resource by heavy metals is still a major environmental and human health concern globally the release of these contaminants into the aquatic environment can lead to the pollution of water resources and generate risks for aquatic living organisms and human health the sediments can act as reservoir for heavy metals thereby they are used to assess the pollution status of the rivers in the present investigation surface sediments collected from two urban rivers named n djili and lukaya draining through the city of kinshasa democratic republic of the congo were characterized for grain size organic matter om and heavy metals additionally sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life sqgs enrichment factor ef and geoaccumulation index igeo were performed to determine the river pollution status the results highlight high concentrations of heavy metals in sediment samples mainly from n djili river reaching the values mg kg 1 of 180 3 cu 451 5 zn 185 8 pb and 4 1 hg these values exceed the sqgs based on ef and igeo values the sediments from the two rivers have severe enrichment and polluted with cu zn and pb and moderate enrichment of cr and as in general the positive correlation was observed between some heavy metals and om suggesting that these contaminants could have originated from common sources with a similar transport pathway based on the sqgs ef and igeo n djili river is considered as highly polluted with heavy metals indicating environmental and human health potential risks the results of this study clearly indicate that the pollution of urban rivers in developing countries can be explained by several anthropogenic activities such as urban runoff uncontrolled landfills in riverbanks untreated wastewater from densely populated areas anarchic commercial and industrial settlements and heavy road traffic the approaches used in this study represent a useful tool to assess the river sediment quality of urban river which can be applied to similar environment keywords tropical river watershed river contamination heavy metals anthropogenic activities human and environmental risk introduction the pollution of water resource by inorganic and organic contaminants is still a major environmental and human health issue across the world in the aquatic ecosystem heavy metals participate in numerous biogeochemical mechanisms and constitute serious concern owing to toxicity persistency bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes and their accumulation in the food chain wang and tessier 2009 dassenakis et al 2003 haller et al 2011 ouyang et al 2018 the environmental behavior of heavy metals depends on their specific chemical forms and their binding state which influence in turn their bioavailability mobility and toxicity to organisms wang and tessier 2009 wildi et al 2004 akcay et al 2003 previous studies have highlighted sediments as recipients and reservoirs of toxic heavy metals poté et al 2008 wildi et al 2004 the evaluation of environmental pollution by heavy metals and their environmental and human health adverse effects toxicological have been performed by several researches as summarized in recent review papers e g karaouzas et al 2021 briffa et al 2020 ouyang et al 2018 in developing nations under tropical conditions such as sub saharan countries the discharge of untreated urban effluents into river environments is a major concern kilunga et al 2017 anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to the contamination of urban rivers by organic

from naturel and anthropogenic sources mavakala et al 2016 mwanamoki et al 2014 kilunga et al 2017 laffite et al 2020 according to the obtained igeo average values of selected metals the pollution status of these metals varied in the following order pb zn cu as cr the igeo classification of moderately to heavily polluted was observed for pb in samples from the sites es9 es12 es13 and es14 the sites es5 es6 es8 and es11 showed moderately polluted by pb while unpolluted to moderately polluted was found for the sites es1 es2 es3 and es4 for cr and as all sites showed practically unpolluted for both studied rivers r1 and r2 for cu the igeo classification practically unpolluted was observed for the sites es1 es3 es4 es5 es6 es7 and es8 and unpolluted to moderately polluted level for the sites es2 and es9 for zn practically unpolluted igeo classification was calculated for sites es1 es2 es3 es4 and es10 while unpolluted to moderately polluted was obtained for es5 es6 es7 es12 es13 and es 14 and moderately polluted level was observed for samples from es8 es9 and es11 generally the obtained igeo values were low for the all metals except values of cu zn and pb which are non negligible in the area of industrial effluent discharge and presence of uncontrolled landfill tshibanda et al 2014 correlation between parameters the spearman s rank order correlation matrix between sediment characteristics om median grain size and heavy metals cr cu zn cd as pb and hg was performed to determine potential links between these parameters and possible origins of contaminants poté et al 2008 the results are presented in table 4 except for cr and cu the positive mutual correlation was observed between median grain size organic matter and heavy metals with coefficient values ranged between from 0 143 to 0 867 the positive correlation was observed between zn cd as pb and hg suggesting that these heavy metals are more likely to have originated from common sources with an eventual similar transport pathway additionally a positive correlation was observed between metals cu zn cd as pb and hg and om in the sediment samples suggesting that om and these metals have possibly originated from common sources and they are carried to the receiving system by common transporters poté et al 2008 haller et al 2011 conclusion this research constitutes the first assessment of heavy metal in sediments from both lukaya and n djili rivers the main conclusions are as following the obtained values for water physicochemical parameters t ph ec of investigated rivers lukaya and n djili were found to be within the permissible levels set by food and agriculture organization the sediment samples from both studied rivers were found to be sandy silts and unpolluted in om content with the exception of one site in n djili river presented high values of om 11 2 which could be attributed to agricultural and urban streaming found in this site the concentration of heavy metals in sediment samples from investigated rivers considerably varied with sampling sites based on the results of the levels of heavy metals in sediment samples compared with sqgs ef and igeo it can be concluded that sediments from investigated rivers are considered as highly polluted by heavy metals especially cu zn cd pb and hg these metals can have adverse and harmful effects on aquatic organisms and serious human health risk through frequent exposure pathways the rivers pollution may be explained by possible multiple diffuse pollution sources including uncontrolled landfills close to the river artisanal activities located in the riverbanks untreated hospital and industrial effluents water discharge into the river receiving systems and inadequate sewage and urban solid waste disposal that are directly released in water courses additionally the uncontrolled urbanization and rapid population growth in kinshasa city since two last decades cannot be excluded based on the obtained correlation matrix positive correlation was observed between metals cu zn cd as pb and hg and om in sediment samples suggesting that these heavy metals and om are more likely to have originated from common sources with an eventual similar transport pathway further studies with more sediment samples combined with ecotoxicological and persistence organic pollutants analyses in sediments from these two rivers are recommended the kinshasa city such as many large cities of developing countries does not have appropriate systems to control rapid urbanization and lacks wastewater treatment facilities to prevent environmental contamination by urban effluents on other hand there is no legal regulation of solid waste management in the studied city thus the results from this study strongly recommend implantation

rise the management of water resources needs to balance values associated with but not limited to economy society ecology culture recreation and water quality to assist the management of water resources in the motueka riwaka plains new zealand a numerical integrated surface groundwater model was developed calibration of the transient integrated surface groundwater model was achieved with a root mean square error rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels model verification against groundwater levels not used in the calibration also resulted in an rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels model outputs coupled with groundwater trend analyses were used to identify the impact of groundwater abstractions on rivers streams and groundwater fed springs trend analyses showed that groundwater levels are lowering in the central area of the plains model scenarios predict that additional groundwater abstraction of over 30 000 m3 day from a well field located near the central area of the plains adjacent

of recent studies dedicated to understanding the interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies and the freshwater saltwater interface field studies are carried out to understand the dynamic behaviour of fluxes between surface and groundwater using various techniques such as distributed temperature sensing dye tracing tests dilution tests hydrochemical heat tracers pumping tests e

past trends in groundwater levels assessing the likely causes of groundwater trends assessing the likely impacts of sea level rise on saltwater intrusion and assessing the likely impacts of various groundwater abstraction scenarios especially from a proposed well field on groundwater levels and surface water flows 2 motueka riwaka plains the motueka and riwaka plains is situated in the north of the south island of new zealand and covers approximately 40 km2 fig 1 one of its primary industries is growing apples basher 2003 the aquifer system underlying the motueka riwaka plains is a primary source of water for irrigation industrial community domestic and stock water supplies the motueka township the nearby riwaka settlement and the kaiteriteri community fig 1 use reticulated potable community water supplied from the aquifer system many other houses outside of the reticulated supply areas have individual shallow domestic bores for water supply the average annual groundwater abstraction within the model area is approximately 7 1 mm3 year which amounts to approximately 95 of the total water abstractions including from surface water increased aquifer abstraction is proposed to supplement the motueka community water supply scheme and to supply smaller communities along the coast to the south the primary water use within the plains is irrigation with an annual average of approximately 5 8 million m3 or 82 of total use followed by 15 for industries and 3 for domestic purposes tdc 2020 2 1 climate the average annual rainfall of the motueka riwaka plains is approximately 1350 mm year of which nearly one third occurs in the winter months cliflo 2019 potential evapotranspiration is usually higher than rainfall during summer months december to february resulting in an average summer soil moisture deficit of nearly 200 mm year macara 2016 temperatures are relatively mild throughout the year with the long term average daily temperature reaching 17 4 c in february and dropping to 7 c in july with a daily temperature variation averaging 10 c cliflo 2019 2 2 geology there are a range of rock types that exist in the plains including old igneous and sedimentary rocks originating from the upper motueka headwaters a complex array of sedimentary and igneous rocks underlying the western tributaries and moutere gravels and younger alluvium underlying the middle and lower reaches and eastern tributaries of the motueka river basher 2003 grindley 1980 johnston 1990 rattenbury et al 1998 alluvial gravels of late quaternary age underly the motueka riwaka plains which is bounded in the west north and base by faulted granite rock and in the south by older low permeability moutere gravels the motueka riwaka plains consists of a series of aggradation layers with young sand deposits along the coast at the mouth of the motueka river rattenbury et al 1998 young sediments underlying the terraces and floodplains are highly permeable store large quantities of water and play an important role in sustaining stream flow basher 2003 2 3 hydrology and hydrogeology two main rivers flow through the motueka riwaka plains the mean flow of the largest river the motueka at woodmans bend fig 1 is 61 4 m3 s with a median flow of 38 3 m3 s the mean flow of the smaller riuwaka river formerly known as the riwaka river is 4 4 m3 s tdc 2020 there are also several other streams and drains which also sustain ecological and cultural values mean monthly flows display a noticeable seasonal fluctuation with higher values in winter and spring and lower values in the summer months basher 2003 periodic large floods are a characteristic feature of the hydrology of the motueka river the 7 day mean annual low flow of the motueka river flow at woodmans bend is estimated to be approximately 10 7 m3 s tdc 2020 the groundwater resources within the model area are highly interconnected with the motueka and riuwaka rivers and previous investigations indicated that a large proportion of aquifer recharge is sourced from these rivers robb 1999 weir 2007 alluvial aquifers in the area consist of gravels well rounded clasts predominately of granite sandstone siltstone and basic igneous rock and sand all of which provide highly permeable substrate for high surface groundwater interaction and aquifer throughflow 2 4 land use approximately half of the motueka riwaka plains is used for growing fruit and vegetable crops this is dominated by apple 1260 ha and kiwifruit 550 ha orchards all of which are irrigated the area of irrigated pasture has declined over the last two decades and currently covers about 2 of the study area the unirrigated area is used predominately for residential town and industrial purposes including tourism related businesses 3 model development a modflow 2005 groundwater model harbaugh 2005 was prepared to help meet the objectives of the study the model was constructed as an integrated surface water groundwater flow and contaminant transport model weir and thomas 2017 provided under supplementary information the transport component of the model was developed using mt3dms zheng 2010 1992 a uniform grid size of 100 m 100 m with three hydrogeological layers was employed each hydrological layer aquifer or aquitard was divided into two further numerical layers to improve the numerical accuracy the simulation period ran from 1 june 1990 through to 31 may 2012 with daily stress periods 8035 days model development and calibration are described below 3 1 conceptual model a conceptual model rajanayaka et al 2008 weir and thomas 2017 for the study area was first developed from the existing understanding of hydrogeology and hydrology along with stratigraphic information from bore logs in summary the aquifer system is bounded in the west north and base by faulted granite rock and in the south by older low permeability moutere gravels the lithology and thickness of the aquifer layers is variable a schematic cross section of the aquifer system is shown in fig 2 thicknesses of the alluvial gravels in the central area of the plains are approximately 20 30 m and reduce to about 6 m towards the fringes to the south the gravels are mixed with material flushed from the moutere valley and have a high content of fine sands silts and clays the aquifer system is primarily recharged from rivers and additional recharge occurs through rainfall and irrigation recharge across the plains groundwater exits the aquifer system by subsurface flow into tasman bay springs near the coast rivers or via groundwater pumping based on the above information groundwater flows in or out of the model area through the north west and south lateral boundaries flow exchanges through the granite basement are insignificant and have been replicated as a no flow boundary the eastern coastal boundary of the upper model layer has been assigned a general head to represent the discharge of groundwater to the sea the deeper layers of the aquifer system continue under the marine sediments and are restricted to discharge vertically into the upper layer via diffuse seepage 3 2 land surface recharge daily time series of land surface recharge lsr were generated using the soil crop water balance model irricalc bright 2009 irricalc uses the theoretical framework of the daily soil water balance modelling by the food and agricultural organization allen et al 1998 the crop soil water balance model simulates the variable use of water in agriculture and horticulture with differing crops soil types climate and irrigation strategies along with an irrigation scheduling component climate data for the irricalc model was obtained from the niwa climate station database cliflo 2019 soil information and water holding properties were reproduced from robb 1999 which sourced data from the new zealand fundamental soil layer newsome et al 2008 it was assumed that lsr under residential areas was equivalent to 50 of unirrigated pasture average annual lsr for the whole model is approximately 680 mm year and varies between 250 and 950 mm year due to the shallow depth to groundwater on the motueka riwaka plains vadose zone travel time are relatively short and have been ignored consequently it is assumed that any land surface recharge will enter the aquifer instantly after leaving the root zone 3 3 motueka and riuwaka rivers the main rivers and streams are represented in the model using modflow s stream flow routing sfr2 package niswonger and prudic 2009 this routes water from upstream interacting with groundwater gaining and losing as the river passes over the plains stream cells are located solely in the uppermost numerical layer the exchange of water between surface water and groundwater is determined through a combination of the bed conductivity and the gradient between the river free surface and underlying groundwater levels niswonger and prudic 2009 prudic et al 2004 channel geometry was defined by variable shaped cross sections each with eight points which were specified as model inputs based on surveyed data the sfr2 package then used this information with the manning equation to derive wetted perimeter and river stage manning roughness coefficients for all streams have been set at a constant value of 0 029 for main channels and 0 035 for river banks these values were derived from streeter and wylie 1981 for bed materials of gravel and earth with stones or weeds respectively reach length was determined by the length of the river passing through each model cell actual bed thicknesses for all reaches are generally unknown but have been set at a nominal constant value of 0 5 m stream bed hydraulic conductivity for each reach was determined through model calibration the average low flow measured loss from the motueka river is 0 97 m3 s measured data are listed in supplementary information 3 4 springs and drains springs and spring fed drains have been represented using the modflow drain drn package harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2000 three key spring fed drain networks were modelled thorpe drain staples drain and frys drain fig 1 drain cells are located solely in the model s uppermost layer drain cells act to remove water from the aquifer at a rate proportional to the difference between the groundwater level elevation in the drain cell and a specified drain invert elevation harbaugh 2005 a specified drain conductance factor also contributes to determining the rate of water removal if groundwater levels are below the invert of the drain then no flow is removed the drain is dry drain invert levels and conductances were generally unknown so these parameters were adjusted during the calibration process 3 5 parameterisation parameterisation of the model was based on both zonification and pilot points doherty et al 2010 the available information on geological and hydrogeological formations and aquifer test results were used for zonifications for assigning initial parameter values and to constrain parameter ranges for model calibration pilot points were used for assigning spatially variable parameters for horizontal hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients for all three layers upper aquifer intermediate aquitard and lower aquifer vertical hydraulic conductivity for each layer has been denoted by a single value the motueka and riuwaka rivers within the model area were divided into eight reaches for parameterisation of the riverbed conductivity similarly parameterisation for drain conductances and general head boundary conductances at the coastal boundary was employed using three and eight zones respectively 3 6 model calibration the key dataset used to calibrate the model was groundwater levels but spring and drain flow data was also considered as were flow losses from the motueka river fig 3 shows the locations of groundwater monitoring bores which were used for model calibration eighteen monitoring groundwater bores on the motueka riwaka plains were used for calibration details are given under supplementary information flow data collected from drains is sparse and consists of one off spot measurements typically made during periods of low rainfall during summer months and at low tides flows measured during these dry periods represent the baseflow groundwater component of the drain at the time in addition to the one off spot measurements a flow recorder was installed temporarily near the thorpe drain outlet from may 1990 through to august 1994 a summary of available data for the three drain networks is given under supplementary information there are no flow measurements for staples drain visual inspections pers comms gordon curnow tasman district council tdc over the 2012 2013 summer indicated that the average baseflow from this drain is typically in the order of 50 200 l s the flows measured by the thorpe drain recorder include quick flow run off e g stormwater and field tile drainage from the land surface as well as the slower baseflow contribution from groundwater simultaneous gaugings of river flows in the motueka river provided estimates of net river flow losses to groundwater during lower flows motueka river flows at woodmans bend fig 1 have been compared with flows at the state highway bridge to calculate the net loss of river flow to groundwater on the days of measurements the results that fall within the model simulation period can be found under supplementary information these all occur within the verification period aquifer test data typically signify the local characteristics and are not representative of an extended area therefore the aquifer test data have not been used to calibrate the model they have however been used to constrain aquifer parameters in the test data locations the integrated surface water groundwater model was calibrated using parameter estimation software pest doherty 2018 table 1 presents the groundwater level objective function values for the calibrated model along with additional statistics that have been generated and a brief description of these statistics the normalised rmse of 2 6 indicates the model is suitably calibrated donnell 2004 mdbc 2001 barnet et al 2012 fig 4 presents a plot of modelled versus measured groundwater levels for the 18 observation bores used for calibrating the groundwater model in total 40 742 groundwater level measurements over the period 1 january 2001 through to 31 may 2012 were used in calibration fig 5 presents a histogram of the residuals along with a theoretical normal distribution fig 6 compares residuals to measured groundwater levels and the mean error the residuals are relatively close to a normal distribution the plots show a small positive bias all measured motueka river losses provided under supplementary information fall within the model verification period therefore no comparison was made for river losses for the calibration period sensitivity analyses have been generated by pest fig 7 provides a summary of the sensitivities of the zone parameters details are given in supplementary information to the objective function 3 7 model verification data used for model verification may be measured at a different simulation time from the period used for calibration verification in time at a different location in the model domain verification in space or a combination of both model verification in time has been conducted for the period 1 june 1990 to 31 december 2000 verification in space adds in the smith monitoring bore this being the only bore that does not have groundwater level measurements after 31 december 2000 a plot of simulated versus measured groundwater levels for the verification period is presented in fig 8 model statistics for the verification period are listed in table 2 these statistics are similar to the calibration period statistics table 1 and like the calibration period they are smaller than accepted industry standards donnell 2004 mdbc 2001 barnet et al 2012 4 results entire model simulation period the normalised mean error me and rmse of the groundwater level objective function for the entire model simulation period 1 june 1990 to 31 may 2012 are 1 3 and 2 3 respectively hydrographs of measured and simulated groundwater levels in the 18 observation bores piezometric surface maps for several selected days flows in the three drains and losses from the motueka river for the full simulation period are given in supplementary information the average modelled losses from the motueka river for the dates for which the measurements were carried out see section 3 3 is 0 72 m3 s the motueka riwaka plains are divided into seven zones for water management purposes fig 9 the modflow zone budget tool harbaugh 1990 was used to analyse the water exchange into and out of these zones to assist in assessing water management options water exchanges for the calibrated model for each management zone averaged over the entire simulation period 1 june 1990 31 may 2012 are presented in fig 9 the values for abstraction and drainage represent rates as estimated using irricalc bright 2009 changes in storage are not presented in these figures only the long term average therefore the summaries do not present the complete flow budget 5 trend analysis trend analyses of groundwater levels were undertaken to complement integrated surface groundwater modelling to further understand the impact of hydroclimatic and land use change on the groundwater resources the sites which had long term groundwater level data 2 years were used for this analysis kerr and weir 2017 the summary statistics for the sites can be found under supplementary information summary variables were extracted from the observations to provide an indication of overall trend and to assist with attribution of the cause of any detected trends summary variables employed were monthly average groundwater levels annual minimums annual maximums change in levels over the non irrigation season and equivalent change over the irrigation season the annual maximums and minimums were calculated from monthly average series the daily observations were not used directly to avoid rapid changes in groundwater levels associated with pumping or recharge from influencing trend analysis the change in groundwater level over the non irrigation season was calculated by subtracting the post irrigation february to june minimum from the pre irrigation september october maximum fig 10 positive values indicate an increase in groundwater levels the pre irrigation season maximum is not always the annual maximum as it is possible for the groundwater level to peak prior to september the 1st for the purposes of assessing the effects of irrigation september 1st was considered appropriate the change in groundwater level over the irrigation season was calculated by subtracting the pre irrigation september october maximum of the previous year from the post irrigation february to june minimum fig 10 negative values indicate a decrease in groundwater level time series plots of all data and the summary variables are also provided in supplementary information for each summary variable at each site trends were assessed qualitatively through plots and quantitatively using statistical metrics these are discussed below 5 1 qualitative assessments four sites rossiter wratt riwaka hall and horrell have more than 30 years of data enabling an assessment of long term trends visual qualitative assessment of the time series see supplementary material for each bore indicates that rossiter and wratt have an almost continuous decreasing trend the riwaka hall and horrell data appear to initially have a decreasing trend then remain steady from about 2000 trends are not clear on any of the other sites the variation in levels is similar between the long term sites indicating that individual bore properties are not obscuring the aquifer level response and that the aquifer levels vary synchronously across the region 5 2 statistical assessment of monthly averages the mann kendal test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was applied to the monthly and annual time series for monthly data the seasonal mann kendall test is used which applies the test to all january s data then all february s data etc then averages these results this leads to a more robust measure of the trend than using annual values and accounts for seasonality groundwater exhibits serial correlation whereby the groundwater level of one month affects the groundwater level of subsequent months and so monthly levels are not independent this affects the calculation of the likelihood of a trend being observed by chance the p value generally leading to under estimated values a corrected p value can be calculated which considers serial correlation and provides an improved measure of the likelihood of the trend occurring by chance series require more than 10 years of data for the corrected p value to be determined the results of the seasonal mann kendall test are presented in table 3 slopes of the trends are shown for those sites where the trend has a less than 0 05 likelihood of occurring by chance five of the series were not long enough to establish the corrected p value therefore the uncorrected p values are also shown slopes were calculated using the kendall slope estimator the p values are reported to three decimal places so sites with p values of 0 have trends that are highly unlikely less than 1 chance in 1000 to have occurred by chance the cut off level of p 0 05 1 chance in 20 was arbitrarily selected as the threshold below which it is not unreasonable to expect the trend to be real statistically significant decreasing trends were found for rossiter wratt riwaka hall and horrell though the trend for horrell was weak this confirms the visual assessment statistically significant increasing trends were found for staples st and lodders though for a much reduced period 11 years the statistically significant corrected p 0 05 trends are shown in fig 11 5 3 statistical assessment of annual time series a mann kendall test for trend of the annual summary variables and their slopes calculated using the thiel sen s slope sen 1968 thiel 1950 is provided in table 4 slopes are only provided for those sites that returned a p value less than 0 05 the three sites with strong decreasing trends in the monthly series also show decreasing trends for their annual maximum and annual minimum values for each of these sites their annual minimum values are decreasing faster than their annual maximums the horrell site also showed a decreasing trend for the annual minimums though not as large as for rossiter wratt and riwaka hall only rossiter returned statistically significant trends in the non irrigation season winter change in levels increasing by 14 mm year and the irrigation season summer change in levels extra loss of 13 mm year for rossiter the irrigation season decline is increasing but the non irrigation season recharge compensates for it 5 4 trend analysis discussion long term changes in groundwater levels may be a result of one or a combination of factors some likely causes include degradation lowering of the motueka river bed increased groundwater pumping changes in irrigation efficiency increased sea levels and climate trends each of these factors have a signature effect on groundwater levels presence of that signature in the observed trends provides indication that the factor is at play for each factor a plausible groundwater impact signature is described and compared to the observed trends as follows degraded river levels will lower the annual groundwater maximum levels and for the same groundwater pumping lead to a lowered annual minimum groundwater level the lower motueka river has degraded at an average rate of 23 mm year between 1978 and 2001 sriboonlue and basher 2003 of the four sites with more than 35 years of data three have statistically significant downward trends in annual groundwater minimums and maximums consistent with the impact of a degraded riverbed the long term site without a statistically significant trend in annual maximums horrell is the farthest from the motueka river so it may be beyond the limit of the river s influence increased groundwater pumping will lower the annual minimum groundwater levels increase irrigation season groundwater level lowering but only decrease maximum groundwater levels on the years when winter recharge is low all four long term sites show reducing trends in their annual groundwater minimums but only one site rossiter shows a change in summer irrigation season groundwater level lowering so the changes cannot be unambiguously attributed to increased pumping for rossiter the irrigation season decline is attributed to increased pumping over time from the nearby lower moutere water scheme in recent years new bores have been installed near the rossiters bore to service this scheme increased irrigation efficiency without increased groundwater pumping will increase the summer decline of irrigation season groundwater level lowering owing to reductions in irrigation recharge as described above only one site has increased summer declines in irrigation season groundwater level lowering so any impact from increased irrigation efficiency is not apparent increased sea levels will lead to an increase in coastal groundwater levels sea level around new zealand has historically increased at approximately 1 6 mm year new zealand government 2009 two near coast sites lodders and staples st show increasing trends but at much greater magnitudes 16 17 mm year than sea level rise indicates sea level rise is not the cause of their increasing groundwater levels climate trends affect the amount of rainfall evapotranspiration and river flows there are indications of increased rainfall in winter and spring decreased rainfall in autumn and no change in summer for the motueka region caloiero 2015 at the same time temperature and hence evapotranspiration has been increasing mullan et al 2001 the impact of increased winter rainfall would only be observed if the winter aquifer recharge was water limited the impact of increased evapotranspiration would mainly be seen through increased irrigation and its associated groundwater pumping the complexity of the relationship between climate and hydrology does not enable simple attribution based on observed trends however the projections of climate change impacts on groundwater without sea level change indicate a near net zero effect weir and thomas 2017 after consideration of the effects above aa possible explanation for the observed trends are that the degrading motueka river is leading to lowering of the aquifer s maximum level particularly in proximity to the river more sites returned trends in annual minimum groundwater levels suggesting that increased groundwater pumping is having an impact but this is not certain as only one site rossiters is showing an associated summer loss trends increase in irrigation season groundwater level lowering the increasing trend in groundwater levels at two coastal sites staples st and lodders may be related to reduced pumping in those areas as households switch from domestic bores to reticulated supply sourced from more inland bores these two sites have just 11 years of data when the data for all sites were re analysed using only 2007 2017 data staples st and lodders were the only sites that showed a statistically significant trend rossiter wratt riwaka hall and horrell the long term sites all showed no statistically significant trend for the limited 2007 2017 period this indicates the trend at staples st and lodders is not widespread but does not clarify whether it is only a relatively recent effect the combined series from tui close and owr do not show any trend despite a combined record length of 28 years these sites are located at a distance from the motueka river and close to the shore for the three long term sites with the decreasing annual maximums rossiter wratt and riwaka hall their annual minimum levels are decreasing faster than their annual maximums this rate differential will increase the likelihood of the aquifer not fully recharging over winter understanding this probability is an important consideration for reliability of supply and provides potential direction for future assessments for all of the trend assessments described the lack of a statistically significant trend does not necessarily mean that no trend exists it just means that the trend if it exists is too small to discern from the variability of the time series only with longer time series of data does the detection of trends become increasingly possible 6 model predictions the calibrated motueka riwaka plains groundwater model was used to assess different management scenarios these scenarios consider the effects on the groundwater system and surface water bodies from different abstraction and water use management options over the plains including potential degradation of the motueka riverbed and potential sea level rise managing abstractions without causing saltwater intrusion is the principal concern of the water management authority tdc as demonstrated by rajanayaka et al 2008 and weir and thomas 2017 the hau plains zone is the most sensitive area to saltwater intrusion primarily due to the local hydrogeology the water bearing gravels thin towards the southern margins of the plains distance from the main recharge source the motueka river and overall water abstractions in the area saltwater intrusion has previously occurred in areas of the hau plains once in the early 1990 s and more recently during the 2014 15 summer the 1990 s event was attributed to local over pumping near the coast and the 2014 15 event was attributed to the failure of a non return valve on a coastal stormwater outlet addressing those issues and local mitigation measures e g moving pumping wells for irrigated areas further inland from the coastal areas and reducing groundwater abstractions from near the coast have avoided recurrence of localised saltwater intrusion events to further reduce the risk of saltwater intrusion in these coastal margins tdc impose 35 water restrictions for droughts exceeding 1 in 10 year events in the hau plains zone the primary trigger for considering saltwater intrusion in the hau plains had been groundwater levels in the fernwood coastal monitoring bore rajanayaka et al 2008 tested the influence of domestic pumping in the hau plains and found that removing the domestic pumping in the hau plains for droughts exceeding 1 in 10 year events had no noticeable effect on flows across the coastal boundary or groundwater levels at the coast this is because domestic abstraction in this area is small compared to irrigation pumping given this outcome no restrictions to domestic pumping were considered in the scenarios considered scenario details results temporal and spatial and criteria for sustainable additional abstraction are discussed below 6 1 scenario details the calibrated model was used to assess several scenarios see table 5 to assist in assessing the impacts of different water resource management regimes an initial model scenario was run that considers no groundwater pumping this scenario represents a quasi natural state of the groundwater system unaffected by groundwater abstraction and subsequent use this scenario does not represent the true natural state of the system as it assumes the existing land cover and that the existing altered state of waterways remains stop banks channel alignments drains etc a second model scenario was then run that considers the current state of groundwater development this scenario was based on the calibrated model but assumes that the existing status quo level of groundwater development land use and corresponding land surface recharge occurs for the entire model simulation period this scenario represents a baseline of existing use against which future changes can be compared various other scenarios were run to assess the effects of additional abstraction from the proposed parker street well field fig 1 and the effectiveness of different management regimes to reduce effects on the groundwater system the different management scenarios assessed can be grouped into two broad categories a scenarios without water restrictions and b scenarios with 35 groundwater abstraction restrictions in the hau plains and the coastal exclusion zone for drought years exceeding a 1 in 10 year event within each of these two broad categories the following management scenarios have been considered 1 an additional 20 000 m3 day abstraction from the proposed parker street well field located adjacent to the motueka river to supply a future urban supply 2 a further 5000 m3 day 25 000 m3 day total from the proposed well field and 3 a further 5000 m3 day 30 000 m3 day total from the proposed well field in addition a further four scenarios were developed one scenario considers the effects of motueka river bed degradation another assesses the aquifer flow response from predicted sea level rise the final two assess the effects of two extremes of projected climate changes in rainfall potential evapotranspiration and river flows the scenario numbers are listed in table 5 a detailed description of these scenarios is presented in weir and thomas 2017 and a summary of the scenarios follows motueka riverbed degradation the motueka river bed inverts are lowered by 0 3 m at woodman s bend and pro rated to zero towards the sea i e no bed invert change at the sea river cross sectional shapes remain unchanged sea level rise mfe 2014 recommends that consideration be given to the potential effects from a range of possible sea level rise values and suggests that a sea level rise of at least 0 8 m be considered bell 2014 suggests that through adopting a 100 year planning timeframe sea level rises of up to 1 0 m should be accommodated a permanent sea level rise of 1 0 m has been applied to the model s coastal boundary climate change dry lowest projected rainfall and highest projected pet for 2090 95 year trends niwa 2015 climate change wet highest projected rainfall and lowest projected pet for 2090 95 year trends niwa 2015 6 2 scenario results key results from each management scenario and the calibrated scenario for groundwater levels mouteka river losses and spring discharge are summarised below further results of groundwater flow budgets are presented in weir and thomas 2017 see supplementary information 6 2 1 groundwater levels 6 2 1 1 temporal effects scenario results show that as abstraction increases low groundwater levels during the summer periods reduce further i e there is an increase in the saw tooth effect for example fig 12 a depicts groundwater level dynamics at fernwood site for the calibration scenario and scenarios 1 5 however bores located near to rivers do not lower noticeably with increased abstraction due to the regulating effect of the river comparing the no abstraction calibration and baseline scenarios there is no visible long term cumulative decline in groundwater levels from year to year by and large groundwater levels return to the no abstraction state most years during the wetter winter periods when irrigation abstractions cease in some cases groundwater levels in the shallow aquifer return a little higher than the no abstraction scenario for a short time period due to a net transfer of water from deep to shallow layers via irrigation and increased land surface recharge the groundwater system recovers quickly from the hydraulic effects of pumping under scenarios 3 5 which include the effects of continuous abstraction from the parker street well field groundwater levels in some bores are constantly reduced particularly in bores located in close proximity to the well field such as the two nursery bores and to a lesser extent rossiters and greenwood this is due to the sustained nature of the well field abstraction which does not turn off during winter in the same way that irrigation takes do should the well field cease abstracting then groundwater levels would recover similar groundwater level hydrographs are not provided for scenarios 6 8 as these are identical to scenarios 3 5 apart for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 instead fig 13 presents low groundwater level hydrographs for the fernwood coastal monitoring bore which is used by the water management authority to manage regional saltwater intrusion over the 2001 period when restrictions were imposed this shows hau plains restrictions reduce groundwater level lowering by approximately 0 1 m in the fernwood coastal monitoring bore which has a positive effect on reducing the risk of saltwater intrusion during dry periods a sea level rise of 1 m scenario 10 results in a rise in groundwater levels over much of the plains but the rise is more prominent with proximity to the coast bores located close to rivers are modelled to experience very little effect from sea level rise owing to the regulating effect of the river the rise in groundwater levels is continuous over the full simulation period as depicted in fig 12 b 6 2 1 2 spatial effects spatial impacts of the scenarios were assessed on 24 march 2001 and 24 january 2006 these two dates were chosen to represent the groundwater system in a state of stress when groundwater levels were low as a consequence of low recharge both land surface recharge and river recharge and high groundwater abstraction when 30 000 m3 day is taken scenario 5 the groundwater level lowering increases to 0 0 8 m and 0 8 1 2 m nearer the well field location for the above dates motueka river bed degradation scenario 9 affects groundwater levels primarily in the upper reaches of the river where the greatest bed lowering is simulated in this area a groundwater level lowering of 0 2 0 3 m is modelled from a bed lowering of 0 3 m the effects propagate from the river s upper reaches and diminish over a distance of approximately 2 3 km from either side of the river with only a small effect 0 1 m beyond this groundwater level changes due to motueka river bed degradation are relatively consistent between the two dates 24 march 2001 and 24 january 2006 a sea level rise of 1 m scenario 10 results in a rise in groundwater levels at the coast of approximately 0 8 m the motueka and riuwaka rivers partially regulate the groundwater level rise elsewhere a rise of 0 2 m or more is modelled to extend up to 3 km inland from the coast these results are relatively consistent between the two dates 24 march 2001 and 24 january 2006 of concern with sea level rise is the potential for groundwater flooding whereby groundwater levels reach the surface causing ponding adversely affecting land use to assess this risk a date of 13 august 1990 has been considered which is when highest groundwater levels were measured over the period of record fig 14 presents the area of the plains where shallow groundwater levels were predicted to reach the land surface under the calibrated model and for the sea level rise scenario scenario 10 during an extreme wet period as represented by 13 august 1990 this assessment shows that some areas of the coastal plains would have experienced historical groundwater flooding if sea level was to rise 1 m then during very wet periods the area of groundwater flooding is modelled to move up to 1 km inland from where historical flooding occurred the greatest horizontal shift is around the golf course see fig 1 and into the south eastern areas of motueka township groundwater level differences for climate change scenarios 11 and 12 are provided in weir and thomas 2017 see supplementary information 6 2 2 groundwater recharge from the motueka river and discharge to springs drains table 5 lists the average modelled groundwater recharge from the motueka river and groundwater discharge to the drains i e drain flows for the entire model period as well as for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 two 1 in 10 year drought periods the groundwater recharge includes the contribution from brooklyn stream which is a tributary of the motueka river and little sydney stream fig 1 also included in table 5 is the percent flow change compared to the calibration scenario generally groundwater abstraction results in an increase in recharge from the motueka river to groundwater this most likely occurs because groundwater abstraction lowers groundwater levels which in turn increases the hydraulic gradient between the river and adjacent groundwater typically the river loses a greater proportion of flow to groundwater during dry periods compared to average the reason for this most likely is twofold firstly the river flows are lower hence any loss is proportionally greater and secondly groundwater abstraction and therefore induced river loss is greater during dry periods compared to the long term average comparing the no abstraction and calibrated scenarios historical abstraction has resulted in an increase in average motueka river losses of approximately 2 and up to 19 during dry periods as shown in table 5 during these dry periods losses are modelled to increase a further 3 6 under the baseline scenario scenario 1 restrictions in the hau plains scenarios 6 8 have very little impact 1 at most on motueka river recharge to groundwater compared to scenarios 3 5 lowering the motueka river bed scenario 9 reduces the losses by 1 2 compared to the baseline scenario this is because the lower river elevations reduce the hydraulic gradients between the river and adjacent groundwater sea level rise scenario 10 is predicted to reduce motueka river losses by 8 15 this is because the resulting raised groundwater levels reduce the hydraulic gradient between the river and adjacent groundwater sea level change with climate change scenarios 12 and 14 provides similar change to sea level rise alone scenario 10 climate change alone scenarios 11 and 13 results in a very small change in river recharge less than 3 increased groundwater abstraction results in reduced drain flows the greater percentage changes occur during dry periods when drain flows are naturally lower due to low groundwater levels during these dry periods the predicted percentage changes in flows are large for some scenarios to control this tdc s tasman resource management plan has set a maximum allowable spring depletion level for the natural springs in the region this is to ensure that flows are not significantly altered from natural flows that sustain ecological and cultural values the allowable average spring depletion in the central plains zone is 35 comparing results from the no abstraction and calibrated scenarios a large reduction in drain flows is predicted to result from existing groundwater abstraction thorpe drain is predicted to be affected more by groundwater abstraction compared to the other two drains due to its location relative to regional groundwater flow directions and areas of greatest groundwater use including the parker street well field hau plains restrictions scenarios 6 8 are predicted to benefit thorpe drain by 5 8 during dry periods compared to scenarios 3 5 of the three drains modelled thorpe drain is the only drain located in the vicinity of the hau plains management zone consequently the other two drains show no benefit from hau plains restrictions the small changes in regional groundwater levels predicted near the drains as a result of motueka river bed degradation scenario 9 results in a reduction in average drain flows by 0 3 and 4 16 during dry periods sea level rise scenario 10 is predicted to substantially increase all drain flows however raised sea level is likely to result in additional sea water seeping diffusing and or back flowing into these drains currently water flowing in the drains is brackish sea level rise is likely to increase the salt content in these drains sea level change with climate change scenarios 12 and 14 provides similar changes to sea level rise alone scenario 10 climate change alone scenarios 11 and 13 results in changes in drain flows of 14 compared with other scenarios 6 3 sustainable additional abstraction in order to compare scenarios and assess a sustainable level of additional abstraction from the parker street well field it is necessary to establish one or more decision criteria as the principal concern relating to groundwater abstraction is managing saltwater intrusion decision criteria have been decided to assess the potential for saltwater intrusion decision criteria comprise a decision variable and a decision trigger these are discussed below to monitor for saltwater intrusion in the coastal margin of the hau plains tdc established the fernwood groundwater level monitoring bore the recorded lowest groundwater level in this bore was 0 52 m amsl on 24 january 2006 both groundwater level and groundwater flux are important controls of potential saltwater intrusion and as such both have been chosen as decision variables considering both the timing of the lowest groundwater levels in the fernwood monitoring bore and the lowest rainfall over the first 90 days of any year two time periods have been considered for decision variables these being the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 given this and the criteria above for assessing saltwater intrusion risk the following three decision variables have been chosen the average groundwater level at fernwood for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 the average seaward flux for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 and the occurrence of landward flux as a result of historical occurrences of saltwater intrusion in the coastal zone of the hau plains tdc s guideline for managing saltwater intrusion has specified a groundwater level of 0 5 m amsl in any coastal monitoring bore rajanayaka et al 2008 this is approximately the same as the lowest measured groundwater level in this bore 0 52 m amsl however salt water has never been observed in the bore since in addition the lowest groundwater level occurred without any restrictions in place as tdc now implement water abstraction restrictions in the hau plains for drought years and saltwater intrusion has not occurred since even given some very dry years a trigger of 0 4 m amsl was chosen in collaboration with tdc the model has been used to represent the coastal flux for consistency with previous studies the seaward flux trigger was set equal to 80 of the flux modelled under the calibration scenario under the calibration scenario the average coastal flux over the first 90 days of 2001 was 0 7 m3 s and over the first 90 days of 2006 was 0 65 m3 s therefore 80 of these values is 0 56 m3 s and 0 52 m3 s respectively the lesser of the two 0 52 m3 s has been chosen as the trigger as shown in table 6 the groundwater level trigger at the fernwood bore and the seaward flux trigger have both been assessed for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 however the third decision variable trigger landward flux has been assessed for the entire model period there should be no occurrences of landward flux i e groundwater should be flowing out to sea at all times no criteria are predicted to be breached under scenarios 1 9 11 and 13 results are given in supplementary information which suggests that more than 30 000 m3 day could be abstracted sustainably from the parker street well field so long as sea level rise either does not occur or that the effects of it are adequately managed sea level rise scenarios 10 12 and 14 is predicted to result in coastal backflow of sea water into the aquifer system if the simulated magnitude of sea level rise occurs then saltwater intrusion may need to be managed to protect water quality in bores located nearer the coast or managed retreat of coastal takes may be needed based on the above analyses under historical patterns of climate and subsequent river flows and land surface drainage groundwater abstraction of over 30 000 m3 day is predicted to be sustainable from the parker street well field without breaching coastal saltwater intrusion criteria 7 future work as managing abstractions without causing saltwater intrusion is the principal concern for tdc the inclusion of density dependent flow into the model will improve the accuracy seawat langevin 2009 which is a generic modflow mt3dms based computer program can be used to model 3d variable density groundwater it is important that reliability robustness and accuracy of model conceptualisation observations parameters and the numerical model and risks and impacts of the decisions made using the model are properly understood by undertaking comprehensive uncertainty analysis therefore uncertainty analysis of the modelling process should be undertaken in the future to better understand quantify and predict the uncertainty associated with the decision making 8 conclusions an integrated surface water groundwater modelling approach was employed to determine sustainable water allocation limits for motueka riwaka plains in new zealand the model area is situated north west of nelson and covers approximately 40 km2 the model was parameterised based on both zones and pilot points and calibrated using the parameter estimation software pest calibration of the transient integrated surface groundwater model was achieved with a root mean square error rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels model verification which was undertaken using an independent dataset measured at a different time period from the period used for calibration resulted in an rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels the integrated surface groundwater model developed using modflow and its associated packages e g river package sfr2 were used to simulate surface groundwater interactions and saltwater intrusion and to conduct scenario analyses to evaluate sustainable water allocation limits trend analyses of long term groundwater levels were also undertaken at different locations within the model area long term decreasing trends in the order of 17 mm year approximately 700 mm over a 41 year record length are apparent in measured groundwater levels at three sites in the central zone west of motueka two sites closer to the coast have increasing trends of 16 mm year approximately 170 mm over a 11 year record length though these sites had a shorter record another coastal site with 28 years of data shows no statistically significant trend the model suggests that groundwater abstraction of over 30 000 m3 day above the current allocation is sustainable from the parker street well field without breaching water authority rules for saltwater intrusion so long as sea level rise or groundwater level lowering does not occur abstraction of 30 000 m3 day from the well field will result in an average 21 increase in motueka river losses during the dry summer 2001 losses are predicted to increase a further 7 the model shows that a coastal 35 groundwater take restriction for drought years is unlikely to affect the motueka river losses under a 30 000 m3 day groundwater abstraction scenario from the parker street well field increased groundwater abstraction of 30 000 m3 day is predicted to reduce the average groundwater discharge to some of the drains while it is also predicted that hau plains restrictions are a useful intervention to reduce groundwater level lowering and reducing the risk of saltwater intrusion it will have an insignificant effect on drain flows the scenario analysis shows that a sea level rise of 1 m is likely to result in a rise in groundwater levels over much of the plains and has the potential for increased groundwater flooding during extreme wet periods however the effect of groundwater level rise in bores that are located close to rivers are insignificant owing to the regulating effect of the river motueka river bed degradation causes lowering of groundwater levels in the upper reaches of the river which propagates from the river over 2 3 km the modelling does not indicate a breach of saltwater intrusion triggers when an additional 30 000 m3 day is abstracted from the parker street well field however sea level rise is predicted to result in saltwater intrusion into the plains and therefore groundwater abstraction near the coast may need to cease to assess the risk of saltwater in coastal monitoring bores in detail an improved monitoring regime may need to be developed to identify the fingering of the saltwater interface between monitoring bores that may occur due to local aquifer heterogeneities and irregular pumping patterns use of a modelling approach that allows simulation of density dependent flow e g seawat will help to improve the accuracy of these model predictions the approach used in this study integrated surface groundwater modelling associated with decision variables and management triggers and groundwater trend analyses can be transferred to

rise the management of water resources needs to balance values associated with but not limited to economy society ecology culture recreation and water quality to assist the management of water resources in the motueka riwaka plains new zealand a numerical integrated surface groundwater model was developed calibration of the transient integrated surface groundwater model was achieved with a root mean square error rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels model verification against groundwater levels not used in the calibration also resulted in an rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels model outputs coupled with groundwater trend analyses were used to identify the impact of groundwater abstractions on rivers streams and groundwater fed springs trend analyses showed that groundwater levels are lowering in the central area of the plains model scenarios predict that additional groundwater abstraction of over 30 000 m3 day from a well field located near the central area of the plains adjacent

groundwater abstraction scenarios especially from a proposed well field on groundwater levels and surface water flows 2 motueka riwaka plains the motueka and riwaka plains is situated in the north of the south island of new zealand and covers approximately 40 km2 fig 1 one of its primary industries is growing apples basher 2003 the aquifer system underlying the motueka riwaka plains is a primary source of water for irrigation industrial community domestic and stock water supplies the motueka township the nearby riwaka settlement and the kaiteriteri community fig 1 use reticulated potable community water supplied from the aquifer system many other houses outside of the reticulated supply areas have individual shallow domestic bores for water supply the average annual groundwater abstraction within the model area is approximately 7 1 mm3 year which amounts to approximately 95 of the total water abstractions including from surface water increased aquifer abstraction is proposed to supplement the motueka community water supply scheme and to supply smaller communities along the coast to the south the primary water use within the plains is irrigation with an annual average of approximately 5 8 million m3 or 82 of total use followed by 15 for industries and 3 for domestic purposes tdc 2020 2 1 climate the average annual rainfall of the motueka riwaka plains is approximately 1350 mm year of which nearly one third occurs in the winter months cliflo 2019 potential evapotranspiration is usually higher than rainfall during summer months december to february resulting in an average summer soil moisture deficit of nearly 200 mm year macara 2016 temperatures are relatively mild throughout the year with the long term average daily temperature reaching 17 4 c in february and dropping to 7 c in july with a daily temperature variation averaging 10 c cliflo 2019 2 2 geology there are a range of rock types that exist in the plains including old igneous and sedimentary rocks

sand deposits along the coast at the mouth of the motueka river rattenbury et al 1998 young sediments underlying the terraces and floodplains are highly permeable store large quantities of water and play an important role in sustaining stream flow basher 2003 2 3 hydrology and hydrogeology two main rivers flow through the motueka riwaka plains the mean flow of the largest river the motueka at

approximately 10 7 m3 s tdc 2020 the groundwater resources within the model area are highly interconnected with the motueka and riuwaka rivers and previous investigations indicated that a large proportion of aquifer recharge is sourced from these rivers robb 1999 weir 2007 alluvial aquifers in the area consist of gravels well rounded clasts predominately of granite sandstone siltstone and basic igneous rock and sand all of which provide highly permeable substrate for high surface groundwater interaction and aquifer throughflow 2 4 land use approximately half of the motueka riwaka plains is used for growing fruit and vegetable crops this is dominated by apple 1260 ha and kiwifruit 550 ha orchards all of which are irrigated the area of irrigated pasture has declined over the last two decades and currently covers about 2 of the study area the unirrigated area is used predominately for residential town and industrial purposes including tourism related businesses 3 model development a modflow 2005 groundwater model harbaugh 2005 was prepared to help meet the objectives of the study the model was constructed as an integrated surface water groundwater flow and contaminant transport model weir and thomas 2017 provided under supplementary information the transport component of the model was developed using mt3dms zheng 2010 1992 a uniform grid size of 100 m 100 m with three hydrogeological layers was employed each hydrological layer aquifer or aquitard was divided into two further numerical layers to improve the numerical accuracy the simulation period ran from 1 june 1990 through to 31 may 2012 with daily stress periods 8035 days model development and calibration are described below 3 1 conceptual model a conceptual model rajanayaka et al 2008 weir and thomas 2017 for the study area was first developed from the existing understanding of hydrogeology and hydrology along with stratigraphic information from bore logs in summary the aquifer system is bounded in the west north and base by faulted granite rock and in the south by older low permeability moutere gravels the lithology and thickness of the aquifer layers is variable a schematic cross section of the aquifer system is shown in fig 2 thicknesses of the alluvial gravels in the central area of the plains are approximately 20 30 m and reduce to about 6 m towards the fringes to the south the gravels are mixed with material flushed from the moutere valley and have a high content of fine sands silts and clays the aquifer system is primarily recharged from rivers and additional recharge occurs through rainfall and irrigation recharge across the plains groundwater exits the aquifer system by subsurface flow into tasman bay springs near the coast rivers or via groundwater pumping based on the above information groundwater flows in or out of the model area through the north west and south lateral boundaries flow exchanges through the granite basement are insignificant and have been replicated as a no flow boundary the eastern coastal boundary of the upper model layer has been assigned a general head to represent the discharge of groundwater to the sea the deeper layers of the aquifer system continue under the marine sediments and are restricted to discharge vertically into the upper layer via diffuse seepage 3 2 land surface recharge daily time series of land surface recharge lsr were generated using the soil crop water balance model irricalc bright 2009 irricalc uses the theoretical framework of the daily soil water balance modelling by the food and agricultural organization allen et al 1998 the crop soil water balance model simulates the variable use of water in agriculture and horticulture with differing crops soil types climate and irrigation strategies along with an irrigation scheduling component climate data for the irricalc model was obtained from the niwa climate station database cliflo 2019 soil information and water holding properties were reproduced from robb 1999 which sourced data from the new zealand fundamental soil layer newsome et al 2008 it was assumed that lsr under residential areas was equivalent to 50 of unirrigated pasture average annual lsr for the whole model is approximately 680 mm year and varies between 250 and 950 mm year due to the shallow depth to groundwater on the motueka riwaka plains vadose zone travel time are relatively short and have been ignored consequently it is assumed that any land surface recharge will enter the aquifer instantly after leaving the root zone 3 3 motueka and riuwaka rivers the main rivers and streams are represented in the model using modflow s stream flow routing sfr2 package niswonger and prudic 2009 this routes water from upstream interacting with groundwater gaining and losing as the river passes over the plains stream cells are located solely in the uppermost numerical layer the exchange of water between surface water and groundwater is determined through a combination of the bed conductivity and the gradient between the river free surface and underlying groundwater levels niswonger and prudic 2009 prudic et al 2004 channel geometry was defined by variable shaped cross sections each with eight points which were specified as model inputs based on surveyed data the sfr2 package then used this information with the manning equation to derive wetted perimeter and river stage manning roughness coefficients for all streams have been set at a constant value of 0 029 for main channels and 0 035 for river banks these values were derived from streeter and wylie 1981 for bed materials of gravel and earth with stones or weeds respectively reach length was determined by the length of the river passing through each model cell actual bed thicknesses for all reaches are generally unknown but have been set at a nominal constant value of 0 5 m stream bed hydraulic conductivity for each reach was determined through model calibration the average low flow measured loss from the motueka river is 0 97 m3 s measured data are listed in supplementary information 3 4 springs and drains springs and spring fed drains have been represented using the modflow drain drn package harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2000 three key spring fed drain networks were modelled thorpe drain staples drain and frys drain fig 1 drain cells are located solely in the model s uppermost layer drain cells act to remove water from the aquifer at a rate proportional to the difference between the groundwater level elevation in the drain cell and a specified drain invert elevation harbaugh 2005 a specified drain conductance factor also contributes to determining the rate of water removal if groundwater levels are below the invert of the drain then no flow is removed the drain is dry drain invert levels and conductances were generally unknown so these parameters were adjusted during the calibration process 3 5 parameterisation parameterisation of the model was based on both zonification and pilot points doherty et al 2010 the available information on geological and hydrogeological formations and aquifer test results were used for zonifications for assigning initial parameter values and to constrain parameter ranges for model calibration pilot points were used for assigning spatially variable parameters for horizontal hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients for all three layers upper aquifer intermediate aquitard and lower aquifer vertical hydraulic conductivity for each layer has been denoted by a single value the motueka and riuwaka rivers within the model area were divided into eight reaches for parameterisation of the riverbed conductivity similarly parameterisation for drain conductances and general head boundary conductances at the coastal boundary was employed using three and eight zones respectively 3 6 model calibration the key dataset used to calibrate the model was groundwater levels but spring and drain flow data was also considered as were flow losses from the motueka river fig 3 shows the locations of groundwater monitoring bores which were used for model calibration eighteen monitoring groundwater bores on the motueka riwaka plains were used for calibration details are given under supplementary information flow data collected from drains is sparse and consists of one off spot measurements typically made during periods of low rainfall during summer months and at low tides flows measured during these dry periods represent the baseflow groundwater component of the drain at the time in addition to the one off spot measurements a flow recorder was installed temporarily near the thorpe drain outlet from may 1990 through to august 1994 a summary of available data for the three drain networks is given under supplementary information there are no flow measurements for staples drain visual inspections pers comms gordon curnow tasman district council tdc over the 2012 2013 summer indicated that the average baseflow from this drain is typically in the order of 50 200 l s the flows measured by the thorpe drain recorder include quick flow run off e g stormwater and field tile drainage from the land surface as well as the slower baseflow contribution from groundwater simultaneous gaugings of river flows in the motueka river provided estimates of net river flow losses to groundwater during lower flows motueka river flows at woodmans bend fig 1 have been compared with flows at the state highway bridge to calculate the net loss of river flow to groundwater on the days of measurements the results that fall within the model simulation period can be found under supplementary information these all occur within the verification period aquifer test data typically signify the local characteristics and are not representative of an extended area therefore the aquifer test data have not been used to calibrate the model they have however been used to constrain aquifer parameters in the test data locations the integrated surface water groundwater model was calibrated using parameter estimation software pest doherty 2018 table 1 presents the groundwater level objective function values for the calibrated model along with additional statistics that have been generated and a brief description of these statistics the normalised rmse of 2 6 indicates the model is suitably calibrated donnell 2004 mdbc 2001 barnet et al 2012 fig 4 presents a plot of modelled versus measured groundwater levels for the 18 observation bores used for calibrating the groundwater model in total 40 742 groundwater level measurements over the period 1 january 2001 through to 31 may 2012 were used in calibration fig 5 presents a histogram of the residuals along with a theoretical normal distribution fig 6 compares residuals to measured groundwater levels and the mean error the residuals are relatively close to a normal distribution the plots show a small positive bias all measured motueka river losses provided under supplementary information fall within the model verification period therefore no comparison was made for river losses for the calibration period sensitivity analyses have been generated by pest fig 7 provides a summary of the sensitivities of the zone parameters details are given in supplementary information to the objective function 3 7 model verification data used for model verification may be measured at a different simulation time from the period used for calibration verification in time at a different location in the model domain verification in space or a combination of both model verification in time has been conducted for the period 1 june 1990 to 31 december 2000 verification in space adds in the smith monitoring bore this being the only bore that does not have groundwater level measurements after 31 december 2000 a plot of simulated versus measured groundwater levels for the verification period is presented in fig 8 model statistics for the verification period are listed in table 2 these statistics are similar to the calibration period statistics table 1 and like the calibration period they are smaller than accepted industry standards donnell 2004 mdbc 2001 barnet et al 2012 4 results entire model simulation period the normalised mean error me and rmse of the groundwater level objective function for the entire model simulation period 1 june 1990 to 31 may 2012 are 1 3 and 2 3 respectively hydrographs of measured and simulated groundwater levels in the 18 observation bores piezometric surface maps for several selected days flows in the three drains and losses from the motueka river for the full simulation period are given in supplementary information the average modelled losses from the motueka river for the dates for which the measurements were carried out see section 3 3 is 0 72 m3 s the motueka riwaka plains are divided into seven zones for water management purposes fig 9 the modflow zone budget tool harbaugh 1990 was used to analyse the water exchange into and out of these zones to assist in assessing water management options water exchanges for the calibrated model for each management zone averaged over the entire simulation period 1 june 1990 31 may 2012 are presented in fig 9 the values for abstraction and drainage represent rates as estimated using irricalc bright 2009 changes in storage are not presented in these figures only the long term average therefore the summaries do not present the complete flow budget 5 trend analysis trend analyses of groundwater levels were undertaken to complement integrated surface groundwater modelling to further understand the impact of hydroclimatic and land use change on the groundwater resources the sites which had long term groundwater level data 2 years were used for this analysis kerr and weir 2017 the summary statistics for the sites can be found under supplementary information summary variables were extracted from the observations to provide an indication of overall trend and to assist with attribution of the cause of any detected trends summary variables employed were monthly average groundwater levels annual minimums annual maximums change in levels over the non irrigation season and equivalent change over the irrigation season the annual maximums and minimums were calculated from monthly average series the daily observations were not used directly to avoid rapid changes in groundwater levels associated with pumping or recharge from influencing trend analysis the change in groundwater level over the non irrigation season was calculated by subtracting the post irrigation february to june minimum from the pre irrigation september october maximum fig 10 positive values indicate an increase in groundwater levels the pre irrigation season maximum is not always the annual maximum as it is possible for the groundwater level to peak prior to september the 1st for the purposes of assessing the effects of irrigation september 1st was considered appropriate the change in groundwater level over the irrigation season was calculated by subtracting the pre irrigation september october maximum of the previous year from the post irrigation february to june minimum fig 10 negative values indicate a decrease in groundwater level time series plots of all data and the summary variables are also provided in supplementary information for each summary variable at each site trends were assessed qualitatively through plots and quantitatively using statistical metrics these are discussed below 5 1 qualitative assessments four sites rossiter wratt riwaka hall and horrell have more than 30 years of data enabling an assessment of long term trends visual qualitative assessment of the time series see supplementary material for each bore indicates that rossiter and wratt have an almost continuous decreasing trend the riwaka hall and horrell data appear to initially have a decreasing trend then remain steady from about 2000 trends are not clear on any of the other sites the variation in levels is similar between the long term sites indicating that individual bore properties are not obscuring the aquifer level response and that the aquifer levels vary synchronously across the region 5 2 statistical assessment of monthly averages the mann kendal test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was applied to the monthly and annual time series for monthly data the seasonal mann kendall test is used which applies the test to all january s data then all february s data etc then averages these results this leads to a more robust measure of the trend than using annual values and accounts for seasonality groundwater exhibits serial correlation whereby the groundwater level of one month affects the groundwater level of subsequent months and so monthly levels are not independent this affects the calculation of the likelihood of a trend being observed by chance the p value generally leading to under estimated values a corrected p value can be calculated which considers serial correlation and provides an improved measure of the likelihood of the trend occurring by chance series require more than 10 years of data for the corrected p value to be determined the results of the seasonal mann kendall test are presented in table 3 slopes of the trends are shown for those sites where the trend has a less than 0 05 likelihood of occurring by chance five of the series were not long enough to establish the corrected p value therefore the uncorrected p values are also shown slopes were calculated using the kendall slope estimator the p values are reported to three decimal places so sites with p values of 0 have trends that are highly unlikely less than 1 chance in 1000 to have occurred by chance the cut off level of p 0 05 1 chance in 20 was arbitrarily selected as the threshold below which it is not unreasonable to expect the trend to be real statistically significant decreasing trends were found for rossiter wratt riwaka hall and horrell though the trend for horrell was weak this confirms the visual assessment statistically significant increasing trends were found for staples st and lodders though for a much reduced period 11 years the statistically significant corrected p 0 05 trends are shown in fig 11 5 3 statistical assessment of annual time series a mann kendall test for trend of the annual summary variables and their slopes calculated using the thiel sen s slope sen 1968 thiel 1950 is provided in table 4 slopes are only provided for those sites that returned a p value less than 0 05 the three sites with strong decreasing trends in the monthly series also show decreasing trends for their annual maximum and annual minimum values for each of these sites their annual minimum values are decreasing faster than their annual maximums the horrell site also showed a decreasing trend for the annual minimums though not as large as for rossiter wratt and riwaka hall only rossiter returned statistically significant trends in the non irrigation season winter change in levels increasing by 14 mm year and the irrigation season summer change in levels extra loss of 13 mm year for rossiter the irrigation season decline is increasing but the non irrigation season recharge compensates for it 5 4 trend analysis discussion long term changes in groundwater levels may be a result of one or a combination of factors some likely causes include degradation lowering of the motueka river bed increased groundwater pumping changes in irrigation efficiency increased sea levels and climate trends each of these factors have a signature effect on groundwater levels presence of that signature in the observed trends provides indication that the factor is at play for each factor a plausible groundwater impact signature is described and compared to the observed trends as follows degraded river levels will lower the annual groundwater maximum levels and for the same groundwater pumping lead to a lowered annual minimum groundwater level the lower motueka river has degraded at an average rate of 23 mm year between 1978 and 2001 sriboonlue and basher 2003 of the four sites with more than 35 years of data three have statistically significant downward trends in annual groundwater minimums and maximums consistent with the impact of a degraded riverbed the long term site without a statistically significant trend in annual maximums horrell is the farthest from the motueka river so it may be beyond the limit of the river s influence increased groundwater pumping will lower the annual minimum groundwater levels increase irrigation season groundwater level lowering but only decrease maximum groundwater levels on the years when winter recharge is low all four long term sites show reducing trends in their annual groundwater minimums but only one site rossiter shows a change in summer irrigation season groundwater level lowering so the changes cannot be unambiguously attributed to increased pumping for rossiter the irrigation season decline is attributed to increased pumping over time from the nearby lower moutere water scheme in recent years new bores have been installed near the rossiters bore to service this scheme increased irrigation efficiency without increased groundwater pumping will increase the summer decline of irrigation season groundwater level lowering owing to reductions in irrigation recharge as described above only one site has increased summer declines in irrigation season groundwater level lowering so any impact from increased irrigation efficiency is not apparent increased sea levels will lead to an increase in coastal groundwater levels sea level around new zealand has historically increased at approximately 1 6 mm year new zealand government 2009 two near coast sites lodders and staples st show increasing trends but at much greater magnitudes 16 17 mm year than sea level rise indicates sea level rise is not the cause of their increasing groundwater levels climate trends affect the amount of rainfall evapotranspiration and river flows there are indications of increased rainfall in winter and spring decreased rainfall in autumn and no change in summer for the motueka region caloiero 2015 at the same time temperature and hence evapotranspiration has been increasing mullan et al 2001 the impact of increased winter rainfall would only be observed if the winter aquifer recharge was water limited the impact of increased evapotranspiration would mainly be seen through increased irrigation and its associated groundwater pumping the complexity of the relationship between climate and hydrology does not enable simple attribution based on observed trends however the projections of climate change impacts on groundwater without sea level change indicate a near net zero effect weir and thomas 2017 after consideration of the effects above aa possible explanation for the observed trends are that the degrading motueka river is leading to lowering of the aquifer s maximum level particularly in proximity to the river more sites returned trends in annual minimum groundwater levels suggesting that increased groundwater pumping is having an impact but this is not certain as only one site rossiters is showing an associated summer loss trends increase in irrigation season groundwater level lowering the increasing trend in groundwater levels at two coastal sites staples st and lodders may be related to reduced pumping in those areas as households switch from domestic bores to reticulated supply sourced from more inland bores these two sites have just 11 years of data when the data for all sites were re analysed using only 2007 2017 data staples st and lodders were the only sites that showed a statistically significant trend rossiter wratt riwaka hall and horrell the long term sites all showed no statistically significant trend for the limited 2007 2017 period this indicates the trend at staples st and lodders is not widespread but does not clarify whether it is only a relatively recent effect the combined series from tui close and owr do not show any trend despite a combined record length of 28 years these sites are located at a distance from the motueka river and close to the shore for the three long term sites with the decreasing annual maximums rossiter wratt and riwaka hall their annual minimum levels are decreasing faster than their annual maximums this rate differential will increase the likelihood of the aquifer not fully recharging over winter understanding this probability is an important consideration for reliability of supply and provides potential direction for future assessments for all of the trend assessments described the lack of a statistically significant trend does not necessarily mean that no trend exists it just means that the trend if it exists is too small to discern from the variability of the time series only with longer time series of data does the detection of trends become increasingly possible 6 model predictions the calibrated motueka riwaka plains groundwater model was used to assess different management scenarios these scenarios consider the effects on the groundwater system and surface water bodies from different abstraction and water use management options over the plains including potential degradation of the motueka riverbed and potential sea level rise managing abstractions without causing saltwater intrusion is the principal concern of the water management authority tdc as demonstrated by rajanayaka et al 2008 and weir and thomas 2017 the hau plains zone is the most sensitive area to saltwater intrusion primarily due to the local hydrogeology the water bearing gravels thin towards the southern margins of the plains distance from the main recharge source the motueka river and overall water abstractions in the area saltwater intrusion has previously occurred in areas of the hau plains once in the early 1990 s and more recently during the 2014 15 summer the 1990 s event was attributed to local over pumping near the coast and the 2014 15 event was attributed to the failure of a non return valve on a coastal stormwater outlet addressing those issues and local mitigation measures e g moving pumping wells for irrigated areas further inland from the coastal areas and reducing groundwater abstractions from near the coast have avoided recurrence of localised saltwater intrusion events to further reduce the risk of saltwater intrusion in these coastal margins tdc impose 35 water restrictions for droughts exceeding 1 in 10 year events in the hau plains zone the primary trigger for considering saltwater intrusion in the hau plains had been groundwater levels in the fernwood coastal monitoring bore rajanayaka et al 2008 tested the influence of domestic pumping in the hau plains and found that removing the domestic pumping in the hau plains for droughts exceeding 1 in 10 year events had no noticeable effect on flows across the coastal boundary or groundwater levels at the coast this is because domestic abstraction in this area is small compared to irrigation pumping given this outcome no restrictions to domestic pumping were considered in the scenarios considered scenario details results temporal and spatial and criteria for sustainable additional abstraction are discussed below 6 1 scenario details the calibrated model was used to assess several scenarios see table 5 to assist in assessing the impacts of different water resource management regimes an initial model scenario was run that considers no groundwater pumping this scenario represents a quasi natural state of the groundwater system unaffected by groundwater abstraction and subsequent use this scenario does not represent the true natural state of the system as it assumes the existing land cover and that the existing altered state of waterways remains stop banks channel alignments drains etc a second model scenario was then run that considers the current state of groundwater development this scenario was based on the calibrated model but assumes that the existing status quo level of groundwater development land use and corresponding land surface recharge occurs for the entire model simulation period this scenario represents a baseline of existing use against which future changes can be compared various other scenarios were run to assess the effects of additional abstraction from the proposed parker street well field fig 1 and the effectiveness of different management regimes to reduce effects on the groundwater system the different management scenarios assessed can be grouped into two broad categories a scenarios without water restrictions and b scenarios with 35 groundwater abstraction restrictions in the hau plains and the coastal exclusion zone for drought years exceeding a 1 in 10 year event within each of these two broad categories the following management scenarios have been considered 1 an additional 20 000 m3 day abstraction from the proposed parker street well field located adjacent to the motueka river to supply a future urban supply 2 a further 5000 m3 day 25 000 m3 day total from the proposed well field and 3 a further 5000 m3 day 30 000 m3 day total from the proposed well field in addition a further four scenarios were developed one scenario considers the effects of motueka river bed degradation another assesses the aquifer flow response from predicted sea level rise the final two assess the effects of two extremes of projected climate changes in rainfall potential evapotranspiration and river flows the scenario numbers are listed in table 5 a detailed description of these scenarios is presented in weir and thomas 2017 and a summary of the scenarios follows motueka riverbed degradation the motueka river bed inverts are lowered by 0 3 m at woodman s bend and pro rated to zero towards the sea i e no bed invert change at the sea river cross sectional shapes remain unchanged sea level rise mfe 2014 recommends that consideration be given to the potential effects from a range of possible sea level rise values and suggests that a sea level rise of at least 0 8 m be considered bell 2014 suggests that through adopting a 100 year planning timeframe sea level rises of up to 1 0 m should be accommodated a permanent sea level rise of 1 0 m has been applied to the model s coastal boundary climate change dry lowest projected rainfall and highest projected pet for 2090 95 year trends niwa 2015 climate change wet highest projected rainfall and lowest projected pet for 2090 95 year trends niwa 2015 6 2 scenario results key results from each management scenario and the calibrated scenario for groundwater levels mouteka river losses and spring discharge are summarised below further results of groundwater flow budgets are presented in weir and thomas 2017 see supplementary information 6 2 1 groundwater levels 6 2 1 1 temporal effects scenario results show that as abstraction increases low groundwater levels during the summer periods reduce further i e there is an increase in the saw tooth effect for example fig 12 a depicts groundwater level dynamics at fernwood site for the calibration scenario and scenarios 1 5 however bores located near to rivers do not lower noticeably with increased abstraction due to the regulating effect of the river comparing the no abstraction calibration and baseline scenarios there is no visible long term cumulative decline in groundwater levels from year to year by and large groundwater levels return to the no abstraction state most years during the wetter winter periods when irrigation abstractions cease in some cases groundwater levels in the shallow aquifer return a little higher than the no abstraction scenario for a short time period due to a net transfer of water from deep to shallow layers via irrigation and increased land surface recharge the groundwater system recovers quickly from the hydraulic effects of pumping under scenarios 3 5 which include the effects of continuous abstraction from the parker street well field groundwater levels in some bores are constantly reduced particularly in bores located in close proximity to the well field such as the two nursery bores and to a lesser extent rossiters and greenwood this is due to the sustained nature of the well field abstraction which does not turn off during winter in the same way that irrigation takes do should the well field cease abstracting then groundwater levels would recover similar groundwater level hydrographs are not provided for scenarios 6 8 as these are identical to scenarios 3 5 apart for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 instead fig 13 presents low groundwater level hydrographs for the fernwood coastal monitoring bore which is used by the water management authority to manage regional saltwater intrusion over the 2001 period when restrictions were imposed this shows hau plains restrictions reduce groundwater level lowering by approximately 0 1 m in the fernwood coastal monitoring bore which has a positive effect on reducing the risk of saltwater intrusion during dry periods a sea level rise of 1 m scenario 10 results in a rise in groundwater levels over much of the plains but the rise is more prominent with proximity to the coast bores located close to rivers are modelled to experience very little effect from sea level rise owing to the regulating effect of the river the rise in groundwater levels is continuous over the full simulation period as depicted in fig 12 b 6 2 1 2 spatial effects spatial impacts of the scenarios were assessed on 24 march 2001 and 24 january 2006 these two dates were chosen to represent the groundwater system in a state of stress when groundwater levels were low as a consequence of low recharge both land surface recharge and river recharge and high groundwater abstraction when 30 000 m3 day is taken scenario 5 the groundwater level lowering increases to 0 0 8 m and 0 8 1 2 m nearer the well field location for the above dates motueka river bed degradation scenario 9 affects groundwater levels primarily in the upper reaches of the river where the greatest bed lowering is simulated in this area a groundwater level lowering of 0 2 0 3 m is modelled from a bed lowering of 0 3 m the effects propagate from the river s upper reaches and diminish over a distance of approximately 2 3 km from either side of the river with only a small effect 0 1 m beyond this groundwater level changes due to motueka river bed degradation are relatively consistent between the two dates 24 march 2001 and 24 january 2006 a sea level rise of 1 m scenario 10 results in a rise in groundwater levels at the coast of approximately 0 8 m the motueka and riuwaka rivers partially regulate the groundwater level rise elsewhere a rise of 0 2 m or more is modelled to extend up to 3 km inland from the coast these results are relatively consistent between the two dates 24 march 2001 and 24 january 2006 of concern with sea level rise is the potential for groundwater flooding whereby groundwater levels reach the surface causing ponding adversely affecting land use to assess this risk a date of 13 august 1990 has been considered which is when highest groundwater levels were measured over the period of record fig 14 presents the area of the plains where shallow groundwater levels were predicted to reach the land surface under the calibrated model and for the sea level rise scenario scenario 10 during an extreme wet period as represented by 13 august 1990 this assessment shows that some areas of the coastal plains would have experienced historical groundwater flooding if sea level was to rise 1 m then during very wet periods the area of groundwater flooding is modelled to move up to 1 km inland from where historical flooding occurred the greatest horizontal shift is around the golf course see fig 1 and into the south eastern areas of motueka township groundwater level differences for climate change scenarios 11 and 12 are provided in weir and thomas 2017 see supplementary information 6 2 2 groundwater recharge from the motueka river and discharge to springs drains table 5 lists the average modelled groundwater recharge from the motueka river and groundwater discharge to the drains i e drain flows for the entire model period as well as for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 two 1 in 10 year drought periods the groundwater recharge includes the contribution from brooklyn stream which is a tributary of the motueka river and little sydney stream fig 1 also included in table 5 is the percent flow change compared to the calibration scenario generally groundwater abstraction results in an increase in recharge from the motueka river to groundwater this most likely occurs because groundwater abstraction lowers groundwater levels which in turn increases the hydraulic gradient between the river and adjacent groundwater typically the river loses a greater proportion of flow to groundwater during dry periods compared to average the reason for this most likely is twofold firstly the river flows are lower hence any loss is proportionally greater and secondly groundwater abstraction and therefore induced river loss is greater during dry periods compared to the long term average comparing the no abstraction and calibrated scenarios historical abstraction has resulted in an increase in average motueka river losses of approximately 2 and up to 19 during dry periods as shown in table 5 during these dry periods losses are modelled to increase a further 3 6 under the baseline scenario scenario 1 restrictions in the hau plains scenarios 6 8 have very little impact 1 at most on motueka river recharge to groundwater compared to scenarios 3 5 lowering the motueka river bed scenario 9 reduces the losses by 1 2 compared to the baseline scenario this is because the lower river elevations reduce the hydraulic gradients between the river and adjacent groundwater sea level rise scenario 10 is predicted to reduce motueka river losses by 8 15 this is because the resulting raised groundwater levels reduce the hydraulic gradient between the river and adjacent groundwater sea level change with climate change scenarios 12 and 14 provides similar change to sea level rise alone scenario 10 climate change alone scenarios 11 and 13 results in a very small change in river recharge less than 3 increased groundwater abstraction results in reduced drain flows the greater percentage changes occur during dry periods when drain flows are naturally lower due to low groundwater levels during these dry periods the predicted percentage changes in flows are large for some scenarios to control this tdc s tasman resource management plan has set a maximum allowable spring depletion level for the natural springs in the region this is to ensure that flows are not significantly altered from natural flows that sustain ecological and cultural values the allowable average spring depletion in the central plains zone is 35 comparing results from the no abstraction and calibrated scenarios a large reduction in drain flows is predicted to result from existing groundwater abstraction thorpe drain is predicted to be affected more by groundwater abstraction compared to the other two drains due to its location relative to regional groundwater flow directions and areas of greatest groundwater use including the parker street well field hau plains restrictions scenarios 6 8 are predicted to benefit thorpe drain by 5 8 during dry periods compared to scenarios 3 5 of the three drains modelled thorpe drain is the only drain located in the vicinity of the hau plains management zone consequently the other two drains show no benefit from hau plains restrictions the small changes in regional groundwater levels predicted near the drains as a result of motueka river bed degradation scenario 9 results in a reduction in average drain flows by 0 3 and 4 16 during dry periods sea level rise scenario 10 is predicted to substantially increase all drain flows however raised sea level is likely to result in additional sea water seeping diffusing and or back flowing into these drains currently water flowing in the drains is brackish sea level rise is likely to increase the salt content in these drains sea level change with climate change scenarios 12 and 14 provides similar changes to sea level rise alone scenario 10 climate change alone scenarios 11 and 13 results in changes in drain flows of 14 compared with other scenarios 6 3 sustainable additional abstraction in order to compare scenarios and assess a sustainable level of additional abstraction from the parker street well field it is necessary to establish one or more decision criteria as the principal concern relating to groundwater abstraction is managing saltwater intrusion decision criteria have been decided to assess the potential for saltwater intrusion decision criteria comprise a decision variable and a decision trigger these are discussed below to monitor for saltwater intrusion in the coastal margin of the hau plains tdc established the fernwood groundwater level monitoring bore the recorded lowest groundwater level in this bore was 0 52 m amsl on 24 january 2006 both groundwater level and groundwater flux are important controls of potential saltwater intrusion and as such both have been chosen as decision variables considering both the timing of the lowest groundwater levels in the fernwood monitoring bore and the lowest rainfall over the first 90 days of any year two time periods have been considered for decision variables these being the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 given this and the criteria above for assessing saltwater intrusion risk the following three decision variables have been chosen the average groundwater level at fernwood for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 the average seaward flux for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 and the occurrence of landward flux as a result of historical occurrences of saltwater intrusion in the coastal zone of the hau plains tdc s guideline for managing saltwater intrusion has specified a groundwater level of 0 5 m amsl in any coastal monitoring bore rajanayaka et al 2008 this is approximately the same as the lowest measured groundwater level in this bore 0 52 m amsl however salt water has never been observed in the bore since in addition the lowest groundwater level occurred without any restrictions in place as tdc now implement water abstraction restrictions in the hau plains for drought years and saltwater intrusion has not occurred since even given some very dry years a trigger of 0 4 m amsl was chosen in collaboration with tdc the model has been used to represent the coastal flux for consistency with previous studies the seaward flux trigger was set equal to 80 of the flux modelled under the calibration scenario under the calibration scenario the average coastal flux over the first 90 days of 2001 was 0 7 m3 s and over the first 90 days of 2006 was 0 65 m3 s therefore 80 of these values is 0 56 m3 s and 0 52 m3 s respectively the lesser of the two 0 52 m3 s has been chosen as the trigger as shown in table 6 the groundwater level trigger at the fernwood bore and the seaward flux trigger have both been assessed for the first 90 days of 2001 and 2006 however the third decision variable trigger landward flux has been assessed for the entire model period there should be no occurrences of landward flux i e groundwater should be flowing out to sea at all times no criteria are predicted to be breached under scenarios 1 9 11 and 13 results are given in supplementary information which suggests that more than 30 000 m3 day could be abstracted sustainably from the parker street well field so long as sea level rise either does not occur or that the effects of it are adequately managed sea level rise scenarios 10 12 and 14 is predicted to result in coastal backflow of sea water into the aquifer system if the simulated magnitude of sea level rise occurs then saltwater intrusion may need to be managed to protect water quality in bores located nearer the coast or managed retreat of coastal takes may be needed based on the above analyses under historical patterns of climate and subsequent river flows and land surface drainage groundwater abstraction of over 30 000 m3 day is predicted to be sustainable from the parker street well field without breaching coastal saltwater intrusion criteria 7 future work as managing abstractions without causing saltwater intrusion is the principal concern for tdc the inclusion of density dependent flow into the model will improve the accuracy seawat langevin 2009 which is a generic modflow mt3dms based computer program can be used to model 3d variable density groundwater it is important that reliability robustness and accuracy of model conceptualisation observations parameters and the numerical model and risks and impacts of the decisions made using the model are properly understood by undertaking comprehensive uncertainty analysis therefore uncertainty analysis of the modelling process should be undertaken in the future to better understand quantify and predict the uncertainty associated with the decision making 8 conclusions an integrated surface water groundwater modelling approach was employed to determine sustainable water allocation limits for motueka riwaka plains in new zealand the model area is situated north west of nelson and covers approximately 40 km2 the model was parameterised based on both zones and pilot points and calibrated using the parameter estimation software pest calibration of the transient integrated surface groundwater model was achieved with a root mean square error rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels model verification which was undertaken using an independent dataset measured at a different time period from the period used for calibration resulted in an rmse of 2 6 for groundwater levels the integrated surface groundwater model developed using modflow and its associated packages e g river package sfr2 were used to simulate surface groundwater interactions and saltwater intrusion and to conduct scenario analyses to evaluate sustainable water allocation limits trend analyses of long term groundwater levels were also undertaken at different locations within the model area long term decreasing trends in the order of 17 mm year approximately 700 mm over a 41 year record length are apparent in measured groundwater levels at three sites in the central zone west of motueka two sites closer to the coast have increasing trends of 16 mm year approximately 170 mm over a 11 year record length though these sites had a shorter record another coastal site with 28 years of data shows no statistically significant trend the model suggests that groundwater abstraction of over 30 000 m3 day above the current allocation is sustainable from the parker street well field without breaching water authority rules for saltwater intrusion so long as sea level rise or groundwater level lowering does not occur abstraction of 30 000 m3 day from the well field will result in an average 21 increase in motueka river losses during the dry summer 2001 losses are predicted to increase a further 7 the model shows that a coastal 35 groundwater take restriction for drought years is unlikely to affect the motueka river losses under a 30 000 m3 day groundwater abstraction scenario from the parker street well field increased groundwater abstraction of 30 000 m3 day is predicted to reduce the average groundwater discharge to some of the drains while it is also predicted that hau plains restrictions are a useful intervention to reduce groundwater level lowering and reducing the risk of saltwater intrusion it will have an insignificant effect on drain flows the scenario analysis shows that a sea level rise of 1 m is likely to result in a rise in groundwater levels over much of the plains and has the potential for increased groundwater flooding during extreme wet periods however the effect of groundwater level rise in bores that are located close to rivers are insignificant owing to the regulating effect of the river motueka river bed degradation causes lowering of groundwater levels in the upper reaches of the river which propagates from the river over 2 3 km the modelling does not indicate a breach of saltwater intrusion triggers when an additional 30 000 m3 day is abstracted from the parker street well field however sea level rise is predicted to result in saltwater intrusion into the plains and therefore groundwater abstraction near the coast may need to cease to assess the risk of saltwater in coastal monitoring bores in detail an improved monitoring regime may need to be developed to identify the fingering of the saltwater interface between monitoring bores that may occur due to local aquifer heterogeneities and irregular pumping patterns use of a modelling approach that allows simulation of density dependent flow e g seawat will help to improve the accuracy of these model predictions the approach used in this study integrated surface groundwater modelling associated with decision variables and management triggers and groundwater trend analyses can be transferred to other catchments to assist sustainable water and ecological flow management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
