6905,moving water can transport temperature signals of surface water into groundwater or vice versa we analyzed the temperature signals in the atmosphere river and pumped water to elucidate source water contributions to the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river temperature fluctuations in response to high frequency intermittent pumping were observed from february 2014 to august 2016 in 14 wells within three shallow unconfined alluvial aquifers along the ohio river the groundwater temperature observed in pumping wells displayed two alternating signals between pump on and pump off periods the difference in groundwater temperatures between pump on and pump off periods was defined as a temperature shift temperature shifts indicate that pumping always introduces water of different temperature to the wells than that of the ambient groundwater while seasonal pump off temperatures varied up to 3 2 c the short term temperature shifts ranged from 0 2 to 2 5 c groundwater was generally warm in winter and cold in summer but pumped water was of lower temperature in winter and higher in summer than the ambient groundwater however the pumping induced temperature shifts were highest in summer and winter and lowest in spring and fall because groundwater temperature lagged that of surface water by approximately six months the thermal transfer velocity in groundwater was more than one order magnitude higher during pumping than that during the recovery periods high frequency pumping changed produced water temperature and increased the thermal transfer velocity in the groundwater these results indicate that stream exfiltration is a major component of the water budget to a number of these wells thermal analysis reveals that the temperature of pumped water can trace source water to the pumping wells this thermal approach for estimating the source of pumped water works best when groundwater temperature variation is seasonally

are mostly developed in unconfined shallow aquifers to intercept induced infiltration from surface water bodies like streams rivers or lakes pumping groundwater continuously from an alluvial aquifer

and velocity spane and mackley 2011 walker 2001 sheets et al 2002 observed that groundwater flow to production wells had shorter and more consistent travel times under continuous rather than intermittent pumping both styles of pumping may deplete streamflow jenkins 1968 but in different fashions wallace et al 1990 surface water exfiltration is not limited to pumping but may also be driven by rise in river stage due to either flooding or stream regulation lewandowski et al 2009 maharjan and donovan 2016 heat can transfer between the surface and subsurface via the combination of radiation conduction and advection convection constantz 2008 solar radiation to the earth causes diurnal and annual temperature oscillations which can be used as source signals in spite of different temporal sensitivity and signal propagation depths stonestrom and constantz 2003 rau et al 2014 suzuki 1960 pioneered a passive heat tracing method to estimate percolation rates based on temperature measurements stallman 1965 improved this method and used the damping of temperature amplitudes and the phase shift to calculate vertical groundwater flows these methods assumed uniform thermal conductivity and constant flow rates which constrains using these methods to homogeneous and saturated flow systems heat transport in saturated porous media is influenced by surface temperature

stream bartolino 2003 both attenuation and delay of temperature oscillations depend on heat capacities thermal diffusivity and seepage velocity lachenbruch and sass 1977 deming 2002 luce et al 2013 surface temperature tends to penetrate to greater depth where groundwater flow is downward and the opposite is true where groundwater flow is upward taniguchi 1993 bendjoudi et al 2005 moving water can transport temperature signals of surface water into groundwater or vice versa therefore heat has been extensively used to trace advective fluid flow through porous media lapham 1989 silliman and

temperature time series have been used in heat transport models to quantify the rate of groundwater and surface water exchanges essaid et al 2008 anibas et al 2009 kurylyk and irvine 2016 and their spatial and temporal variabilities schmidt et al 2006 jensen and engesgaard 2011 lautz and ribaudo 2012 molina giraldo et al 2011 modeled the propagation of temperature signals into an aquifer from a partially penetrating losing stream most of these studies were performed in hyporheic exchange zones and measured vertical temperature variations beneath streambeds to depths 2 m however heat transport in a bank storage zone 100 m has been less studied for a gaining stream under the natural hydraulic gradient thermal behavior of groundwater has potential to shed light on groundwater and surface water connectivity and exchange rates in the bank storage zone that has both economic and ecological significance when considering the issues of water quality and quantity in rivers we investigated the impact of intermittent pumping on groundwater temperature in connection to stream exfiltration using high frequency temperature time series data collected in the atmosphere shallow unconfined aquifers and a leaky stream we hypothesize that if pumping induces surface water to exfiltrate into the shallow aquifers then the temperature of produced water would diverge from the ambient groundwater temperature provided that the temperature of exfiltrated water has significantly different thermal signature from that of other sources of water to the pumping wells 2 study sites the study area is a series of discontinuous gravel aquifers along the ohio river valley of west virginia tapped by wells in three pws systems new martinsville glen dale and mcmechen fig 1 the pleistocene age ohio river incised bedrock of permo pennsylvanian age to form the modern valley prellwitz 2004 quaternary sediment filled its valley with unconsolidated sand gravel silt and clay simard 1989 rogers 1990 the basal portion of the valley is composed of coarse grained gravel underlain by finer sediments quaternary age terraces form the land surface as floodplain deposits which also extend up the major tributaries groundwater in mcmechen glen dale and new martinsville is intermittently pumped at approximately 6000 2000 and 8000 m3 day respectively using combinations of 11 wells completed near the base of the aquifer mcmechen has four concurrently pumped wells in two rows nearly parallel to the river glen dale has four observation and two production wells pumped intermittently one at a time with weekly rotation new martinsville has five pumping wells of which two n4 and n5 alternates their operation and the other three are pumped simultaneously the south flowing ohio river forms nearly level pools along the channel hannibal locks and dam at new martinsville forms a 68 km long pool which is adjacent to 11 of the 14 wells wells are 70 to 160 m distant from the river in mcmechen 110 to 250 m in glen dale and 90 to 270 m in new martinsville the new martinsville well field has three wells n1 n2 and n3 from 750 to 1600 m downstream of the dam and two n4 and n5 1500 to 1600 m upstream of it table 1 summarizes locations and characteristics of pumping and observation wells employed 3 methods groundwater temperatures and water levels response to intermittent pumping were measured in the 14 wells using data logger coupled sensors data were collected at one minute intervals from february 2014 to february 2016 and then at hourly intervals until august 2016 also during this period air temperature was measured in a well casing well g4 with the sensor 1 52 m below ground surface 15 minute interval stream temperature was compiled from january 2014 to november 2016 from a gaging station in montgomery pool 60 miles upstream from glen dale along the ohio river the pressure transducers used in wells were of two kinds i vented global water wl 16 and ii sealed onset u020 models the sealed loggers were used in unpumped outdoor wells in the glen dale pws the vented transducers have pressure and temperature accuracy of 1 cm and 0 28 c the sealed ones are 3 cm and 0 44 c the loggers were downloaded monthly and converted to hydraulic heads using standard techniques weight and sonderegger 2001 water level below the top of casing was measured periodically with an electric tape 5 mm to verify transducer readings fig 2 a shows schematic flow lines in a hypothetical unconfined alluvial aquifer with a single pumping well at distance l from a stream a pressure temperature sensor is shown set in the well at depth z below ground surface a cone of depression is shown to have developed in response to pumping intercepting the river boundary and inducing exfiltration fluid flow to the well is dominantly horizontal in the screened interval and dominantly vertical above it perhaps due to anisotropy of aquifer materials fig 2b illustrates hypothesized heat transfer mechanisms in the aquifer of fig 2a the surface and subsurface temperatures differ and fluctuate seasonally changes in subsurface temperature are slow and form nearly horizontal isotherms in this conduction zone groundwater entering the well by advection from the river may reflect stream temperature rather than that of the aquifer surface single headed arrow

volume weighted sum of the heat capacities of water sediment and air woodside and messmer 1961 we considered advection as the transport of heat by moving water through porous media caused by pressure gradients while conduction as heat transport through the sediment fluid matrix by vibrating atoms the cyclic temperature variations at the surface of the earth can be defined by eq 3 3 t a cos ω t

ω 2 d e eq 4 reduces to eq 6 when advection component is absent eq 6 defines heat flow in a subsurface by conduction carslaw and jaeger 1959 the exponential term of eq 6 determines damping of the amplitude of temperature variations with depth while the second term of the cosine within the parenthesis defines the lag time similarly the temperature fluctuations due to conduction that are propagated into the solid can be estimated by 2 ω d e carslaw and jaeger 1959 luce et al 2013 higher frequency oscillations like daily temperature variations are only detectable at shallow depths while lower frequency oscillations such as annual temperature variations are detectable at greater depths thermal properties of an aquifer can be estimated using eq 3 by matching observed annual temperature variations at depths without considering the effects of intermittent pumping for simplicity we assumed conduction was the dominant mechanism of heat transport at an annual scale although advection could also contribute to heat flow during recharge events however maharjan and donovan 2016 showed that lateral flow dominated vertical flow in such aquifers even during the recharge events where the layers of clay and silt occur in the vadose zone the model was adjusted in accordance with the observed data to estimate lag times τ days and seasonal temperature shifts sts c twice the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and the results were presented in table 1 high frequency intermittent pumping caused both water level and temperature to fluctuate inside the wells water level responses to intermittent pumping were significantly quicker than temperature response inside the wells hence only the short term temperature variations due to pumping were modeled using eq 7 7 t a exp b t c where t is temperature variations inside wells during pumping or recovery periods c t is time in minutes a b and c are amplitude c decay constant 1 min and stable temperature at the end of the modeled durations c respectively here we defined a recovery period as the time in between two successive intermittent pumping periods that is usually less than a week temperature variations due to pumping and recovery were manually sampled only for wells n4 and n5 from two and half year long time series because static water levels in these wells did not fluctuated significantly in comparison to other wells throughout the year pumping periods were generally shorter in length than the recovery periods for all the wells 63 38 pumping and 25 recovery and 78 number of samples 52 pumping and 26 recovery were randomly collected for wells n4 and n5 respectively over the study period fit parameters to the datasets were estimated using a curve fitting toolbox in matlab with a 95 of confidence limit fig 3 4 results 4 1 observed water level and temperature observed water level variations during pumping of well m5 from may 2014 to august 2016 are shown as light grey bands fig 4 this well was intermittently pumped at high frequency followed by 8 to 10 minute pump off periods generally too brief to be discernible at the scale of fig 4 labels 1 upper edge of light grey bands and 2 lower edge indicate non pumping pump off and pumping pump on water levels respectively the separation between labels 1 and 2 i e the height of the light grey band is drawdown due to pumping i e the sum of aquifer and well losses the magnitude of this drawdown was approximately uniform during the period shown and independent of seasonal variations in aquifer water level during pump off periods i e label 1 the water level represents that of the aquifer itself and was higher in spring than fall the bottom of the light grey band represents aquifer water level less well loss drawdown although not apparent in this figure when the pump turns off the well losses recover within an hour and the well head re equilibrates with the surrounding aquifer whose level is at all times below stream stage in the vicinity of this well field temperature variations in the well during and after pumping appear as vertical dark grey bands fig 4 the period showing no band represents a data gap label 3 labels 4 and 5 indicate temperatures at pump on and pump off times respectively the difference in groundwater temperatures between pump on and pump off period was defined as a temperature shift the appearance of temperature as a band is simply due to high frequency pumping the magnitude of temperature fluctuations generated by such high frequency pumping was seasonally non uniform and highest during summer and winter double headed arrows high water levels appear to correlate with some asterisk but not all temperature peaks temperature in this well showed an annual range of 3 4 c fluctuation with minima in july october and maxima in february april this annual temperature range during non pumping in summer and winter will be referred to as seasonal temperature shift sts at much briefer time scales the temperature difference between pumping and non pumping periods i e the difference between labels 4 and 5 will be referred to as pumping induced temperature shifts pits the longer term sts range was approximately 7 20 times higher than pits for well m5 fig 5 shows river water and air temperature between january 2014 and november 2016 for montgomery pool and well g4 respectively air temperature was recorded at 1 minute intervals inside well g4 at 1 52 m below the surface and is a dampened measure of surface temperature both temperatures attained their maxima in august and minima in february with an annual range of 28 and 20 c respectively however river temperature lagged behind that of air by approximately 15 days briggs et al 2018 noted similar long lag between atmosphere and surface water seasonal temperature signals in selected rivers of the eastern united states and used process based thermal modeling to demonstrate that such lags are indicative of river flow that is predominantly sourced from shallow aquifers both temperatures contain two different periodic components i a long term seasonal trend and ii a short term diurnal trend stream temperature is less sensitive to diurnal temperature fluctuations than that of air which shows diurnal spikes especially during summer and winter the lower sensitivity of stream temperature and longer lag time to variations in solar radiation is ascribed to the high specific heat capacity of water larger volume of the river water and the depth at which the temperature was being measured caissie 2006 fig 6 depicts high resolution water level grey and temperature black fluctuations at different seasons for well n4 this graphic is analogous to fig 4 but for a different well and at much higher time resolution pits reached its maxima during summer fig 6a and winter fig 6b and its minima during spring and fall not shown the direction of pits differs in summer from winter the pits shift is negative cools during pump off periods in late spring summer negative re equilibration but positive in late fall winter positive re equilibration groundwater recovered to its non pumping level in less than an hour but temperature took approximately a week to do so aquifer water level top of the light grey band showed very little fluctuation but temperature varied significantly during the study period pits is represented by double headed arrows in fig 6 and reached its peak within an hour of the onset of pumping because its temperature is derived from warmer groundwater entering the well from the basal gravel aquifer following cessation of pumping temperature recovers to an ambient condition slowly and exponentially the temperature fluctuations within the dashed oval are also pits but related to high frequency pumping longer the recovery period larger the pits however the magnitude of the pits is influenced more by season than by the duration of the recovery period 4 2 analysis of observed data fig 7 shows an observed grey and modeled black temperature using eq 3 between february 2014 and august 2016 for the ohio river on the top of both columns and 10 wells from 3 pwss the observed temperature variations in both groundwater and surface water were not perfectly sinusoidal and the amplitudes were not constant even for the same well from year to year however the model captured seasonal temperature variations in the ohio river and groundwater at the 10 wells the amplitude of temperature variations in surface water was more than one order magnitude higher than that of groundwater temperature for majority of the wells the amplitude and the phase shift of temperature variations in groundwater was distinctly different from one well to another depending upon sensor depths and the distance from a river the effect of sensor depth and the distance from a river on the groundwater temperature variations will be discussed later the quality of agreement between the model and the observed data varied widely for different wells presumably because of phenomena and local factors not incorporated into the model however the model estimated effective aquifer thermal diffusivities by separately comparing amplitude and lag time estimated using eqs 3 and 6 the ranges of thermal diffusivity calculated using both amplitude and lag time were consistent and varied from 0 01 to 0 07 cm2 s thermal diffusivity calculated using amplitude showed wider range than that calculated using lag time the conductive thermal velocity was calculated using equation 14 of luce et al 2013 that ranged from 5 to 12 cm day in these aquifers table 1 fig 8 compares temperature from montgomery pool top to water level and temperature variations in wells n4 middle and n5 bottom at new martinsville pws between february 2014 and august 2016 the complementary grey stripes for the two wells indicate they were pumped in alternation stream and groundwater temperature ranged from 0 to 28 c and from 10 8 to 13 8 c respectively sts vertical double headed arrows varied in magnitude slightly from one year to another for the same well labels 1 2 and 3 refer to the time of a year when temperature were the lowest in the stream n4 and n5 respectively indicating time lag between surface and groundwater temperature peaks this time lag for well n4 is approximately 60 days shorter than n5 as indicated by the hachured line between labels 2 and 3 in fig 8 sts a and pits c for n4 in fig 8 are larger than that of n5 by 0 4 c and 0 3 c respectively however this difference is not large and fall within the limit of uncertainty these results can be ascribed to some combination of two factors i n4 being closer to the stream than n5 105 vs 270 m and ii the n4 sensor being closer to the surface than that of n5 8 5 vs 13 7 m at all times shown aquifer water level was higher but pumping drawdown was lower for well n4 than n5 assumedly for the same reasons fig 9a depicts τ vs sensor depth for pumping and non pumping wells with lag times estimated by matching river water temperature peaks to the corresponding groundwater peaks using eq 3 fig 7 lag times range from 140 to 280 days for these wells and were generally less for pumping than for non pumping wells sensor depth and τ show some correlation r2 0 48 and indicate that τ generally increases with depth below the surface with minor variability fig 9b shows sts vs sensor depth for pumping and non pumping wells with sts calculated by subtracting summer minimum from winter maximum temperature in year 2015 which ranged 0 to 3 2 c these data indicate no clear relationship between the two parameters presumably sensors depth being more than 10 m below the ground surface fig 9c portrays pits vs sensor depth for pumping wells only with pits calculated by subtracting temperature between pump off and pump on durations pits varied spatially and temporally hence we used the maximum value of pits calculated during winter 2015 for each well pits showed a weak correlation r2 0 28 with sensor depth the maximum values of pits ranges from 0 2 to 2 5 c p values of linear regression models were 0 02 0 49 and 0 22 respectively for lag time sts and pits the p values indicate that the correlation between lag time and sensor depth was only significant fig 10 shows average monthly values of the fit parameters for eq 7 calculated separately from selectively long pumping and recovery periods between 2014 and 2016 for wells n4 left and n5 right the solid line represents temperature of the produced water e g during pumping and the grey line that of groundwater inside the well casing following recovery from the pumping the groundwater temperature inside the well stabilizes after a certain time of pump on off this stable temperature varied spatially and temporally in these aquifers here we analyzed stable temperature variations for wells n4 and n5 only fig 10a the stable groundwater temperature variations were higher for recovery periods than for pumping this result is interpreted to show that intermittent pumping minimized the amplitude of annual groundwater temperature variations by lowering groundwater temperature during winter while raising it during summer during both pumping and recovery periods groundwater temperature was higher during winter than during summer pitss were significantly higher in both summer and winter than in spring and fall as well as being generally higher during pumping than during recovery periods fig 10b the constant term of eq 7 was more than one order magnitude higher during pumping periods than that during recovery throughout the year fig 10c no correlation between pumping and recovery periods was found for the constant term the comparison of the values of the fit parameters a b and c for wells n4 and n5 depict a similar trend yet significantly different in magnitude fig 10 the groundwater temperature was always higher by approximately 1 c or more at well n4 than that at well n5 throughout the year also the groundwater temperature variations were higher for well n4 than that for well n5 similarly pitss were higher for n4 than for n5 and the temporal variations of pitss were slightly different for the two wells unlike stable groundwater temperature and pits the constant term of eq 7 was higher for n5 than for n4 however the ratio of constant for pumping to recovery was higher for n4 than n5 table 2 the temporal variations of the constant term were different for both pumping and recovery periods and between the two wells n4 and n5 5 discussion we studied groundwater temperature time series data from multiple wells in shallow alluvial aquifers next to a leaky stream and demonstrated the impacts of intermittent pumping on groundwater temperature in an attempt to identify the sources of water to the pumping wells the aquifer stage was continually lower than stream stage in most locations close to the wellfields especially in the mcmechen pws an extensive cone of depression is inferred to lie below the stream throughout the year resulting in continuous stream exfiltration maharjan 2017 we tested the hypothesis that temperature could be used as a tracer to identify stream exfiltration in a bank storage zone key observations of this groundwater temperature datasets include pumping wells displayed alternating temperature signals between pump on and pump off periods pitss were highest in summer and winter but lowest in spring and fall groundwater was generally warm in winter and cold in summer but pumping lowered the temperature of produced water in winter but raised it in summer heat transfer velocity was higher for pumping periods than that for recovery periods thermal analysis reveals that the temperature of pumped water can trace source water water temperature inside the well casing contained two signals between pump on and pump off periods the reason for the temperature shifts is primarily due to mixing of waters with different thermal signals into a well casing it suggests pumping always introduces water of different temperature to the wells than that of the ambient groundwater we acknowledged that shallow aquifer temperature is not vertically uniform taniguchi 1993 and that pumping in an unconfined aquifer can induce vertical water movement neuman 1972 thus it is theoretically possible that the different thermal signatures during pumping are merely an artifact of groundwater being sourced form shallower depths in the aquifer the pumped water was warmer in summer and colder in winter than the ambient groundwater temperature but it also could be due to shallower groundwater inflow as both river water and shallow groundwater tend to have higher seasonality compared to deeper groundwater however the well logs showed that these aquifers have multiple low conductive layers that would impede vertical flow of water fig a1 given that no source sink of heat existed nearby these aquifers the most plausible explanation for the temperature shifts is stream exfiltration hence we deduced that the pump off temperature matches the ambient groundwater temperature outside the well casing at sensor depth while the pump on temperature reflects the temperature of both ground and surface water pits ranged from 0 2 to 2 5 c in different wells and varied in magnitude and sign from time to time the magnitude of pits tended to be high in summer and winter and low in spring and fall in these wells fig 6 large pitss are the result of maximum phase shifts between groundwater and surface water temperature signals during summer and winter but phase shifts between two temperature signals minimize during fall and spring yielding small pitss the rate of induced infiltration affects phase shift between the two temperatures schneider 1962 the rate of induced infiltration would be much higher during low frequency pumping because groundwater flow to production wells had shorter and more consistent travel times under continuous rather than intermittent pumping periods sheets et al 2002 that means any exfiltrated water would frequently move back and forth into the aquifer during high frequency pumping decreasing pitss and the converse is true at low frequency pumping fig 6 furthermore pitss was observed higher in several wells close to the river than those further away fig 8 because thermal plumes dissipates exponentially away from the source suzuki 1960 hatch et al 2006 these aforementioned results suggest the amplitude of pits depends on seasonality pumping schedule and the distance from the river pits could be one of the most important indicators of groundwater and surface water interactions in these aquifers that explains the temperature variations in the pumping wells during pump on and off periods however this method is only applicable when significant variations in groundwater and surface water temperature exists in general groundwater temperature is warmer in winter and colder in summer than the surface water temperature because the amplitude of the temperature decreases and lag time increases with depth bartolino 2003 depending on the sensor depth below the surface however the magnitude and the timing of maximum minimum temperature varies significantly taniguchi 1993 pumping could alter the thermal regime in a shallow unconfined aquifer depending upon anisotropy of the aquifer groundwater flow could be much higher in one direction than the other since these unconfined alluvial aquifers have significantly high transmissivity horizontal flow is more prominent than the vertical flow maharjan 2017 however delayed gravity yield from an unconfined aquifer could contribute significant vertical groundwater flow neuman 1972 promoting advective heat transfer in the vertical direction nevertheless delayed gravity yield would not be plausible in these aquifers as pumps were operated only for short time intervals hence it can be concluded that stream exfiltration is the most important factor controlling the temperature of produced water and explains well why pumping lowered the temperature of produced water in winter but raised it in summer heat transfer velocity calculated by fitting the temperature signals into eq 7 was more than an order magnitude higher during pumping periods than that during recovery periods fig 10 thermal velocity depends on the magnitude of seepage velocity heat capacity and thermal diffusivity lachenbruch and sass 1977 deming 2002 since thermal diffusivity and heat capacity are fairly constant for a relatively small temporal and spatial window seepage velocity determines the value of the decay constant in eq 7 luce et al 2013 showed that for a specific location amplitude ratio and phase shifts were linked to each other by seepage velocity the seepage velocity in turn depends on hydraulic gradient the hydraulic gradient around the pumping well increases during the pumping periods and decreases during the recovery periods as a result the extent of capture zone becomes wider while the pumping period and narrower during the recovery period high hydraulic gradient allows water to flow quickly into the wells but low hydraulic gradient retards flow of water into the wells it is important to recognize that the pumping periods were associated not only with higher advective heat flows but also with the high pits and sts it was also noted that the aquifer water level recovered to that of the aquifer quickly when the pump was turned off but groundwater temperature responded much more slowly figs 4 6 and 8 indicating that hydraulic pressure moves faster than the thermal signals in these aquifer water levels in wells other than n4 and n5 fluctuated significantly over the study period such change in aquifer water level could have implications to heat transport because heat capacity and thermal conductivity increases with increase in saturation of porous media menberg et al 2014 kurylyk et al 2015 while the heat capacity depends linearly on saturation thermal conductivity is strictly non linear and material dependent côté and konrad 2005 hence the advective heat flows calculated from wells n4 and n5 would have higher accuracy than the other wells and were not calculated for the rest of the wells in this study besides the list of expected results we observed a few unexpected results groundwater temperature has been shown to remain fairly constant at depths below 10 m from ground surface despite changes in surface temperature anderson 2005 however all sensors used in this study were more than 10 m deep below the surface table 1 and still showed some level of temperature variations in an annual scale only well g4 19 8 m showed a constant temperature throughout the study period it is not unusual to see the extent of thermal alterations below 10 m from the surface as bartolino and niswonger 1999 observed 8 c at depths 10 m or deeper resulting from groundwater and surface water exchange for purely horizontal groundwater flow through the porous media vertical conductive heat transfer is often overwhelmed by horizontal advection such that temperature oscillations reflects induced water temperature in the wells constantz 2008 hence we conclude that high frequency pumping enhanced induced infiltration from surface water bodies thus fluctuating temperature inside the wells both components pump on off of short term temperature fluctuations show strong seasonality with an annual range 0 3 2 c in some cases sts decreased with sensor depth table 1 but no consistent correlation was found when all samples were considered fig 9 in some cases wells closer to the river displayed higher sts than ones farther away these results suggest that heat transfer in these systems is complex and varies spatially such complexity may have arisen due to heterogeneous aquifer or combination of thermal transport mechanisms as described by constantz 2008 we neglected thermal dispersivity because variably saturated water percolation is likely slower than saturated flow and can be neglected for slow moving groundwater rau et al 2012 groundwater and surface water temperature peaked at different times of a year yielding lag of 140 280 days between the two signals fig 7 lag time showed a weak positive correlation with depth for both pumping and non pumping wells fig 9 for some wells lag time was indifferent to change in l z or pumping rate while for others it correlated with z table 1 pumping wells had short lag time behind the surface temperature than the non pumping wells because of pumping induced surface water bartolino 2003 made similar observations in non pumping wells at different depths in alluvial aquifers along the rio grande river these results and their interpretations are based on a limited number of locations 14 shallow wells in such a small dataset it was difficult to establish relationships between either lag time sts or pits vs sensor depth fig 9 heat flow in such shallow aquifers is complex as multiple sources of water to pumping wells could exist vertical recharge lateral seepage and leakage from streambed and supply lines different combinations of l z and pumping rate could also substantially affect the magnitudes of pits sts and lag time because based on the well distance and pumping rate water budget could significantly vary jenkins 1968 despite the limitations we were able to calculate stable groundwater temperature and pits separately and found them significantly different for pumping and recovery periods however lag time were undiscernible at the time scale of hours the differences in stable groundwater temperature pits and seepage velocity during pumping and recovery periods strongly support that stream exfiltration is a major source of water budget to a number of pumping wells and is supported by the modeling results for mcmechen aquifer maharjan 2017 furthermore the quick temperature response after pump on off periods fig 6 suggests a close connection between surface water and groundwater it was inferred that high frequency pumping induced surface water and transferred heat into the aquifer thus the pumped water temperature can trace source water into the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river it is technically possible to calculate the amount of stream exfiltration using two end members mixing analysis based on conservation of thermal energy because temperatures of groundwater surface water and produced water as well as the rate of pumping were measured quantification of the amount of stream exfiltration is crucially important for pwss to understand overall quality and quantity of groundwater resources that plays a huge role in sustainable development of water resources however caution shall be taken while using this method especially for unconfined shallow aquifers because the groundwater temperature could be stratified in a vertical direction which violates the assumption that the measured temperature is representative of the entire aquifer however conservative tracers such as chlorine stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen could be useful estimating volumetric contribution of the river water to the pumped water using the two end members mixing analysis 6 conclusions temperature signals transport along with moving water that can easily be measured thus temperature time series have been extensively used to quantify the exchange rate of water mainly in hyporheic zones we collected high frequency temperature time series signals in the atmosphere river and pumped water in bank storage zones in an attempt to elucidate source water contributions to the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river temperature fluctuations inside frequently pumped wells displayed strong seasonality with different magnitudes of sts pits and τ that ranged between 0 and 3 2 c 0 2 2 5 c and 140 280 days respectively pumping decreased the lag times between groundwater and surface water temperature that was much prominent in the wells close to the river than that farther away pumping lowered the temperature of produced water in winter but raised it in summer the heat transfer velocity increased by more than one order magnitude during the pumping

6905,moving water can transport temperature signals of surface water into groundwater or vice versa we analyzed the temperature signals in the atmosphere river and pumped water to elucidate source water contributions to the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river temperature fluctuations in response to high frequency intermittent pumping were observed from february 2014 to august 2016 in 14 wells within three shallow unconfined alluvial aquifers along the ohio river the groundwater temperature observed in pumping wells displayed two alternating signals between pump on and pump off periods the difference in groundwater temperatures between pump on and pump off periods was defined as a temperature shift temperature shifts indicate that pumping always introduces water of different temperature to the wells than that of the ambient groundwater while seasonal pump off temperatures varied up to 3 2 c the short term temperature shifts ranged from 0 2 to 2 5 c groundwater was generally warm in winter and cold in summer but pumped water was of lower temperature in winter and higher in summer than the ambient groundwater however the pumping induced temperature shifts were highest in summer and winter and lowest in spring and fall because groundwater temperature lagged that of surface water by approximately six months the thermal transfer velocity in groundwater was more than one order magnitude higher during pumping than that during the recovery periods high frequency pumping changed produced water temperature and increased the thermal transfer velocity in the groundwater these results indicate that stream exfiltration is a major component of the water budget to a number of these wells thermal analysis reveals that the temperature of pumped water can trace source water to the pumping wells this thermal approach for estimating the source of pumped water works best when groundwater temperature variation is seasonally

partially penetrating losing stream most of these studies were performed in hyporheic exchange zones and measured vertical temperature variations beneath streambeds to depths 2 m however heat transport in a bank storage zone 100 m has been less studied for a gaining stream under the natural hydraulic gradient thermal behavior of groundwater has potential to shed light on groundwater and surface water connectivity and exchange rates in the bank storage zone that has both economic and ecological significance when considering the issues of water quality and quantity in rivers we investigated the impact of intermittent pumping on groundwater temperature in connection to stream exfiltration using high frequency temperature time series data collected in the atmosphere shallow unconfined aquifers and a leaky stream we hypothesize that if pumping induces surface water to exfiltrate into the shallow aquifers then the temperature of produced water would diverge from the ambient groundwater temperature provided that the temperature of exfiltrated water has significantly different thermal signature from that of other sources of water to the pumping wells 2 study sites the study area is a series of discontinuous gravel aquifers along the ohio river valley of west virginia tapped by wells in three pws systems new martinsville glen dale and mcmechen fig 1 the

also extend up the major tributaries groundwater in mcmechen glen dale and new martinsville is intermittently pumped at approximately 6000 2000 and 8000 m3 day respectively using combinations of 11 wells completed near the base of the aquifer mcmechen has four concurrently pumped wells in two rows nearly parallel to the river glen dale has four observation and two production wells pumped intermittently one at a time with weekly rotation new martinsville has five pumping wells of which two n4 and n5 alternates their operation and the other three are pumped simultaneously the south flowing ohio river forms nearly level pools along the channel hannibal locks and dam at new martinsville forms a 68 km long pool which is adjacent to 11 of the 14 wells wells are 70 to 160 m distant

n4 and n5 1500 to 1600 m upstream of it table 1 summarizes locations and characteristics of pumping and observation wells employed 3 methods groundwater temperatures and water levels response to intermittent pumping were measured in the 14 wells using data logger coupled sensors data were collected at one minute intervals from february 2014 to february 2016 and then at hourly intervals until august 2016 also during this period air temperature was measured in a well casing well g4 with the sensor 1 52 m below ground surface 15 minute interval stream temperature was compiled from january 2014 to november 2016 from a gaging station in montgomery pool 60 miles upstream from glen dale along the ohio river the pressure transducers used in wells were of two kinds i vented global water wl 16 and ii sealed onset u020 models the sealed loggers were used in unpumped outdoor wells in the glen dale pws the vented transducers have pressure and temperature accuracy of 1 cm and 0 28 c the sealed ones are 3 cm and 0 44 c the loggers were downloaded monthly and converted to hydraulic heads using standard techniques weight and sonderegger 2001 water level below the top of casing was measured periodically with an electric tape 5 mm to verify transducer readings fig 2 a shows schematic flow lines in a hypothetical unconfined alluvial aquifer with a single pumping well at distance l from a stream a pressure temperature sensor is shown set in the well at depth z below ground surface a cone of depression is shown to have developed in response to pumping intercepting the river boundary and inducing exfiltration fluid flow to the well is dominantly horizontal in the screened interval and dominantly vertical above it perhaps due to anisotropy of aquifer materials fig 2b illustrates hypothesized heat transfer mechanisms in the aquifer of fig 2a the surface and subsurface temperatures differ and fluctuate seasonally changes in subsurface temperature are slow and form nearly horizontal isotherms in this conduction zone groundwater entering the well by advection from the river may reflect stream temperature rather than that of the aquifer surface single headed arrow

propagated into the solid can be estimated by 2 ω d e carslaw and jaeger 1959 luce et al 2013 higher frequency oscillations like daily temperature variations are only detectable at shallow depths while lower frequency oscillations such as annual temperature variations are detectable at greater depths thermal properties of an aquifer can be estimated using eq 3 by matching observed annual temperature variations at depths without considering the effects of intermittent pumping for simplicity we assumed conduction was the dominant mechanism of heat transport at an annual scale although advection could also contribute to heat flow during recharge events however maharjan and donovan 2016 showed that lateral flow dominated vertical flow in such aquifers even during the recharge events where the layers of clay and silt occur in the vadose zone the model was adjusted in accordance with the observed data to estimate lag times τ days and seasonal temperature shifts sts c twice the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and the results were presented in table 1 high frequency intermittent pumping caused both water level and temperature to fluctuate inside the wells water level responses to intermittent pumping were significantly quicker than temperature response inside the wells hence only the short term temperature variations due to pumping were modeled using eq 7 7 t a exp b t c where t is temperature variations inside wells during pumping or recovery periods c t is time in minutes a b and c are amplitude c decay constant 1 min and stable temperature at the end of the modeled durations c respectively here we defined a recovery period as the time in between two successive intermittent pumping periods that is usually less than a week temperature variations due to pumping and recovery were manually sampled only for wells n4 and n5 from two and half year long time series because static water levels in these wells did not fluctuated significantly in comparison to other wells throughout the year pumping periods were generally shorter in length than the recovery periods for all the wells 63 38 pumping and 25 recovery and 78 number of samples 52 pumping and 26 recovery were randomly collected for wells n4 and n5 respectively over the study period fit parameters to the datasets were estimated using a curve fitting toolbox in matlab with a 95 of confidence limit fig 3 4 results 4 1 observed water level and temperature observed water level variations during pumping of well m5 from may 2014 to august 2016 are shown as light grey bands fig 4 this well was intermittently pumped at high frequency followed by 8 to 10 minute pump off periods generally too brief to be discernible at the scale of fig 4 labels 1 upper edge of light grey bands and 2 lower edge indicate non pumping pump off and pumping pump on water levels respectively the separation between labels 1 and 2 i e the height of the light grey band is drawdown due to pumping i e the sum of aquifer and well losses the magnitude of this drawdown was approximately uniform during the period shown and independent of seasonal variations in aquifer water level during pump off periods i e label 1 the water level represents that of the aquifer itself and was higher in spring than fall the bottom of the light grey band represents aquifer water level less well loss drawdown although not apparent in this figure when the pump turns off the well losses recover within an hour and the well head re equilibrates with the surrounding aquifer whose level is at all times below stream stage in the vicinity of this well field temperature variations in the well during and after pumping appear as vertical dark grey bands fig 4 the period showing no band represents a data gap label 3 labels 4 and 5 indicate temperatures at pump on and pump off times respectively the difference in groundwater temperatures between pump on and pump off period was defined as a temperature shift the appearance of temperature as a band is simply due to high frequency pumping the magnitude of temperature fluctuations generated by such high frequency pumping was seasonally non uniform and highest during summer and winter double headed arrows high water levels appear to correlate with some asterisk but not all temperature peaks temperature in this well showed an annual range of 3 4 c fluctuation with minima in july october and maxima in february april this annual temperature range during non pumping in summer and winter will be referred to as seasonal temperature shift sts at much briefer time scales the temperature difference between pumping and non pumping periods i e the difference between labels 4 and 5 will be referred to as pumping induced temperature shifts pits the longer term sts range was approximately 7 20 times higher than pits for well m5 fig 5 shows river water and air temperature between january 2014 and november 2016 for montgomery pool and well g4 respectively air temperature was recorded at 1 minute intervals inside well g4 at 1 52 m below the surface and is a dampened measure of surface temperature both temperatures attained their maxima in august and minima in february with an annual range of 28 and 20 c respectively however river temperature lagged behind that of air by approximately 15 days briggs et al 2018 noted similar long lag between atmosphere and surface water seasonal temperature signals in selected rivers of the eastern united states and used process based thermal modeling to demonstrate that such lags are indicative of river flow that is predominantly sourced from shallow aquifers both temperatures contain two different periodic components i a long term seasonal trend and ii a short term diurnal trend stream temperature is less sensitive to diurnal temperature fluctuations than that of air which shows diurnal spikes especially during summer and winter the lower sensitivity of stream temperature and longer lag time to variations in solar radiation is ascribed to the high specific heat capacity of water larger volume of the river water and the depth at which the temperature was being measured caissie 2006 fig 6 depicts high resolution water level grey and temperature black fluctuations at different seasons for well n4 this graphic is analogous to fig 4 but for a different well and at much higher time resolution pits reached its maxima during summer fig 6a and winter fig 6b and its minima during spring and fall not shown the direction of pits differs in summer from winter the pits shift is negative cools during pump off periods in late spring summer negative re equilibration but positive in late fall winter positive re equilibration groundwater recovered to its non pumping level in less than an hour but temperature took approximately a week to do so aquifer water level top of the light grey band showed very little fluctuation but temperature varied significantly during the study period pits is represented by double headed arrows in fig 6 and reached its peak within an hour of the onset of pumping because its temperature is derived from warmer groundwater entering the well from the basal gravel aquifer following cessation of pumping temperature recovers to an ambient condition slowly and exponentially the temperature fluctuations within the dashed oval are also pits but related to high frequency pumping longer the recovery period larger the pits however the magnitude of the pits is influenced more by season than by the duration of the recovery period 4 2 analysis of observed data fig 7 shows an observed grey and modeled black temperature using eq 3 between february 2014 and august 2016 for the ohio river on the top of both columns and 10 wells from 3 pwss the observed temperature variations in both groundwater and surface water were not perfectly sinusoidal and the amplitudes were not constant even for the same well from year to year however the model captured seasonal temperature variations in the ohio river and groundwater at the 10 wells the amplitude of temperature variations in surface water was more than one order magnitude higher than that of groundwater temperature for majority of the wells the amplitude and the phase shift of temperature variations in groundwater was distinctly different from one well to another depending upon sensor depths and the distance from a river the effect of sensor depth and the distance from a river on the groundwater temperature variations will be discussed later the quality of agreement between the model and the observed data varied widely for different wells presumably because of phenomena and local factors not incorporated into the model however the model estimated effective aquifer thermal diffusivities by separately comparing amplitude and lag time estimated using eqs 3 and 6 the ranges of thermal diffusivity calculated using both amplitude and lag time were consistent and varied from 0 01 to 0 07 cm2 s thermal diffusivity calculated using amplitude showed wider range than that calculated using lag time the conductive thermal velocity was calculated using equation 14 of luce et al 2013 that ranged from 5 to 12 cm day in these aquifers table 1 fig 8 compares temperature from montgomery pool top to water level and temperature variations in wells n4 middle and n5 bottom at new martinsville pws between february 2014 and august 2016 the complementary grey stripes for the two wells indicate they were pumped in alternation stream and groundwater temperature ranged from 0 to 28 c and from 10 8 to 13 8 c respectively sts vertical double headed arrows varied in magnitude slightly from one year to another for the same well labels 1 2 and 3 refer to the time of a year when temperature were the lowest in the stream n4 and n5 respectively indicating time lag between surface and groundwater temperature peaks this time lag for well n4 is approximately 60 days shorter than n5 as indicated by the hachured line between labels 2 and 3 in fig 8 sts a and pits c for n4 in fig 8 are larger than that of n5 by 0 4 c and 0 3 c respectively however this difference is not large and fall within the limit of uncertainty these results can be ascribed to some combination of two factors i n4 being closer to the stream than n5 105 vs 270 m and ii the n4 sensor being closer to the surface than that of n5 8 5 vs 13 7 m at all times shown aquifer water level was higher but pumping drawdown was lower for well n4 than n5 assumedly for the same reasons fig 9a depicts τ vs sensor depth for pumping and non pumping wells with lag times estimated by matching river water temperature peaks to the corresponding groundwater peaks using eq 3 fig 7 lag times range from 140 to 280 days for these wells and were generally less for pumping than for non pumping wells sensor depth and τ show some correlation r2 0 48 and indicate that τ generally increases with depth below the surface with minor variability fig 9b shows sts vs sensor depth for pumping and non pumping wells with sts calculated by subtracting summer minimum from winter maximum temperature in year 2015 which ranged 0 to 3 2 c these data indicate no clear relationship between the two parameters presumably sensors depth being more than 10 m below the ground surface fig 9c portrays pits vs sensor depth for pumping wells only with pits calculated by subtracting temperature between pump off and pump on durations pits varied spatially and temporally hence we used the maximum value of pits calculated during winter 2015 for each well pits showed a weak correlation r2 0 28 with sensor depth the maximum values of pits ranges from 0 2 to 2 5 c p values of linear regression models were 0 02 0 49 and 0 22 respectively for lag time sts and pits the p values indicate that the correlation between lag time and sensor depth was only significant fig 10 shows average monthly values of the fit parameters for eq 7 calculated separately from selectively long pumping and recovery periods between 2014 and 2016 for wells n4 left and n5 right the solid line represents temperature of the produced water e g during pumping and the grey line that of groundwater inside the well casing following recovery from the pumping the groundwater temperature inside the well stabilizes after a certain time of pump on off this stable temperature varied spatially and temporally in these aquifers here we analyzed stable temperature variations for wells n4 and n5 only fig 10a the stable groundwater temperature variations were higher for recovery periods than for pumping this result is interpreted to show that intermittent pumping minimized the amplitude of annual groundwater temperature variations by lowering groundwater temperature during winter while raising it during summer during both pumping and recovery periods groundwater temperature was higher during winter than during summer pitss were significantly higher in both summer and winter than in spring and fall as well as being generally higher during pumping than during recovery periods fig 10b the constant term of eq 7 was more than one order magnitude higher during pumping periods than that during recovery throughout the year fig 10c no correlation between pumping and recovery periods was found for the constant term the comparison of the values of the fit parameters a b and c for wells n4 and n5 depict a similar trend yet significantly different in magnitude fig 10 the groundwater temperature was always higher by approximately 1 c or more at well n4 than that at well n5 throughout the year also the groundwater temperature variations were higher for well n4 than that for well n5 similarly pitss were higher for n4 than for n5 and the temporal variations of pitss were slightly different for the two wells unlike stable groundwater temperature and pits the constant term of eq 7 was higher for n5 than for n4 however the ratio of constant for pumping to recovery was higher for n4 than n5 table 2 the temporal variations of the constant term were different for both pumping and recovery periods and between the two wells n4 and n5 5 discussion we studied groundwater temperature time series data from multiple wells in shallow alluvial aquifers next to a leaky stream and demonstrated the impacts of intermittent pumping on groundwater temperature in an attempt to identify the sources of water to the pumping wells the aquifer stage was continually lower than stream stage in most locations close to the wellfields especially in the mcmechen pws an extensive cone of depression is inferred to lie below the stream throughout the year resulting in continuous stream exfiltration maharjan 2017 we tested the hypothesis that temperature could be used as a tracer to identify stream exfiltration in a bank storage zone key observations of this groundwater temperature datasets include pumping wells displayed alternating temperature signals between pump on and pump off periods pitss were highest in summer and winter but lowest in spring and fall groundwater was generally warm in winter and cold in summer but pumping lowered the temperature of produced water in winter but raised it in summer heat transfer velocity was higher for pumping periods than that for recovery periods thermal analysis reveals that the temperature of pumped water can trace source water water temperature inside the well casing contained two signals between pump on and pump off periods the reason for the temperature shifts is primarily due to mixing of waters with different thermal signals into a well casing it suggests pumping always introduces water of different temperature to the wells than that of the ambient groundwater we acknowledged that shallow aquifer temperature is not vertically uniform taniguchi 1993 and that pumping in an unconfined aquifer can induce vertical water movement neuman 1972 thus it is theoretically possible that the different thermal signatures during pumping are merely an artifact of groundwater being sourced form shallower depths in the aquifer the pumped water was warmer in summer and colder in winter than the ambient groundwater temperature but it also could be due to shallower groundwater inflow as both river water and shallow groundwater tend to have higher seasonality compared to deeper groundwater however the well logs showed that these aquifers have multiple low conductive layers that would impede vertical flow of water fig a1 given that no source sink of heat existed nearby these aquifers the most plausible explanation for the temperature shifts is stream exfiltration hence we deduced that the pump off temperature matches the ambient groundwater temperature outside the well casing at sensor depth while the pump on temperature reflects the temperature of both ground and surface water pits ranged from 0 2 to 2 5 c in different wells and varied in magnitude and sign from time to time the magnitude of pits tended to be high in summer and winter and low in spring and fall in these wells fig 6 large pitss are the result of maximum phase shifts between groundwater and surface water temperature signals during summer and winter but phase shifts between two temperature signals minimize during fall and spring yielding small pitss the rate of induced infiltration affects phase shift between the two temperatures schneider 1962 the rate of induced infiltration would be much higher during low frequency pumping because groundwater flow to production wells had shorter and more consistent travel times under continuous rather than intermittent pumping periods sheets et al 2002 that means any exfiltrated water would frequently move back and forth into the aquifer during high frequency pumping decreasing pitss and the converse is true at low frequency pumping fig 6 furthermore pitss was observed higher in several wells close to the river than those further away fig 8 because thermal plumes dissipates exponentially away from the source suzuki 1960 hatch et al 2006 these aforementioned results suggest the amplitude of pits depends on seasonality pumping schedule and the distance from the river pits could be one of the most important indicators of groundwater and surface water interactions in these aquifers that explains the temperature variations in the pumping wells during pump on and off periods however this method is only applicable when significant variations in groundwater and surface water temperature exists in general groundwater temperature is warmer in winter and colder in summer than the surface water temperature because the amplitude of the temperature decreases and lag time increases with depth bartolino 2003 depending on the sensor depth below the surface however the magnitude and the timing of maximum minimum temperature varies significantly taniguchi 1993 pumping could alter the thermal regime in a shallow unconfined aquifer depending upon anisotropy of the aquifer groundwater flow could be much higher in one direction than the other since these unconfined alluvial aquifers have significantly high transmissivity horizontal flow is more prominent than the vertical flow maharjan 2017 however delayed gravity yield from an unconfined aquifer could contribute significant vertical groundwater flow neuman 1972 promoting advective heat transfer in the vertical direction nevertheless delayed gravity yield would not be plausible in these aquifers as pumps were operated only for short time intervals hence it can be concluded that stream exfiltration is the most important factor controlling the temperature of produced water and explains well why pumping lowered the temperature of produced water in winter but raised it in summer heat transfer velocity calculated by fitting the temperature signals into eq 7 was more than an order magnitude higher during pumping periods than that during recovery periods fig 10 thermal velocity depends on the magnitude of seepage velocity heat capacity and thermal diffusivity lachenbruch and sass 1977 deming 2002 since thermal diffusivity and heat capacity are fairly constant for a relatively small temporal and spatial window seepage velocity determines the value of the decay constant in eq 7 luce et al 2013 showed that for a specific location amplitude ratio and phase shifts were linked to each other by seepage velocity the seepage velocity in turn depends on hydraulic gradient the hydraulic gradient around the pumping well increases during the pumping periods and decreases during the recovery periods as a result the extent of capture zone becomes wider while the pumping period and narrower during the recovery period high hydraulic gradient allows water to flow quickly into the wells but low hydraulic gradient retards flow of water into the wells it is important to recognize that the pumping periods were associated not only with higher advective heat flows but also with the high pits and sts it was also noted that the aquifer water level recovered to that of the aquifer quickly when the pump was turned off but groundwater temperature responded much more slowly figs 4 6 and 8 indicating that hydraulic pressure moves faster than the thermal signals in these aquifer water levels in wells other than n4 and n5 fluctuated significantly over the study period such change in aquifer water level could have implications to heat transport because heat capacity and thermal conductivity increases with increase in saturation of porous media menberg et al 2014 kurylyk et al 2015 while the heat capacity depends linearly on saturation thermal conductivity is strictly non linear and material dependent côté and konrad 2005 hence the advective heat flows calculated from wells n4 and n5 would have higher accuracy than the other wells and were not calculated for the rest of the wells in this study besides the list of expected results we observed a few unexpected results groundwater temperature has been shown to remain fairly constant at depths below 10 m from ground surface despite changes in surface temperature anderson 2005 however all sensors used in this study were more than 10 m deep below the surface table 1 and still showed some level of temperature variations in an annual scale only well g4 19 8 m showed a constant temperature throughout the study period it is not unusual to see the extent of thermal alterations below 10 m from the surface as bartolino and niswonger 1999 observed 8 c at depths 10 m or deeper resulting from groundwater and surface water exchange for purely horizontal groundwater flow through the porous media vertical conductive heat transfer is often overwhelmed by horizontal advection such that temperature oscillations reflects induced water temperature in the wells constantz 2008 hence we conclude that high frequency pumping enhanced induced infiltration from surface water bodies thus fluctuating temperature inside the wells both components pump on off of short term temperature fluctuations show strong seasonality with an annual range 0 3 2 c in some cases sts decreased with sensor depth table 1 but no consistent correlation was found when all samples were considered fig 9 in some cases wells closer to the river displayed higher sts than ones farther away these results suggest that heat transfer in these systems is complex and varies spatially such complexity may have arisen due to heterogeneous aquifer or combination of thermal transport mechanisms as described by constantz 2008 we neglected thermal dispersivity because variably saturated water percolation is likely slower than saturated flow and can be neglected for slow moving groundwater rau et al 2012 groundwater and surface water temperature peaked at different times of a year yielding lag of 140 280 days between the two signals fig 7 lag time showed a weak positive correlation with depth for both pumping and non pumping wells fig 9 for some wells lag time was indifferent to change in l z or pumping rate while for others it correlated with z table 1 pumping wells had short lag time behind the surface temperature than the non pumping wells because of pumping induced surface water bartolino 2003 made similar observations in non pumping wells at different depths in alluvial aquifers along the rio grande river these results and their interpretations are based on a limited number of locations 14 shallow wells in such a small dataset it was difficult to establish relationships between either lag time sts or pits vs sensor depth fig 9 heat flow in such shallow aquifers is complex as multiple sources of water to pumping wells could exist vertical recharge lateral seepage and leakage from streambed and supply lines different combinations of l z and pumping rate could also substantially affect the magnitudes of pits sts and lag time because based on the well distance and pumping rate water budget could significantly vary jenkins 1968 despite the limitations we were able to calculate stable groundwater temperature and pits separately and found them significantly different for pumping and recovery periods however lag time were undiscernible at the time scale of hours the differences in stable groundwater temperature pits and seepage velocity during pumping and recovery periods strongly support that stream exfiltration is a major source of water budget to a number of pumping wells and is supported by the modeling results for mcmechen aquifer maharjan 2017 furthermore the quick temperature response after pump on off periods fig 6 suggests a close connection between surface water and groundwater it was inferred that high frequency pumping induced surface water and transferred heat into the aquifer thus the pumped water temperature can trace source water into the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river it is technically possible to calculate the amount of stream exfiltration using two end members mixing analysis based on conservation of thermal energy because temperatures of groundwater surface water and produced water as well as the rate of pumping were measured quantification of the amount of stream exfiltration is crucially important for pwss to understand overall quality and quantity of groundwater resources that plays a huge role in sustainable development of water resources however caution shall be taken while using this method especially for unconfined shallow aquifers because the groundwater temperature could be stratified in a vertical direction which violates the assumption that the measured temperature is representative of the entire aquifer however conservative tracers such as chlorine stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen could be useful estimating volumetric contribution of the river water to the pumped water using the two end members mixing analysis 6 conclusions temperature signals transport along with moving water that can easily be measured thus temperature time series have been extensively used to quantify the exchange rate of water mainly in hyporheic zones we collected high frequency temperature time series signals in the atmosphere river and pumped water in bank storage zones in an attempt to elucidate source water contributions to the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river temperature fluctuations inside frequently pumped wells displayed strong seasonality with different magnitudes of sts pits and τ that ranged between 0 and 3 2 c 0 2 2 5 c and 140 280 days respectively pumping decreased the lag times between groundwater and surface water temperature that was much prominent in the wells close to the river than that farther away pumping lowered the temperature of produced water in winter but raised it in summer the heat transfer velocity increased by more than one order magnitude during the pumping periods than that during recovery periods this study strongly indicates that pits could be a single important element that shows connectivity between groundwater and surface water exchange besides sts seepage velocity and lag time stream exfiltration is the most important factor controlling the temperature of the produced water and constitutes a significant portion of the water budget for a number of pumping wells that occurs throughout the year at different rates thermal approach for estimating the source of pumped water works best when the contrast in temperature between groundwater and surface water is seasonally large i e in summer and winter despite limited data and multiple potential sources of water to pumping wells thermal analysis reveals that the temperature of pumped water can trace source water to the pumping wells this method could be a reliable and inexpensive field based method for observation of groundwater surface water exchange in bank storage zones understanding of spatial and temporal variations in water exchange in bank storage zones along a long reach of a stream could provide crucial information to water operators to develop and manage sustainable and

6906,the climate change and human activities can principally doubt the frequency analysis methods which assume that the hydrological events are stationary the pearson type 3 p3 distribution which has been widely applied in frequency analysis under the stationary condition was developed for the nonstationary cases the distribution parameters can be expressed as exponential or polynomial functions with time or other covariates parameter estimation for the nonstationary p3 model was done with the penalized maximum likelihood estimation pmle method in which we applied a restrictive penalty on the location parameter to avoid unreasonable results the results of the nonstationary p3 model were compared to that of the generalized extreme value gev distribution in which the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle method was applied to estimate the parameters the monte carlo simulations indicated that the nonstationary p3 model provided better results than the nonstationary gev model for different sample sizes both models were also applied in hydrological series with various trends and record lengths to prove the feasibility of the nonstationary p3 model in practical applications the applications showed that the nonstationary p3 model performed better than the nonstationary gev model in most of the studied cases keywords pearson type 3 distribution nonstationary condition parameter estimation penalized maximum likelihood estimation 1 introduction to meet the demand of project design the extreme value theory provides a method to explain historical records and to make inference for future probabilities of extreme events i e floods wind speeds extreme waves and rainfall the log pearson type 3 lp3 distribution was commonly recommended to fit sequences of annual peak flood flows in the united states benson 1968 moreover the pearson type 3 p3 distribution was recommended for frequency analysis by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china zhan and ye 1987 since then the p3 lp3 and gamma family of distributions were considered in a large number of related studies such as precipitation annual runoff and flood series durrans 1992 to analyze the eco hydrological conditions in the yellow river zhang et al 2013 used the stationary p3 distribution to conduct the frequency analysis for stream flow for the low flow frequency analysis yu et al 2014 found that the stationary p3 distribution is usually able to give the most satisfactory results when compared to that of weibull and copula based distributions except for frequency analysis zucco et al 2015 used the p3 distribution to fit runoff series wherein the parameters in the distribution were peak discharge time to peak and shape parameter respectively however there is by no means universal acceptance of the p3 distribution for modeling hydrological events the advances in both at site and regional frequency analyses caused debates which were related to the utilization of p3 distribution among statistical hydrologists vogel and mcmartin 1991 for example ribeiro correa and rousselle 1993 developed an estimation methodology for a regional p3 flood flow model however hosking and wallis 1993 suggested to use the generalized extreme value gev distribution because the sample l skewness and l kurtosis were unbiased and the generalized logistic distribution was recommended as the standard for regional flood frequency analysis in the uk kjeldsen and jones 2006 during the past decades numerous methods have been developed to estimate the p3 distribution parameters and to conduct frequency analysis bobée 1973 singh and singh 1985 song and ding 1988 durrans 1992 cohen 1950 introduced the method of moments which was later recommended by the us water resources council durrans 1992 harter 1969 provided a detailed table of percentage points for the p3 distribution matalas and wallis 1973 found that the maximum likelihood estimation mle method yielded solutions that were less biased and less variable when compared to the moment estimates similar conclusions were confirmed by other researchers buckett and oliver 1977 song and ding 1988 ding et al 1989 on the contrary nozdryn plotnicki and watt 1979 used mle the method of moments and a method which preserved the moments of untransformed flows to estimate the parameters and they argued that no one method be superior for the whole of the parameter space singh and singh 1985 also pointed that the method of moments with a corrected coefficient of skewness c s provided better results than the mle method however the traditional frequency analysis was based on two fundamental assumptions the data series should be independent and identically distributed previous studies indicated that extreme events were hardly stationary due to the influence of climate change and human activity and significant trends can be detected in extreme values from different hydro climatological series milly et al 2008 ipcc 2014 lin et al 2014 pointed out that the land use change was more likely to affect runoff during the flood season in further the social economy was significantly affected by the extreme climatic factors he et al 2017 as a result the nonstationary model with time varying parameters was progressively popular in recent two decades which challenged the uses of the method of moments that may only be valid for the stationary conditions although the p3 distribution is still considered as an alternative in regional frequency analysis yang et al 2010 san et al 2011 it has no longer be applied in the hydrology to the same extent as others under the nonstationary condition for example the nonstationary gev model is prevalent in recent hydrologic literature and has been extensively used for flood frequency analysis coles 2001 adlouni et al 2007 cannon 2010 lima et al 2015 the gamlss package also has widely been used in hydrological frequency analysis in recent years lópez and francés 2013 li and tan 2015 the gamlss package in r project provides a number of continuous discrete and mixed distributions for modelling the data series but it only includes a two parameter gamma distribution stasinopoulos et al 2008 therefore this paper aimed to develop a method for the nonstationary p3 distribution besides we can conduct further works based on the fitted p3 distribution for example it is able to compare the performance of different parameter estimation methods and analyze the reliability of results based on uncertainty estimation in recent years some studies also reported that the p3 distribution could generate the most satisfactory results in at site and regional analysis saf 2009 dodangeh et al 2014 yu et al 2014 to our knowledge the p3 distribution was hardly used to fit the nonstationary time series liu et al 2014 studied the performance of different distributions under the nonstationary conditions and pointed that the gev and p3 models can better fit sample than other models however unlike the usual method which adopted the time varying parameters in a nonstationary model liu et al 2014 used the nonstationary modeling by modifying the nonstationary series to stationary series the objective of this study is to use the p3 distribution for estimating design values under the nonstationary conditions a penalized maximum likelihood estimation pmle method is used for parameter estimation in the case of a nonstationary p3 model this method avoids unreasonable results in the nonstationary condition by setting a penalized term to restrict the value of the location parameter the parameters are expressed as a polynomial function of time t to show the feasibility of pmle if the nonstationary p3 distribution performs well in this case we believed that it can generate satisfied results when using other covariates the parameters can also be dependent on other covariates i e climate indices before selecting other covariates it is better to quantitatively understand the effects of climate and human factors on the hydrological process thus we do not consider other covariates in this paper the results of nonstationary p3 models are compared to that of nonstationary gev models which is the most popular model for annual maximum minimum series the nonstationary gev parameters are estimated by the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle method which can avoid the problem in numerical technique when employing the mle method in small samples martins and stedinger 2000 adlouni et al 2007 moreover we use the extremes package in r project to build the nonstationary gev model the performance of both models is verified by monte carlo simulation and case studies 2 methods 2 1 nonstationary pearson type 3 model 2 1 1 model structure the pearson type 3 distribution is bounded in one direction according to the shape parameter and its probability density function is as follows 1 f x β α γ α x r α 1 exp β x r where α β r are the shape scale and location parameters respectively in general the p3 distribution has five forms according to the shape parameter α and previous research indicated that it would be more suitable when α 2 buckett and oliver 1977 if the scale parameter β 0 the p3 distribution has a positive skewness and x r 0 while the distribution has a negative skewness and x r 0 when β 0 koutrouvelis and canavos 1999 as we are interested in the frequency of extreme value with a high quantile the shape and scale parameters are supposed to be positive values in this paper in the stationary case the traditional parameter estimation method is used the first four moments of the population to obtain the three parameters of the p3 distribution according to the sample series these parameters can be expressed as the equations from the mean value x coefficient of variation c v and coefficient of skewness c s zhang et al 2013 2 α 4 c s 2 β 2 x c v c s r x 1 2 c v c s however the method is no longer be valid under the nonstationary assumption therefore the maximum likelihood estimation mle method is used in this paper to obtain the time varying parameters of the nonstationary p3 distribution the parameters in a nonstationary p3 distribution model will be expressed as a function of time t or other covariates 3 f x β t α t γ α t x t r t α t 1 e β t x t r t in this study the shape parameter α t exp k 0 k 1 t k 2 t 2 scale parameter β t exp k 3 k 4 t k 5 t 2 and location parameter r t exp k 6 k 7 t k 8 t 2 are exponential functions related to time t the using of the exponential function is to ensure that the positivity of α and β are respected for all values of t by changing the value of k i i 0 1 8 there are 27 models in which the exponential functions are constant linear or quadratic the models with time dependence of order i in the shape parameter order j in the scale parameter and order k in the location parameter are denoted by m ijk i 0 1 2 j 0 1 2 k 0 1 2 some examples are presented in table 1 for example m 012 indicates a model that the shape parameter is independent of time while the scale parameter and location parameter has a linear and quadratic trend respectively besides k i i 0 1 8 is the parameter of trend functions i e the parameters to be estimated are k 0 k 3 k 4 k 6 k 7 k 8 for the m 012 model k 0 k 1 k 3 k 4 k 6 k 7 for the m 111 model 2 1 2 parameter estimation assuming x 1 x 2 x n is a sequence of hydrological variables that are distributed within the nonstationary p3 distribution under the nonstationary condition we can have the likelihood estimators of x 1 x 2 x n 4 l α t β t r t t 1 n β t α t γ α t x t r t α t 1 e β t x t r t it is more convenient to take logarithms of eq 4 and have the log likelihood estimators 5 d ln l α t β t r t t 1 n ln β t α t γ α t x t r t α t 1 e β t x t r t by using a nelder mead or newton raphson algorithm it can obtain the maximum likelihood estimators α t β t r t of parameters as the p3 distribution has a lower bound at the location parameter the likelihood is not derivable for the location parameter and the maximum likelihood estimator of the location parameter is actually the first order statistic of the sample this can also provide a reference when using numerical techniques to obtain the maximum likelihood estimators unlike the stationary p3 distribution there are some drawbacks when using mle method to estimate the nonstationary p3 distribution parameters for instance the changes of location parameters r t in a nonstationary model may lead to a result of x t r t 0 which can generate unreasonable likelihood value exerting a significant impact on the optimization progress no matter what kind of algorithms are used in the mle method for example the probability density obtained from eq 3 should lie between 0 and 1 and eq 5 will generate a negative log likelihood value in the case of x t r t 0 and shape parameter α 1 eq 3 will frequently generate comparatively large values i e 106 resulting in a positive value from the log likelihood function moreover eq 3 may also return a complex number when x t r t 0 the optimization process is disturbed by these problems which will doubt the precision of parameter estimation a penalized term π x t r t is introduced in the optimization process to avoid such problems it is defined as 6 π x t r t 1 x t r t b exp a x t r t b c x t r t b t 1 2 n where the coefficients are set as a 100 c 3 and b 0 05 in this study a small value of b means a more restrictive penalty on location parameter r the a and c values indicate the convergence rate and the large values of them are corresponding to a small interval from π x r 1 to π x r 0 fig 1 shows the penalty function π x r with coefficients a 100 c 3 and b 0 05 each of the observations x t has a corresponding probability density f x t α t β t r t which is penalized by the corresponding π x t r t if the location parameter is a constant value the penalty function is actually based on the difference between x 1 and r in which x 1 is the minimum value of data series the likelihood function l α t β t r t is transformed into a penalized likelihood function t 1 n f x t π x t r t the penalized log likelihood function equals the expression in 5 plus ln π x t r t which is 7 d ln l α t β t r t ln π x t r t the parameters of the nonstationary p3 model can be obtained by maximizing the log likelihood function in eq 7 2 2 nonstationary gev model the gev distribution is the combination of continuous probability distributions including the gumbel fréchet and weibull families jenkinson 1956 under the nonstationary condition the gev distribution has a cumulative distribution function 8 f x exp 1 ξ t x μ t σ t 1 ξ t ξ t 0 exp exp x μ t σ t ξ t 0 where 1 ξ t x μ t σ t 0 μ t r σ t 0 and ξ t r are the location scale and shape parameters respectively the gev distribution has been widely used in the hydrological frequency analysis by considering a linear or quadratic dependence on covariates the gev models with time dependence of order i in the scale parameter and order j in the location parameter are denoted by ge v ij i 0 1 2 3 j 0 1 2 3 the maximum likelihood estimation mle method is the most popular method for the development of computer sciences however hosking et al 1985 pointed that the l moments estimation was superior to the mle method for sample sizes varying from 15 to 100 moreover previous studies found that the mle may generate absurd values of the shape parameter especially for the small samples record length 50 however the l moments can only be used under the stationary assumption which largely restricted its application then several methods were proposed to improve the performance of mle method coles and dixon 1999 proposed a penalized mle method to restrict the value of shape parameter martins and stedinger 2000 proposed a generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle which could provide a more restrictive penalty on the shape parameter morrison and smith 2002 developed a mixed method which combined the mle and l moments method to avoid the problems mentioned above the gmle method was widely used and further developed in a nonstationary condition adlouni et al 2007 cannon 2010 the generalized likelihood function is defined as 9 ℓ gl π ξ l n 10 l n t 1 n f x t u t σ t ξ t where l n is the likelihood function of sample series details can be seen in martins and stedinger 2000 the penalized function π ξ is the beta distribution given by π ξ 0 5 θ 3 p 1 0 5 θ 3 q 1 b p q with p 6 and q 9 wherein b p q γ p γ q γ p q 2 3 model checking the commonly used methods akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are introduced in this paper to compare the performance of different models these statistics are given by 11 aic 2 l l f 2 n u m p a r 12 bic 2 l l f n u m p a r log n where llf is the maximized log likelihood numpar is the number of parameters and n is the record length a lower value of aic or bic indicates a better model in the simulation study the best model is determined by the aic and bic values and the root mean square error rmse is computed for different quantiles non exceedance probabilities p 0 5 0 8 0 9 0 95 0 99 with sample sizes n 20 n 40 n 60 n 80 n 100 2 4 methods of uncertainty analysis the profile likelihood method is assumed to be a robust and accurate method in uncertainty analysis for extreme events coles 2001 obeysekera and salas 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 based on the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators the profile method can be used to estimate the confidence intervals with the following steps the fitted p3 distribution has a parameter vector θ α β r and the quantile q p with nonexceedance probability p 0 p 1 is obtained as 13 q p g a m i n v p α 1 β r where gaminv is the gamma inverse cumulative distribution function let θ i denotes a particular parameter which is desired to estimate its confidence interval and θ i is the remaining parameters in θ the shape parameter of p3 distribution is set to be the particular parameter because it can affect the type of distribution buckett and oliver 1977 the profile log likelihood for θ i is defined as coles 2001 14 ℓ p θ i max θ i ℓ θ i θ i eq 14 is used to obtain the maximum value concerning all parameters expect θ i the approximation of a 1 α confidence interval of θ i is computed as 15 θ i 2 ℓ θ max ℓ p θ i c 1 α where ℓ θ is the corresponding log likelihood values of θ and c 1 α is 1 α quantile of the chi square distribution with one degree of freedom by introducing the design quantile q p into the likelihood function the location parameter can be obtained from eq 9 as follows 16 r q p g a m i n v p α 1 β after reparameterization q p α β it can obtain the log likelihood estimators based on eq 7 according to eqs 7 and 15 the corresponding confidence intervals for the design quantile can be efficiently calculated by substituting different q p values into the reparameterized distribution f x q p α β the preceding steps can be easily implemented under the stationary condition while q p has the same record length with the sample under the nonstationary case assuming that the shape parameter α is a constant value we maximize eq 7 with respect to the remaining parameters and repeat this step in a certain range of α then we can have a set of the maximum likelihood estimates α β r different q p values are computed based on α β r and the corresponding confidence intervals for a design quantile can be computed by substituting different q p values into equations 3 selection of time varying parameters the changing parameters influence the nonstationary p3 distribution model the effects of shape scale and location parameters are investigated before the analysis which can provide a reference for identifying the suitable parameter that shows nonstationarity in the nonstationary model for example the location parameter and scale parameter in gev distribution are approximate to the mean value and variance respectively both parameters are likely to consider as the time varying parameters while the shape parameter indicates the distribution families and is commonly supposed to be stationary in previous studies adlouni et al 2007 panagoulia et al 2014 to our knowledge the selection of time varying parameters in a nonstationary p3 model was never discussed before and we hope the following discussion may be helpful to choose the proper model structure we collected discharge records for a 52 year period from the miyun reservoir and the annual runoff time series is used as the sample series to study the effects of different parameters on the p3 model by using the stationary p3 model the shape scale and location parameters are 1 672 0 223 and 1 566 respectively we change the value of a single parameter while holding others constant to analyze the effect of each parameter buckett and oliver 1977 indicated that the shape parameter α affected the form of probability density function fig 2 it can improve the model performance by considering trends in the shape parameter the aic and bic values of the model m 100 are 287 45 and 295 25 respectively which are comparatively small to that of the stationary p3 model 312 24 and 318 09 respectively the location parameter r is mainly influencing the upper bounds of the probability density function fig 2 it is related to the mean value of the sample and is most likely to be dependent on covariates the scale parameter β is expected to affect tail behaviors fig 3 a large value of β generally indicates a heavy tailed case while the small β means a light tailed or short tailed distribution in all the cases the nonstationary p3 model can better explain the variation in data for the sample series with a significant trend further analysis is conducted in the simulation study and all of the three parameters are time dependent for the nonstationary p3 model in this study 4 simulation study to compare the performance of the two nonstationary models the monte carlo simulation was adopted to generate samples following gev01 μ 0 1 t 20 σ 5 ξ 0 1 gev10 μ 20 σ 0 025 t 5 ξ 0 1 and gev11 μ 0 1 t 20 σ 0 025 t 5 ξ 0 1 models the influences of sample sizes were considered by using five scenarios record length n 20 40 60 80 100 we generated 10 000 samples for each of the five scenarios in the simulation study the gmle method and mle method were used to estimate the parameters of the nonstationary gev models the model with the lower bias was compared to the nonstationary p3 model and the gmle method outperformed the mle method in most cases for samples obtained from gev01 and gev10 models we considered linear m 001 m 010 m 100 variations in a single parameter of the p3 model to fit the simulated samples for samples obtained from the gev11 model there were 4 alternative p3 models including m 011 m 101 m 110 and m 111 the best of these models was compared to the corresponding gev model table 2 presents the rmse of different quantiles obtained with the nonstationary gev models and the best of p3 models for small samples n 20 and n 40 the nonstationary p3 model performs much better than the nonstationary gev model the difference reduces significantly with the increase in sample sizes because more information is available for quantiles with low probabilities of non exceedance the result of the gev model is similar to that of the p3 model whereas the gev model leads to high biases for quantiles with high non exceedance probability exceptions can be detected from samples obtained from the gev10 model in which the gev model has outperformed the best of p3 model when there is a large sample size n 80 these exceptions may be caused by the difference between both models the gev10 model only considers temporal evolutions in scale parameter and the samples generated by it may hardly be described by the p3 model by using samples generated by the gev11 model fig 4 shows a boxplot of rmse for each quantile obtained with gev and p3 models similar to the results displayed in table 2 significant differences are noted with changes in sample sizes the nonstationary p3 model dramatically reduces the model uncertainties for small samples and quantiles with high non exceedance probability based on the samples obtained from gev models we can further analyze the model structures under nonstationary condition table 3 presents the results that which p3 model is suitable for samples generated by different gev models for high non exceedance probability we can infer that the model structure is highly related to the gev model which has been used to generate samples especially for a large sample besides the location parameter is most likely to be time dependent in a nonstationary p3 model however this conclusion is only valid in estimating design value with high quantiles for quantile 0 5 the performances of m 001 m 010 and m 100 are slightly different from each other considering that the main objective is to estimate the frequency of extreme events these results are not presented in this paper 5 applications 5 1 case of nonstationary time series the rapid urbanization increases demand for water resulting in a decreasing trend in groundwater as well as surface runoff on the other hand urban flood hazard which is mainly caused by the extreme precipitation is even more severe in recent years the linear regression and mann kendall methods are used to analyze the trend the discharge records were collected for a 52 year period in the miyun reservoir which is one of the most critical water supply sources in beijing fig 5 flood records of the wangkuai reservoir were provided by the haihe river water conservancy commission fig 5 the annual maximum daily precipitation time series were collected from 8 meteorological stations in which some places have suffered severe urban flood inundation in recent years fig 5 the results of trend analysis show that the trends of those sample series are statistically significant p 0 05 figs 6 and 7 the nonstationarity in hydrological events may be caused by climate change or human activities however the traditional statistical methods assume that the hydrological events are stationary to have a precise quantile estimation under nonstationary conditions we consider a nonstationary p3 model in which the parameters are time dependent the parameter can also be dependent on other covariates i e climate indicators if the physical mechanism for hydro meteorological patterns has been thoroughly investigated human activities can also be considered as covariates as previous studies also reported that the reservoir operation had great potential to control flood and cause intra annual runoff alteration seibert et al 2014 lin et al 2017 5 2 case studies 5 2 1 decreasing discharges in this section all the parameters are assumed to be time dependent in the nonstationary p3 model while the nonstationary gev model considers changes in scale and location parameters table 4 shows the performance of different models in which we only present the results of nonstationary models that are less biased the annual runoff time series and flood records have significant trends so the results of stationary models are highly biased in comparison the nonstationary model can generate comparatively precise results results also show that the p3 model is superior to the gev model in both stationary and nonstationary cases for the annual runoff time series the m 001 model has the minimum values of aic and bic 284 62 and 292 43 respectively indicating a linear dependence of the location parameter on time in general the bic penalizes complex models more strongly than the aic panagoulia et al 2014 this explains that the m 201 and m 102 models have small aic values and relatively large bic values table 4 based on the fitted p3 model fig 8 shows the variations of probability density function as the data series has a decreasing trend during the past decades the small value is going to have a large probability density with the changing parameter the applied functions are highly depending on the statistical characteristics of the sample because time t is selected as the covariate in the nonstationary model which means a lack of understanding the physical mechanisms of the relationship between runoff and covariate in this study the annual runoff time series have a monotonic trend unlike the samples that fluctuate frequently therefore it can be described by a simple function for example the m 002 model aic 286 78 bic 296 54 is not able to perform better than the m 001 model the results of gev models can also approve this point on the contrary the temporal evolution of annual maximum daily discharges is more drastic in consequence the complex model can generate more accurate results the m 020 model bic 362 13 performs much better than the m 010 model bic 369 51 besides it should be noticed that polynomial functions may not well describe variations in samples in general a suitable and complex function can lead to less biased results i e cubic spline can highlight non linear dependencies in flood properties over time villarini et al 2009 5 2 2 increasing extreme rainfall with the rapid urbanization many studies indicated that the extreme rainfall exhibited an increasing trend in the urban region which could be necessary for the urban drainage network design de et al 2009 there is a need to consider nonstationarity in the probability distribution of extreme rainfall we applied nonstationary p3 and gev models to annual maximum daily precipitation series in which significant increasing trends can be detected previous studies indicated that the record lengths could affect the performance of estimation methods as a result the data series were collected from 8 meteorological stations and with different record lengths from 25 years to 61 years fig 5 the parameters and model diagnostics of gev and p3 models were calculated by using the methods presented in section 2 as there are eight stations this section only shows the best p3 and gev models for each station table 5 except for the shanghai station the results apparently indicate that the nonstationary p3 model can explain a substantial amount of the variation in the data the nonstationary gev model is equally efficient to the nonstationary p3 model in the yicheng station which has short sample series indicating the superiority of gmle method in small samples the above discussions are also proved by table 5 the nonstationary gev model can better explain the variation in data by considering the trends in location and scale parameters the p3 models with a time varying location parameter are recommended for the xiamen and banga stations while for the shanghai qiongshan and wenchang stations the shape parameter of the best models are dependent on time 5 2 3 uncertainty analysis we use the annual runoff series in the miyun reservoir to illustrate the application of the profile likelihood method based upon the above analysis the m 001 model is more suitable to represent data than others according to the model diagnostic to observe the difference between those models we compute the return levels estimated by the m 000 and m 001 models the corresponding confidence intervals are computed by the profile likelihood method and the results are presented in fig 9 the estimates of quantiles given by the m 001 model show steadily decreasing trends which is similar to that of the annual runoff series as a large design value is generally corresponding to high uncertainty the confidence intervals are clearly asymmetric under stationary and nonstationary conditions although the profile likelihood method can be used in this case there is a problem that should be noticed before using this method as we mentioned before the parameters are redefined as q p α β and we can have the location parameter according to the eq 16 in general we should substitute large q p values into equations to estimate the upper limit of the confidence interval but this process can also lead to large values of location parameter r which inevitably results in negative values of x r as a result the numerical technique may fail to generate optimal results because the initial value of r is too absurd as the gaminv function is monotonically increased with the decrease of scale parameter β β 0 this problem can be avoided by changing the initial value of β for the nonstationary p3 distribution the profile likelihood method should be further studied in the future besides bootstrap methods can also give a realistic estimation for uncertainties at least for the gev distribution serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and it can be considered in future studies table 6 presents more details of return levels for the following periods 1960 1970 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2011 the results show that the return levels given by the m 001 model have a significant inter annual difference indeed the estimated values in the 1960 1970 period can be 6 108 m3 higher than that in the 2001 2011 period therefore the use of an improper model i e stationary model or nonstationary models without proper consideration for the parameters can result in a significant overestimation or underestimation of the return levels 6 summary and conclusion this study presented a nonstationary p3 model which can be used efficiently to describe the variance in data the nonstationarity in data was analyzed using time varying parameters in the p3 model to verify the performance of the p3 model in modeling hydrological events the results of the p3 model were compared to that obtained from the gev model which was widely accepted to describe the nonstationarity the nonstationary gev model only considers the trends in location and scale parameters the mle method is used in parameter estimation for those models however the maximum likelihood estimators of the gev model may generate a significant variance for small samples and the mle method may result in unreasonable results when used to estimate the parameters of a nonstationary p3 model for the nonstationary p3 model we added a penalized term to the likelihood function in which the location parameter is restricted according to the sample variables the p3 model is rarely used in the nonstationary condition so its estimation methods can be further developed in the future studies the penalized term provided in this paper has a major drawback that it arbitrarily overlooks some model outputs if the location parameter cannot meet the requirements x r 0 05 thus there are significant rooms for improving the performance of the nonstationary p3 model by using modified mle method a special case which is rarely occurred in natural conditions can significantly affect the performance of p3 distribution this is necessary to be mentioned when estimating the parameters of the nonstationary p3 distribution based on the pmle method for example the annual maximum minimum series x 1 2 n has a very large maximum value i e x t 1 1000 when compared to its minimum value i e x t 2 10 to have a precise estimation in this case we should assure that the x r values are reasonable at t 1 and t 2 therefore the parameters should be expressed as a very complex function of time but we can also use other covariates by carefully investigating the driving forces of such a significant variation the proposed method was verified according to the monte carlo simulations in which the rmse value was computed for different quantiles of non exceedance probabilities to compare the performance of both models also these models were applied in annual runoff series and annual maximum daily precipitation series in which significant increasing and decreasing trends could be detected the aic and bic criterions were selected to compare the performance of those models both the simulation and case studies indicated that the nonstationary p3 model could better explain the variation in data series rather than the nonstationary gev model the monte carlo simulations illustrated that the location parameter is most likely to be time dependent in a nonstationary p3 model for the annual runoff the parameter estimators obtained from the m 001 model were less biased but there is by no means to only consider the trends in the location parameter for the nonstationary p3 model in other regions although the nonstationary p3 model with a time varying location parameter could provide the best results in most simulation cases our analyses show that the most interesting parameter can also be the scale parameter in this paper we only considered the case that the parameters of both models were dependent on time previous studies already indicated the climate change and human activity could significantly affect the hydrological process further studies can extend the use of the nonstationary p3 model in two aspects 1 the parameters are considered to be dependent with other covariates 2 to improve the parameter estimation methods for the

6906,the climate change and human activities can principally doubt the frequency analysis methods which assume that the hydrological events are stationary the pearson type 3 p3 distribution which has been widely applied in frequency analysis under the stationary condition was developed for the nonstationary cases the distribution parameters can be expressed as exponential or polynomial functions with time or other covariates parameter estimation for the nonstationary p3 model was done with the penalized maximum likelihood estimation pmle method in which we applied a restrictive penalty on the location parameter to avoid unreasonable results the results of the nonstationary p3 model were compared to that of the generalized extreme value gev distribution in which the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle method was applied to estimate the parameters the monte carlo simulations indicated that the nonstationary p3 model provided better results than the nonstationary gev model for different sample sizes both models were also applied in hydrological series with various trends and record lengths to prove the feasibility of the nonstationary p3 model in practical applications the applications showed that the nonstationary p3 model performed better than the nonstationary gev model in most of the studied cases keywords pearson type 3 distribution nonstationary condition parameter estimation penalized maximum likelihood estimation 1 introduction to meet the demand of project design the extreme value theory provides a method to explain historical records and to make inference for future probabilities of extreme events i e floods wind speeds extreme waves and rainfall the log pearson type 3 lp3 distribution was commonly recommended to fit sequences of annual peak flood flows in the united states benson 1968 moreover the pearson type 3 p3 distribution was recommended for frequency analysis by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china zhan and ye 1987 since then the p3 lp3 and gamma family of distributions were considered in a large number of related studies such as precipitation annual runoff and flood series durrans 1992 to analyze the eco hydrological conditions in the yellow river zhang et al 2013 used the stationary p3 distribution to conduct the frequency analysis for stream flow for the low flow frequency analysis yu et al 2014 found that the stationary p3 distribution is usually able to give the most satisfactory results when compared to that of weibull and copula based distributions except for frequency analysis zucco et al 2015 used the p3 distribution to fit runoff series wherein the parameters in the distribution were peak discharge time to peak and shape parameter respectively however there is by no means universal acceptance of the p3 distribution for modeling hydrological events the advances in both at site and regional frequency analyses caused debates which were related to the utilization of p3 distribution among statistical hydrologists vogel and mcmartin 1991 for example ribeiro correa and rousselle 1993 developed an estimation methodology for a regional p3 flood flow model however hosking and wallis 1993 suggested to use the generalized extreme value gev distribution because the sample l skewness and l kurtosis were unbiased and the generalized logistic distribution was recommended as the standard for regional flood frequency analysis in the uk kjeldsen and jones 2006 during the past decades numerous methods have been developed to estimate the p3 distribution parameters and to conduct frequency analysis bobée 1973 singh and singh 1985 song and ding 1988 durrans 1992 cohen 1950 introduced the method of moments which was later recommended by the us water resources council durrans 1992 harter 1969 provided a detailed table of percentage points for the p3 distribution matalas and wallis 1973 found that the maximum likelihood estimation mle method yielded solutions that were less biased and less variable when compared to the moment estimates similar conclusions were confirmed by other researchers buckett and oliver 1977 song and ding 1988 ding et al 1989 on the contrary nozdryn plotnicki and watt 1979 used mle the method of moments and a method which preserved the moments of untransformed flows to estimate the parameters and they argued that no one method be superior for the whole of the parameter space singh and singh 1985 also pointed that the method of moments with a corrected coefficient of skewness c s provided better results than the mle method however the traditional frequency analysis was based on two fundamental assumptions the data series should be independent and identically distributed previous studies indicated that extreme events were hardly stationary due to the influence of climate change and human activity and significant trends can be detected in extreme values from different hydro climatological series milly et al 2008 ipcc 2014 lin et al 2014 pointed out that the land use change was more likely to affect runoff during the flood season in further the social economy was significantly affected by the extreme climatic factors he et al 2017 as a result the nonstationary model with time varying parameters was progressively popular in recent two decades which challenged the uses of the method of moments that may only be valid for the stationary conditions although the p3 distribution is still considered as an alternative in regional frequency analysis yang et al 2010 san et al 2011 it has no longer be applied in the hydrology to the same extent as others under the nonstationary condition for example the nonstationary gev model is prevalent in recent hydrologic literature and has been extensively used for flood frequency analysis coles 2001 adlouni et al 2007 cannon 2010 lima et al 2015 the gamlss package also has widely been used in hydrological frequency analysis in recent years lópez and francés 2013 li and tan 2015 the gamlss package in r project provides a number of continuous discrete and mixed distributions for modelling the data series but it only includes a two parameter gamma distribution stasinopoulos et al 2008 therefore this paper aimed to develop a method for the nonstationary p3 distribution besides we can conduct further works based on the fitted p3 distribution for example it is able to compare the performance of different parameter estimation methods and analyze the reliability of results based on uncertainty estimation in recent years some studies also reported that the p3 distribution could generate the most satisfactory results in at site and regional analysis saf 2009 dodangeh et al 2014 yu et al 2014 to our knowledge the p3 distribution was hardly used to fit the nonstationary time series liu et al 2014 studied the performance of different distributions under the nonstationary conditions and pointed that the gev and p3 models can better fit sample than other models however unlike the usual method which adopted the time varying parameters in a nonstationary model liu et al 2014 used the nonstationary modeling by modifying the nonstationary series to stationary series the objective of this study is to use the p3 distribution for estimating design values under the nonstationary conditions a penalized maximum likelihood estimation pmle method is used for parameter estimation in the case of a nonstationary p3 model this method avoids unreasonable results in the nonstationary condition by setting a penalized term to restrict the value of the location parameter the parameters are expressed as a polynomial function of time t to show the feasibility of pmle if the nonstationary p3 distribution performs well in this case we believed that it can generate satisfied results when using other covariates the parameters can also be dependent on other covariates i e climate indices before selecting other covariates it is better to quantitatively understand the effects of climate and human factors on the hydrological process thus we do not consider other covariates in this paper the results of nonstationary p3 models are compared to that of nonstationary gev models which is the most popular model for annual maximum minimum series the nonstationary gev parameters are estimated by the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle method which can avoid the problem in numerical technique when employing the mle method in small samples martins and stedinger 2000 adlouni et al 2007 moreover we use the extremes package in r project to build the nonstationary gev model the performance of both models is verified by monte carlo simulation and case studies 2 methods 2 1 nonstationary pearson type 3 model 2 1 1 model structure the pearson type 3 distribution is bounded in one direction according to the shape parameter and its probability density function is as follows 1 f x β α γ α x r α 1 exp β x r where α β r are the shape scale and location parameters respectively in general the p3 distribution has five forms according to the shape parameter α and previous research indicated that it would be more suitable when α 2 buckett and oliver 1977 if the scale parameter β 0 the p3 distribution has a positive skewness and x r 0 while the distribution has a negative skewness and x r 0 when β 0 koutrouvelis and canavos 1999 as we are interested in the frequency of extreme value with a high quantile the shape and scale parameters are supposed to be positive values in this paper in the stationary case the traditional parameter estimation method is used the first four moments of the population to obtain the three parameters of the p3 distribution according to the sample series these parameters can be expressed as the equations from the mean value x coefficient of variation c v and coefficient of skewness c s zhang et al 2013 2 α 4 c s 2 β 2 x c v c s r x 1 2 c v c s however the method is no longer be valid under the nonstationary assumption therefore the maximum likelihood estimation mle method is used in this paper to obtain the time varying parameters of the nonstationary p3 distribution the parameters in a nonstationary p3 distribution model will be expressed as a function of time t or other covariates 3 f x β t α t γ α t x t r t α t 1 e β t x t r t in this study the shape parameter α t exp k 0 k 1 t k 2 t 2 scale parameter β t exp k 3 k 4 t k 5 t 2 and location parameter r t exp k 6 k 7 t k 8 t 2 are exponential functions related to time t the using of the exponential function is to ensure that the positivity of α and β are respected for all values of t by changing the value of k i i 0 1 8 there are 27 models in which the exponential functions are constant linear or quadratic the models with time dependence of order i in the shape parameter order j in the scale parameter and order k in the location parameter are denoted by m ijk i 0 1 2 j 0 1 2 k 0 1 2 some examples are presented in table 1 for example m 012 indicates a model that the shape parameter is independent of time while the scale parameter and location parameter has a linear and quadratic trend respectively besides k i i 0 1 8 is the parameter of trend functions i e the parameters to be estimated are k 0 k 3 k 4 k 6 k 7 k 8 for the m 012 model k 0 k 1 k 3 k 4 k 6 k 7 for the m 111 model 2 1 2 parameter estimation assuming x 1 x 2 x n is a sequence of hydrological variables that are distributed within the nonstationary p3 distribution under the nonstationary condition we can have the likelihood estimators of x 1 x 2 x n 4 l α t β t r t t 1 n β t α t γ α t x t r t α t 1 e β t x t r t it is more convenient to take logarithms of eq 4 and have the log likelihood estimators 5 d ln l α t β t r t t 1 n ln β t α t γ α t x t r t α t 1 e β t x t r t by using a nelder mead or newton raphson algorithm it can obtain the maximum likelihood estimators α t β t r t of parameters as the p3 distribution has a lower bound at the location parameter the likelihood is not derivable for the location parameter and the maximum likelihood estimator of the location parameter is actually the first order statistic of the sample this can also provide a reference when using numerical techniques to obtain the maximum likelihood estimators unlike the stationary p3 distribution there are some drawbacks when using mle method to estimate the nonstationary p3 distribution parameters for instance the changes of location parameters r t in a nonstationary model may lead to a result of x t r t 0 which can generate unreasonable likelihood value exerting a significant impact on the optimization progress no matter what kind of algorithms are used in the mle method for example the probability density obtained from eq 3 should lie between 0 and 1 and eq 5 will generate a negative log likelihood value in the case of x t r t 0 and shape parameter α 1 eq 3 will frequently generate comparatively large values i e 106 resulting in a positive value from the log likelihood function moreover eq 3 may also return a complex number when x t r t 0 the optimization process is disturbed by these problems which will doubt the precision of parameter estimation a penalized term π x t r t is introduced in the optimization process to avoid such problems it is defined as 6 π x t r t 1 x t r t b exp a x t r t b c x t r t b t 1 2 n where the coefficients are set as a 100 c 3 and b 0 05 in this study a small value of b means a more restrictive penalty on location parameter r the a and c values indicate the convergence rate and the large values of them are corresponding to a small interval from π x r 1 to π x r 0 fig 1 shows the penalty function π x r with coefficients a 100 c 3 and b 0 05 each of the observations x t has a corresponding probability density f x t α t β t r t which is penalized by the corresponding π x t r t if the location parameter is a constant value the penalty function is actually based on the difference between x 1 and r in which x 1 is the minimum value of data series the likelihood function l α t β t r t is transformed into a penalized likelihood function t 1 n f x t π x t r t the penalized log likelihood function equals the expression in 5 plus ln π x t r t which is 7 d ln l α t β t r t ln π x t r t the parameters of the nonstationary p3 model can be obtained by maximizing the log likelihood function in eq 7 2 2 nonstationary gev model the gev distribution is the combination of continuous probability distributions including the gumbel fréchet and weibull families jenkinson 1956 under the nonstationary condition the gev distribution has a cumulative distribution function 8 f x exp 1 ξ t x μ t σ t 1 ξ t ξ t 0 exp exp x μ t σ t ξ t 0 where 1 ξ t x μ t σ t 0 μ t r σ t 0 and ξ t r are the location scale and shape parameters respectively the gev distribution has been widely used in the hydrological frequency analysis by considering a linear or quadratic dependence on covariates the gev models with time dependence of order i in the scale parameter and order j in the location parameter are denoted by ge v ij i 0 1 2 3 j 0 1 2 3 the maximum likelihood estimation mle method is the most popular method for the development of computer sciences however hosking et al 1985 pointed that the l moments estimation was superior to the mle method for sample sizes varying from 15 to 100 moreover previous studies found that the mle may generate absurd values of the shape parameter especially for the small samples record length 50 however the l moments can only be used under the stationary assumption which largely restricted its application then several methods were proposed to improve the performance of mle method coles and dixon 1999 proposed a penalized mle method to restrict the value of shape parameter martins and stedinger 2000 proposed a generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle which could provide a more restrictive penalty on the shape parameter morrison and smith 2002 developed a mixed method which combined the mle and l moments method to avoid the problems mentioned above the gmle method was widely used and further developed in a nonstationary condition adlouni et al 2007 cannon 2010 the generalized likelihood function is defined as 9 ℓ gl π ξ l n 10 l n t 1 n f x t u t σ t ξ t where l n is the likelihood function of sample series details can be seen in martins and stedinger 2000 the penalized function π ξ is the beta distribution given by π ξ 0 5 θ 3 p 1 0 5 θ 3 q 1 b p q with p 6 and q 9 wherein b p q γ p γ q γ p q 2 3 model checking the commonly used methods akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are introduced in this paper to compare the performance of different models these statistics are given by 11 aic 2 l l f 2 n u m p a r 12 bic 2 l l f n u m p a r log n where llf is the maximized log likelihood numpar is the number of parameters and n is the record length a lower value of aic or bic indicates a better model in the simulation study the best model is determined by the aic and bic values and the root mean square error rmse is computed for different quantiles non exceedance probabilities p 0 5 0 8 0 9 0 95 0 99 with sample sizes n 20 n 40 n 60 n 80 n 100 2 4 methods of uncertainty analysis the profile likelihood method is assumed to be a robust and accurate method in uncertainty analysis for extreme events coles 2001 obeysekera and salas 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 based on the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators the profile method can be used to estimate the confidence intervals with the following steps the fitted p3 distribution has a parameter vector θ α β r and the quantile q p with nonexceedance probability p 0 p 1 is obtained as 13 q p g a m i n v p α 1 β r where gaminv is the gamma inverse cumulative distribution function let θ i denotes a particular parameter which is desired to estimate its confidence interval and θ i is the remaining parameters in θ the shape parameter of p3 distribution is set to be the particular parameter because it can affect the type of distribution buckett and oliver 1977 the profile log likelihood for θ i is defined as coles 2001 14 ℓ p θ i max θ i ℓ θ i θ i eq 14 is used to obtain the maximum value concerning all parameters expect θ i the approximation of a 1 α confidence interval of θ i is computed as 15 θ i 2 ℓ θ max ℓ p θ i c 1 α where ℓ θ is the corresponding log likelihood values of θ and c 1 α is 1 α quantile of the chi square distribution with one degree of freedom by introducing the design quantile q p into the likelihood function the location parameter can be obtained from eq 9 as follows 16 r q p g a m i n v p α 1 β after reparameterization q p α β it can obtain the log likelihood estimators based on eq 7 according to eqs 7 and 15 the corresponding confidence intervals for the design quantile can be efficiently calculated by substituting different q p values into the reparameterized distribution f x q p α β the preceding steps can be easily implemented under the stationary condition while q p has the same record length with the sample under the nonstationary case assuming that the shape parameter α is a constant value we maximize eq 7 with respect to the remaining parameters and repeat this step in a certain range of α then we can have a set of the maximum likelihood estimates α β r different q p values are computed based on α β r and the corresponding confidence intervals for a design quantile can be computed by substituting different q p values into equations 3 selection of time varying parameters the changing parameters influence the nonstationary p3 distribution model the effects of shape scale and location parameters are investigated before the analysis which can provide a reference for identifying the suitable parameter that shows nonstationarity in the nonstationary model for example the location parameter and scale parameter in gev distribution are approximate to the mean value and variance respectively both parameters are likely to consider as the time varying parameters while the shape parameter indicates the distribution families and is commonly supposed to be stationary in previous studies adlouni et al 2007 panagoulia et al 2014 to our knowledge the selection of time varying parameters in a nonstationary p3 model was never discussed before and we hope the following discussion may be helpful to choose the proper model structure we collected discharge records for a 52 year period from the miyun reservoir and the annual runoff time series is used as the sample series to study the effects of different parameters on the p3 model by using the stationary p3 model the shape scale and location parameters are 1 672 0 223 and 1 566 respectively we change the value of a single parameter while holding others constant to analyze the effect of each parameter buckett and oliver 1977 indicated that the shape parameter α affected the form of probability density function fig 2 it can improve the model performance by considering trends in the shape parameter the aic and bic values of the model m 100 are 287 45 and 295 25 respectively which are comparatively small to that of the stationary p3 model 312 24 and 318 09 respectively the location parameter r is mainly influencing the upper bounds of the probability density function fig 2 it is related to the mean value of the sample and is most likely to be dependent on covariates the scale parameter β is expected to affect tail behaviors fig 3 a large value of β generally indicates a heavy tailed case while the small β means a light tailed or short tailed distribution in all the cases the nonstationary p3 model can better explain the variation in data for the sample series with a significant trend further analysis is conducted in the simulation study and all of the three parameters are time dependent for the nonstationary p3 model in this study 4 simulation study to compare the performance of the two nonstationary models the monte carlo simulation was adopted to generate samples following gev01 μ 0 1 t 20 σ 5 ξ 0 1 gev10 μ 20 σ 0 025 t 5 ξ 0 1 and gev11 μ 0 1 t 20 σ 0 025 t 5 ξ 0 1 models the influences of sample sizes were considered by using five scenarios record length n 20 40 60 80 100 we generated 10 000 samples for each of the five scenarios in the simulation study the gmle method and mle method were used to estimate the parameters of the nonstationary gev models the model with the lower bias was compared to the nonstationary p3 model and the gmle method outperformed the mle method in most cases for samples obtained from gev01 and gev10 models we considered linear m 001 m 010 m 100 variations in a single parameter of the p3 model to fit the simulated samples for samples obtained from the gev11 model there were 4 alternative p3 models including m 011 m 101 m 110 and m 111 the best of these models was compared to the corresponding gev model table 2 presents the rmse of different quantiles obtained with the nonstationary gev models and the best of p3 models for small samples n 20 and n 40 the nonstationary p3 model performs much better than the nonstationary gev model the difference reduces significantly with the increase in sample sizes because more information is available for quantiles with low probabilities of non exceedance the result of the gev model is similar to that of the p3 model whereas the gev model leads to high biases for quantiles with high non exceedance probability exceptions can be detected from samples obtained from the gev10 model in which the gev model has outperformed the best of p3 model when there is a large sample size n 80 these exceptions may be caused by the difference between both models the gev10 model only considers temporal evolutions in scale parameter and the samples generated by it may hardly be described by the p3 model by using samples generated by the gev11 model fig 4 shows a boxplot of rmse for each quantile obtained with gev and p3 models similar to the results displayed in table 2 significant differences are noted with changes in sample sizes the nonstationary p3 model dramatically reduces the model uncertainties for small samples and quantiles with high non exceedance probability based on the samples obtained from gev models we can further analyze the model structures under nonstationary condition table 3 presents the results that which p3 model is suitable for samples generated by different gev models for high non exceedance probability we can infer that the model structure is highly related to the gev model which has been used to generate samples especially for a large sample besides the location parameter is most likely to be time dependent in a nonstationary p3 model however this conclusion is only valid in estimating design value with high quantiles for quantile 0 5 the performances of m 001 m 010 and m 100 are slightly different from each other considering that the main objective is to estimate the frequency of extreme events these results are not presented in this paper 5 applications 5 1 case of nonstationary time series the rapid urbanization increases demand for water resulting in a decreasing trend in groundwater as well as surface runoff on the other hand urban flood hazard which is mainly caused by the extreme precipitation is even more severe in recent years the linear regression and mann kendall methods are used to analyze the trend the discharge records were collected for a 52 year period in the miyun reservoir which is one of the most critical water supply sources in beijing fig 5 flood records of the wangkuai reservoir were provided by the haihe river water conservancy commission fig 5 the annual maximum daily precipitation time series were collected from 8 meteorological stations in which some places have suffered severe urban flood inundation in recent years fig 5 the results of trend analysis show that the trends of those sample series are statistically significant p 0 05 figs 6 and 7 the nonstationarity in hydrological events may be caused by climate change or human activities however the traditional statistical methods assume that the hydrological events are stationary to have a precise quantile estimation under nonstationary conditions we consider a nonstationary p3 model in which the parameters are time dependent the parameter can also be dependent on other covariates i e climate indicators if the physical mechanism for hydro meteorological patterns has been thoroughly investigated human activities can also be considered as covariates as previous studies also reported that the reservoir operation had great potential to control flood and cause intra annual runoff alteration seibert et al 2014 lin et al 2017 5 2 case studies 5 2 1 decreasing discharges in this section all the parameters are assumed to be time dependent in the nonstationary p3 model while the nonstationary gev model considers changes in scale and location parameters table 4 shows the performance of different models in which we only present the results of nonstationary models that are less biased the annual runoff time series and flood records have significant trends so the results of stationary models are highly biased in comparison the nonstationary model can generate comparatively precise results results also show that the p3 model is superior to the gev model in both stationary and nonstationary cases for the annual runoff time series the m 001 model has the minimum values of aic and bic 284 62 and 292 43 respectively indicating a linear dependence of the location parameter on time in general the bic penalizes complex models more strongly than the aic panagoulia et al 2014 this explains that the m 201 and m 102 models have small aic values and relatively large bic values table 4 based on the fitted p3 model fig 8 shows the variations of probability density function as the data series has a decreasing trend during the past decades the small value is going to have a large probability density with the changing parameter the applied functions are highly depending on the statistical characteristics of the sample because time t is selected as the covariate in the nonstationary model which means a lack of understanding the physical mechanisms of the relationship between runoff and covariate in this study the annual runoff time series have a monotonic trend unlike the samples that fluctuate frequently therefore it can be described by a simple function for example the m 002 model aic 286 78 bic 296 54 is not able to perform better than the m 001 model the results of gev models can also approve this point on the contrary the temporal evolution of annual maximum daily discharges is more drastic in consequence the complex model can generate more accurate results the m 020 model bic 362 13 performs much better than the m 010 model bic 369 51 besides it should be noticed that polynomial functions may not well describe variations in samples in general a suitable and complex function can lead to less biased results i e cubic spline can highlight non linear dependencies in flood properties over time villarini et al 2009 5 2 2 increasing extreme rainfall with the rapid urbanization many studies indicated that the extreme rainfall exhibited an increasing trend in the urban region which could be necessary for the urban drainage network design de et al 2009 there is a need to consider nonstationarity in the probability distribution of extreme rainfall we applied nonstationary p3 and gev models to annual maximum daily precipitation series in which significant increasing trends can be detected previous studies indicated that the record lengths could affect the performance of estimation methods as a result the data series were collected from 8 meteorological stations and with different record lengths from 25 years to 61 years fig 5 the parameters and model diagnostics of gev and p3 models were calculated by using the methods presented in section 2 as there are eight stations this section only shows the best p3 and gev models for each station table 5 except for the shanghai station the results apparently indicate that the nonstationary p3 model can explain a substantial amount of the variation in the data the nonstationary gev model is equally efficient to the nonstationary p3 model in the yicheng station which has short sample series indicating the superiority of gmle method in small samples the above discussions are also proved by table 5 the nonstationary gev model can better explain the variation in data by considering the trends in location and scale parameters the p3 models with a time varying location parameter are recommended for the xiamen and banga stations while for the shanghai qiongshan and wenchang stations the shape parameter of the best models are dependent on time 5 2 3 uncertainty analysis we use the annual runoff series in the miyun reservoir to illustrate the application of the profile likelihood method based upon the above analysis the m 001 model is more suitable to represent data than others according to the model diagnostic to observe the difference between those models we compute the return levels estimated by the m 000 and m 001 models the corresponding confidence intervals are computed by the profile likelihood method and the results are presented in fig 9 the estimates of quantiles given by the m 001 model show steadily decreasing trends which is similar to that of the annual runoff series as a large design value is generally corresponding to high uncertainty the confidence intervals are clearly asymmetric under stationary and nonstationary conditions although the profile likelihood method can be used in this case there is a problem that should be noticed before using this method as we mentioned before the parameters are redefined as q p α β and we can have the location parameter according to the eq 16 in general we should substitute large q p values into equations to estimate the upper limit of the confidence interval but this process can also lead to large values of location parameter r which inevitably results in negative values of x r as a result the numerical technique may fail to generate optimal results because the initial value of r is too absurd as the gaminv function is monotonically increased with the decrease of scale parameter β β 0 this problem can be avoided by changing the initial value of β for the nonstationary p3 distribution the profile likelihood method should be further studied in the future besides bootstrap methods can also give a realistic estimation for uncertainties at least for the gev distribution serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and it can be considered in future studies table 6 presents more details of return levels for the following periods 1960 1970 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2011 the results show that the return levels given by the m 001 model have a significant inter annual difference indeed the estimated values in the 1960 1970 period can be 6 108 m3 higher than that in the 2001 2011 period therefore the use of an improper model i e stationary model or nonstationary models without proper consideration for the parameters can result in a significant overestimation or underestimation of the return levels 6 summary and conclusion this study presented a nonstationary p3 model which can be used efficiently to describe the variance in data the nonstationarity in data was analyzed using time varying parameters in the p3 model to verify the performance of the p3 model in modeling hydrological events the results of the p3 model were compared to that obtained from the gev model which was widely accepted to describe the nonstationarity the nonstationary gev model only considers the trends in location and scale parameters the mle method is used in parameter estimation for those models however the maximum likelihood estimators of the gev model may generate a significant variance for small samples and the mle method may result in unreasonable results when used to estimate the parameters of a nonstationary p3 model for the nonstationary p3 model we added a penalized term to the likelihood function in which the location parameter is restricted according to the sample variables the p3 model is rarely used in the nonstationary condition so its estimation methods can be further developed in the future studies the penalized term provided in this paper has a major drawback that it arbitrarily overlooks some model outputs if the location parameter cannot meet the requirements x r 0 05 thus there are significant rooms for improving the performance of the nonstationary p3 model by using modified mle method a special case which is rarely occurred in natural conditions can significantly affect the performance of p3 distribution this is necessary to be mentioned when estimating the parameters of the nonstationary p3 distribution based on the pmle method for example the annual maximum minimum series x 1 2 n has a very large maximum value i e x t 1 1000 when compared to its minimum value i e x t 2 10 to have a precise estimation in this case we should assure that the x r values are reasonable at t 1 and t 2 therefore the parameters should be expressed as a very complex function of time but we can also use other covariates by carefully investigating the driving forces of such a significant variation the proposed method was verified according to the monte carlo simulations in which the rmse value was computed for different quantiles of non exceedance probabilities to compare the performance of both models also these models were applied in annual runoff series and annual maximum daily precipitation series in which significant increasing and decreasing trends could be detected the aic and bic criterions were selected to compare the performance of those models both the simulation and case studies indicated that the nonstationary p3 model could better explain the variation in data series rather than the nonstationary gev model the monte carlo simulations illustrated that the location parameter is most likely to be time dependent in a nonstationary p3 model for the annual runoff the parameter estimators obtained from the m 001 model were less biased but there is by no means to only consider the trends in the location parameter for the nonstationary p3 model in other regions although the nonstationary p3 model with a time varying location parameter could provide the best results in most simulation cases our analyses show that the most interesting parameter can also be the scale parameter in this paper we only considered the case that the parameters of both models were dependent on time previous studies already indicated the climate change and human activity could significantly affect the hydrological process further studies can extend the use of the nonstationary p3 model in two aspects 1 the parameters are considered to be dependent with other covariates 2 to improve the parameter estimation methods for the

6907,macropore flow is a ubiquitous hydrologic process that has not been well explained using traditional hydrologic theories in particular macropore flow velocity mfv is poorly understood with respect to its typical ranges and controlling factors here we conducted a meta analysis based on an mfv dataset compiled from 243 measurements documented in 76 journal articles the dataset includes mfv values measured using different approaches across the soil core field profile and trench scales our analyses show that mfv has a geometric mean of 1 08 10 3 m s 1 which is about 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values of saturated hydraulic conductivity in the soil matrix using machine learning methods including classification and regression tree and random forests algorithms we identified observation scale travel distance rainfall intensity and macropore diameter as the most important factors that control mfv mfv is much larger at the trench scale than at the other two scales mainly due to abundant large macropores correlation analysis and multivariate regression revealed that 1 mfv and rainfall intensity have significant positive correlation which indicates that mfv is a dynamic variable and 2 mfv and macropore diameter also have strong positive correlation at the trench scale which indicates macropore size as a key controlling factor using macropore diameter and rainfall intensity as explanatory factors mfv can be well predicted r 2 0 76 by a multivariate regression equation at trench scale implying that rainfall intensity can be considered a proxy for the filling degree of macropores furthermore both the poiseuille and manning equations were found to overestimate the mfv values suggesting a parameter representing the connectivity of the macropore network is needed for providing reasonable estimates of mfv using physically based equations keywords macropore flow velocity meta analysis observation scale macropore diameter rainfall intensity macropore network connectivity 1 introduction macropores are large soil voids with features that are distinct from the soil matrix cey and rudolph 2009 they are ubiquitous in soils and function as fast channels bypassing the soil matrix and expediting the movement of water and solutes below ground both vertically and horizontally macropore flow mf has been identified as a significant contributor to streamflow across diverse climate regions from semi arid to humid and from tropical to cold regions koch et al 2013 dos santos et al 2016 van schaik et al 2008 zhu 1997 negishi et al 2007 uchida et al 2005 jones 2010 mf also has great influences on infiltration soil moisture distribution hardie et al 2011 hardie et al 2013 and groundwater table dynamics mirus and nimmo 2013 hence effectively representing mf in hydrologic models is important for improving soil moisture and streamflow prediction and water management zehe et al 2007 2010 beven and germann 2013 weiler 2017 alaoui et al 2018 the most important variable to represent mf is the average velocity of water traveling through the macropores denoted as macropore flow velocity mfv which is the rate of the macropore flux in macropores mfv determines the strength and significance of mf in simulations of subsurface flow and solute transport jarvis 2007 anderson et al 2009b it is usually much larger than the travel velocity of water through soil matrix which is mostly estimated using saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and hydraulic head gradient mfv is primarily a function of water storage in the macropores and the structure of macropores density of macropores in the soil diameter of macropores macropore networks etc however the structure of macropore co evolves with the soil structure e g cracks and fissures soil fauna and plant roots and other surface and subsurface properties beven and germann 1982 so measuring or precisely describing the structure of macropores has been challenging the mfv values have also been directly set in several studies instead of deriving them with macropore structure or other information the simplest way to estimate mfv is to relate it to ks by a ratio for example yu et al 2014 suggested using mfv that is 100 times the value of ks to represent the mf process since mfv is always much larger than ks dusek et al 2012 assumed mfv at a fixed value of 5000 cm d 1 for measured ks ranging from 1 3 to 567 cm d 1 at different soil horizons the poiseuille equation and manning equation have also been adopted chen and wagenet 1992 köhne et al 2009 to provide a reference value of mfv although the aforementioned approaches have been shown to provide reasonable estimates of mfv there is no general guidance on appropriate values to be used across basins of different characteristics hence estimating mfv through experiments is often preferred artificial tracer is the most popular approach applied to empirically quantify mfv at soil core scale luo et al 2008 measured mfv by applying tracer and computed the velocity as a function of travel time and vertical distance at field profile scale cey and rudolph 2009 used dye tracer to track the occurrence of film and rivulet flow along vertical macropores and obtained flow velocity soil core scale measurements often ignore the effect of large scale heterogeneities because the structure and the connectivity of macropore network cannot be represented at such a scale experiments at the hillslope scale on the other hand can better represent the large scale heterogeneity and produce more reasonable mfv estimates anderson et al 2009a and 2009b quantified hillslope scale mfv by excavating a trench and applying steady artificial rainfall with nacl added at the upper hillslope as a tracer cheng et al 2009 estimated mfv by using hydrographs from individual macropores at an excavated trench profile however such experiments are time consuming and labor intensive a feasible alternative is to establish relationships between mfv and its controlling factors e g soil properties land use water supply conditions to enable estimation of mfv a priori from existing information several studies have been conducted to explore the main controlling factors of mfv anderson et al 2009b found that mfv is most closely related to the 1 h rainfall intensity and slope length mosley 1982 indicated that mfv varies as a function of antecedent moisture conditions and the relative importance of various pathways at a given site which are in turn functions of macropore network and soil properties uchida et al 2001 concluded that mfv depends on macropore diameter and its value is generally larger in peaty soil than in forest soil these studies have been conducted at single or multiple hillslopes there are also studies that considered a wider range of sites and controls for example jarvis et al 2009 suggested that soil susceptibility to mf could be predicted from easily available soil properties and site factors koestel et al 2012 collected 733 breakthrough curves from the literature and found that moderate to strong mf occurs only for undisturbed soils that contain more than 8 clay similarly koestel and jorda 2014 demonstrated that soil susceptibility to mf under steady state conditions is predictable from proxy variables to a large extent such as the clay content ratio between clay content and organic carbon and lateral observation scale jarvis et al 2013 defined the largest macropore hydraulic conductivity ks ma for large soil pores diameter 0 3 mm and found that its value is related to soil texture and soil bulk density although the magnitudes of both mf and ks ma are related to mfv they cannot reflect the true flow velocity along the macropore network despite these studies there is no consensus on the most appropriate physical or empirical equations to be used for the estimate mfv values and comprehensive studies on the identification of the general controls on mfv across diverse hillslopes and scales are still in need weiler 2017 called for community efforts to combine existing datasets to allow inter comparison studies as it has been successfully performed in many other scientific fields a meta analysis approach e g mutema et al 2015 may be an effective way to address this need this study presents a meta analysis conducted to compile a dataset from the published literature that reported measured mfvs from empirical experiments and a series of relevant controlling factors the dataset was then analyzed with multiple methods machine learning algorithms including classification and regression tree and random forests were employed to identify the main controlling factors of mfv correlation analysis and multivariate regression were used to determine empirical relationships between mfv and its main controlling factors our objective is three fold 1 to establish general ranges and typical values of mfv at different scales 2 to identify the dominant factors controlling mfv and 3 to provide guidance for estimating mfv in the field especially at hillslope scale 2 data and methods 2 1 compiling the dataset in this study mfv is defined as the velocity of water traveling through macropores measurements of mfv values were collected from the published literature through google scholar search the criteria for including a publication are 1 the mfv values are obtained from experiments 2 the experiments are conducted in undisturbed soils 3 the occurrence of macropore flow is obvious 4 sufficient information about the experiments and sites is provided 5 the mfv values are either directly presented in the work or can be indirectly estimated by using the provided information and 6 the approaches used to estimate mfv belongs to a screened group in order to ensure a common ground where a comparison among mfv values differently derived can be made on the basis of these criteria a dataset consisting of 243 individual data points compiled from 76 published studies was realized among the various experimental approaches for mf only five explicitly provide the mfv values which are briefly described below 2 1 1 artificial tracer artificial tracer is the most common and effective approach to determine mfv at different scales the velocity of macropore flow v can be obtained by fitting the measured breakthrough curves using the convection dispersion equation or by dividing the travel distance by travel time there are two kinds of travel time t usually used to calculate mfv i e peak travel time and first arrival travel time according to the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation for solute transport jury et al 1991 the peak travel time is more suitable for calculating the mean mfv and is preferred in our analysis if the peak travel time is absent mfv derived from the first arrival travel time is selected most mfv values adopted here are obtained using peak travel time and breakthrough curve fitting 2 1 2 non sequential soil moisture response generally during a rainfall period a wetting front moves gradually from the top to the bottom in a homogeneous soil profile the soil moisture content in the upper part of the soil responds faster than that in the lower part thus the soil moisture content increases sequentially from the upper part to the lower part with macropore flow the sequential response of soil moisture content with depth can be violated lin and zhou 2008 defined preferential flow operationally as an increase in soil water content out of sequence with respect to soil depth with this consideration we collected velocity values calculated under the no sequence soil water moisture response condition in this approach mfv values are also calculated by dividing the travel distance by the response time 2 1 3 hydraulic conductivity and macroporosity macropores are usually identified as pores of equivalent cylindrical diameter larger than 0 3 1 mm luxmoore 1981 jarvis 2007 which is corresponding to capillary potential φ of 3 10 h p a flow velocity in macropores can be estimated by combining the information of macroporosity ε and amount of water flowing through them once the flow flux q s under saturated condition and near saturation hydraulic conductivity k φ with capillary potential φ 3 10 h p a are obtained the contribution of macropore to q s can be calculated as q s k φ considering the portion of water moving through macropores the mean velocity of flow through the macropore can be given as 1 v q s k φ ε ε can be estimated by the difference between water content at φ 0 and φ 3 10 h p a or directly measured by x ray computed tomography 2 1 4 individual macropore discharge macropore flow rate can be directly measured at an excavated trench or road cut cross section the corresponding mfv can be estimated by dividing the macropore discharge q mac by macropore cross sectional area a mac a series of observed q mac can be obtained under different conditions we used the largest value of q mac when calculating mfv 2 1 5 rainfall runoff lag when macropore flow is the dominant component in discharge in a storm event the lag time between hyetograph and hydrograph centroid represents the mean transport time of macropore flow under wet condition mosley 1982 at small scales the mean mfv value during a storm event can be estimated by dividing the mean travel distance by the centroid lag time of hyetograph and hydrograph table 1 lists the number of publications and data points corresponding to each approach described above furthermore all the field and laboratory experimental data are also classified according to the experiment scales i e trench hillslope scale field profile scale and soil core soil column scale the trench scale experiments were conducted at hillslopes with travel distances ranging from several meters to 100 m 17 8 m on average at field profile scale the vertical infiltration process dominates and the travel distance is around 0 82 m at the soil core scale the experiments were undertaken either in the field or the laboratory with travel distances less than 0 5 m 0 18 m on average all publications used to compile the dataset are listed in the appendix 2 2 methods of identifying controlling factors we begin with ten local factors that are considered to potentially control mfv including boundary condition factors experimental factors and physical factors of the experiment sites the boundary condition factor is mainly represented by the artificial or natural rainfall intensity during the experiments here no distinction is made between the two kinds of rainfall conditions experimental factors include the observation scales i e soil core field profile or trench travel distance and experimental conditions artificial rainfall natural rainfall injection or ponding regarding the experimental conditions injection means water is injected to a specific depth below the soil surface by trench or drilled hole and ponding means that the experiments are conducted with water pressure greater than zero at the soil surface physical factors include soil types clayey loamy sandy and silty soil land use forest grassland and farmland macropore diameter mean annual precipitation ks and slope gradient soil types were reclassified following jarvis et al 2009 1 clay sandy clay silty clay sandy clay loam clay loam and silty clay loam were grouped as clayey soil 2 sand loamy sand and sandy loam were grouped as sandy soil 3 silt and silty loam were grouped as silty soil and 4 loam was separately listed as loamy soil more detailed descriptions of each factor are provided in table 2 2 3 methods of analysis three steps were used to analyze the relationships between mfv and its controlling factors in the first step two machine learning methods classification and regression tree and random forests were used to identify the most dominant controlling factors of mfv in the second step correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression methods were used to reveal the correlations of the identified controlling factors and mfv lastly empirical equations were derived to estimate mfv as a function of the identified controlling factors these steps are described in more detail below 2 3 1 classification and regression tree classification and regression tree cart is a non parametric technique for sequential partitioning of a dataset composed of a response variable and any number of potential predictor variables using dichotomous criteria breiman et al 1984 following breiman 2001 three steps were undertaken to build a regression tree first recursive binary splitting was used to grow a large tree on the training data until each terminal node has fewer than a given minimum number of observations then a complexity parameter was used to prune the large tree in order to obtain the sequence of the best subtrees finally k fold cross validation was used to test the accuracy of the generated regression tree and optimize the nodes or splitters of the tree at each split the technique searches for the predictor variable that provides the most effective binary separation of the range in the response variable rothwell et al 2008 in each group values of the response variable have to be as homogeneous as possible aiming at minimizing the overall deviance the importance of the variables selected in cart was assessed by the total reduction in the residual sum of squares rss achieved by all splitting nodes on that predictor variable after the regression tree is generated prasad et al 2006 they were also scaled to sum to 100 and any variable with contribution less than 1 was considered insignificant 2 3 2 random forests random forests rf is an ensemble of un pruned regression trees that are grown on bootstrap samples koestel and jorda 2014 when a bootstrap resample is drawn 1 3 of the data were excluded from the sample while the remaining data were replicated to bring the sample back to the full size the portion of the data drawn into the sample in a replication is known as the in bag data 2 3 of the data whereas the portion not drawn is the out of bag data 1 3 of the data the latter were not used to build or prune any tree but provide better estimates of node error and other generalization errors for bagged predictors when building each tree the number of predictors n p used to find the best split at each node was a randomly chosen subset of the total number of predictors m n p m was used as recommended by james et al 2013 we used two measures of variable importance the first one is the increase in mean squared error mse if one predictor variable is removed which is the increase of prediction accuracy for the out of bag data as a result of the predictor variable being permuted the mses were then averaged over all the trees and normalized by the standard error the second measure increase node purity the reduction in after split is similar to that for cart and was computed based on the data used to grow the trees the difference from the measure for cart is that the value of increase in node purity for rf is averaged from all the trees and the value is not scaled to 100 as ensemble learning methods cart and rf allow us to analyze both categorical data and continuous data simultaneously and have alternative ways to deal with missing data in contrast to rf cart is not so sensitive to missing data it can produce reasonable results with high explained variance even without padding missing data however cart is less robust since a small change in the data can cause a large change in the estimated final tree james et al 2013 the performance can be substantially improved by rf aggregating of thousands of decision trees thus cart and rf are complementary in their unique strengths and weaknesses and the results generated from the two models can be used for cross validation 2 3 3 correlation and regression analysis cart and rf were used to identify the main controlling factors for mfv however the exact relationships between mfv and the controlling factors are not determined by the methods because cart and rf are non parametric methods the correlation analysis method was used to analyze the individual relationships between mfv and each of the controlling factors once the controlling factors were narrowed down to those with statistically significant relationships with mfv stepwise regression was applied to further select the controlling factors as the predictive variables of mfv in the format of empirical formula adding or removing predictive variables was based on a statistical test t test at significance levels of 0 05 and 0 1 respectively for the t test the values of mfv were assumed to follow a normal distribution after a logarithmic transformation 3 results 3 1 statistics of mfv across all measurements at three spatial scales mfv is found in the range of 2 22 10 5 1 83 10 1 m s 1 considering the range of mfv over four orders of magnitude the geometric mean is used to express the mean value of mfv nimmo 2007 which is 1 08 10 3 m s 1 fig 1 on average the largest mfv values occur at the trench scale and the smallest at the field profile scale in terms of geometric mean the mfv value at the trench scale is 6 0 and 2 1 times larger than those at the field profile scale and soil core scale respectively note that the difference among the mfv values at the three scales is statistically significant p 0 01 t test the mfv differences across scales can be mostly attributed to the differences in the structures of the macropores first of all the trench scale experiments were conducted on hillslopes where abundant macropores exist with large diameter generated by decayed or alive roots earth worms and even subsurface erosion beven and germann 1982 in the soil core scale experiments the probability of incorporating large macropores into a core decreases with core sampling scale allaire et al 2009 which is around 20 cm in the studies examined so there is a low probability that the core contains obvious large macropores secondly geometric mean of mfv at soil core scale is larger than that at field profile scale this can be attributed to the connectivity of macropore network in fact as individual macropore length is small usually less than 25 cm sidle et al 2001 soil core scale with smaller travel distance 18 cm on average corresponds to a better connected macropore network and thus larger mfv compared to field profile scale with longer travel distance 82 cm on average thirdly the measured mfv values at the trench scale are largely dominated by lateral macropore flow while those measured at the field profile and soil core scales are dominated by vertical macropore flow cheng et al 2017 suggested that macropore diameters in the lateral direction are generally larger than those in the vertical direction moreover the mfv values derived from the mf measured from single macropores are the largest across all data points i e no less than 7 10 3 m s see the upper whisker of boxplot in fig 1 a this is because measuring individual macropore discharge is only possible when the macropore diameter is large enough to be measurable mfv values are not easy to be obtained and not extensively available on the other hand ks values can be approximated based on soil property data such as sand clay and silt fractions which are extensively available therefore if a ratio can be identified between mfv and ks it will be convenient to estimate mfv a priori before calibrating a catchment hydrologic model although the ratio of mfv and ks varies over 7 orders of magnitude for all data points its 25th and 75th percentiles are within 2 orders of magnitude ranging from 29 to 2450 fig 2 the geometric mean of the ratios for all data points is 339 and for the three scales trench field profile soil core it is 3099 132 and 49 respectively this means mfv is about 2 3 orders larger than the corresponding values of saturated hydraulic conductivity at the trench scale the ratio is much larger than those at the field profile and soil core scales this is reasonable since here ks is assumed to be isotropic whilst the trench scale mfv values are more dominated by lateral mf which tends to be faster than the vertical mf due to a more efficient macropore network zehe et al 2010 3 2 dominant controlling factors of mfv 3 2 1 controlling factors identified by cart and rf the regression tree for mfv generated from cart is shown in fig 3 here the complexity parameter is set as 0 025 i e each splitting step must increase r2 by at least 0 025 the tree starts with whether the observation scale is the trench scale or not at the trench scale macropore diameter is the first control on mfv larger macropore diameters d 100 mm are associated with larger mfv for the soil core and field profile scales these data points are split according to whether the travel distance is greater than 19 cm short travel distance corresponds to large mfv the overall variance explained by the regression tree is 57 1 according to the regression tree the three most important variables for explaining mfv are scale l and d fig 4 a the r2 value for the training data increases with the numbers of splits however the maximum r2 0 53 occurs at the third split for cross validation with 10 fold cross validation used fig 4 b this means that the first three splits are sufficient to explain the variance of observed mfv by scale l and d generally scale is the first order controlling factor for all data points l is the main controlling factor at soil core and field profile scales and d is the dominant factor for mfv at trench scale for the rf model without padding the missing data the explained variance of random forests is very low and the increase in mse can be negative if missing data are not dealt with thus it is necessary to replace missing data first for continuous predictors one option is the weighted average of the non missing observations where the weights are the proximities there are alternatives for many observations conducted under ponding conditions with sufficient water supply at the soil core scale the rate of water infiltration into the soil is equal to or greater than ks hence it is reasonable to replace the missing values of rainfall intensity by the value of ks the macropore diameter is usually small at the soil core and field profile scales if the replaced values of d are larger than 5 mm they are set as the mean observed values at the two scales about 2 8 mm after these replacements the explained variance is 63 4 considering the measures of variable importance increase in mse and increase in node purity d i and l are ranked as the top three most important variables fig 5 compared to the results from cart d and l are both identified as important variables while now i becomes important instead of scale the reason for this may be that after padding d at the trench scale is much larger than that at the field profile and soil core scales while after padding i at the soil core scale is also larger than that at the trench and field profile scales hence the large difference of d and i among the scales may dominate over the influence of scale as an important controlling factor 3 2 2 correlation analysis for controlling factors and mfv based on the results from cart and rf scale l d and i are identified as the dominant controlling factors on mfv the effect of scale on mfv has been discussed in section 3 1 observed values of d are mainly available at the trench scale but less so at the other two scales in this subsection we conduct a correlation analysis across all scales to elucidate the explicit relationships between mfv and the other two identified controlling factors l and i the effects of other factors like soil texture and land use are also examined mfv and travel distance have significantly positive correlation considering all data points fig 6 however this positive correlation only holds at the field profile scale at the trench scale mfv and l are uncorrelated whereas a significant negative correlation is detected at the soil core scale recall the regression tree analysis shown in fig 3 there is a splitter with l 19 cm for the soil core and field profile scales where smaller l corresponds to larger mfv this suggests a non linear relationship between l and mfv if the data of the soil core and field profile scales are pooled mfv decreases with l when l is smaller than 19 cm but it tends to increase with l for larger values of l the non linear relationship between l and mfv at soil core and field profile scales may be attributed to the connectivity of the macropore network at the soil core scale the length of individual macropores is usually less than 25 cm sidle et al 2001 the inverse relationship between mfv and l fig 6b suggests that macropore networks may be better connected at short travel distances leading to faster mfv for example the mean value of mfv calculated from bodhinayake and si 2004 was 1 26 10 5 m s with relatively longer travel distance l 20 cm while the mfv value calculated from rawls et al 1993 was much larger v 9 30 10 3 m s with shorter travel distance l 5 6 cm considering the macroporosities from the former experiments were about 27 times larger than the latter ones it indicates the macropore network with shorter travel distance has much better connectivity the inverse relationship between mfv and l is also consistent with the findings of koestel et al 2012 who performed a meta analysis using the normalized first 5 arrival time of the breakthrough curve as a proxy of macropore flow at the soil core scale at the field profile scale much larger macropores can be present as travel distance increases which offset the negative effect of macropore network connectivity at the trench scale field measurement results seem to be more site dependent so the correlation between l and mfv is weak anderson et al 2009b mcguire et al 2007 megahan and clayton 1983 wienhöfer et al 2009 that is the observed mfv may be more dependent on whether the experimental site features any highly connected preferential flow network anderson et al 2009b so the travel distance may not reflect the connectivity of the macropore network or macropore diameter at trench scale the positive correlation found when all data points are analyzed may result from the larger mfv values at the trench scale as water travels longer distances compared to the field profile and soil core scales rainfall intensity i represents the boundary condition of the experiments mfv has a significantly positive correlation with i for all data points and at all three scales fig 7 indicating that mfv is a dynamic variable instead of a static property of specific sites as i increases more water enters into and flows through the macropores and this tends to increase the hydraulic connectivity within the macropore network sidle et al 2000 as a result it reduces the impacts of friction from the macropore surface on the flow leading to increased mfv the positive correlation is also confirmed by site based experiments anderson et al 2009b hincapié and germann 2009 and other meta analyses of preferential flow velocity at the soil core scale koestel et al 2012 regarding the influence of land use three major types of landuse are considered forested sites grasslands and farmlands the geometric mean value of mfv from forested sites is slightly larger than that from grasslands and obviously larger than that from farmlands fig 8 a the difference of mfv among land use types is statistically significant p 0 01 t test this observation is consistent with previous studies according to which 1 the diameters of macropores are generally larger in forested areas than grasslands due to more active root dynamics and earthworm activities alaoui et al 2011 2 agriculture cultivation in farmlands tends to destroy the macropore and reduce the connectivity of macropore in the top soils lindahl et al 2009 regarding the impacts of soil texture no significant difference was identified in general p 0 05 t test although the median mfv values are somewhat different among different soil textures the ranges of mfv are similar for different soil textures fig 8 b 3 3 estimating mfv with multi variate regression since trench scale mfv measurements are more relevant to processes at hillslope to catchment scales we further analyze the trench scale results to develop empirical relationships that may be useful for hydrologic modeling of hillslopes and catchments 3 3 1 new empirical formula to estimate mfv in cart and rf d as an indicator of macropore morphology has been identified as a dominant control at the trench scale fig 3 d is used as a criterion to divide the data into two groups to which correlation and regression analyses are applied to analyze the relationship between site factors and mfv the splitting value of d derived from cart is only helpful for analysis of data with measured d because the partition at trench scale fig 3 does not account for missing data that make up 46 of the data points at the trench scale thus the splitting value generated from cart is not adopted here instead data points with d 10 m m are classified as large macropore group 55 data points and data with d 10 m m or data with no information on the size of macropore diameter are classified as small macropore group 55 data points the mfv values of larger macropore are 6 times larger than those of small macropore fig 9 and this difference is statistically significant p value 0 01 t test for the large macropore group mfv shows significantly positive correlations with i and d fig 10 larger i and d correspond to faster mfv the significantly negative correlation between slope gradient s and mfv however seems counterintuitive the negative correlation results from a significantly negative correlation between s and d the partial correlation between mfv and s is positive r 0 32 p 0 23 after removing d other factors like the travel distance l or mean annual precipitation p are not significantly correlated with mfv based on the above discussion the mfv values in the large macropore group can be well predicted by a multivariate regression formula fig 11 a with rainfall intensity and macropore diameter as the major explanatory factors rainfall intensity can be regarded as a proxy of the filling degree of macropore larger rainfall intensity indicates a greater filling degree of macropores this regression formula indicates that mfv is mostly determined r 2 0 76 by the rainfall property rainfall intensity i and the intrinsic macropore morphology macropore diameter d 2 v 0 0184 d 4 1 02 i 1 27 one may notice there are indeed more data points in fig 11b than those in fig 11a it is because the multiple regression in fig 11a requires the experiments contain information of both rainfall intensity and macropore diameter while data points in fig 11b only need information on macropore diameter 3 3 2 comparison with existing equations of mfv estimation in literature there are theoretical equations i e poiseuille equation and manning equation usually used to estimate mfv primarily comparing the regression formula derived from field measurements with these existing equations could provide some insight into the possible limitations of these theoretical equations and the implications of other potential controlling factors the poiseuille equation with the hypothesis that the mf flow regime is dominated by laminar flow šimůnek et al 2003 is one of the most popular equations it can be expressed as 3 v d 2 32 g ν s f where ν is the kinematic viscosity that is equal to 1 0 10 6 m 2 s at 20 c g is gravity acceleration and s f is hydraulic gradient based on the poiseuille equation the estimated mfv values can be several orders of magnitude larger than those presented in section 3 1 for example when the macropore diameter equals to 2 mm the estimated mfv for a vertical profile can be as large as 1 m s which is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the geometric mean value of the measured mfv this order of magnitude difference between the poiseuille equation and mfv measurements suggest that laminar flow may not be a good assumption for mf in the experiment sites the manning equation assuming that the mf flow regime is dominated by turbulent flow is another frequently used equation the equation is expressed as 4 v 1 n f r h 2 3 s f 1 2 where n f is roughness coefficient ranging from 0 016 to 0 14 for soil material surface chow 1959 according to the manning equation mfv decreases with n f the manning equation also tends to overestimate mfv even by setting n f as upper limit 0 14 as the inner wall surface of macropores may exert more friction force to water than the upper soil surface chen and wagenet 1992 we calibrated the n f value here to achieve the best predicting power the resulted n f value is 7 0 fig 11 b much higher than the typically recommended range for soil surfaces even so the coefficient of determination r 2 is only 0 16 fig 11 b much lower than that from our regression formula both theoretical equations for laminar flow poiseuille equation and turbulent flow manning equation could not provide a reasonable estimation of mfv there are two main reasons that may explain the overestimation of mfv the first reason is related to the filling degree of macropores since macropores are buried beneath ground the filling degree of macropores is mostly unknown during the experimental period fig 7 shows that mfv is a dynamic variable depending on the rainfall intensity which controls the water content in macropores it is very likely that the macropores are only partially filled with water in the manning equation eq 4 r h is estimated as d 4 which only holds when the macropores are fully filled by water which may rarely occur in reality in other words r h is likely overestimated in the first place the calibrated value of n f is much higher than the typical range implying that the value is adjusted to compensate for the effects from overestimation of r h on the other hand the effective roughness of the macropore inner wall is generally much larger when the macropores are partially filled than when they are fully filled secondly the connectivity of the macropore network is not reflected in the poiseuille and manning equations which are originally derived for individual pipes or macropores individual macropores are small and their length is usually under 25 cm sidle et al 2001 a macropore network is composed of a number of individual macropore pipes which themselves are disconnected most of the time the flow from one macropore may have to penetrate the soil matrix before getting into another adjacent macropore in overcoming the obstruction of the soil matrix much energy is dissipated and the flow velocity is reduced wienhöfer et al 2009 noted that the spatial arrangement and internal connectivity of the preferential network constitute the first order controls on the hydrological response of hillslopes besides the connectivity of the macropore network is dynamic guo et al 2014 as the soil is wetted more macropores are activated and the connectivity of the macropore network increases as water tends to follow the least resistant flow path sidle et al 2001 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 the resistance of the macropore network is also a function of soil moisture content and water supply these analyses suggest that including the effects of the filling degree of macropore and the roughness of macropore network is of great importance in estimating mfv here we suggest that rainfall intensity can act as a proxy for the filling degree of macropore fig 11 a a parameter reflecting the connectivity of the macropore network is also necessary to be introduced to equations for estimate mfv in soils 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 discussion 4 1 1 comparison to mfv statistics from other studies the statistics of mfv have been summarized in a few studies nimmo 2007 collected 64 field tests of preferential flow at the field profile scale and found that the maximum transport velocity has a geometric mean of 1 5 10 4 m s which is much smaller than the geometric mean value for all data points found in this study and twice as small as the geometric value at the field profile scale in this study see section 3 1 one possible reason is that nimmo 2007 considered both mfv in soils and rocks and generally mf is slower in rocks what s more nimmo 2007 focused on preferential flow which includes both macropore flow and other flow types i e finger flow and funnel flow uchida et al 2001 summarized the observed velocities in soil pipes from nine studies which were on the order of 5 4 10 3 8 10 1 m s i e at the upper end of the mfv values at the trench scale which is reasonable since the macropore diameters involved in the studies cited by uchida et al 2001 are relatively large in our study we used a much larger dataset that contains 243 experimental data points so the typical values and general range of mfv provided here are more representative for soils 4 1 2 comparison to controlling factors of mfv identified in other studies in our study observation scale travel distance rainfall intensity and macropore diameter are identified as the most important factors that control mfv compared to other studies using data from experiments at the soil core scale or field profile scale only our study covers three scales which allows observation scale and travel distance to be identified as major controls as a macropore morphological factor macropore diameter is included and has been identified as a key factor in determining mfv especially at the trench scale several studies have emphasized the importance of macropore diameter in determining mfv smettem and collisgeorge 1985 showed that mfv has a power law relationship with pore diameter in the range of 2 6 mm at soil core scale uchida et al 2001 also showed a power law relationship using observations at the trench scale the poiseuille and manning equations for pipeflow have been applied to represent flow velocity in macropores chen and wagenet 1992 and macropore diameter is a key factor in both equations thus it is reasonable that macropore diameter has been identified as a dominant control rainfall intensity has also been recognized as a proxy of the filling degree of macropores for example anderson et al 2009b found that mfv is dependent on the 1 h rainfall intensity and germann and beven 1985 modelled mfv as a function of water content in macropore further germann et al 2007 derived an equation to calculate mfv based on the stokes flow theory by treating mfv as a function of film thickness which is mainly determined by rainfall intensity as to the connectivity of the macropore network several studies have mentioned its importance to determine mfv sidle et al 2001 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 wienhöfer et al 2009 but no equations describing mfv have accounted for such effect to our knowledge in order to do this the connectivity of the macropore network and its influence on mfv must be well represented despite difficulties some efforts have been undertaken to address this problem at the soil core scale a macropore network can be visualized by x ray computed tomography and the properties of connectivity can be estimated naveed et al 2016 at the field profile scale weiler and naef 2003 used dye tracer to examine the interaction between the soil matrix and the macropore network which reflects the connectivity of macropore network at the trench scale some studies were also conducted to quantify the macropore network accompanying hillslope excavation anderson et al 2009a this approach is rather expensive but more importantly it cannot directly measure the continuity of the macropore network recently guo et al 2014 proposed a new practical and nondestructive approach to map the subsurface lateral preferential flow network by ground penetrating radar although the spatial distribution of the macropore network is complex and its activation depends on water moisture conditions the activated macropore network becomes self organized as soil moisture increases sidle et al 2000 and it develops based on the path of lowest resistance weiler and mcdonnell 2007 thus the skeletal macropore network derived from ground penetrating radar may plausibly capture the connectivity and resistance of the macropore network and ultimately inform parameterizations of mf in hydrological models 4 1 3 controlling factors of other mf attributes mfv is a key attribute of mf but it is only meaningful when mf does occur several studies have looked at other attributes of mf such as the strength of mf quantified by different indicators the relative 5 arrival time of inert tracer koestel and jorda 2014 and the occurrence of mf these attributes need to be considered simultaneously when modeling mf process it is meaningful to synthetically compare the similarity and dissimilarity of controlling factors between mfv and other mf attributions overall the strength of mf is mainly related to soil texture and the occurrence of mf is largely controlled by the boundary conditions i e rainfall properties considering the strength of mf several studies showed that clay content is a key controlling factor i e larger clay content tends to produce larger degree of mf jarvis et al 2009 koestel et al 2012 koestel and jorda 2014 other controlling factors were also investigated previously for example koestel et al 2012 found that the degree of preferential flow decreases with travel distance koestel and jorda 2014 suggested that information on the water saturation state is important for better prediction of mf as to the occurrence of mf rainfall properties are usually considered as essential controlling factors liu and lin 2015 found that mf tends to occur more frequently in response to intense rainfall events peng et al 2016 showed that rainfall amount is the prominent control on the occurrence of mf wiekenkamp et al 2016 indicated that mf is triggered by both amount and intensity of rainfall heppell et al 2002 categorized rainfall induced mf into intensity driven and duration driven types lastly antecedent soil moisture and topography also have noticeable impacts on the occurrence of mf 4 1 4 implications for further research generally the factors affecting mf can be grouped into macroscopic and microscopic factors land use soil texture observation scale travel length climate precipitation and rainfall intensity are macroscopic factors while macropore diameter macroporosity macropore continuity and macropore network connectivity are microscopic factors theoretically mfv could be directly determined by the microscopic factors when the water supply conditions are known the macroscopic factors reflect or control the microscopic characteristics in an indirect way this statement also applies to the strength of mf which is mainly determined by the density and macroporosity of mf jarvis et al 2009 the clay content related to the generation of cracks and fissures reflects some of the microscopic factors thus finding appropriate macroscopic factors reflecting microscopic properties controlling mfv is a potential way of estimating mfv other factors such as antecedent soil moisture nimmo 2012 may also be necessary for inclusion in future studies higher soil moisture will facilitate the movement of water from the soil matrix to the macropore and lessen the resistance of the macropore network sidle et al 2000 which will trigger rapid macropore flow response and fast velocity at a certain rainfall intensity 4 2 conclusions according to our meta analysis the observed mfv values range between 2 22 10 5 1 83 10 1 m s 1 the geometric mean is 1 08 10 3 m s 1 which is about 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix mfv values and the ratios of mfv to ks are significantly different across scales mfv at the trench scale is 3 10 times larger than that mfv at the soil core and field profile scales the ratio of mfv to ks at the trench scale is 23 and 62 times that at the soil core and field profile scales respectively observation scale travel distance macropore diameter and rainfall intensity are identified as major controlling factors for mfv by the cart and rf analyses with the total variance explained reaching around 60 however neither soil texture nor land use shows significant influence generally mfv increases with travel distance considering all data points a non linear relationship exists between mfv and travel distance because mfv decreases with travel distance at the soil core scale but correlation at the trench scale is nonsignificant mfv depends on rainfall intensity at all scales at the same time macropore diameter is regarded as the first order control at the trench scale and larger macropores tend to be associated with larger mfv values combining information of macropore diameter and rainfall intensity mfv can be predicted by a multivariate regression equation with accuracy r 2 0 76 at the trench scale in contrast the poiseuille or the manning equations do not predict mfv well which suggests that it is important to consider the degree of macropore saturation by a proxy such as rainfall intensity the results also point to the need of introducing a parameter to represent the effect of macropore network connectivity on mfv although our findings are still preliminary they suggest a potential for better estimating mfv using local site factors more experiments combining measurements of saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mfv and potential controlling factors at diverse scales are needed to explore their relationships within and across scales investigating the relationships between macroscopic factors and microscopic factors e g macropore morphology and macropore network connectivity on mfv is also of great value

6907,macropore flow is a ubiquitous hydrologic process that has not been well explained using traditional hydrologic theories in particular macropore flow velocity mfv is poorly understood with respect to its typical ranges and controlling factors here we conducted a meta analysis based on an mfv dataset compiled from 243 measurements documented in 76 journal articles the dataset includes mfv values measured using different approaches across the soil core field profile and trench scales our analyses show that mfv has a geometric mean of 1 08 10 3 m s 1 which is about 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values of saturated hydraulic conductivity in the soil matrix using machine learning methods including classification and regression tree and random forests algorithms we identified observation scale travel distance rainfall intensity and macropore diameter as the most important factors that control mfv mfv is much larger at the trench scale than at the other two scales mainly due to abundant large macropores correlation analysis and multivariate regression revealed that 1 mfv and rainfall intensity have significant positive correlation which indicates that mfv is a dynamic variable and 2 mfv and macropore diameter also have strong positive correlation at the trench scale which indicates macropore size as a key controlling factor using macropore diameter and rainfall intensity as explanatory factors mfv can be well predicted r 2 0 76 by a multivariate regression equation at trench scale implying that rainfall intensity can be considered a proxy for the filling degree of macropores furthermore both the poiseuille and manning equations were found to overestimate the mfv values suggesting a parameter representing the connectivity of the macropore network is needed for providing reasonable estimates of mfv using physically based equations keywords macropore flow velocity meta analysis observation scale macropore diameter rainfall intensity macropore network connectivity 1 introduction macropores are large soil voids with features that are distinct from the soil matrix cey and rudolph 2009 they are ubiquitous in soils and function as fast channels bypassing the soil matrix and expediting the movement of water and solutes below ground both vertically and horizontally macropore flow mf has been identified as a significant contributor to streamflow across diverse climate regions from semi arid to humid and from tropical to cold regions koch et al 2013 dos santos et al 2016 van schaik et al 2008 zhu 1997 negishi et al 2007 uchida et al 2005 jones 2010 mf also has great influences on infiltration soil moisture distribution hardie et al 2011 hardie et al 2013 and groundwater table dynamics mirus and nimmo 2013 hence effectively representing mf in hydrologic models is important for improving soil moisture and streamflow prediction and water management zehe et al 2007 2010 beven and germann 2013 weiler 2017 alaoui et al 2018 the most important variable to represent mf is the average velocity of water traveling through the macropores denoted as macropore flow velocity mfv which is the rate of the macropore flux in macropores mfv determines the strength and significance of mf in simulations of subsurface flow and solute transport jarvis 2007 anderson et al 2009b it is usually much larger than the travel velocity of water through soil matrix which is mostly estimated using saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and hydraulic head gradient mfv is primarily a function of water storage in the macropores and the structure of macropores density of macropores in the soil diameter of macropores macropore networks etc however the structure of macropore co evolves with the soil structure e g cracks and fissures soil fauna and plant roots and other surface and subsurface properties beven and germann 1982 so measuring or precisely describing the structure of macropores has been challenging the mfv values have also been directly set in several studies instead of deriving them with macropore structure or other information the simplest way to estimate mfv is to relate it to ks by a ratio for example yu et al 2014 suggested using mfv that is 100 times the value of ks to represent the mf process since mfv is always much larger than ks dusek et al 2012 assumed mfv at a fixed value of 5000 cm d 1 for measured ks ranging from 1 3 to 567 cm d 1 at different soil horizons the poiseuille equation and manning equation have also been adopted chen and wagenet 1992 köhne et al 2009 to provide a reference value of mfv although the aforementioned approaches have been shown to provide reasonable estimates of mfv there is no general guidance on appropriate values to be used across basins of different characteristics hence estimating mfv through experiments is often preferred artificial tracer is the most popular approach applied to empirically quantify mfv at soil core scale luo et al 2008 measured mfv by applying tracer and computed the velocity as a function of travel time and vertical distance at field profile scale cey and rudolph 2009 used dye tracer to track the occurrence of film and rivulet flow along vertical macropores and obtained flow velocity soil core scale measurements often ignore the effect of large scale heterogeneities because the structure and the connectivity of macropore network cannot be represented at such a scale experiments at the hillslope scale on the other hand can better represent the large scale heterogeneity and produce more reasonable mfv estimates anderson et al 2009a and 2009b quantified hillslope scale mfv by excavating a trench and applying steady artificial rainfall with nacl added at the upper hillslope as a tracer cheng et al 2009 estimated mfv by using hydrographs from individual macropores at an excavated trench profile however such experiments are time consuming and labor intensive a feasible alternative is to establish relationships between mfv and its controlling factors e g soil properties land use water supply conditions to enable estimation of mfv a priori from existing information several studies have been conducted to explore the main controlling factors of mfv anderson et al 2009b found that mfv is most closely related to the 1 h rainfall intensity and slope length mosley 1982 indicated that mfv varies as a function of antecedent moisture conditions and the relative importance of various pathways at a given site which are in turn functions of macropore network and soil properties uchida et al 2001 concluded that mfv depends on macropore diameter and its value is generally larger in peaty soil than in forest soil these studies have been conducted at single or multiple hillslopes there are also studies that considered a wider range of sites and controls for example jarvis et al 2009 suggested that soil susceptibility to mf could be predicted from easily available soil properties and site factors koestel et al 2012 collected 733 breakthrough curves from the literature and found that moderate to strong mf occurs only for undisturbed soils that contain more than 8 clay similarly koestel and jorda 2014 demonstrated that soil susceptibility to mf under steady state conditions is predictable from proxy variables to a large extent such as the clay content ratio between clay content and organic carbon and lateral observation scale jarvis et al 2013 defined the largest macropore hydraulic conductivity ks ma for large soil pores diameter 0 3 mm and found that its value is related to soil texture and soil bulk density although the magnitudes of both mf and ks ma are related to mfv they cannot reflect the true flow velocity along the macropore network despite these studies there is no consensus on the most appropriate physical or empirical equations to be used for the estimate mfv values and comprehensive studies on the identification of the general controls on mfv across diverse hillslopes and scales are still in need weiler 2017 called for community efforts to combine existing datasets to allow inter comparison studies as it has been successfully performed in many other scientific fields a meta analysis approach e g mutema et al 2015 may be an effective way to address this need this study presents a meta analysis conducted to compile a dataset from the published literature that reported measured mfvs from empirical experiments and a series of relevant controlling factors the dataset was then analyzed with multiple methods machine learning algorithms including classification and regression tree and random forests were employed to identify the main controlling factors of mfv correlation analysis and multivariate regression were used to determine empirical relationships between mfv and its main controlling factors our objective is three fold 1 to establish general ranges and typical values of mfv at different scales 2 to identify the dominant factors controlling mfv and 3 to provide guidance for estimating mfv in the field especially at hillslope scale 2 data and methods 2 1 compiling the dataset in this study mfv is defined as the velocity of water traveling through macropores measurements of mfv values were collected from the published literature through google scholar search the criteria for including a publication are 1 the mfv values are obtained from experiments 2 the experiments are conducted in undisturbed soils 3 the occurrence of macropore flow is obvious 4 sufficient information about the experiments and sites is provided 5 the mfv values are either directly presented in the work or can be indirectly estimated by using the provided information and 6 the approaches used to estimate mfv belongs to a screened group in order to ensure a common ground where a comparison among mfv values differently derived can be made on the basis of these criteria a dataset consisting of 243 individual data points compiled from 76 published studies was realized among the various experimental approaches for mf only five explicitly provide the mfv values which are briefly described below 2 1 1 artificial tracer artificial tracer is the most common and effective approach to determine mfv at different scales the velocity of macropore flow v can be obtained by fitting the measured breakthrough curves using the convection dispersion equation or by dividing the travel distance by travel time there are two kinds of travel time t usually used to calculate mfv i e peak travel time and first arrival travel time according to the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation for solute transport jury et al 1991 the peak travel time is more suitable for calculating the mean mfv and is preferred in our analysis if the peak travel time is absent mfv derived from the first arrival travel time is selected most mfv values adopted here are obtained using peak travel time and breakthrough curve fitting 2 1 2 non sequential soil moisture response generally during a rainfall period a wetting front moves gradually from the top to the bottom in a homogeneous soil profile the soil moisture content in the upper part of the soil responds faster than that in the lower part thus the soil moisture content increases sequentially from the upper part to the lower part with macropore flow the sequential response of soil moisture content with depth can be violated lin and zhou 2008 defined preferential flow operationally as an increase in soil water content out of sequence with respect to soil depth with this consideration we collected velocity values calculated under the no sequence soil water moisture response condition in this approach mfv values are also calculated by dividing the travel distance by the response time 2 1 3 hydraulic conductivity and macroporosity macropores are usually identified as pores of equivalent cylindrical diameter larger than 0 3 1 mm luxmoore 1981 jarvis 2007 which is corresponding to capillary potential φ of 3 10 h p a flow velocity in macropores can be estimated by combining the information of macroporosity ε and amount of water flowing through them once the flow flux q s under saturated condition and near saturation hydraulic conductivity k φ with capillary potential φ 3 10 h p a are obtained the contribution of macropore to q s can be calculated as q s k φ considering the portion of water moving through macropores the mean velocity of flow through the macropore can be given as 1 v q s k φ ε ε can be estimated by the difference between water content at φ 0 and φ 3 10 h p a or directly measured by x ray computed tomography 2 1 4 individual macropore discharge macropore flow rate can be directly measured at an excavated trench or road cut cross section the corresponding mfv can be estimated by dividing the macropore discharge q mac by macropore cross sectional area a mac a series of observed q mac can be obtained under different conditions we used the largest value of q mac when calculating mfv 2 1 5 rainfall runoff lag when macropore flow is the dominant component in discharge in a storm event the lag time between hyetograph and hydrograph centroid represents the mean transport time of macropore flow under wet condition mosley 1982 at small scales the mean mfv value during a storm event can be estimated by dividing the mean travel distance by the centroid lag time of hyetograph and hydrograph table 1 lists the number of publications and data points corresponding to each approach described above furthermore all the field and laboratory experimental data are also classified according to the experiment scales i e trench hillslope scale field profile scale and soil core soil column scale the trench scale experiments were conducted at hillslopes with travel distances ranging from several meters to 100 m 17 8 m on average at field profile scale the vertical infiltration process dominates and the travel distance is around 0 82 m at the soil core scale the experiments were undertaken either in the field or the laboratory with travel distances less than 0 5 m 0 18 m on average all publications used to compile the dataset are listed in the appendix 2 2 methods of identifying controlling factors we begin with ten local factors that are considered to potentially control mfv including boundary condition factors experimental factors and physical factors of the experiment sites the boundary condition factor is mainly represented by the artificial or natural rainfall intensity during the experiments here no distinction is made between the two kinds of rainfall conditions experimental factors include the observation scales i e soil core field profile or trench travel distance and experimental conditions artificial rainfall natural rainfall injection or ponding regarding the experimental conditions injection means water is injected to a specific depth below the soil surface by trench or drilled hole and ponding means that the experiments are conducted with water pressure greater than zero at the soil surface physical factors include soil types clayey loamy sandy and silty soil land use forest grassland and farmland macropore diameter mean annual precipitation ks and slope gradient soil types were reclassified following jarvis et al 2009 1 clay sandy clay silty clay sandy clay loam clay loam and silty clay loam were grouped as clayey soil 2 sand loamy sand and sandy loam were grouped as sandy soil 3 silt and silty loam were grouped as silty soil and 4 loam was separately listed as loamy soil more detailed descriptions of each factor are provided in table 2 2 3 methods of analysis three steps were used to analyze the relationships between mfv and its controlling factors in the first step two machine learning methods classification and regression tree and random forests were used to identify the most dominant controlling factors of mfv in the second step correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression methods were used to reveal the correlations of the identified controlling factors and mfv lastly empirical equations were derived to estimate mfv as a function of the identified controlling factors these steps are described in more detail below 2 3 1 classification and regression tree classification and regression tree cart is a non parametric technique for sequential partitioning of a dataset composed of a response variable and any number of potential predictor variables using dichotomous criteria breiman et al 1984 following breiman 2001 three steps were undertaken to build a regression tree first recursive binary splitting was used to grow a large tree on the training data until each terminal node has fewer than a given minimum number of observations then a complexity parameter was used to prune the large tree in order to obtain the sequence of the best subtrees finally k fold cross validation was used to test the accuracy of the generated regression tree and optimize the nodes or splitters of the tree at each split the technique searches for the predictor variable that provides the most effective binary separation of the range in the response variable rothwell et al 2008 in each group values of the response variable have to be as homogeneous as possible aiming at minimizing the overall deviance the importance of the variables selected in cart was assessed by the total reduction in the residual sum of squares rss achieved by all splitting nodes on that predictor variable after the regression tree is generated prasad et al 2006 they were also scaled to sum to 100 and any variable with contribution less than 1 was considered insignificant 2 3 2 random forests random forests rf is an ensemble of un pruned regression trees that are grown on bootstrap samples koestel and jorda 2014 when a bootstrap resample is drawn 1 3 of the data were excluded from the sample while the remaining data were replicated to bring the sample back to the full size the portion of the data drawn into the sample in a replication is known as the in bag data 2 3 of the data whereas the portion not drawn is the out of bag data 1 3 of the data the latter were not used to build or prune any tree but provide better estimates of node error and other generalization errors for bagged predictors when building each tree the number of predictors n p used to find the best split at each node was a randomly chosen subset of the total number of predictors m n p m was used as recommended by james et al 2013 we used two measures of variable importance the first one is the increase in mean squared error mse if one predictor variable is removed which is the increase of prediction accuracy for the out of bag data as a result of the predictor variable being permuted the mses were then averaged over all the trees and normalized by the standard error the second measure increase node purity the reduction in after split is similar to that for cart and was computed based on the data used to grow the trees the difference from the measure for cart is that the value of increase in node purity for rf is averaged from all the trees and the value is not scaled to 100 as ensemble learning methods cart and rf allow us to analyze both categorical data and continuous data simultaneously and have alternative ways to deal with missing data in contrast to rf cart is not so sensitive to missing data it can produce reasonable results with high explained variance even without padding missing data however cart is less robust since a small change in the data can cause a large change in the estimated final tree james et al 2013 the performance can be substantially improved by rf aggregating of thousands of decision trees thus cart and rf are complementary in their unique strengths and weaknesses and the results generated from the two models can be used for cross validation 2 3 3 correlation and regression analysis cart and rf were used to identify the main controlling factors for mfv however the exact relationships between mfv and the controlling factors are not determined by the methods because cart and rf are non parametric methods the correlation analysis method was used to analyze the individual relationships between mfv and each of the controlling factors once the controlling factors were narrowed down to those with statistically significant relationships with mfv stepwise regression was applied to further select the controlling factors as the predictive variables of mfv in the format of empirical formula adding or removing predictive variables was based on a statistical test t test at significance levels of 0 05 and 0 1 respectively for the t test the values of mfv were assumed to follow a normal distribution after a logarithmic transformation 3 results 3 1 statistics of mfv across all measurements at three spatial scales mfv is found in the range of 2 22 10 5 1 83 10 1 m s 1 considering the range of mfv over four orders of magnitude the geometric mean is used to express the mean value of mfv nimmo 2007 which is 1 08 10 3 m s 1 fig 1 on average the largest mfv values occur at the trench scale and the smallest at the field profile scale in terms of geometric mean the mfv value at the trench scale is 6 0 and 2 1 times larger than those at the field profile scale and soil core scale respectively note that the difference among the mfv values at the three scales is statistically significant p 0 01 t test the mfv differences across scales can be mostly attributed to the differences in the structures of the macropores first of all the trench scale experiments were conducted on hillslopes where abundant macropores exist with large diameter generated by decayed or alive roots earth worms and even subsurface erosion beven and germann 1982 in the soil core scale experiments the probability of incorporating large macropores into a core decreases with core sampling scale allaire et al 2009 which is around 20 cm in the studies examined so there is a low probability that the core contains obvious large macropores secondly geometric mean of mfv at soil core scale is larger than that at field profile scale this can be attributed to the connectivity of macropore network in fact as individual macropore length is small usually less than 25 cm sidle et al 2001 soil core scale with smaller travel distance 18 cm on average corresponds to a better connected macropore network and thus larger mfv compared to field profile scale with longer travel distance 82 cm on average thirdly the measured mfv values at the trench scale are largely dominated by lateral macropore flow while those measured at the field profile and soil core scales are dominated by vertical macropore flow cheng et al 2017 suggested that macropore diameters in the lateral direction are generally larger than those in the vertical direction moreover the mfv values derived from the mf measured from single macropores are the largest across all data points i e no less than 7 10 3 m s see the upper whisker of boxplot in fig 1 a this is because measuring individual macropore discharge is only possible when the macropore diameter is large enough to be measurable mfv values are not easy to be obtained and not extensively available on the other hand ks values can be approximated based on soil property data such as sand clay and silt fractions which are extensively available therefore if a ratio can be identified between mfv and ks it will be convenient to estimate mfv a priori before calibrating a catchment hydrologic model although the ratio of mfv and ks varies over 7 orders of magnitude for all data points its 25th and 75th percentiles are within 2 orders of magnitude ranging from 29 to 2450 fig 2 the geometric mean of the ratios for all data points is 339 and for the three scales trench field profile soil core it is 3099 132 and 49 respectively this means mfv is about 2 3 orders larger than the corresponding values of saturated hydraulic conductivity at the trench scale the ratio is much larger than those at the field profile and soil core scales this is reasonable since here ks is assumed to be isotropic whilst the trench scale mfv values are more dominated by lateral mf which tends to be faster than the vertical mf due to a more efficient macropore network zehe et al 2010 3 2 dominant controlling factors of mfv 3 2 1 controlling factors identified by cart and rf the regression tree for mfv generated from cart is shown in fig 3 here the complexity parameter is set as 0 025 i e each splitting step must increase r2 by at least 0 025 the tree starts with whether the observation scale is the trench scale or not at the trench scale macropore diameter is the first control on mfv larger macropore diameters d 100 mm are associated with larger mfv for the soil core and field profile scales these data points are split according to whether the travel distance is greater than 19 cm short travel distance corresponds to large mfv the overall variance explained by the regression tree is 57 1 according to the regression tree the three most important variables for explaining mfv are scale l and d fig 4 a the r2 value for the training data increases with the numbers of splits however the maximum r2 0 53 occurs at the third split for cross validation with 10 fold cross validation used fig 4 b this means that the first three splits are sufficient to explain the variance of observed mfv by scale l and d generally scale is the first order controlling factor for all data points l is the main controlling factor at soil core and field profile scales and d is the dominant factor for mfv at trench scale for the rf model without padding the missing data the explained variance of random forests is very low and the increase in mse can be negative if missing data are not dealt with thus it is necessary to replace missing data first for continuous predictors one option is the weighted average of the non missing observations where the weights are the proximities there are alternatives for many observations conducted under ponding conditions with sufficient water supply at the soil core scale the rate of water infiltration into the soil is equal to or greater than ks hence it is reasonable to replace the missing values of rainfall intensity by the value of ks the macropore diameter is usually small at the soil core and field profile scales if the replaced values of d are larger than 5 mm they are set as the mean observed values at the two scales about 2 8 mm after these replacements the explained variance is 63 4 considering the measures of variable importance increase in mse and increase in node purity d i and l are ranked as the top three most important variables fig 5 compared to the results from cart d and l are both identified as important variables while now i becomes important instead of scale the reason for this may be that after padding d at the trench scale is much larger than that at the field profile and soil core scales while after padding i at the soil core scale is also larger than that at the trench and field profile scales hence the large difference of d and i among the scales may dominate over the influence of scale as an important controlling factor 3 2 2 correlation analysis for controlling factors and mfv based on the results from cart and rf scale l d and i are identified as the dominant controlling factors on mfv the effect of scale on mfv has been discussed in section 3 1 observed values of d are mainly available at the trench scale but less so at the other two scales in this subsection we conduct a correlation analysis across all scales to elucidate the explicit relationships between mfv and the other two identified controlling factors l and i the effects of other factors like soil texture and land use are also examined mfv and travel distance have significantly positive correlation considering all data points fig 6 however this positive correlation only holds at the field profile scale at the trench scale mfv and l are uncorrelated whereas a significant negative correlation is detected at the soil core scale recall the regression tree analysis shown in fig 3 there is a splitter with l 19 cm for the soil core and field profile scales where smaller l corresponds to larger mfv this suggests a non linear relationship between l and mfv if the data of the soil core and field profile scales are pooled mfv decreases with l when l is smaller than 19 cm but it tends to increase with l for larger values of l the non linear relationship between l and mfv at soil core and field profile scales may be attributed to the connectivity of the macropore network at the soil core scale the length of individual macropores is usually less than 25 cm sidle et al 2001 the inverse relationship between mfv and l fig 6b suggests that macropore networks may be better connected at short travel distances leading to faster mfv for example the mean value of mfv calculated from bodhinayake and si 2004 was 1 26 10 5 m s with relatively longer travel distance l 20 cm while the mfv value calculated from rawls et al 1993 was much larger v 9 30 10 3 m s with shorter travel distance l 5 6 cm considering the macroporosities from the former experiments were about 27 times larger than the latter ones it indicates the macropore network with shorter travel distance has much better connectivity the inverse relationship between mfv and l is also consistent with the findings of koestel et al 2012 who performed a meta analysis using the normalized first 5 arrival time of the breakthrough curve as a proxy of macropore flow at the soil core scale at the field profile scale much larger macropores can be present as travel distance increases which offset the negative effect of macropore network connectivity at the trench scale field measurement results seem to be more site dependent so the correlation between l and mfv is weak anderson et al 2009b mcguire et al 2007 megahan and clayton 1983 wienhöfer et al 2009 that is the observed mfv may be more dependent on whether the experimental site features any highly connected preferential flow network anderson et al 2009b so the travel distance may not reflect the connectivity of the macropore network or macropore diameter at trench scale the positive correlation found when all data points are analyzed may result from the larger mfv values at the trench scale as water travels longer distances compared to the field profile and soil core scales rainfall intensity i represents the boundary condition of the experiments mfv has a significantly positive correlation with i for all data points and at all three scales fig 7 indicating that mfv is a dynamic variable instead of a static property of specific sites as i increases more water enters into and flows through the macropores and this tends to increase the hydraulic connectivity within the macropore network sidle et al 2000 as a result it reduces the impacts of friction from the macropore surface on the flow leading to increased mfv the positive correlation is also confirmed by site based experiments anderson et al 2009b hincapié and germann 2009 and other meta analyses of preferential flow velocity at the soil core scale koestel et al 2012 regarding the influence of land use three major types of landuse are considered forested sites grasslands and farmlands the geometric mean value of mfv from forested sites is slightly larger than that from grasslands and obviously larger than that from farmlands fig 8 a the difference of mfv among land use types is statistically significant p 0 01 t test this observation is consistent with previous studies according to which 1 the diameters of macropores are generally larger in forested areas than grasslands due to more active root dynamics and earthworm activities alaoui et al 2011 2 agriculture cultivation in farmlands tends to destroy the macropore and reduce the connectivity of macropore in the top soils lindahl et al 2009 regarding the impacts of soil texture no significant difference was identified in general p 0 05 t test although the median mfv values are somewhat different among different soil textures the ranges of mfv are similar for different soil textures fig 8 b 3 3 estimating mfv with multi variate regression since trench scale mfv measurements are more relevant to processes at hillslope to catchment scales we further analyze the trench scale results to develop empirical relationships that may be useful for hydrologic modeling of hillslopes and catchments 3 3 1 new empirical formula to estimate mfv in cart and rf d as an indicator of macropore morphology has been identified as a dominant control at the trench scale fig 3 d is used as a criterion to divide the data into two groups to which correlation and regression analyses are applied to analyze the relationship between site factors and mfv the splitting value of d derived from cart is only helpful for analysis of data with measured d because the partition at trench scale fig 3 does not account for missing data that make up 46 of the data points at the trench scale thus the splitting value generated from cart is not adopted here instead data points with d 10 m m are classified as large macropore group 55 data points and data with d 10 m m or data with no information on the size of macropore diameter are classified as small macropore group 55 data points the mfv values of larger macropore are 6 times larger than those of small macropore fig 9 and this difference is statistically significant p value 0 01 t test for the large macropore group mfv shows significantly positive correlations with i and d fig 10 larger i and d correspond to faster mfv the significantly negative correlation between slope gradient s and mfv however seems counterintuitive the negative correlation results from a significantly negative correlation between s and d the partial correlation between mfv and s is positive r 0 32 p 0 23 after removing d other factors like the travel distance l or mean annual precipitation p are not significantly correlated with mfv based on the above discussion the mfv values in the large macropore group can be well predicted by a multivariate regression formula fig 11 a with rainfall intensity and macropore diameter as the major explanatory factors rainfall intensity can be regarded as a proxy of the filling degree of macropore larger rainfall intensity indicates a greater filling degree of macropores this regression formula indicates that mfv is mostly determined r 2 0 76 by the rainfall property rainfall intensity i and the intrinsic macropore morphology macropore diameter d 2 v 0 0184 d 4 1 02 i 1 27 one may notice there are indeed more data points in fig 11b than those in fig 11a it is because the multiple regression in fig 11a requires the experiments contain information of both rainfall intensity and macropore diameter while data points in fig 11b only need information on macropore diameter 3 3 2 comparison with existing equations of mfv estimation in literature there are theoretical equations i e poiseuille equation and manning equation usually used to estimate mfv primarily comparing the regression formula derived from field measurements with these existing equations could provide some insight into the possible limitations of these theoretical equations and the implications of other potential controlling factors the poiseuille equation with the hypothesis that the mf flow regime is dominated by laminar flow šimůnek et al 2003 is one of the most popular equations it can be expressed as 3 v d 2 32 g ν s f where ν is the kinematic viscosity that is equal to 1 0 10 6 m 2 s at 20 c g is gravity acceleration and s f is hydraulic gradient based on the poiseuille equation the estimated mfv values can be several orders of magnitude larger than those presented in section 3 1 for example when the macropore diameter equals to 2 mm the estimated mfv for a vertical profile can be as large as 1 m s which is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the geometric mean value of the measured mfv this order of magnitude difference between the poiseuille equation and mfv measurements suggest that laminar flow may not be a good assumption for mf in the experiment sites the manning equation assuming that the mf flow regime is dominated by turbulent flow is another frequently used equation the equation is expressed as 4 v 1 n f r h 2 3 s f 1 2 where n f is roughness coefficient ranging from 0 016 to 0 14 for soil material surface chow 1959 according to the manning equation mfv decreases with n f the manning equation also tends to overestimate mfv even by setting n f as upper limit 0 14 as the inner wall surface of macropores may exert more friction force to water than the upper soil surface chen and wagenet 1992 we calibrated the n f value here to achieve the best predicting power the resulted n f value is 7 0 fig 11 b much higher than the typically recommended range for soil surfaces even so the coefficient of determination r 2 is only 0 16 fig 11 b much lower than that from our regression formula both theoretical equations for laminar flow poiseuille equation and turbulent flow manning equation could not provide a reasonable estimation of mfv there are two main reasons that may explain the overestimation of mfv the first reason is related to the filling degree of macropores since macropores are buried beneath ground the filling degree of macropores is mostly unknown during the experimental period fig 7 shows that mfv is a dynamic variable depending on the rainfall intensity which controls the water content in macropores it is very likely that the macropores are only partially filled with water in the manning equation eq 4 r h is estimated as d 4 which only holds when the macropores are fully filled by water which may rarely occur in reality in other words r h is likely overestimated in the first place the calibrated value of n f is much higher than the typical range implying that the value is adjusted to compensate for the effects from overestimation of r h on the other hand the effective roughness of the macropore inner wall is generally much larger when the macropores are partially filled than when they are fully filled secondly the connectivity of the macropore network is not reflected in the poiseuille and manning equations which are originally derived for individual pipes or macropores individual macropores are small and their length is usually under 25 cm sidle et al 2001 a macropore network is composed of a number of individual macropore pipes which themselves are disconnected most of the time the flow from one macropore may have to penetrate the soil matrix before getting into another adjacent macropore in overcoming the obstruction of the soil matrix much energy is dissipated and the flow velocity is reduced wienhöfer et al 2009 noted that the spatial arrangement and internal connectivity of the preferential network constitute the first order controls on the hydrological response of hillslopes besides the connectivity of the macropore network is dynamic guo et al 2014 as the soil is wetted more macropores are activated and the connectivity of the macropore network increases as water tends to follow the least resistant flow path sidle et al 2001 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 the resistance of the macropore network is also a function of soil moisture content and water supply these analyses suggest that including the effects of the filling degree of macropore and the roughness of macropore network is of great importance in estimating mfv here we suggest that rainfall intensity can act as a proxy for the filling degree of macropore fig 11 a a parameter reflecting the connectivity of the macropore network is also necessary to be introduced to equations for estimate mfv in soils 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 discussion 4 1 1 comparison to mfv statistics from other studies the statistics of mfv have been summarized in a few studies nimmo 2007 collected 64 field tests of preferential flow at the field profile scale and found that the maximum transport velocity has a geometric mean of 1 5 10 4 m s which is much smaller than the geometric mean value for all data points found in this study and twice as small as the geometric value at the field profile scale in this study see section 3 1 one possible reason is that nimmo 2007 considered both mfv in soils and rocks and generally mf is slower in rocks what s more nimmo 2007 focused on preferential flow which includes both macropore flow and other flow types i e finger flow and funnel flow uchida et al 2001 summarized the observed velocities in soil pipes from nine studies which were on the order of 5 4 10 3 8 10 1 m s i e at the upper end of the mfv values at the trench scale which is reasonable since the macropore diameters involved in the studies cited by uchida et al 2001 are relatively large in our study we used a much larger dataset that contains 243 experimental data points so the typical values and general range of mfv provided here are more representative for soils 4 1 2 comparison to controlling factors of mfv identified in other studies in our study observation scale travel distance rainfall intensity and macropore diameter are identified as the most important factors that control mfv compared to other studies using data from experiments at the soil core scale or field profile scale only our study covers three scales which allows observation scale and travel distance to be identified as major controls as a macropore morphological factor macropore diameter is included and has been identified as a key factor in determining mfv especially at the trench scale several studies have emphasized the importance of macropore diameter in determining mfv smettem and collisgeorge 1985 showed that mfv has a power law relationship with pore diameter in the range of 2 6 mm at soil core scale uchida et al 2001 also showed a power law relationship using observations at the trench scale the poiseuille and manning equations for pipeflow have been applied to represent flow velocity in macropores chen and wagenet 1992 and macropore diameter is a key factor in both equations thus it is reasonable that macropore diameter has been identified as a dominant control rainfall intensity has also been recognized as a proxy of the filling degree of macropores for example anderson et al 2009b found that mfv is dependent on the 1 h rainfall intensity and germann and beven 1985 modelled mfv as a function of water content in macropore further germann et al 2007 derived an equation to calculate mfv based on the stokes flow theory by treating mfv as a function of film thickness which is mainly determined by rainfall intensity as to the connectivity of the macropore network several studies have mentioned its importance to determine mfv sidle et al 2001 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 wienhöfer et al 2009 but no equations describing mfv have accounted for such effect to our knowledge in order to do this the connectivity of the macropore network and its influence on mfv must be well represented despite difficulties some efforts have been undertaken to address this problem at the soil core scale a macropore network can be visualized by x ray computed tomography and the properties of connectivity can be estimated naveed et al 2016 at the field profile scale weiler and naef 2003 used dye tracer to examine the interaction between the soil matrix and the macropore network which reflects the connectivity of macropore network at the trench scale some studies were also conducted to quantify the macropore network accompanying hillslope excavation anderson et al 2009a this approach is rather expensive but more importantly it cannot directly measure the continuity of the macropore network recently guo et al 2014 proposed a new practical and nondestructive approach to map the subsurface lateral preferential flow network by ground penetrating radar although the spatial distribution of the macropore network is complex and its activation depends on water moisture conditions the activated macropore network becomes self organized as soil moisture increases sidle et al 2000 and it develops based on the path of lowest resistance weiler and mcdonnell 2007 thus the skeletal macropore network derived from ground penetrating radar may plausibly capture the connectivity and resistance of the macropore network and ultimately inform parameterizations of mf in hydrological models 4 1 3 controlling factors of other mf attributes mfv is a key attribute of mf but it is only meaningful when mf does occur several studies have looked at other attributes of mf such as the strength of mf quantified by different indicators the relative 5 arrival time of inert tracer koestel and jorda 2014 and the occurrence of mf these attributes need to be considered simultaneously when modeling mf process it is meaningful to synthetically compare the similarity and dissimilarity of controlling factors between mfv and other mf attributions overall the strength of mf is mainly related to soil texture and the occurrence of mf is largely controlled by the boundary conditions i e rainfall properties considering the strength of mf several studies showed that clay content is a key controlling factor i e larger clay content tends to produce larger degree of mf jarvis et al 2009 koestel et al 2012 koestel and jorda 2014 other controlling factors were also investigated previously for example koestel et al 2012 found that the degree of preferential flow decreases with travel distance koestel and jorda 2014 suggested that information on the water saturation state is important for better prediction of mf as to the occurrence of mf rainfall properties are usually considered as essential controlling factors liu and lin 2015 found that mf tends to occur more frequently in response to intense rainfall events peng et al 2016 showed that rainfall amount is the prominent control on the occurrence of mf wiekenkamp et al 2016 indicated that mf is triggered by both amount and intensity of rainfall heppell et al 2002 categorized rainfall induced mf into intensity driven and duration driven types lastly antecedent soil moisture and topography also have noticeable impacts on the occurrence of mf 4 1 4 implications for further research generally the factors affecting mf can be grouped into macroscopic and microscopic factors land use soil texture observation scale travel length climate precipitation and rainfall intensity are macroscopic factors while macropore diameter macroporosity macropore continuity and macropore network connectivity are microscopic factors theoretically mfv could be directly determined by the microscopic factors when the water supply conditions are known the macroscopic factors reflect or control the microscopic characteristics in an indirect way this statement also applies to the strength of mf which is mainly determined by the density and macroporosity of mf jarvis et al 2009 the clay content related to the generation of cracks and fissures reflects some of the microscopic factors thus finding appropriate macroscopic factors reflecting microscopic properties controlling mfv is a potential way of estimating mfv other factors such as antecedent soil moisture nimmo 2012 may also be necessary for inclusion in future studies higher soil moisture will facilitate the movement of water from the soil matrix to the macropore and lessen the resistance of the macropore network sidle et al 2000 which will trigger rapid macropore flow response and fast velocity at a certain rainfall intensity 4 2 conclusions according to our meta analysis the observed mfv values range between 2 22 10 5 1 83 10 1 m s 1 the geometric mean is 1 08 10 3 m s 1 which is about 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix mfv values and the ratios of mfv to ks are significantly different across scales mfv at the trench scale is 3 10 times larger than that mfv at the soil core and field profile scales the ratio of mfv to ks at the trench scale is 23 and 62 times that at the soil core and field profile scales respectively observation scale travel distance macropore diameter and rainfall intensity are identified as major controlling factors for mfv by the cart and rf analyses with the total variance explained reaching around 60 however neither soil texture nor land use shows significant influence generally mfv increases with travel distance considering all data points a non linear relationship exists between mfv and travel distance because mfv decreases with travel distance at the soil core scale but correlation at the trench scale is nonsignificant mfv depends on rainfall intensity at all scales at the same time macropore diameter is regarded as the first order control at the trench scale and larger macropores tend to be associated with larger mfv values combining information of macropore diameter and rainfall intensity mfv can be predicted by a multivariate regression equation with accuracy r 2 0 76 at the trench scale in contrast the poiseuille or the manning equations do not predict mfv well which suggests that it is important to consider the degree of macropore saturation by a proxy such as rainfall intensity the results also point to the need of introducing a parameter to represent the effect of macropore network connectivity on mfv although our findings are still preliminary they suggest a potential for better estimating mfv using local site factors more experiments combining measurements of saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mfv and potential controlling factors at diverse scales are needed to explore their relationships within and across scales investigating the relationships between macroscopic factors and microscopic factors e g macropore morphology and macropore network connectivity on mfv is also of great value

6908,wedge shaped aquifers are usually formed where two linear boundaries intersect these types of aquifers are commonly seen in river basins and alluvial fans but have received much less attention in the hydrological sciences community fundamental understanding of the effects of lateral boundaries on the hydrodynamic process in such aquifers is quite poor particularly for unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer systems which will be the concern of this study solutions of flow to a well in an unconfined fractured wedge shaped two aquifer system are obtained using laplace hankel and fourier transforms an infinitesimal radius pumping well partially penetrates the overlying unconfined aquifer both aquifer layers are homogeneous and anisotropic bounded by two intersecting linear lateral boundaries of constant head or barrier types and the aquifer system is semi infinite in radial direction the time domain drawdowns are obtained via the stehfest algorithm and gaussian quadrature the inter porosity flow in the underlying fracture aquifer the instantaneous water table drainage the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and the wedge angle are taken into account eliminating the inter porosity flow in the underlying fractured aquifer the presented solution reduces to a leaky wedge shaped aquifer case the influences of the underlying fractured aquifer hydraulic parameters on the overlying unconfined aquifer for different wedge angles and linear lateral boundaries types are explored using dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity curves the results of this study can be utilized to obtain hydraulic parameters of an alluvial and river basin unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer systems the presented solution can also be used for

wedge angle 1 introduction wedge shaped aquifers are usually formed where two boundaries intersect these aquifers are commonly seen in river basins lambs 2004 yeh and chang 2006 and alluvial fans samani and sedghi 2015 yeh and chang 2006 unfortunately these types of aquifers have received much less attention in the hydrological science community and many fundamental effects of lateral boundaries on the hydrodynamic processes associated with such aquifers are either unknown or poorly described pumping tests which have been used successfully for obtaining aquifer parameters in horizontally infinite aquifers are natural choices for determining hydraulic characteristics of wedge shaped aquifers however if the drawdown cone expands to lateral boundaries the analytical models for horizontally infinite aquifers are no longer valid for wedge shaped aquifers in these cases the models considering the intersecting lateral boundaries are suggested samani and sedghi 2015 sedghi and samani 2010 sedghi et al 2009 2012 yeh and chang 2006 yeh et al 2008 such analytical models are indispensable for parameter estimations of wedge shaped aquifers and also for benchmarking numerical solutions involving groundwater pumping in such aquifers unfortunately there are relatively few analytical works on wedge shaped aquifers chan et al 1978 developed the first solution of flow to a well in an artesian wedge shaped aquifer they used hankel and fourier sine transformations to obtain their solution although their approach removed the image well method limitations chan et al 1978 yeh and chang 2006 its applications were limited to two dimensional 2d confined single layered wedge shaped aquifers bounded by constant head boundaries the same aquifer configuration was considered by yeh and chang 2006 which considered the spatial variations of the lateral boundaries head and showed that the chan et al 1978 solution was a special case of their solution they also used the shank transformation shanks 1955 to accelerate convergence of series appeared in their solutions in an effort to obtain three dimensional 3d solution of groundwater flow to a well in confined and unconfined wedge shaped aquifer sedghi et al 2009 utilized the laplace and fourier transformations they investigated the effects of different geometrical and hydraulic parameters on dimensionless drawdown and stream depletion rate sedghi and samani 2010 adopted a double porosity concept presented by barenblatt et al 1960 to analytically model the dimensionless drawdown in a fractured wedge shaped aquifer they considered barrier barrier constant head barrier and constant head constant head wedge configurations the inter porosity concept barenblatt et al 1960 is not adopted by barker 1988 to develop analytical solutions of flow to a well for arbitrary flow dimensions his solution is however applicable in fractured aquifer well test among other applications but the physical interpretation of flow dimension is unclear in fractured aquifer cases barker 1988 the flow dimensions are interpreted by bowman et al 2013 for the fractured media the effects of hydraulic conductivity specific storage and geometry of matrix blocks on the flow dimension are not investigated in their work as their interpretations are not based on inter porosity concept presented by barenblatt et al 1960 leakage from the bottom of an unconfined wedge shaped aquifer was considered in the analytical solution presented by sedghi et al 2012 they used the fourier series suggested by ozisik 2013 to derive the solution and to obtain time domain drawdown using stehfest stehfest 1970 algorithm for inverse laplace transform the horizontal component of flow in the aquitard was not considered by sedghi et al 2012 such a flow component may be significant near the pumping well or stream aquifer interface a patchy wedge shaped aquifer with radial heterogeneity was analytically modeled by samani and sedghi 2015 which also generalized their solution for a multi zone wedge shaped aquifer case all above mentioned solutions only considered single layer wedge shaped aquifers multi layer wedge shaped aquifers have rarely been investigated up to present unconfined aquifers are sometimes underlain by an aquitard malama et al 2007 2008 wagner 2011 this hydrogeological setting may occur in alluvial fans as well in fact one of the most important characteristics of alluvial fans is coarsing or fining upward sequences due to climate variation tectonics and sedimentological processes maliva 2016 that may cause layering of the aquifer for example layered alluvial fan aquifers were reported in zagros and alborz mountains groundwater provinces of iran issar 1969 unconfined fractured aquifer systems were also not uncommon in horizontally infinite aquifers al shaibani 2008 sedghi and samani 2015 wagner 2011 alluvial fans maliva and missimer 2012 or near anticlines 180 wedge aquifers issar 1969 alluvial fans especially those that form in basins with low tectonic activity are wedge shaped in planer and cross sectional view spherical wedge in basins with high tectonic activity however thick alluvial fans with steep margin due to high angle faults can form in cylindrical wedge blair 1987 this condition is the most favorable condition for development of large alluvial fans blair and mcpherson 2009 thick aquifers that are formed in these fans tectonic valleys may recharge the underlying bedrock as in great basin usa belcher et al 2017 fetter 2000 another example is the batina plain aquifer in the sultanate of oman underlain by tertiary limestone aquifer extending inland to the foothills of northern oman mountains young et al 1998 this aquifer can be considered as the wedge shaped aquifer near the mountain range in above mentioned cases the underlying aquifer provides an extra source of water for the overlying pumped aquifer thus the single layer conceptual model is no longer valid sedghi and samani 2015 instead one has to consider water exchange or leaking between the underlying and overlying aquifers up to date many analytical and semi analytical solutions have been developed for groundwater flow in leaky aquifer aquitard systems hantush 1959 1960 hantush and jacob 1955 hunt 2005 malama et al 2007 2008 neuman and witherspoon 1969 sun and zhan 2006 zhan and bian 2006 zhan and park 2003 and unconfined fractured aquifer systems sedghi and samani 2015 unfortunately none of them can be applied for wedge shaped aquifers the objective of this study is to develop solutions for flow to a well in an unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer system the laplace hankel domain solutions of flow to a partially penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer aquitard and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer systems are obtained the solutions take into account the instantaneous drainage of water table anisotropy in both aquifers horizontal and vertical flows in the unconfined aquifer and the underlying aquitard and inter porosity flow in the underlying aquifer if it is fractured the constant head constant head and barrier barrier wedge configurations are considered as two examples to illustrate the methodology type curves of dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity versus dimensionless time are produced for the sake of application 2 mathematical model 2 1 conceptual model the schematic representation of an unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system is shown in fig 1 the aquifer system consists of an upper unconfined aquifer and a lower aquitard model i or a lower fractured aquifer model ii bounded by two intersecting constant head or no flow boundaries the water table boundary condition neuman 1972 1974 is considered at the top of the unconfined aquifer which interacts with the underlying aquitard model i or the underlying fracture system model ii through its interface the unconfined aquifer and the underlying aquitard model i are homogeneous and of uniform thickness the underlying fractured aquifer model ii as stated by moench 1984 consists of two overlapping interacting continua a fissure system with a much higher hydraulic diffusivity and a block system with a much lower hydraulic diffusivity to model this dual continuum domain the dual porosity approach barenblatt et al 1960 deruyck et al 1982 is adopted the base of the aquifer system is impermeable to flow the 3d cylindrical coordinate system r θ z with the origin at the intersection of lateral boundaries and the initial horizontal water table is considered for the aquifer system the z axis is positive upward and the aquifer system radially extends to infinity 2 2 mathematical model to solve the mathematical model presented in this section the following assumptions are adopted 1 the pumping well is discharged at the constant rate and the flux through the well screen is uniform 2 the drawdown is much smaller than the initial aquifer thickness malama et al 2008 neuman 1972 3 unsaturated flow above the unconfined aquifer is neglected 4 both aquifer layers are horizontally isotope and homogeneous for the leaky wedge shaped aquifer case 5 the double porosity flow concept barenblatt et al 1960 is adopted to simulate the inter porosity flow in the underlying fractured aquifer for the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system 6 lateral boundaries cut both aquifer layers and the no flow boundary bounded the aquifer system from the bottom transient groundwater flow to a well in the overlying unconfined wedge shaped aquifer obeys the following governing equation samani and sedghi 2015 1 k h 1 2 s 1 r 2 1 r s 1 r 1 r 2 2 s 1 θ 2 k z 1 2 s 1 z 2 s s 1 s 1 t q r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 δ z z 0 where s 1 is the drawdown l kh 1 is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity lt 1 kz 1 is the vertical hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ss 1 is the specific storage l 1 q is the pumping rate lt 3 and is positive δ is dirac delta function with the unit of the reciprocal of parameter in the argument and r 0 θ 0 z 0 is the coordinate of the point sink the above governing equation is subjected to the following initial condition 2 s 1 r θ z 0 0 for the constant head constant head c c hereafter wedge shaped aquifer the lateral boundary conditions are 3 s 1 r 0 z t 0 4 s 1 r φ z t 0 where φ is the angle of the wedge for the barrier barrier b b hereafter wedge shaped aquifer the lateral boundary conditions become 5 s 1 r 0 t θ 0 6 s 1 r φ t θ 0 the far field boundary condition for either the c c or b b wedge shaped aquifer is 7 s 1 θ z t 0 the instantaneously drainable water table can be formulated as neuman 1974 8 k z 1 s 1 z s y s 1 t z 0 where sy is the specific yield the governing equation for the underlying fractured aquifer layer is sedghi and samani 2010 9 k h 2 2 s 2 r 2 1 r s 2 r 1 r 2 2 s 2 θ 2 k z 2 2 s 2 z 2 γ s s 2 s 2 t 0 where s 2 is the drawdown l kh 2 is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity lt 1 kz 2 the vertical hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ss 2 is the specific storage l 1 and γ is the inter porosity flow term it should be noted that at first the solution is obtained for the case with the fractured underlying aquifer then the leaky underlying aquifer case can be obtained by eliminating the inter porosity flow term from the equation the inter porosity flow term between the matrix continuum and the fractured continuum is defined as park and zhan 2003 10 γ 3 k m r m s m r r r m where km is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 of the matrix block r is the radial distance from the center of the spherical matrix l and sm is the drawdown in the rock matrix l the spherical matrix block as stated by moench 1984 is a good choice for simulating the fractured aquifer hydraulic behavior therefore it is commonly used to model inter porosity flux term as deruyck et al 1982 11 k m r 2 r r 2 s m r s sm s m t where ssm is the matrix block specific storage l 1 the initial and boundary conditions for matrix blocks are respectively 12 s m r 0 0 13 s m r m t s 2 the governing equation of eq 9 is subjected to the following initial condition 14 s 2 r θ z 0 0 the lateral boundary conditions of the wedge shaped aquifer are 15 s 2 r 0 z t 0 16 s 2 r φ z t 0 for the c c wedge shaped aquifer and 17 s 2 r 0 t θ 0 18 s 2 r φ t θ 0 for the b b wedge shaped aquifer the far field boundary condition is 19 s 2 θ z t 0 the no flow boundary condition at the base of the aquifer system is 20 s 2 z z b 2 0 where b 2 is depth of the bottom of the underlying fractured aquifer from the initial water table the following continuity equations are enforced at the interface of unconfined and fractured aquifers 21 s 1 r θ b 1 t s 2 r θ b 1 t 22 k z 1 s 1 z k z 2 s 2 z z b 1 where b 1 is the depth of the bottom of the overlying unconfined aquifer from the initial water table using the dimensionless parameters defined in table 1 the point source solution to above equations for the c c wedge shaped aquifer case can be obtained using laplace hankel and fourier transformations appendix a as 23 s d 1 n 1 8 π φ p s i n n π φ θ 0 s i n n π φ θ 0 c 1 z 0 d exp λ 1 z d ξ λ 1 ξ λ 1

with respect to z 0d one can obtain the partially penetrating pumping well solutions it is notable that by performing such an integration one has assumed that the pumping rate is uniformly distributed along the well screen this assumption becomes a fact when the well fully penetrates the pumped aquifer but is better treated as an approximation when the well is partially penetrating this is because flux across the well screen is concentrated more near the two ends of a partially penetrating well and is relatively uniform in the central section of the screen acknowledging the non uniform flux distribution along the well screen of a partially penetrating well will make the problem substantially complex as shown in many previous investigations feng and zhan 2016 wang and zhan 2017 fortunately the uniform flux assumption often works reasonably well particularly when the point of concern is not very close to the two ends of the well screen as demonstrated in many previous investigations feng and zhan 2015 zhan and zlotnik 2002 nevertheless after such an integration one obtains the solutions for the c c wedge shaped aquifer 29 s p d 1 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 d 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 d 1 s

prepare type curves utilized in section 4 eliminating the inter porosity flow from the underlying fractured aquifer the solution for the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is obtained 3 numerical evaluation in principle the time domain solution can be obtained using inverse laplace transform integral however for laplace domain solutions obtained in this work analytical inverse laplace transform is impossible due to the complexity of the solution thus the time domain dimensionless drawdown is obtained via numerical inverse laplace transform method of stehfest stehfest 1970 this stehfest program has been used in many similar studies before and is proven to be sufficiently accurate and robust moench 1995 samani et al 2006 zhan and zlotnik 2002 numerical exercises have been carried out with terms of 6 8 10 12 and 14 in the stehfest program and we conclude that the use of 6 terms in the stehfest program has generated sufficiently accurate computational results with the accuracy of about 1 percent comparing with the image well method drawdown obtained using the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm integrals with infinite upper limits in eqs 33 40 arising from hankel transformation are split into finite integrals between successive roots of bessel functions yeh and chang 2006 present a method of determining the roots of bessel functions each finite integral is calculated using gaussian quadrature michels 1963 press et al 1992 the sum of finite integrals is calculated using the ɛ series acceleration algorithm of wynn wynn 1956 the number of bessel function zeros after splitting the integrals with infinite upper limits in eqs 33 40 is usually around 110 4 results and discussion in this section some key results for the simulated wedge shaped aquifer are presented in type curves i e the dimensionless drawdown versus the dimensionless time and scaled sensitivity dimensionless time curves the default values of parameters used to construct figures are given in table 2 the influences of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities of fractures and storativity of the matrix blocks are explored for both b b and c c wedge shaped aquifers fig 2 compares type curves produced using the semi analytical method of this study and the image well method proposed by sedghi and samani 2015 for a wedge angle of 60 at the dimensionless depths z d of 0 8 and 1 6 the agreement is acceptable during all dimensionless times at two depths showing that the presented solution can successfully simulate the dimensionless drawdown in unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer systems 4 1 dimensional drawdown time curves to compare single layer leaky and unconfined fractured constant head constant head wedge shaped aquifer systems dimensional drawdown time curves are prepared fig 3 realistic parameters values of unconfined and fractured aquifers alkinani et al 2016 belcher et al 2017 kruseman et al 1994 park and zhan 2003 introduced in table 2 are used to prepare the curves the thickness of the underlying fractured aquifer increased to 50 m this increases the transmissivity of the underlying fractured aquifer to 4320 m2 day 1 that is within the range of the transmissivity of the oman fractured ophiolite macumber 2003 as illustrated in fig 3 the drawdown curve of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer deviate from that of leaky wedge shaped aquifer i e a fractured aquifer with impermeable matrix blocks from the start of pumping to about an hour after that it is due to the release of water stored in the matrix blocks furthermore the slope of the drawdown time curve of unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer is lower than that of leaky wedge shaped aquifer during the early and intermediate times after about 5 min from start of pumping the drawdown curve of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer starts to deviate from that of unbounded aquifer due to the effects of lateral constant head boundaries it should be noted that such a time of deviation increases as the distance of pumping well from the wedge apex increases comparing single layer and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifers also reveals that the drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer is lower than that of the single layer aquifer due to the release of water stored in the underlying bedrock aquifer the differences between curves are less marked in barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer figure not shown it should be noted that the duration and the amount of deviations of the drawdown time curves of various wedge shaped aquifers which are shown in fig 3 depend on aquifer parameters values to implement the effects of parameters values in drawdown and time more in depth analysis in the following sections are based on dimensionless forms 4 2 influences of kz 2 the effects of the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the underlying fractured aquifer black lines and the underlying aquitard obtained by eliminating inter porosity flow from the underlying fractured aquifer red lines on the drawdown response of the overlying unconfined aquifer are illustrated in fig 4 the default parameter values given in table 2 are used to construct fig 4 the configuration of constant head constant head lateral boundaries is considered the dimensionless drawdown response of the single layer wedge shaped aquifer with the same lateral boundaries configuration bold black line is also added to compare with the two aquifer systems fig 4 shows that increasing the kz 2 kz 1 ratio decreases the dimensionless drawdown from the early to late times as more water released from the underlying aquifer layer comparing the leaky wedge shaped aquifer red line with the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer black line reveals that the dimensionless drawdown in the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is more than that of the unconfined fractured aquifer due to release of additional water stored in the matrix blocks the early time gap between the leaky and unconfined fractured aquifer systems is widen as kz 2 kz 1 increases showing that more water is released from the matrix blocks sedghi and samani 2015 furthermore decreasing kz 2 kz 1decreases the deviation of both leaky and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifers from that of the single layer wedge shaped aquifer for kz 2 kz 1of about 10 4 this deviation becomes negligible during the intermediate time when the inter porosity flow diminishes leaky and unconfined fractured aquifer curves converge to common curves inspection of fig 4 also reveals that the dimensionless drawdown is leveled off during the late time when the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries fig 5 is constructed similar to fig 4 but for a wedge angle φ of about 12 comparing figs 4 and 5 reveals that decreasing the wedge angle decreases the deviation of leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer the deviation of unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the single layer wedge shaped aquifer is also decreased this is due to the fact that the lower the wedge angle is the sooner the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries thus the smaller contribution of the underlying aquifer to the pumpage figs 6 and 7 are prepared similarly to figs 4 and 5 respectively for the barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer the effects of inter porosity flow on reducing the dimensionless drawdown during the early and intermediate times are evident in figs 6 and 7 as in figs 4 and 5 moreover comparing figs 6 and 7 with figs 4 and 5 one can see that the deviation of the dimensionless drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system from that of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is more significant in the b b wedge shaped aquifer interestingly decreasing the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer increases the deviation of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system this is due to the fact that the lateral barrier boundaries do not recharge aquifer as the cone of depression reaches there thus increasing the contribution of water stored in matrix blocks to the pumpage the effects of kz 2 are further investigated using the scaled sensitivity generally the lateral boundaries configuration affects the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system to show these effects the scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown is calculated as huang and yeh 2007 41 s pi p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where spi is the scaled sensitivity pi is the input parameter e g ssm o is the output function of the system e g s p d 1 and δ p i is the parameter increment that may be calculated as δ p i 10 p i it should be noted that the absolute sensitivity is calculated in this work to avoid negative values the effects of lateral boundary type and wedge angle on the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the fractures kz 2 are shown in fig 8 the sensitivity of drawdown to kz 2 for the b b wedge shaped red lines the c c wedge shaped black lines and the horizontally infinite bold black line unconfined fractured aquifer systems are compared fig 8 shows that the sensitivity of drawdown to kzf increases during the early time levels off during the intermediate time and rises again during the late time it reaches an asymptote after the dimensionless time of about 104 careful inspection of fig 8 reveals that the sensitivity of the drawdown of the b b c c wedge shaped aquifer system to kzf is higher lower than that of the horizontally infinite unconfined fractured aquifer system during the early and late times for the case with the wedge angle of 12 this is due to the fact that for the cases in which the wedge angle is as low as of 12 the lateral boundaries affect the dimensionless drawdown during both early and late times sedghi et al 2009 in fact as the drawdown cone reaches the constant head lateral boundaries they recharge the aquifer and reduce the vertical component of flow therefore the sensitivity to kzf decreases the barrier lateral boundaries however do not recharge the aquifer and this increases the depletion of the underlying fracture aquifer during the periods when the cone of depression reaches the lateral boundaries interestingly the sensitivity to kzf for the b b wedge shaped aquifer system is less than the horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifer systems during the intermediate time when the water table drainage dominates this is due to the fact that the main source of water during the intermediate time is water table drainage as the area of the cone of depression of the b b wedge shaped aquifer is larger than that of horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifer the downward flow to the pumping well is more significant there and this reduces the sensitivity of the drawdown to kzf for the c c wedge shaped aquifer system the higher hydraulic diffusivity of the underlying fractured aquifer comparing to that of the overlying unconfined aquifer and the lateral constant head recharging boundaries increase the upward flow to the pumping well and subsequently increases the sensitivity of drawdown to kzf 4 3 influences of kh 2 to explore the effects of kh 2 kh 1 fig 9 is constructed the c c wedge shaped aquifer is considered and other parameters are set to default values table 2 inspecting fig 9 reveals that increasing kh 2 kh 1 decreases the early and intermediate time dimensionless drawdown of both unconfined fractured black lines and leaky red lines wedge shaped aquifer systems it should be noted that increasing kz 2 kz 1 has the same effects fig 4 in contrast to the effects of increasing kz 2 kz 1 which increases the deviation of an unconfined fractured black lines fig 4 from a leaky wedge shaped aquifer red lines fig 4 at the early and intermediate times increasing kh 2 kh 1 reduces this deviation fig 9 at the kh 2 kh 1 of about 102 the deviation becomes insignificant at the early and intermediate times reflecting the fact that the inter porosity flow diminishes considerably during those times in fact increasing the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the underlying aquifer increases the horizontal diffusivity of this aquifer therefore the cone of depression expands to the lateral constant head boundaries faster thus significantly reducing the contribution of inerter porosity flow to pumpage during the late time when the effects of inter porosity flow disappear the drawdowns of the unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer coincide and follow the same trend along a common asymptote furthermore at the kh 2 kh 1 of 10 2 the effects of the underlying aquifer diminish during the late time and the drawdowns of the two layer wedge shaped aquifer systems coincide with those of a single layer wedge shaped aquifer to test the effects of the wedge angle on the dimensionless drawdown for different kh 2 kh 1 fig 10 is prepared similarly as fig 9 but for a wedge angle of 12 comparing figs 10 and 9 demonstrates that the early and intermediate time gap between the unconfined fractured black lines and leaky wedge shaped aquifer red lines decreases as the wedge angle decreases at the kh 2 kh 1 of 102 they follow a common asymptote from early to late times fig 10 the effects of kh 2 kh 1 on the dimensionless drawdown for the b b wedge shaped aquifer are shown in fig 11 for ϕ 52 â and fig 12 for ϕ 12 â figs 11 and 12 follow the overall trend as figs 9 and 10 during the early and intermediate times however during the late time when the effects of barrier lateral boundaries dominate the dimensionless drawdowns rise figs 11 and 12 in these cases as in the c c wedge shaped case the late time deviation of the two layer wedge shaped aquifer from the single layer one becomes insignificant at the kh 2 kh 1 of 10 2 to explore the effects of the wedge angle on sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of fractures fig 13 is prepared this figure illustrates that the sensitivity of the c c wedge shaped aquifer system drawdowns to kh 2 red lines is more significant during the early time comparing to the b b wedge shaped aquifer systems black lines during the same time this is due to the fact that kh 2 as well as kh 1 affects the resistance to flow in the underlying fractured aquifer from the lateral constant head boundary toward the pumping the barrier lateral boundaries reduce the horizontal flow in the underlying fractured aquifer in the b b wedge shaped aquifer during the early time leading to lower sensitivity to kh 2 for this case as stated by butler and mcelwee 1990 sensitivity of the drawdown to the transmissivity of a hydraulic zone continue to increase as long as the cone of depression is within that zone it is leveled off at the value that is proportional to the size of the hydraulic zone when the hydraulic gradient reaches a constant value there butler and mcelwee 1990 in the c c wedge shaped aquifer the hydraulic gradient within the underlying fractured aquifer stabilizes during the late time when the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries thus the scaled sensitivity reaches a plateau during the late time fig 13 black lines the value that the scaled sensitivity is stabilized is proportional to the wedge angle this is due to the fact that the area of the cone of depression decreases as the wedge angle decreases in the c c wedge shaped aquifer for the b b wedge shaped aquifer however the late time scaled sensitivity is not stabilized as the hydraulic gradient continues to increase fig 13 red lines furthermore the late time scaled sensitivity is inversely proportional to the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer owing to the fact that the rate of expansion of the cone of depression increases as the wedge angle decreases 4 4 influences of ssm to illustrate the effects of ssm ssu on the dimensionless drawdown fig 14 is prepared the c c wedge shaped aquifer is considered and the other parameters are set to default values table 2 as it is depicted in fig 14 increasing ratio of ssm ssu decreases the dimsionless drawdow during the early and intermediate times when the water stored in the matrix blocks is released sedghi and samani 2015 the same trend is also seen in fig 15 prepared for a wedge angle of 12 the drawdow platue and the inter porosity flow diminish during the late time as the effects of constant head lateral boundaries dominate figs 14 and 15 figs 16 and 17 are prepared similarly as figs 14 and 15 but for the b b wedge shaped aquifer the same trend as figs 14 and 15 is seen in figs 16 and 17 during the early and intermediate times during the late time however the dimensionless drawdown curve of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system with a ssm ssu of 250 does not converge to the leaky wedge shaped aquifer drawdown curve figs 16 and 17 such results may atribute to the fact that the no flow lateral boundaries do not contribute to pumpage and an elevated ssm ssu ratio increases the intensity and duration of the inter porosity flow thus affects the late time dimensionless drawdown to examine the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the matrix block specific storage fig 18 is constructed similarly as figs 8 and 13 generally the b b wedge shaped aquifer red lines is more sensitive to ssm comparing to the horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifers black lines the sensitivity of the c c unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer increases during the early time when the water released from the matrix blocks starts to affect the dimensionless drawdown of the overlying unconfined aquifer and such a sensitivity reaches its peak during the intermediate time when the inter porosity flow dominates once the drawdown cone reaches the lateral constant head boundaries the scaled sensitivity to ssm starts to decrease the lower the wedge angle is the sooner the drawdown cone reaches the lateral boundaries and sooner for the sensitivity to ssm to decrease after reaching the peak this is analogue to the results reported by butler and mcelwee 1990 which investigated the sensitivity of the drawdown of a radially symmetric heterogeneous aquifer to storativity for the horizontally infinite unconfined fractured aquifer system bold black line however the scaled sensitivity maintains its maximum magnitude during the late time reflecting the phenomenon that the matrix block affects the dimensionless drawdown during the late time similar statement has been made by mcelwee and yukler 1978 for horizontally infinite homogeneous aquifers for the b b unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer as the lateral barrier boundaries greatly influence the dimensionless drawdown the late time sensitivity increases and levels off at the values inversely proportional to the wedge angle this is quite different from what has been seen in a horizontally infinite homogenous aquifer in which the late time sensitivity is lower than that of b b wedge shaped aquifer as illustrated in fig 18 the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown of the c c wedge shaped aquifer to ssm is very low during the late time this increases the ssm uncertainty in parameter estimation process using the collected drawdown data to increase the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to ssm the variable rate pumping test is suggested butler and mcelwee 1990 to test the effects of step increase in pumping rate on the scaled sensitivity to ssm fig 19 is prepared the pumping rate increases by 50 dash line and 100 dotted line at the dimensionless time t d of 10 and 100 respectively the superposition principle is followed to obtain scaled sensitivity increasing the pumping rate increases the scaled sensitivity to ssm proportional to the amount of pumping rate variation fig 19 this is explained by butler and mcelwee 1990 when investigating the sensitivity of drawdown to transmissivity and storativity of radially symmetric non uniform aquifers they stated that each time the pumping rate is increased a new cone of depression superimposed on the original one propagate out from the pumping well and producing an increase in sensitivity for more information on the pattern of pumping to achieve the maximum sensitivity to a hydraulic parameter of concern i e transmissivity or storativity one may consult butler and mcelwee 1990 5 discussion of parameter estimation and non uniqueness issue one can see that the developed mathematical model involves a total of nine hydraulic parameters in addition to several geometric parameters these include kh1 kz1 ss1 sy for the overlying unconfined aquifer kh2 kz2 ss2 for the underlying fractured aquifer km rm for the matrix block if one wants to conduct a full scale inversion for all nine parameters simply based on type curves generated from observed drawdown data non uniqueness of the estimated parameters is going to be a challenging issue as often seen in inversion of similar hydrological systems carrera and neuman 1986 carrera et al 2005 yeh et al 2015 the use of dimensionless terms in this study will reduce the number of parameters involved in the mathematical model and can recover some characteristic properties represented in dimensionless numbers the other benefit of nondimensionalization is to resolve the parameter correlation problem however even with this effort one usually still cannot completely resolve the non uniqueness issue of the parameter estimation with so many parameters involved in the mathematical model therefore it is tantamount to determine a subset of the involved parameters before the full inversion and this can be done using additional pumping tests described as follows if a pumping test is conducted with a pumping well that is only partially penetrating the upper unconfined aquifer with a nearby multi level observation well that is also only penetrating the upper unconfined aquifer the early stage drawdown should have negligible influence from the upper water table boundary and the lower fractured aquifer this can be attributed to two reasons first the drop of water table at the upper boundary is usually delayed partially because of the capillary force above the water table neuman 1972 1974 moench 1995 second the unpumped fractured aquifer can only release a very small amount of water to the upper pumped unconfined aquifer at the early stage of pumping due to the limited storage capacity of the fractures although the storage capacity of the rock matrix could be considerable release of water from the rock matrix takes much longer time so its effect will not appear at the early stage of pumping in the unconfined aquifer therefore one may obtain kh1 kz1 ss1 from this test the horizontal radial distance between the multi level observation well and the pumping well should be much less than 1 5b 1 where b 1 is the pre pumping saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer bear 1979 the reason to set the observation well much less than 1 5b 1 is to record the vertical flow effect which is usually negligible when r 1 5b 1 the use of multi level observation well is to measure drawdown at different depths at a given location such an instrument is necessary to obtain an accurate estimation of the vertical hydraulic conductivity kz1 if a multi level observation well is not available then two or more observation wells taping at different depths can serve the same purpose furthermore if the pumping well and the observation well screened in the deeper part of the unconfined c c wedge shaped aquifer the intermediate time drawdown is more valuable to estimate the storativity of the matrix blocks sm fig 18 and the fractures ss2 figure not shown with above preparation one only have four more parameters sy km kh2 and kz2 to be determined all these four parameters are reflection of aquifer response after a sufficiently long time of pumping figs 8 and 13 because it takes time for water to be released from the vadose zone above the water table and from the rock matrix thus one should focus on analyzing the drawdown at the late stage non uniqueness issue of parameter estimation should be much easier to handle for such a four parameter problem for instance the release of water from the upper unconfined aquifer because of falling of the water table containing the information of sy will result in a downward flux across the interface of the upper and lower aquifers thus the effect of sy may be detected by installing observation wells at different depths for instance at both the upper unconfined aquifer and the lower fractured aquifer on the other hand the effect of inter porosity flux or the fracture matrix water exchange as reflected in km sm through eq 10 does not depends on the depth moreover variable rate pumping test can increase the sensitivity of drawdown to hydraulic parameters fig 19 hence the non uniqueness issue becomes less likely randomly variable rate pumping test also reduces the parameter correlation butler and mcelwee 1990 6 summary and conclusion new laplace domain solutions of flow to a well in an unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system is obtained both c c and b b wedge shaped aquifers are considered eliminating the inter porosity flow from the underlying fractured aquifer the solutions reduce to that for an aquifer aquitard wedge shaped aquifer system the developed solutions are used to analyze the dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity of the wedge shaped aquifer system the following conclusions can be drawn 1 decreasing kz 2 kz 1 decreases the deviation of both leaky and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifers from that of a single layer wedge shaped aquifer when the kz 2 kz 1 value reduces to about 10 4 this deviation becomes insignificant decreasing the wedge angle decreases the deviation of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer the deviation of unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the single layer wedge shaped aquifer is also decreased 2 deviation of the dimensionless drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system from that of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is more significant in the b b wedge shaped aquifer interestingly decreasing the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer increases the deviation of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system 3 the sensitivity of the drawdown of the b b c c wedge shaped aquifer system to kzf is higher lower than that of the horizontally infinite unconfined fractured aquifer during the early and late times for the case with a wedge angle of 12 increasing kh 2 kh 1 reduces the deviation of drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system from that of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer at the kh 2 kh 1 of about 102 the early and intermediate time deviation becomes insignificant reflecting the phenomenon that the inter porosity flow diminishes considerably 4 in the c c wedge shaped aquifer the hydraulic gradient within the underlying fractured aquifer stabilizes during the late time when the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries thus the scaled sensitivity reaches a plateau during the late time the value that the scaled sensitivity is stabilized is proportional to the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer the late time scaled sensitivity is not stabilized as the hydraulic gradient continues to increase furthermore the late time scaled sensitivity is inversely proportional to the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer the b b wedge shaped aquifer is more sensitive to ssm comparing to horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifers 5 step increase in the discharge rate increases the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to ssm in the c c wedge shaped aquifers

6908,wedge shaped aquifers are usually formed where two linear boundaries intersect these types of aquifers are commonly seen in river basins and alluvial fans but have received much less attention in the hydrological sciences community fundamental understanding of the effects of lateral boundaries on the hydrodynamic process in such aquifers is quite poor particularly for unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer systems which will be the concern of this study solutions of flow to a well in an unconfined fractured wedge shaped two aquifer system are obtained using laplace hankel and fourier transforms an infinitesimal radius pumping well partially penetrates the overlying unconfined aquifer both aquifer layers are homogeneous and anisotropic bounded by two intersecting linear lateral boundaries of constant head or barrier types and the aquifer system is semi infinite in radial direction the time domain drawdowns are obtained via the stehfest algorithm and gaussian quadrature the inter porosity flow in the underlying fracture aquifer the instantaneous water table drainage the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and the wedge angle are taken into account eliminating the inter porosity flow in the underlying fractured aquifer the presented solution reduces to a leaky wedge shaped aquifer case the influences of the underlying fractured aquifer hydraulic parameters on the overlying unconfined aquifer for different wedge angles and linear lateral boundaries types are explored using dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity curves the results of this study can be utilized to obtain hydraulic parameters of an alluvial and river basin unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer systems the presented solution can also be used for

wedge angle 1 introduction wedge shaped aquifers are usually formed where two boundaries intersect these aquifers are commonly seen in river basins lambs 2004 yeh and chang 2006 and alluvial fans samani and sedghi 2015 yeh and chang 2006 unfortunately these types of aquifers have received much less attention in the hydrological science community and many fundamental effects of lateral boundaries on the hydrodynamic processes associated with such aquifers are either unknown or poorly described pumping tests which have been used successfully for obtaining aquifer parameters in horizontally infinite aquifers are natural choices for determining hydraulic characteristics of wedge shaped aquifers however if the drawdown cone expands to lateral boundaries the analytical models for horizontally infinite aquifers are no longer valid for wedge shaped aquifers in these cases the models considering the intersecting lateral boundaries are suggested samani and sedghi 2015 sedghi and samani 2010 sedghi et al 2009 2012 yeh and chang 2006 yeh et al 2008 such analytical models are indispensable for parameter estimations of wedge shaped aquifers and also for benchmarking numerical solutions involving groundwater pumping in such aquifers unfortunately there are relatively few analytical works on wedge shaped aquifers chan et al 1978 developed the first solution of flow to a well in an artesian wedge shaped aquifer they used hankel and fourier sine transformations to obtain their solution although their approach removed the image well method limitations chan et al 1978 yeh and chang 2006 its applications were limited to two dimensional 2d confined single layered wedge shaped aquifers bounded by constant head boundaries the same aquifer configuration was considered by yeh and chang 2006 which considered the spatial variations of the lateral boundaries head and showed that the chan et al 1978 solution was a special case of their solution they also used the shank transformation shanks 1955 to accelerate convergence of series appeared in their solutions in an effort to obtain three dimensional 3d solution of groundwater flow to a well in confined and unconfined wedge shaped aquifer sedghi et al 2009 utilized the laplace and fourier transformations they investigated the effects of different geometrical and hydraulic parameters on dimensionless drawdown and stream depletion rate sedghi and samani 2010 adopted a double porosity concept presented by barenblatt et al 1960 to analytically model the dimensionless drawdown in a fractured wedge shaped aquifer they considered barrier barrier constant head barrier and constant head constant head wedge configurations the inter porosity concept barenblatt et al 1960 is not adopted by barker 1988 to develop analytical solutions of flow to a well for arbitrary flow dimensions his solution is however applicable in fractured aquifer well test among other applications but the physical interpretation of flow dimension is unclear in fractured aquifer cases barker 1988 the flow dimensions are interpreted by bowman et al 2013 for the fractured media the effects of hydraulic conductivity specific storage and geometry of matrix blocks on the flow dimension are not investigated in their work as their interpretations are not based on inter porosity concept presented by barenblatt et al 1960 leakage from the bottom of an unconfined wedge shaped aquifer was considered in the analytical solution presented by sedghi et al 2012 they used the fourier series suggested by ozisik 2013 to derive the solution and to obtain time domain drawdown using stehfest stehfest 1970 algorithm for inverse laplace transform the horizontal component of flow in the aquitard was not considered by sedghi et al 2012 such a flow component may be significant near the pumping well or stream aquifer interface a patchy wedge shaped aquifer with radial heterogeneity was analytically modeled by samani and sedghi 2015 which also generalized their solution for a multi zone wedge shaped aquifer case all above mentioned solutions only considered single layer wedge shaped aquifers multi layer wedge shaped aquifers have rarely been investigated up to present unconfined aquifers are sometimes underlain by an aquitard malama et al 2007 2008 wagner 2011 this hydrogeological setting may occur in alluvial fans as well in fact one of the most important characteristics of alluvial fans is coarsing or fining upward sequences due to climate variation tectonics and sedimentological processes maliva 2016 that may cause layering of the aquifer for example layered alluvial fan aquifers were reported in zagros and alborz mountains groundwater provinces of iran issar 1969 unconfined fractured aquifer systems were also not uncommon in horizontally infinite aquifers al shaibani 2008 sedghi and samani 2015 wagner 2011 alluvial fans maliva and missimer 2012 or near anticlines 180 wedge aquifers issar 1969 alluvial fans especially those that form in basins with low tectonic activity are wedge shaped in planer and cross sectional view spherical wedge in basins with high tectonic activity however thick alluvial fans with steep margin due to high angle faults can form in cylindrical wedge blair 1987 this condition is the most favorable condition for development of large alluvial fans blair and mcpherson 2009 thick aquifers that are formed in these fans tectonic valleys may recharge the underlying bedrock as in great basin usa belcher et al 2017 fetter 2000 another example is the batina plain aquifer in the sultanate of oman underlain by tertiary limestone aquifer extending inland to the foothills of northern oman mountains young et al 1998 this aquifer can be considered as the wedge shaped aquifer near the mountain range in above mentioned cases the underlying aquifer provides an extra source of water for the overlying pumped aquifer thus the single layer conceptual model is no longer valid sedghi and samani 2015 instead one has to consider water exchange or leaking between the underlying and overlying aquifers up to date many analytical and semi analytical solutions have been developed for groundwater flow in leaky aquifer aquitard systems hantush 1959 1960 hantush and jacob 1955 hunt 2005 malama et al 2007 2008 neuman and witherspoon 1969 sun and zhan 2006 zhan and bian 2006 zhan and park 2003 and unconfined fractured aquifer systems sedghi and samani 2015 unfortunately none of them can be applied for wedge shaped aquifers the objective of this study is to develop solutions for flow to a well in an unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer system the laplace hankel domain solutions of flow to a partially penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer aquitard and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer systems are obtained the solutions take into account the instantaneous drainage of water table anisotropy in both aquifers horizontal and vertical flows in the unconfined aquifer and the underlying aquitard and inter porosity flow in the underlying aquifer if it is fractured the constant head constant head and barrier barrier wedge configurations are considered as two examples to illustrate the methodology type curves of dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity versus dimensionless time are produced for the sake of application 2 mathematical model 2 1 conceptual model the schematic representation of an unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system is shown in fig 1 the aquifer system consists of an upper unconfined aquifer and a lower aquitard model i or a lower fractured aquifer model ii bounded by two intersecting constant head or no flow boundaries the water table boundary condition neuman 1972 1974 is considered at the top of the unconfined aquifer which interacts with the underlying aquitard model i or the underlying fracture system model ii through its interface the unconfined aquifer and the underlying aquitard model i are homogeneous and of uniform thickness the underlying fractured aquifer model ii as stated by moench 1984 consists of two overlapping interacting continua a fissure system with a much higher hydraulic diffusivity and a block system with a much lower hydraulic diffusivity to model this dual continuum domain the dual porosity approach barenblatt et al 1960 deruyck et al 1982 is adopted the base of the aquifer system is impermeable to flow the 3d cylindrical coordinate system r θ z with the origin at the intersection of lateral boundaries and the initial horizontal water table is considered for the aquifer system the z axis is positive upward and the aquifer system radially extends to infinity 2 2 mathematical model to solve the mathematical model presented in this section the following assumptions are adopted 1 the pumping well is discharged at the constant rate and the flux through the well screen is uniform 2 the drawdown is much smaller than the initial aquifer thickness malama et al 2008 neuman 1972 3 unsaturated flow above the unconfined aquifer is neglected 4 both aquifer layers are horizontally isotope and homogeneous for the leaky wedge shaped aquifer case 5 the double porosity flow concept barenblatt et al 1960 is adopted to simulate the inter porosity flow in the underlying fractured aquifer for the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system 6 lateral boundaries cut both aquifer layers and the no flow boundary bounded the aquifer system from the bottom transient groundwater flow to a well in the overlying unconfined wedge shaped aquifer obeys the following governing equation samani and sedghi 2015 1 k h 1 2 s 1 r 2 1 r s 1 r 1 r 2 2 s 1 θ 2 k z 1 2 s 1 z 2 s s 1 s 1 t q r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 δ z z 0 where s 1 is the drawdown l kh 1 is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity lt 1 kz 1 is the vertical hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ss 1 is the specific storage l 1 q is the pumping rate lt 3 and is positive δ is dirac delta function with the unit of the reciprocal of parameter in the argument and r 0 θ 0 z 0 is the coordinate of the point sink the above governing equation is subjected to the following initial condition 2 s 1 r θ z 0 0 for the constant head constant head c c hereafter wedge shaped aquifer the lateral boundary conditions are 3 s 1 r 0 z t 0 4 s 1 r φ z t 0 where φ is the angle of the wedge for the barrier barrier b b hereafter wedge shaped aquifer the lateral boundary conditions become 5 s 1 r 0 t θ 0 6 s 1 r φ t θ 0 the far field boundary condition for either the c c or b b wedge shaped aquifer is 7 s 1 θ z t 0 the instantaneously drainable water table can be formulated as neuman 1974 8 k z 1 s 1 z s y s 1 t z 0 where sy is the specific yield the governing equation for the underlying fractured aquifer layer is sedghi and samani 2010 9 k h 2 2 s 2 r 2 1 r s 2 r 1 r 2 2 s 2 θ 2 k z 2 2 s 2 z 2 γ s s 2 s 2 t 0 where s 2 is the drawdown l kh 2 is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity lt 1 kz 2 the vertical hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ss 2 is the specific storage l 1 and γ is the inter porosity flow term it should be noted that at first the solution is obtained for the case with the fractured underlying aquifer then the leaky underlying aquifer case can be obtained by eliminating the inter porosity flow term from the equation the inter porosity flow term between the matrix continuum and the fractured continuum is defined as park and zhan 2003 10 γ 3 k m r m s m r r r m where km is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 of the matrix block r is the radial distance from the center of the spherical matrix l and sm is the drawdown in the rock matrix l the spherical matrix block as stated by moench 1984 is a good choice for simulating the fractured aquifer hydraulic behavior therefore it is commonly used to model inter porosity flux term as deruyck et al 1982 11 k m r 2 r r 2 s m r s sm s m t where ssm is the matrix block specific storage l 1 the initial and boundary conditions for matrix blocks are respectively 12 s m r 0 0 13 s m r m t s 2 the governing equation of eq 9 is subjected to the following initial condition 14 s 2 r θ z 0 0 the lateral boundary conditions of the wedge shaped aquifer are 15 s 2 r 0 z t 0 16 s 2 r φ z t 0 for the c c wedge shaped aquifer and 17 s 2 r 0 t θ 0 18 s 2 r φ t θ 0 for the b b wedge shaped aquifer the far field boundary condition is 19 s 2 θ z t 0 the no flow boundary condition at the base of the aquifer system is 20 s 2 z z b 2 0 where b 2 is depth of the bottom of the underlying fractured aquifer from the initial water table the following continuity equations are enforced at the interface of unconfined and fractured aquifers 21 s 1 r θ b 1 t s 2 r θ b 1 t 22 k z 1 s 1 z k z 2 s 2 z z b 1 where b 1 is the depth of the bottom of the overlying unconfined aquifer from the initial water table using the dimensionless parameters defined in table 1 the point source solution to above equations for the c c wedge shaped aquifer case can be obtained using laplace hankel and fourier transformations appendix a as 23 s d 1 n 1 8 π φ p s i n n π φ θ 0 s i n n π φ θ 0 c 1 z 0 d exp λ 1 z d ξ λ 1 ξ λ 1

with respect to z 0d one can obtain the partially penetrating pumping well solutions it is notable that by performing such an integration one has assumed that the pumping rate is uniformly distributed along the well screen this assumption becomes a fact when the well fully penetrates the pumped aquifer but is better treated as an approximation when the well is partially penetrating this is because flux across the well screen is concentrated more near the two ends of a partially penetrating well and is relatively uniform in the central section of the screen acknowledging the non uniform flux distribution along the well screen of a partially penetrating well will make the problem substantially complex as shown in many previous investigations feng and zhan 2016 wang and zhan 2017 fortunately the uniform flux assumption often works reasonably well particularly when the point of concern is not very close to the two ends of the well screen as demonstrated in many previous investigations feng and zhan 2015 zhan and zlotnik 2002 nevertheless after such an integration one obtains the solutions for the c c wedge shaped aquifer 29 s p d 1 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 d 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 d 1 s

prepare type curves utilized in section 4 eliminating the inter porosity flow from the underlying fractured aquifer the solution for the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is obtained 3 numerical evaluation in principle the time domain solution can be obtained using inverse laplace transform integral however for laplace domain solutions obtained in this work analytical inverse laplace transform is impossible due to the complexity of the solution thus the time domain dimensionless drawdown is obtained via numerical inverse laplace transform method of stehfest stehfest 1970 this stehfest program has been used in many similar studies before and is proven to be sufficiently accurate and robust moench 1995 samani et al 2006 zhan and zlotnik 2002 numerical exercises have been carried out with terms of 6 8 10 12 and 14 in the stehfest program and we conclude that the use of 6 terms in the stehfest program has generated sufficiently accurate computational results with the accuracy of about 1 percent comparing with the image well method drawdown obtained using the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm integrals with infinite upper limits in eqs 33 40 arising from hankel transformation are split into finite integrals between successive roots of bessel functions yeh and chang 2006 present a method of determining the roots of bessel functions each finite integral is calculated using gaussian quadrature michels 1963 press et al 1992 the sum of finite integrals is calculated using the ɛ series acceleration algorithm of wynn wynn 1956 the number of bessel function zeros after splitting the integrals with infinite upper limits in eqs 33 40 is usually around 110 4 results and discussion in this section some key results for the simulated wedge shaped aquifer are presented in type curves i e the dimensionless drawdown versus the dimensionless time and scaled sensitivity dimensionless time curves the default values of parameters used to construct figures are given in table 2 the influences of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities of fractures and storativity of the matrix blocks are explored for both b b and c c wedge shaped aquifers fig 2 compares type curves produced using the semi analytical method of this study and the image well method proposed by sedghi and samani 2015 for a wedge angle of 60 at the dimensionless depths z d of 0 8 and 1 6 the agreement is acceptable during all dimensionless times at two depths showing that the presented solution can successfully simulate the dimensionless drawdown in unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer systems 4 1 dimensional drawdown time curves to compare single layer leaky and unconfined fractured constant head constant head wedge shaped aquifer systems dimensional drawdown time curves are prepared fig 3 realistic parameters values of unconfined and fractured aquifers alkinani et al 2016 belcher et al 2017 kruseman et al 1994 park and zhan 2003 introduced in table 2 are used to prepare the curves the thickness of the underlying fractured aquifer increased to 50 m this increases the transmissivity of the underlying fractured aquifer to 4320 m2 day 1 that is within the range of the transmissivity of the oman fractured ophiolite macumber 2003 as illustrated in fig 3 the drawdown curve of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer deviate from that of leaky wedge shaped aquifer i e a fractured aquifer with impermeable matrix blocks from the start of pumping to about an hour after that it is due to the release of water stored in the matrix blocks furthermore the slope of the drawdown time curve of unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer is lower than that of leaky wedge shaped aquifer during the early and intermediate times after about 5 min from start of pumping the drawdown curve of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer starts to deviate from that of unbounded aquifer due to the effects of lateral constant head boundaries it should be noted that such a time of deviation increases as the distance of pumping well from the wedge apex increases comparing single layer and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifers also reveals that the drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer is lower than that of the single layer aquifer due to the release of water stored in the underlying bedrock aquifer the differences between curves are less marked in barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer figure not shown it should be noted that the duration and the amount of deviations of the drawdown time curves of various wedge shaped aquifers which are shown in fig 3 depend on aquifer parameters values to implement the effects of parameters values in drawdown and time more in depth analysis in the following sections are based on dimensionless forms 4 2 influences of kz 2 the effects of the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the underlying fractured aquifer black lines and the underlying aquitard obtained by eliminating inter porosity flow from the underlying fractured aquifer red lines on the drawdown response of the overlying unconfined aquifer are illustrated in fig 4 the default parameter values given in table 2 are used to construct fig 4 the configuration of constant head constant head lateral boundaries is considered the dimensionless drawdown response of the single layer wedge shaped aquifer with the same lateral boundaries configuration bold black line is also added to compare with the two aquifer systems fig 4 shows that increasing the kz 2 kz 1 ratio decreases the dimensionless drawdown from the early to late times as more water released from the underlying aquifer layer comparing the leaky wedge shaped aquifer red line with the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer black line reveals that the dimensionless drawdown in the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is more than that of the unconfined fractured aquifer due to release of additional water stored in the matrix blocks the early time gap between the leaky and unconfined fractured aquifer systems is widen as kz 2 kz 1 increases showing that more water is released from the matrix blocks sedghi and samani 2015 furthermore decreasing kz 2 kz 1decreases the deviation of both leaky and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifers from that of the single layer wedge shaped aquifer for kz 2 kz 1of about 10 4 this deviation becomes negligible during the intermediate time when the inter porosity flow diminishes leaky and unconfined fractured aquifer curves converge to common curves inspection of fig 4 also reveals that the dimensionless drawdown is leveled off during the late time when the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries fig 5 is constructed similar to fig 4 but for a wedge angle φ of about 12 comparing figs 4 and 5 reveals that decreasing the wedge angle decreases the deviation of leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer the deviation of unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the single layer wedge shaped aquifer is also decreased this is due to the fact that the lower the wedge angle is the sooner the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries thus the smaller contribution of the underlying aquifer to the pumpage figs 6 and 7 are prepared similarly to figs 4 and 5 respectively for the barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer the effects of inter porosity flow on reducing the dimensionless drawdown during the early and intermediate times are evident in figs 6 and 7 as in figs 4 and 5 moreover comparing figs 6 and 7 with figs 4 and 5 one can see that the deviation of the dimensionless drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system from that of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is more significant in the b b wedge shaped aquifer interestingly decreasing the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer increases the deviation of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system this is due to the fact that the lateral barrier boundaries do not recharge aquifer as the cone of depression reaches there thus increasing the contribution of water stored in matrix blocks to the pumpage the effects of kz 2 are further investigated using the scaled sensitivity generally the lateral boundaries configuration affects the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system to show these effects the scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown is calculated as huang and yeh 2007 41 s pi p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where spi is the scaled sensitivity pi is the input parameter e g ssm o is the output function of the system e g s p d 1 and δ p i is the parameter increment that may be calculated as δ p i 10 p i it should be noted that the absolute sensitivity is calculated in this work to avoid negative values the effects of lateral boundary type and wedge angle on the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the fractures kz 2 are shown in fig 8 the sensitivity of drawdown to kz 2 for the b b wedge shaped red lines the c c wedge shaped black lines and the horizontally infinite bold black line unconfined fractured aquifer systems are compared fig 8 shows that the sensitivity of drawdown to kzf increases during the early time levels off during the intermediate time and rises again during the late time it reaches an asymptote after the dimensionless time of about 104 careful inspection of fig 8 reveals that the sensitivity of the drawdown of the b b c c wedge shaped aquifer system to kzf is higher lower than that of the horizontally infinite unconfined fractured aquifer system during the early and late times for the case with the wedge angle of 12 this is due to the fact that for the cases in which the wedge angle is as low as of 12 the lateral boundaries affect the dimensionless drawdown during both early and late times sedghi et al 2009 in fact as the drawdown cone reaches the constant head lateral boundaries they recharge the aquifer and reduce the vertical component of flow therefore the sensitivity to kzf decreases the barrier lateral boundaries however do not recharge the aquifer and this increases the depletion of the underlying fracture aquifer during the periods when the cone of depression reaches the lateral boundaries interestingly the sensitivity to kzf for the b b wedge shaped aquifer system is less than the horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifer systems during the intermediate time when the water table drainage dominates this is due to the fact that the main source of water during the intermediate time is water table drainage as the area of the cone of depression of the b b wedge shaped aquifer is larger than that of horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifer the downward flow to the pumping well is more significant there and this reduces the sensitivity of the drawdown to kzf for the c c wedge shaped aquifer system the higher hydraulic diffusivity of the underlying fractured aquifer comparing to that of the overlying unconfined aquifer and the lateral constant head recharging boundaries increase the upward flow to the pumping well and subsequently increases the sensitivity of drawdown to kzf 4 3 influences of kh 2 to explore the effects of kh 2 kh 1 fig 9 is constructed the c c wedge shaped aquifer is considered and other parameters are set to default values table 2 inspecting fig 9 reveals that increasing kh 2 kh 1 decreases the early and intermediate time dimensionless drawdown of both unconfined fractured black lines and leaky red lines wedge shaped aquifer systems it should be noted that increasing kz 2 kz 1 has the same effects fig 4 in contrast to the effects of increasing kz 2 kz 1 which increases the deviation of an unconfined fractured black lines fig 4 from a leaky wedge shaped aquifer red lines fig 4 at the early and intermediate times increasing kh 2 kh 1 reduces this deviation fig 9 at the kh 2 kh 1 of about 102 the deviation becomes insignificant at the early and intermediate times reflecting the fact that the inter porosity flow diminishes considerably during those times in fact increasing the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the underlying aquifer increases the horizontal diffusivity of this aquifer therefore the cone of depression expands to the lateral constant head boundaries faster thus significantly reducing the contribution of inerter porosity flow to pumpage during the late time when the effects of inter porosity flow disappear the drawdowns of the unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer coincide and follow the same trend along a common asymptote furthermore at the kh 2 kh 1 of 10 2 the effects of the underlying aquifer diminish during the late time and the drawdowns of the two layer wedge shaped aquifer systems coincide with those of a single layer wedge shaped aquifer to test the effects of the wedge angle on the dimensionless drawdown for different kh 2 kh 1 fig 10 is prepared similarly as fig 9 but for a wedge angle of 12 comparing figs 10 and 9 demonstrates that the early and intermediate time gap between the unconfined fractured black lines and leaky wedge shaped aquifer red lines decreases as the wedge angle decreases at the kh 2 kh 1 of 102 they follow a common asymptote from early to late times fig 10 the effects of kh 2 kh 1 on the dimensionless drawdown for the b b wedge shaped aquifer are shown in fig 11 for ϕ 52 â and fig 12 for ϕ 12 â figs 11 and 12 follow the overall trend as figs 9 and 10 during the early and intermediate times however during the late time when the effects of barrier lateral boundaries dominate the dimensionless drawdowns rise figs 11 and 12 in these cases as in the c c wedge shaped case the late time deviation of the two layer wedge shaped aquifer from the single layer one becomes insignificant at the kh 2 kh 1 of 10 2 to explore the effects of the wedge angle on sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of fractures fig 13 is prepared this figure illustrates that the sensitivity of the c c wedge shaped aquifer system drawdowns to kh 2 red lines is more significant during the early time comparing to the b b wedge shaped aquifer systems black lines during the same time this is due to the fact that kh 2 as well as kh 1 affects the resistance to flow in the underlying fractured aquifer from the lateral constant head boundary toward the pumping the barrier lateral boundaries reduce the horizontal flow in the underlying fractured aquifer in the b b wedge shaped aquifer during the early time leading to lower sensitivity to kh 2 for this case as stated by butler and mcelwee 1990 sensitivity of the drawdown to the transmissivity of a hydraulic zone continue to increase as long as the cone of depression is within that zone it is leveled off at the value that is proportional to the size of the hydraulic zone when the hydraulic gradient reaches a constant value there butler and mcelwee 1990 in the c c wedge shaped aquifer the hydraulic gradient within the underlying fractured aquifer stabilizes during the late time when the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries thus the scaled sensitivity reaches a plateau during the late time fig 13 black lines the value that the scaled sensitivity is stabilized is proportional to the wedge angle this is due to the fact that the area of the cone of depression decreases as the wedge angle decreases in the c c wedge shaped aquifer for the b b wedge shaped aquifer however the late time scaled sensitivity is not stabilized as the hydraulic gradient continues to increase fig 13 red lines furthermore the late time scaled sensitivity is inversely proportional to the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer owing to the fact that the rate of expansion of the cone of depression increases as the wedge angle decreases 4 4 influences of ssm to illustrate the effects of ssm ssu on the dimensionless drawdown fig 14 is prepared the c c wedge shaped aquifer is considered and the other parameters are set to default values table 2 as it is depicted in fig 14 increasing ratio of ssm ssu decreases the dimsionless drawdow during the early and intermediate times when the water stored in the matrix blocks is released sedghi and samani 2015 the same trend is also seen in fig 15 prepared for a wedge angle of 12 the drawdow platue and the inter porosity flow diminish during the late time as the effects of constant head lateral boundaries dominate figs 14 and 15 figs 16 and 17 are prepared similarly as figs 14 and 15 but for the b b wedge shaped aquifer the same trend as figs 14 and 15 is seen in figs 16 and 17 during the early and intermediate times during the late time however the dimensionless drawdown curve of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system with a ssm ssu of 250 does not converge to the leaky wedge shaped aquifer drawdown curve figs 16 and 17 such results may atribute to the fact that the no flow lateral boundaries do not contribute to pumpage and an elevated ssm ssu ratio increases the intensity and duration of the inter porosity flow thus affects the late time dimensionless drawdown to examine the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to the matrix block specific storage fig 18 is constructed similarly as figs 8 and 13 generally the b b wedge shaped aquifer red lines is more sensitive to ssm comparing to the horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifers black lines the sensitivity of the c c unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer increases during the early time when the water released from the matrix blocks starts to affect the dimensionless drawdown of the overlying unconfined aquifer and such a sensitivity reaches its peak during the intermediate time when the inter porosity flow dominates once the drawdown cone reaches the lateral constant head boundaries the scaled sensitivity to ssm starts to decrease the lower the wedge angle is the sooner the drawdown cone reaches the lateral boundaries and sooner for the sensitivity to ssm to decrease after reaching the peak this is analogue to the results reported by butler and mcelwee 1990 which investigated the sensitivity of the drawdown of a radially symmetric heterogeneous aquifer to storativity for the horizontally infinite unconfined fractured aquifer system bold black line however the scaled sensitivity maintains its maximum magnitude during the late time reflecting the phenomenon that the matrix block affects the dimensionless drawdown during the late time similar statement has been made by mcelwee and yukler 1978 for horizontally infinite homogeneous aquifers for the b b unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer as the lateral barrier boundaries greatly influence the dimensionless drawdown the late time sensitivity increases and levels off at the values inversely proportional to the wedge angle this is quite different from what has been seen in a horizontally infinite homogenous aquifer in which the late time sensitivity is lower than that of b b wedge shaped aquifer as illustrated in fig 18 the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown of the c c wedge shaped aquifer to ssm is very low during the late time this increases the ssm uncertainty in parameter estimation process using the collected drawdown data to increase the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to ssm the variable rate pumping test is suggested butler and mcelwee 1990 to test the effects of step increase in pumping rate on the scaled sensitivity to ssm fig 19 is prepared the pumping rate increases by 50 dash line and 100 dotted line at the dimensionless time t d of 10 and 100 respectively the superposition principle is followed to obtain scaled sensitivity increasing the pumping rate increases the scaled sensitivity to ssm proportional to the amount of pumping rate variation fig 19 this is explained by butler and mcelwee 1990 when investigating the sensitivity of drawdown to transmissivity and storativity of radially symmetric non uniform aquifers they stated that each time the pumping rate is increased a new cone of depression superimposed on the original one propagate out from the pumping well and producing an increase in sensitivity for more information on the pattern of pumping to achieve the maximum sensitivity to a hydraulic parameter of concern i e transmissivity or storativity one may consult butler and mcelwee 1990 5 discussion of parameter estimation and non uniqueness issue one can see that the developed mathematical model involves a total of nine hydraulic parameters in addition to several geometric parameters these include kh1 kz1 ss1 sy for the overlying unconfined aquifer kh2 kz2 ss2 for the underlying fractured aquifer km rm for the matrix block if one wants to conduct a full scale inversion for all nine parameters simply based on type curves generated from observed drawdown data non uniqueness of the estimated parameters is going to be a challenging issue as often seen in inversion of similar hydrological systems carrera and neuman 1986 carrera et al 2005 yeh et al 2015 the use of dimensionless terms in this study will reduce the number of parameters involved in the mathematical model and can recover some characteristic properties represented in dimensionless numbers the other benefit of nondimensionalization is to resolve the parameter correlation problem however even with this effort one usually still cannot completely resolve the non uniqueness issue of the parameter estimation with so many parameters involved in the mathematical model therefore it is tantamount to determine a subset of the involved parameters before the full inversion and this can be done using additional pumping tests described as follows if a pumping test is conducted with a pumping well that is only partially penetrating the upper unconfined aquifer with a nearby multi level observation well that is also only penetrating the upper unconfined aquifer the early stage drawdown should have negligible influence from the upper water table boundary and the lower fractured aquifer this can be attributed to two reasons first the drop of water table at the upper boundary is usually delayed partially because of the capillary force above the water table neuman 1972 1974 moench 1995 second the unpumped fractured aquifer can only release a very small amount of water to the upper pumped unconfined aquifer at the early stage of pumping due to the limited storage capacity of the fractures although the storage capacity of the rock matrix could be considerable release of water from the rock matrix takes much longer time so its effect will not appear at the early stage of pumping in the unconfined aquifer therefore one may obtain kh1 kz1 ss1 from this test the horizontal radial distance between the multi level observation well and the pumping well should be much less than 1 5b 1 where b 1 is the pre pumping saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer bear 1979 the reason to set the observation well much less than 1 5b 1 is to record the vertical flow effect which is usually negligible when r 1 5b 1 the use of multi level observation well is to measure drawdown at different depths at a given location such an instrument is necessary to obtain an accurate estimation of the vertical hydraulic conductivity kz1 if a multi level observation well is not available then two or more observation wells taping at different depths can serve the same purpose furthermore if the pumping well and the observation well screened in the deeper part of the unconfined c c wedge shaped aquifer the intermediate time drawdown is more valuable to estimate the storativity of the matrix blocks sm fig 18 and the fractures ss2 figure not shown with above preparation one only have four more parameters sy km kh2 and kz2 to be determined all these four parameters are reflection of aquifer response after a sufficiently long time of pumping figs 8 and 13 because it takes time for water to be released from the vadose zone above the water table and from the rock matrix thus one should focus on analyzing the drawdown at the late stage non uniqueness issue of parameter estimation should be much easier to handle for such a four parameter problem for instance the release of water from the upper unconfined aquifer because of falling of the water table containing the information of sy will result in a downward flux across the interface of the upper and lower aquifers thus the effect of sy may be detected by installing observation wells at different depths for instance at both the upper unconfined aquifer and the lower fractured aquifer on the other hand the effect of inter porosity flux or the fracture matrix water exchange as reflected in km sm through eq 10 does not depends on the depth moreover variable rate pumping test can increase the sensitivity of drawdown to hydraulic parameters fig 19 hence the non uniqueness issue becomes less likely randomly variable rate pumping test also reduces the parameter correlation butler and mcelwee 1990 6 summary and conclusion new laplace domain solutions of flow to a well in an unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system is obtained both c c and b b wedge shaped aquifers are considered eliminating the inter porosity flow from the underlying fractured aquifer the solutions reduce to that for an aquifer aquitard wedge shaped aquifer system the developed solutions are used to analyze the dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity of the wedge shaped aquifer system the following conclusions can be drawn 1 decreasing kz 2 kz 1 decreases the deviation of both leaky and unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifers from that of a single layer wedge shaped aquifer when the kz 2 kz 1 value reduces to about 10 4 this deviation becomes insignificant decreasing the wedge angle decreases the deviation of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer the deviation of unconfined fractured and leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the single layer wedge shaped aquifer is also decreased 2 deviation of the dimensionless drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system from that of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer is more significant in the b b wedge shaped aquifer interestingly decreasing the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer increases the deviation of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer from the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system 3 the sensitivity of the drawdown of the b b c c wedge shaped aquifer system to kzf is higher lower than that of the horizontally infinite unconfined fractured aquifer during the early and late times for the case with a wedge angle of 12 increasing kh 2 kh 1 reduces the deviation of drawdown of the unconfined fractured wedge shaped aquifer system from that of the leaky wedge shaped aquifer at the kh 2 kh 1 of about 102 the early and intermediate time deviation becomes insignificant reflecting the phenomenon that the inter porosity flow diminishes considerably 4 in the c c wedge shaped aquifer the hydraulic gradient within the underlying fractured aquifer stabilizes during the late time when the cone of depression reaches the lateral constant head boundaries thus the scaled sensitivity reaches a plateau during the late time the value that the scaled sensitivity is stabilized is proportional to the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer the late time scaled sensitivity is not stabilized as the hydraulic gradient continues to increase furthermore the late time scaled sensitivity is inversely proportional to the wedge angle in the b b wedge shaped aquifer the b b wedge shaped aquifer is more sensitive to ssm comparing to horizontally infinite and the c c wedge shaped aquifers 5 step increase in the discharge rate increases the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to ssm in the c c wedge shaped aquifers

6909,this study investigates the efficiency of correcting radar rainfall estimates using a stochastic error model in the upper iguaçu river basin in southern brazil for improving streamflow simulations the 2 dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d is adopted here and modified to account for topographic complexity seasonality and distance from the radar srem2d was used to correct the radar rainfall estimates and produce an ensemble of equally probable rainfall fields that were then used to force a distributed hydrological model systematic and random errors in simulated streamflow were evaluated for a cascade of sub basins of the iguaçu catchment with drainage area ranging from 1 808 to 21 536 km2 results showed an improvement in the statistical metrics when the srem2d ensemble was used as input to the hydrological model in place of the radar rainfall estimates in most sub basins specifically srem2d was able to remove the relative bias up to 50 in the radar rainfall dataset regardless of the basin dimension whereas the random error was reduced more prominently in the larger basins up to 100 m3 s 1 an event scale evaluation was also performed for nine selected flood events in three sub basins srem2d reduced the overestimation in the cumulative rainfall and streamflow volumes during these events keywords radar rainfall streamflow ensemble uncertainties precipitation flood event 1 introduction minimizing the loss of human lives and mitigating socio economic impacts associated with severe flooding depend on the ability to issue warnings with sufficient lead times to enable preemptive mitigation actions flood prediction poses scientific and operational challenges to natural disasters centers mainly due to the difficulties in monitoring rainfall that directly impacts streamflow model simulations these issues are aggravated in basins with short response times few hours where forecasting systems need to combine meteorological and hydrological input at fine temporal and spatial scales caseri et al 2016 located in southern brazil the iguaçu river basin has a long history of severe floods with significant socio economic impacts garcia 2016 land use deforestation and climate changes in recent decades have contributed to worsen the effects of floods in the region in addition the disordered development of riverine areas and the increased land surface impermeability mainly in the basin headwater areas where large urban centers are located amplified both frequency and magnitude of flash floods pisani and bruna 2011 a recent survey of the brazilian water national agency has identified five areas that are highly vulnerable to floods in the iguaçu river basin ana 2014 fig 1 the use of hydrological models in flood monitoring largely depends on the reliability and availability of real time precipitation input data this is due the fact that the quality of hydrological forecasts is strongly dependent on the initial moisture conditions in the basin which is mostly determined by antecedent rainfall events due to their fine spatial and temporal resolution ground radar precipitation estimates represent a

equiprobable precipitation fields ensemble error corrections of satellite rainfall estimates have been shown to improve model streamflow simulations over the tar river basin in north carolina u s maggioni et al 2013 as well as across the tocantins araguaia basin in the brazilian amazon region falck et al 2015 short term precipitation forecasting can be based on the extrapolation of consecutive radar scans to assess the uncertainty of radar rainfall estimates probabilistic radar ensembles have been used in combination or not with numerical weather prediction models liguori and rico ramirez 2013 codo and rico ramirez 2018 showed that the extrapolation of radar rainfall fields could be improved by a radar ensemble generator that accounts for the residual error between radar rainfall estimates and rain gauge observations this study investigates the efficiency of correcting radar rainfall estimates using a stochastic rainfall error model to simulate streamflow in a region characterized by complex topography and seasonal rainfall variability specifically the 2 dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d developed by hossain and anagnostou 2006 is applied to a radar precipitation dataset to produce an ensemble of rainfall estimates used to force the distributed hydrological model mhd modelo hidrológico distribuído rodriguez and tomasella 2016 the model

rain and flow volumes time lag and dispersion the study region and the datasets are presented in section 2 section 3 describes the methodology including the hydrological model srem2d and the hydrograph separation method used to identify the flooding events section 4 presents and discusses the results and section 5 summarizes the conclusions 2 study area and dataset the iguaçu river basin is located in southern brazil 97 and argentina 3 covering an area of 70 800 km2 águasparaná 2017 the iguaçu river is formed by the confluence of the iraí and atuba rivers in the metropolitan area of curitiba 3 5 million inhabitants ibge 2015 the springs are situated in the western edge of the serra do mar running for 1320 km until they join the paraná river fig 1 the predominant climatic regime in the basin is humid subtropical oceanic with no dry season and hot summers alvares et al 2013 since the iguaçu basin includes 10 multipurpose reservoirs copel 2017 the impact of flooding is reduced in the lower part of the basin by reservoir operation on the other hand the upper iguaçu basin is mostly unregulated and encompasses a drainage area of 21 536 km2 floods in the region are usually associated with diurnal convection in small basins and stratiform and convective precipitation associated with cold fronts in the larger basins rainfall datasets used in this study were derived from a ground based radar and a rain gauge network the paraná meteorological system simepar s band doppler radar is located in teixeira soares in southern brazil radar data were processed by simepar using the reflectivity of the constant altitude plan position indicator cappi level at 3 km height above mean sea level the spatial resolution is 1 km the temporal resolution is about 5 min for a full volume scans with 7 elevations ppis plan position indicator and the first elevation angle of 0 5 deg whereas the data collection frequency is 10 min the maximum range is 200 km but the radar makes a scan in vigilance mode every 30 min with the maximum range of 480 km around the radar radar data were aggregated to the 4 km hourly spatio temporal scale setting the radar range to 150 km as the radar performance commonly degrades at distances beyond 150 km ciach et al 1997 simpson and fox 2018 data are available for a period that ranges from december 2007 to november 2010 hourly data from 40 rain gauges 14 meteorological stations where air temperature dew point temperature atmospheric pressure incident global radiation and wind speed are measured and nine streamflow stations were available for an 8 year long time series january 2005 december 2013 the hydrometeorological variables were quality controlled by simepar additional information used in the hydrological model was a digital elevation

a soil map embrapa 1981 3 methodology 3 1 the mhd inpe hydrological model the distributed hydrological model developed at the brazilian institute for space research inpe namely mhd inpe rodriguez and tomasella 2016 is a regular grid cell model that uses hydrological response units in each cell as a function of land use and coverage mhd inpe is composed of four modules i soil water balance ii evapotranspiration iii surface sub surface and groundwater fluxes and iv channel routing this model has been successfully applied to climate change and land use land cover change impact studies siqueira et al 2015 mohor et al 2015 rodriguez and tomasella 2016 as a tool for hydrological monitoring and forecasting falck et al 2015 casagrande et al 2017 tomasella et al 2018 and by insurance companies for estimating economic indicators during droughts mohor and mendiondo 2017 additional details on the hydrological model can be found in rodriguez and tomasella 2016 the mhd inpe model was run in nine sub basins of the iguaçu river basin table 1 over a 4 km regular grid at hourly temporal resolution model parameters were calibrated using hourly observations of meteorological data interpolated across the basin using the inverse square effective distance the latter was calculated as the sum of the geodetic distance between the station and the center of the pixel and the weighted distance between the pixel average altitude and the rain gauge altitude as described by lefèvre et al 2002 the shuffled complex evolution algorithm method scea duan et al 1992 combines deterministic and probabilistic approaches through the systematic evolution of complex data points and the direction of the optimum the set of optimum parameters values was selected maximizing the mean nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the logarithm of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nselog of simulated vs observed streamflow the hydrological model was calibrated for the period 2005 2008 using continuous series of interpolated meteorological data table 2 the model was spun up for a period of 720 hours to reduce the impacts of initial conditions for the validation run 2008 2013 the model used the moisture states from the calibration run as initial conditions cold start 3 2 the srem2d error model the srem2d model was developed by hossain and anagnostou 2006 to correct satellite rainfall estimates based on a higher quality reference dataset srem2d characterizes the multidimensional structure of satellite rainfall errors using stochastic space time formulations in this study srem2d was used to correct radar rainfall estimates with respect to the reference ground observations and to generate an ensemble of equally probable reference like rainfall fields the multidimensional structure of the error includes i a temporal dimension how does the error vary in time ii a spatial dimension how does the error vary in space and iii a retrieval dimension what is the magnitude of the precipitation error in rainy areas hossain et al 2009 srem2d considers both false alarms and missed rain through the joint spatial probability of successful delineation of rainy and non rainy areas this is a critical element as real sensor data including radar rainfall estimates exhibit spatial clusters of false rain and false no rain srem2d has been successfully used to improve the performance of hydrological models for monitoring and predicting floods past studies have evaluated the propagation of satellite precipitation uncertainties in streamflow simulations in mountainous basins and observed a dependency of rainfall runoff error propagation on the basin size nikolopoulos et al 2010 maggioni et al 2013 furthermore falck et al 2015 2016 applied srem2d to satellite precipitation products over the tocantins araguaia basin in brazil 5280 764 000 km2 and showed that the systematic error in the streamflow ensemble decreases as a function of catchment area although the rainfall to streamflow error propagation did not show any dependency on the basin size in this study srem2d parameters were calibrated based on the radar rainfall estimates considering the rain gauge observations as reference a regional calibration was chosen to account for the complex topography of each sub basin and the distance from the radar which largely affect the precipitation error errors in the radar precipitation estimates are indeed related to the spread of the radar beam as distance from the radar increases usually 150 km causing distortion in the shapes and sizes of echoes decreasing the radar detection capability areas close to the radar 50 km are affected by the blind cone and secondary lobes generating ground clutter radar precipitation estimates are also affected by topography due to ground clutter which is reflected back to the radar and mistakenly interpreted by the sensor as cloud water drops resulting in incorrect high precipitation rates during the srem2d calibration phase only pixels where both radar and rain gauge reference were available at the same time were considered moreover a seasonal calibration was performed for the four following seasons summer december 2007 february 2008 fall march to may 2008 winter june to august 2008 and spring september to november 2008 then in the running phase the calibrated srem2d was run to produce an ensemble of 25 members that reproduce the reference precipitation dataset for all pixels in each sub basin during both calibration december 2007 november 2008 and validation december 2008 november 2010 periods at hourly time step table 2 3 3 the characteristic point method to evaluate the performance of radar rainfall ensemble in capturing streamflow during a flooding event we extracted flood events from the long term continuous streamflow time series using the characteristic point method cpm proposed by mei and anagnostou 2015 cpm is a fully automated hydrograph separation method that uses time series of rainfall and streamflow as input the method defines a flood event based on the recession characteristics of streamflow rather than any user specific streamflow threshold moreover it incorporates information of basin average precipitation to identify the triggering rainfall of flood events cpm has been successfully applied to the development of a comprehensive flood event database for the continental united states during 2002 2013 shen et al 2017 in this study we used gauge interpolated rainfall fields to derive basin average rainfall for each sub basin considering the total upslope contributing area for the december 2008 november 2010 period these basin average rainfall time series and corresponding streamflow record were used as input to cpm to extract flood events a total of 66 flood events was extracted for the nine sub basins during the study period table 2 and these flood events form the population for our analysis a set of flood events properties was calculated for the flood events population cumulative event rainfall and flow volumes vr and vq dispersion of event rainfall and flow time series sr and sq and time lag tlag these parameters represent different aspects of the flood event and their accurate representation reflects the model performance in capturing the magnitude temporal variability and timing of floods the flood event properties are defined as follows 1 v r t r r t d t v q t q q t d t 2 s r t r t c r 2 t r r t d t s q t q t c q 2 t q q t d t 3 t lag c q c r where r indicates rainfall q is streamflow tr and tq are the period of rainfall and flow event respectively t is the time step vr and vq represent the magnitude of cumulative rainfall and streamflow over the event period respectively cr and cq are the temporal location of mass centers of hyetograph and hydrograph their difference tlag represents the mean time lag of flood response of a catchment sr and sq represent the temporal degree of dispersion of rainfall and streamflow with respect to cr and cq where larger sr and sq indicate less concentrated patterns of the hyetograph and hydrograph respectively cr and cq are defined as 4 c r t r t r t d t t r r t d t c q t r t q t d t t r q t d t vr vq sr sq and tlag were calculated for three precipitation datasets i e gauge interpolated rainfall fields radar precipitation estimates and srem2d rainfall ensemble mean and the corresponding streamflow simulations obtained by forcing the hydrological model with each precipitation dataset 3 4 performance analysis the hydrological model performance was assessed using two metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nselog defined as 5 nse 1 t 1 n qs t q o t t 1 n qo t qo 2 6 nse log 1 t 1 n l o g qs t l o g qo t t 1 n l o g q o t l o g q o 2 where qot represents observed hourly streamflow qst refers to streamflow simulated by forcing the model either with rain gauge or radar data or the srem2d ensemble n indicates the number of time intervals and overbars indicate the average value nse and nselog can range between and 1 where 1 represents the perfect match of simulated streamflow to the observed data zero means that the model simulation is as accurate as the mean of the observations and negative values mean that the observation average is better than the model simulation mhd inpe was evaluated based on two additional metrics the relative bias rbias and the unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse defined as follows 7 rbias 1 n t 1 n qs t qo t 1 n t 1 n qo t 8 ubrmse 1 n t 1 n qs t q s t qo t qo t 2 for the srem2d ensemble forced simulation rbias and ubrmse were calculated for each of the 25 members of the streamflow ensemble to evaluate the events properties of rainfall and streamflow described in section 3 3 we also used the rbias 9 rbias r e r o ro r b i a s q s q o qo where ro is the reference rainfall re refers to rainfall estimate and corresponds to either the radar observations or the srem2d ensemble mean qo is the streamflow simulated by rain gauge observations and qs is the streamflow simulated by forcing with re i e either radar observations or the srem2d ensemble mean the optimal value of rbias is zero the positive negative values represent an overestimate underestimate in rainfall or streamflow ubrmse can range between 0 and where the optimal value is zero 4 results 4 1 hydrological model calibration and validation table 3 shows calibration and validation results in terms of nse and nselog for nine streamflow stations overall the hydrological model was able to reproduce the hydrological response of the iguaçu basin in terms of frequency and magnitude of streamflow peaks and recession periods for most sub basins nse and nselog were close to or higher than 0 7 during both calibration and validation periods however in the headwater basins like b1 b2 and b4 nse showed values ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 the poorer performance is likely due to the density of the rain gauge network which is crucial for representing the hydrological response in smaller drainage areas with higher spatial rainfall variability influenced by topography for instance in sub basin b2 where the model showed the worst performance there exists only a single rainfall station at its outlet while five rain gauges are located in sub basin b4 where the performance of the hydrological model was superior in addition hydrological models have limitations related to the complexity of headwater sub basins as important processes such as hydrological partitioning are poorly characterized even by physically based models kelleher et al 2015 another source of uncertainties is the extrapolation of peak flows from the rating curve particularly in headwater basins where measuring discharge during severe floods is logistically difficult in the case of headwater basins b6 and b8 the model was able to properly reproduce streamflow even in the case of b8 which is characterized by extremely complex topography fig 1 the nse coefficient was above 0 8 and 0 7 during the calibration and validation periods respectively according to moriasi et al 2007 such nse values correspond to excellent model performance moreover due to the low density of the real time rain gauge network the interpolated rainfall field is affected by errors and uncertainties regardless of the chosen interpolation method particularly in complex terrain areas such as the headwater catchments this explains at least partially the lower performance of the hydrological model for sub basins b1 and b2 table 3 although the radar is able to capture the spatial structure of rainfall fields further corrections may be necessary to remove biases and improve correlations with reference rain gauge observations in this context the use of ensemble techniques as proposed in this study becomes an attractive tool particularly in early warning systems 4 2 rainfall error model a previous study by falck et al 2015 demonstrated that a local srem2d calibration is preferred to a single calibration for the entire tocantins araguaia basin a large basin located in center of brazil specifically they showed that parameters calibrated for the whole basin 764 000 km2 could not fully represent rainfall errors in catchments smaller than 25 000 km2 even though the iguaçu and tocantins araguaia basins are characterized by different precipitation regimes size and topography the same approach was followed for the iguaçu basin where complex terrain and distance from the radar location play a fundamental role in rainfall error characterization fig 2 a shows the relative frequencies of elevation hypsometric index in the upper iguaçu basin black line and in each sub basin colored lines the basin elevation ranges from 1333 m in b1 to 747 m at the basin outlet located in b9 with an average of 889 m the average altitude of most sub basins is relatively similar ranging from 821 m to 892 m except for sub basins b4 and b8 which have higher mean altitude 929 m and 1058 m respectively fig 2b shows the variance of elevation normalized by the total basin area normalized variance nv which is a measure of topographic complexity in each sub basin with respect to the whole catchment most sub basins presented nv values below 20 whereas sub basin 8 showed a nv of 48 thus sub basin b8 was analyzed separately because both the hypsometric index and the normalized variance indicated contrasting differences when compared to the rest of the sub basins the probability density function pdf and the cumulative density function cdf of the error between radar rainfall estimates and rain gauge observations were constructed based on a point to point comparison for all pixels where both radar and rain gauge measurements were available pdfs and cdfs for each sub basin are shown in fig 3 error distributions both in terms of pdfs and cdfs show a similar behavior in all basins except for b5 and b6 specifically the pdfs of these two basins are significantly skewed towards lower rainfall rates 1 mm h these two sub basins are located close to the radar indicating that the distance from the radar affects the error in the rainfall estimates consequently srem2d was calibrated for three different regions table 4 the first region r1 corresponds to basins that are far away from the weather radar location distance 50 km and are topographically complex like b8 the second region r2 corresponds to basins that are closer to the radar distance 50 km but topographically simple like b5 and b6 the third region r3 includes basins that are far from the radar distance 50 km and topographically simple like b1 b2 b3 b4 b7 and b9 due to the seasonal differences of rainfall events srem2d was calibrated for each season summer fall winter and spring separately the calibrated parameters are summarized in table 5 fig 4 shows the cumulative rainfall time series of the srem2d ensemble median gray solid line the srem2d ensemble minimum and maximum light gray shaded area radar rainfall estimates black solid line and ground observations black dashed line for a small sub basin in r1 b8 santa cruz do timbó timbó river 2448 km2 a medium size sub basin in r2 b5 são mateus do sul iguaçu river 5440 km2 and a large sub basin in r3 b9 união da vitória iguaçu river 21 536 km2 in the medium sub basin the srem2d ensemble reduced significantly the bias in the radar data by 2000 mm resulting in values closer to the rain gauge time series considered to be the benchmark however in the small basin the bias reduction caused an overall underestimation of 1000 mm which is due to the fact that the bias is not constant in time and may change from the calibration to the validation period over the entire basin srem2d produces the best correction 2000 mm and the ensemble mean almost completely overlaps the reference cumulative rainfall the large basin showed smaller ensemble spread than the small and mid size sub basins due to the fact that smaller areas are more affected by topographic heterogeneity which enhances the precipitation spatio temporal variability 4 3 streamflow time series analysis the hydrological model ability of simulating streamflow when forced with i rain gauge observations triangles ii radar rainfall estimates stars and iii srem2d rainfall ensemble boxplots was assessed through the nse and nselog as a function of basin area during 2008 2010 fig 5 results showed an improvement in the statistical metrics when the srem2d ensemble was used as input to mhd inpe instead of the radar estimates in all sub basins except for b8 in the case of the nse where the performance of the ensemble was slightly worse when compared to the results generated using radar rainfall estimates this can be explained by a combination of factors firstly when compared to the rain gauge observations both radar rainfall estimates and the srem2d ensemble had similar absolute error in b8 making streamflow simulations insensitive to the srem2d bias correction fig 4a in addition radar rainfall estimates were consistently larger than observations while the ensemble members underestimating rain gauge observations particularly during more intense rainfall events as the hydrological model tended to underestimate flow peaks overestimations in rainfall estimations tended to have a positive influence by correcting the model deficiency in simulating high flows finally it should be noted that the extrapolation of rating curves for high flows adds uncertainty particularly in the case of small and fast response catchments such as b8 where peak discharge is rarely measured systematic rbias and random ubrmse errors in the simulated streamflow time series were investigated for a cascade of basin scales 1808 21 536 km2 and are shown in fig 6 srem2d was able to significantly remove the bias in the radar dataset regardless of the basin dimension with an average bias removal of 0 5 the positive rbias in streamflow was also removed in b8 although it resulted in a slight underestimation the srem2d ensemble forced streamflow simulation improved the rbias in most sub basins on the other hand the random error depicted by the ubrmse increased with the catchment area as larger flows are observed in larger sub basins in larger basins like b5 b7 and b9 srem2d reduced the streamflow random error with respect to simulations that used radar rainfall estimates as input to the hydrological model 4 4 event based performance analysis in order to assess the ability of srem2d to improve flood monitoring and prediction an event based performance analysis was conducted firstly flood events were identified during the srem2d validation period using rain and streamflow observations in each sub basin using cpm table 6 shows the number of streamflow events in each sub basin and the average properties of these events sixty six events were identified by cpm in nine sub basins during the period december 2008 november 2010 table 2 fig 7 presents streamflow events from model simulations forced by i radar rainfall estimates black solid line rain gauge observations black dashed line the srem2d ensemble median gray solid line and minimum and maximum of the srem2d ensemble envelope light gray shaded area three catchments of different drainage area were then selected and performance statistics were computed for three different rainfall events with contrasting behavior resulting in nine representative streamflow events identified by cpm the chosen streamflow events included six multi peaks events and three single peak events with recurrence period around 4 2 years in b8 6 6 years in b5 and 10 years in b9 these events were associated with stratiform and or convective precipitation the hydrograph of each event was evaluated for all the simulation cases i e using the three different rainfall inputs results showed that the use of srem2d significantly improved the streamflow simulations removing the bias in the radar rainfall product additionally events in the small sub basin b8 in r1 and in the mid sized sub basin b5 in r2 presented larger ensemble spreads when compared to the large basin which is due to higher precipitation uncertainties in regions characterized by complex terrain fig 8 shows the relative bias of rainfall and streamflow properties for radar rainfall data and radar forced simulations stars and for the srem2d ensemble mean and srem2d ensemble mean forced simulations squares for the events identified in fig 7 the radar dataset significantly overestimated the cumulative rainfall volume vr which led to an overestimation in the cumulative flow volume vq of all the events srem2d was able to reduce the overestimation in the cumulative rainfall volume and corresponding streamflow volume estimated by the radar the largest overestimation of rainfall and streamflow volumes was observed in mid size and large sub basins the relative biases of tlag for radar rainfall estimates and the srem2d ensemble mean are close to zero showing that both radar and srem2d well reproduced the time lag between mass centers of rainfall events and their corresponding hydrographs the relative biases in the hyetograph and hydrograph shape parameters sr and sq are also very close to zero this demonstrated that both radar rainfall estimates and the srem2d ensemble mean were able to well represent the benchmark hyetograph and hydrograph shape parameters 5 conclusions this study investigated the efficiency of correcting radar rainfall estimates using the srem2d error model to simulate streamflow in the iguaçu basin characterized by complex topography and seasonal rainfall variability the mhd inpe hydrological model was shown to properly simulate streamflow across the basin when calibrated with rain gauge observations however the model showed some limitations in the headwater basins because of the high spatio temporal precipitation variability in complex terrain since the calibration of the hydrological model suffered from uncertainties related to low density rain gauge network it is important to assess how rainfall runoff model calibration results would be affected when bias corrected radar rainfall estimates are used in place of interpolated rain gauge measurements due to the region complex topography the distance from the radar affecting the radar product quality and precipitation seasonality the srem2d error model was regionally calibrated during the four seasons results showed that srem2d reduced significantly the bias in the radar rainfall product particularly in medium and large size basins 5 440 21 536 km2 improvements in the model performance were observed when the srem2d ensemble was used as input to mhd inpe in place of radar estimates for all catchment sizes except for a small basin in r1 where the model performance using radar estimates was already very close to the one of the reference overall srem2d was able to significantly remove the bias in the radar dataset regardless of the basin size furthermore the streamflow ensemble showed a reduction in the systematic error when compared to streamflow simulated with rain gauge for most sub basins the random error increased with the catchment area but the proposed technique reduced the random error in larger basins nine flood events were analyzed in the basin during the study period and the use of srem2d significantly improved streamflow simulations during these events srem2d also reduced the bias of cumulative rainfall and streamflow volumes during the selected flood events moreover both the radar dataset and the srem2d ensemble were able to properly reproduce the flood event time lags and hyetograph and hydrograph shape parameters this study demonstrated the potential of using an error model traditionally applied to satellite precipitation products to correct radar rainfall estimates for real time streamflow monitoring forecasting and flood risk mapping as the methodology was tested only in the iguaçu basin future work should verify the performance of the proposed methodology in other basins of the world to generalize these results to different climatological regions acknowledgments this work was partially supported by the national council for scientific and technological

6909,this study investigates the efficiency of correcting radar rainfall estimates using a stochastic error model in the upper iguaçu river basin in southern brazil for improving streamflow simulations the 2 dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d is adopted here and modified to account for topographic complexity seasonality and distance from the radar srem2d was used to correct the radar rainfall estimates and produce an ensemble of equally probable rainfall fields that were then used to force a distributed hydrological model systematic and random errors in simulated streamflow were evaluated for a cascade of sub basins of the iguaçu catchment with drainage area ranging from 1 808 to 21 536 km2 results showed an improvement in the statistical metrics when the srem2d ensemble was used as input to the hydrological model in place of the radar rainfall estimates in most sub basins specifically srem2d was able to remove the relative bias up to 50 in the radar rainfall dataset regardless of the basin dimension whereas the random error was reduced more prominently in the larger basins up to 100 m3 s 1 an event scale evaluation was also performed for nine selected flood events in three sub basins srem2d reduced the overestimation in the cumulative rainfall and streamflow volumes during these events keywords radar rainfall streamflow ensemble uncertainties precipitation flood event 1 introduction minimizing the loss of human lives and mitigating socio economic impacts associated with severe flooding depend on the ability to issue warnings with sufficient lead times to enable preemptive mitigation actions flood prediction poses scientific and operational challenges to natural disasters centers mainly due to the difficulties in monitoring rainfall that directly impacts streamflow model simulations these issues are aggravated in basins with short response times few hours where forecasting systems need to combine meteorological and hydrological input at fine temporal and spatial scales caseri et al 2016 located in southern brazil the iguaçu river basin has a long history of severe floods with significant socio economic impacts garcia 2016 land use deforestation and climate changes in recent decades have contributed to worsen the effects of floods in the region in addition the disordered development of riverine areas and the increased land surface impermeability mainly in the basin headwater areas where large urban centers are located amplified both frequency and magnitude of flash floods pisani and bruna 2011 a recent survey of the brazilian water national agency has identified five areas that are highly vulnerable to floods in the iguaçu river basin ana 2014 fig 1 the use of hydrological models in flood monitoring largely depends on the reliability and availability of real time precipitation input data this is due the fact that the quality of hydrological forecasts is strongly dependent on the initial moisture conditions in the basin which is mostly determined by antecedent rainfall events due to their fine spatial and temporal resolution ground radar precipitation estimates represent a viable option for monitoring and forecasting flood hazards however these estimates are affected by errors due to unwanted echoes from the local topography and the conversion of reflectivity into

2013 codo and rico ramirez 2018 showed that the extrapolation of radar rainfall fields could be improved by a radar ensemble generator that accounts for the residual error between radar rainfall

is located in southern brazil 97 and argentina 3 covering an area of 70 800 km2 águasparaná 2017 the iguaçu river is formed by the confluence of the iraí and atuba rivers in the metropolitan area of curitiba 3 5 million inhabitants ibge 2015 the springs are situated in the western edge of the serra do mar running for 1320 km until they join the paraná river fig 1 the predominant climatic regime in the basin is humid subtropical oceanic with no dry season and hot summers alvares et al 2013 since the iguaçu basin includes 10 multipurpose reservoirs copel 2017 the impact of flooding is reduced in the lower part of the basin by reservoir operation on the other hand the upper iguaçu basin is mostly unregulated and encompasses a drainage area of 21 536 km2 floods in the region are usually associated with diurnal convection in small basins and stratiform and convective precipitation associated with cold fronts in the larger basins rainfall datasets used in this study were derived from a

volume scans with 7 elevations ppis plan position indicator and the first elevation angle of 0 5 deg whereas the data collection frequency is 10 min the maximum range is 200 km but the radar makes a scan in vigilance mode every 30 min with the maximum range of 480 km around the radar radar data were aggregated to the 4 km hourly spatio temporal scale setting the radar range to 150 km as the radar performance commonly degrades at distances beyond 150 km ciach et al 1997 simpson and fox 2018 data are available for a period that ranges from december 2007 to november 2010 hourly data from 40 rain gauges 14 meteorological stations where air temperature dew point temperature atmospheric pressure incident global radiation and wind speed are measured and nine streamflow stations were available for

tomasella 2016 is a regular grid cell model that uses hydrological response units in each cell as a function of land use and coverage mhd inpe is composed of four modules i soil water balance ii evapotranspiration iii surface sub surface and groundwater fluxes and iv channel routing this model has been successfully applied to climate change and land use land cover change impact studies siqueira et al 2015 mohor et al 2015 rodriguez and tomasella 2016 as a tool for hydrological monitoring and forecasting falck et al 2015 casagrande et al 2017 tomasella et al 2018 and by insurance companies for estimating economic indicators during droughts mohor and mendiondo 2017 additional details on the hydrological model can be found in rodriguez and tomasella 2016 the mhd inpe model was run in nine sub basins of the iguaçu river basin table 1 over a 4 km regular grid at hourly temporal resolution model parameters were calibrated using hourly observations of meteorological data interpolated across the basin using the inverse square effective distance the latter was calculated as the sum of the geodetic distance between the station and the center of the pixel and the weighted distance between the pixel average altitude and the rain gauge altitude as described by lefèvre et al 2002 the shuffled complex evolution algorithm method scea duan et al 1992 combines deterministic and probabilistic approaches through the systematic evolution of complex data points and the direction of the optimum the set of optimum parameters values was selected maximizing the mean nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the logarithm of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nselog of simulated vs observed streamflow the hydrological model was calibrated for the period 2005 2008 using continuous series of interpolated meteorological data table 2 the model was spun up for a period of 720 hours to reduce the impacts of initial conditions for the validation run 2008 2013 the model used the moisture states from the calibration run as initial conditions cold start 3 2 the srem2d error model the srem2d model was developed by hossain and anagnostou 2006 to correct satellite rainfall estimates based on a higher quality reference dataset srem2d characterizes the multidimensional structure of satellite rainfall errors using stochastic space time formulations in this study srem2d was used to correct radar rainfall estimates with respect to the reference ground observations and to generate an ensemble of equally probable reference like rainfall fields the multidimensional structure of the error includes i a temporal dimension how does the error vary in time ii a spatial dimension how does the error vary in space and iii a retrieval dimension what is the magnitude of the precipitation error in rainy areas hossain et al 2009 srem2d considers both false alarms and missed rain through the joint spatial probability of successful delineation of rainy and non rainy areas this is a critical element as real sensor data including radar rainfall estimates exhibit spatial clusters of false rain and false no rain srem2d has been successfully used to improve the performance of hydrological models for monitoring and predicting floods past studies have evaluated the propagation of satellite precipitation uncertainties in streamflow simulations in mountainous basins and observed a dependency of rainfall runoff error propagation on the basin size nikolopoulos et al 2010 maggioni et al 2013 furthermore falck et al 2015 2016 applied srem2d to satellite precipitation products over the tocantins araguaia basin in brazil 5280 764 000 km2 and showed that the systematic error in the streamflow ensemble decreases as a function of catchment area although the rainfall to streamflow error propagation did not show any dependency on the basin size in this study srem2d parameters were calibrated based on the radar rainfall estimates considering the rain gauge observations as reference a regional calibration was chosen to account for the complex topography of each sub basin and the distance from the radar which largely affect the precipitation error errors in the radar precipitation estimates are indeed related to the spread of the radar beam as distance from the radar increases usually 150 km causing distortion in the shapes and sizes of echoes decreasing the radar detection capability areas close to the radar 50 km are affected by the blind cone and secondary lobes generating ground clutter radar precipitation estimates are also affected by topography due to ground clutter which is reflected back to the radar and mistakenly interpreted by the sensor as cloud water drops resulting in incorrect high precipitation rates during the srem2d calibration phase only pixels where both radar and rain gauge reference were available at the same time were considered moreover a seasonal calibration was performed for the four following seasons summer december 2007 february 2008 fall march to may 2008 winter june to august 2008 and spring september to november 2008 then in the running phase the calibrated srem2d was run to produce an ensemble of 25 members that reproduce the reference precipitation dataset for all pixels in each sub basin during both calibration december 2007 november 2008 and validation december 2008 november 2010 periods at hourly time step table 2 3 3 the characteristic point method to evaluate the performance of radar rainfall ensemble in capturing streamflow during a flooding event we extracted flood events from the long term continuous streamflow time series using the characteristic point method cpm proposed by mei and anagnostou 2015 cpm is a fully automated hydrograph separation method that uses time series of rainfall and streamflow as input the method defines a flood event based on the recession characteristics of streamflow rather than any user specific streamflow threshold moreover it incorporates information of basin average precipitation to identify the triggering rainfall of flood events cpm has been successfully applied to the development of a comprehensive flood event database for the continental united states during 2002 2013 shen et al 2017 in this study we used gauge interpolated rainfall fields to derive basin average rainfall for each sub basin considering the total upslope contributing area for the december 2008 november 2010 period these basin average rainfall time series and corresponding streamflow record were used as input to cpm to extract flood events a total of 66 flood events was extracted for the nine sub basins during the study period table 2 and these flood events form the population for our analysis a set of flood events properties was calculated for the flood events population cumulative event rainfall and flow volumes vr and vq dispersion of event rainfall and flow time series sr and sq and time lag tlag these parameters represent different aspects of the flood event and their accurate representation reflects the model performance in capturing the magnitude temporal variability and timing of floods the flood event properties are defined as follows 1 v r t r

respectively t is the time step vr and vq represent the magnitude of cumulative rainfall and streamflow over the event period respectively cr and cq are the temporal location of mass centers of hyetograph and hydrograph their difference tlag represents the mean time lag of flood response of a catchment sr and sq represent the temporal degree of dispersion of rainfall and streamflow with respect to cr and cq where larger sr and sq indicate less concentrated patterns of the hyetograph and hydrograph respectively cr and cq are defined as 4 c r t r t r t d t t r r t d t c q t r t q t d t

metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nselog defined as 5 nse 1 t 1 n qs t q o t t 1 n qo t qo 2 6 nse log 1 t 1 n l o g qs t l o g qo t t 1 n l o g q o t l o g q o 2 where qot represents observed hourly streamflow qst refers to streamflow simulated by forcing the model either with rain gauge or radar data or the srem2d ensemble n indicates the number of time intervals and overbars indicate the average value nse and nselog can range between and 1 where 1 represents the perfect match of simulated streamflow to the observed data zero means that the model simulation is as accurate as the mean of the observations and negative values mean that the observation average is better than the model simulation mhd inpe was evaluated based on two additional metrics the relative bias rbias and the unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse defined as follows 7 rbias 1 n t 1 n qs t qo t 1 n t 1 n qo t 8 ubrmse 1 n t 1 n qs t q s t qo t qo t 2 for

srem2d ensemble mean qo is the streamflow simulated by rain gauge observations and qs is the streamflow simulated by forcing with re i e either radar observations or the srem2d ensemble mean the optimal value of rbias is zero the positive negative values represent an overestimate underestimate in rainfall or streamflow ubrmse can range between 0 and where the optimal value is zero 4 results 4 1 hydrological model calibration and validation table 3 shows calibration and validation results in terms of nse and nselog for nine streamflow stations overall the hydrological model was able to reproduce the hydrological response of the iguaçu basin in terms of frequency and magnitude of streamflow peaks and recession periods for most sub basins nse and nselog were close to or higher than 0 7 during both calibration and validation periods however in the headwater basins like b1 b2 and b4 nse showed values ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 the poorer performance is likely due to the density of the rain gauge network which is crucial for representing the hydrological response in smaller drainage areas with higher spatial rainfall variability influenced by topography for instance in sub basin b2 where the model showed the worst performance there exists only a single rainfall station at its outlet while five rain gauges are located in sub basin b4 where the performance of the hydrological model was superior in addition hydrological models have limitations related to the complexity of headwater sub basins as important processes such as hydrological partitioning are poorly characterized even by physically based models kelleher et al 2015 another source of uncertainties is the extrapolation of peak flows from the rating curve particularly in headwater basins where measuring discharge during severe floods is logistically difficult in the case of headwater basins b6 and b8 the model was able to properly reproduce streamflow even in the case of b8 which is characterized by extremely complex topography fig 1 the nse coefficient was above 0 8 and 0 7 during the calibration and validation periods respectively according to moriasi et al 2007 such nse values correspond to excellent model performance moreover due to the low density of the real time rain gauge network the interpolated rainfall field is affected by errors and uncertainties regardless of the chosen interpolation method particularly in complex terrain areas such as the headwater catchments this explains at least partially the lower performance of the hydrological model for sub basins b1 and b2 table 3 although the radar is able to capture the spatial structure of rainfall fields further corrections may be necessary to remove biases and improve correlations with reference rain gauge observations in this context the use of ensemble techniques as proposed in this study becomes an attractive tool particularly in early warning systems 4 2 rainfall error model a previous study by falck et al 2015 demonstrated that a local srem2d calibration is preferred to a single calibration for the entire tocantins araguaia basin a large basin located in center of brazil specifically they showed that parameters calibrated for the whole basin 764 000 km2 could not fully represent rainfall errors in catchments smaller than 25 000 km2 even though the iguaçu and tocantins araguaia basins are characterized by different precipitation regimes size and topography the same approach was followed for the iguaçu basin where complex terrain and distance from the radar location play a fundamental role in rainfall error characterization fig 2 a shows the relative frequencies of elevation hypsometric index in the upper iguaçu basin black line and in each sub basin colored lines the basin elevation ranges from 1333 m in b1 to 747 m at the basin outlet located in b9 with an average of 889 m the average altitude of most sub basins is relatively similar ranging from 821 m to 892 m except for sub basins b4 and b8 which have higher mean altitude 929 m and 1058 m respectively fig 2b shows the variance of elevation normalized by the total basin area normalized variance nv which is a measure of topographic complexity in each sub basin with respect to the whole catchment most sub basins presented nv values below 20 whereas sub basin 8 showed a nv of 48 thus sub basin b8 was analyzed separately because both the hypsometric index and the normalized variance indicated contrasting differences when compared to the rest of the sub basins the probability density function pdf and the cumulative density function cdf of the error between radar rainfall estimates and rain gauge observations were constructed based on a point to point comparison for all pixels where both radar and rain gauge measurements were available pdfs and cdfs for each sub basin are shown in fig 3 error distributions both in terms of pdfs and cdfs show a similar behavior in all basins except for b5 and b6 specifically the pdfs of these two basins are significantly skewed towards lower rainfall rates 1 mm h these two sub basins are located close to the radar indicating that the distance from the radar affects the error in the rainfall estimates consequently srem2d was calibrated for three different regions table 4 the first region r1 corresponds to basins that are far away from the weather radar location distance 50 km and are topographically complex like b8 the second region r2 corresponds to basins that are closer to the radar distance 50 km but topographically simple like b5 and b6 the third region r3 includes basins that are far from the radar distance 50 km and topographically simple like b1 b2 b3 b4 b7 and b9 due to the seasonal differences of rainfall events srem2d was calibrated for each season summer fall winter and spring separately the calibrated parameters are summarized in table 5 fig 4 shows the cumulative rainfall time series of the srem2d ensemble median gray solid line the srem2d ensemble minimum and maximum light gray shaded area radar rainfall estimates black solid line and ground observations black dashed line for a small sub basin in r1 b8 santa cruz do timbó timbó river 2448 km2 a medium size sub basin in r2 b5 são mateus do sul iguaçu river 5440 km2 and a large sub basin in r3 b9 união da vitória iguaçu river 21 536 km2 in the medium sub basin the srem2d ensemble reduced significantly the bias in the radar data by 2000 mm resulting in values closer to the rain gauge time series considered to be the benchmark however in the small basin the bias reduction caused an overall underestimation of 1000 mm which is due to the fact that the bias is not constant in time and may change from the calibration to the validation period over the entire basin srem2d produces the best correction 2000 mm and the ensemble mean almost completely overlaps the reference cumulative rainfall the large basin showed smaller ensemble spread than the small and mid size sub basins due to the fact that smaller areas are more affected by topographic heterogeneity which enhances the precipitation spatio temporal variability 4 3 streamflow time series analysis the hydrological model ability of simulating streamflow when forced with i rain gauge observations triangles ii radar rainfall estimates stars and iii srem2d rainfall ensemble boxplots was assessed through the nse and nselog as a function of basin area during 2008 2010 fig 5 results showed an improvement in the statistical metrics when the srem2d ensemble was used as input to mhd inpe instead of the radar estimates in all sub basins except for b8 in the case of the nse where the performance of the ensemble was slightly worse when compared to the results generated using radar rainfall estimates this can be explained by a combination of factors firstly when compared to the rain gauge observations both radar rainfall estimates and the srem2d ensemble had similar absolute error in b8 making streamflow simulations insensitive to the srem2d bias correction fig 4a in addition radar rainfall estimates were consistently larger than observations while the ensemble members underestimating rain gauge observations particularly during more intense rainfall events as the hydrological model tended to underestimate flow peaks overestimations in rainfall estimations tended to have a positive influence by correcting the model deficiency in simulating high flows finally it should be noted that the extrapolation of rating curves for high flows adds uncertainty particularly in the case of small and fast response catchments such as b8 where peak discharge is rarely measured systematic rbias and random ubrmse errors in the simulated streamflow time series were investigated for a cascade of basin scales 1808 21 536 km2 and are shown in fig 6 srem2d was able to significantly remove the bias in the radar dataset regardless of the basin dimension with an average bias removal of 0 5 the positive rbias in streamflow was also removed in b8 although it resulted in a slight underestimation the srem2d ensemble forced streamflow simulation improved the rbias in most sub basins on the other hand the random error depicted by the ubrmse increased with the catchment area as larger flows are observed in larger sub basins in larger basins like b5 b7 and b9 srem2d reduced the streamflow random error with respect to simulations that used radar rainfall estimates as input to the hydrological model 4 4 event based performance analysis in order to assess the ability of srem2d to improve flood monitoring and prediction an event based performance analysis was conducted firstly flood events were identified during the srem2d validation period using rain and streamflow observations in each sub basin using cpm table 6 shows the number of streamflow events in each sub basin and the average properties of these events sixty six events were identified by cpm in nine sub basins during the period december 2008 november 2010 table 2 fig 7 presents streamflow events from model simulations forced by i radar rainfall estimates black solid line rain gauge observations black dashed line the srem2d ensemble median gray solid line and minimum and maximum of the srem2d ensemble envelope light gray shaded area three catchments of different drainage area were then selected and performance statistics were computed for three different rainfall events with contrasting behavior resulting in nine representative streamflow events identified by cpm the chosen streamflow events included six multi peaks events and three single peak events with recurrence period around 4 2 years in b8 6 6 years in b5 and 10 years in b9 these events were associated with stratiform and or convective precipitation the hydrograph of each event was evaluated for all the simulation cases i e using the three different rainfall inputs results showed that the use of srem2d significantly improved the streamflow simulations removing the bias in the radar rainfall product additionally events in the small sub basin b8 in r1 and in the mid sized sub basin b5 in r2 presented larger ensemble spreads when compared to the large basin which is due to higher precipitation uncertainties in regions characterized by complex terrain fig 8 shows the relative bias of rainfall and streamflow properties for radar rainfall data and radar forced simulations stars and for the srem2d ensemble mean and srem2d ensemble mean forced simulations squares for the events identified in fig 7 the radar dataset significantly overestimated the cumulative rainfall volume vr which led to an overestimation in the cumulative flow volume vq of all the events srem2d was able to reduce the overestimation in the cumulative rainfall volume and corresponding streamflow volume estimated by the radar the largest overestimation of rainfall and streamflow volumes was observed in mid size and large sub basins the relative biases of tlag for radar rainfall estimates and the srem2d ensemble mean are close to zero showing that both radar and srem2d well reproduced the time lag between mass centers of rainfall events and their corresponding hydrographs the relative biases in the hyetograph and hydrograph shape parameters sr and sq are also very close to zero this demonstrated that both radar rainfall estimates and the srem2d ensemble mean were able to well represent the benchmark hyetograph and hydrograph shape parameters 5 conclusions this study investigated the efficiency of correcting radar rainfall estimates using the srem2d error model to simulate streamflow in the iguaçu basin characterized by complex topography and seasonal rainfall variability the mhd inpe hydrological model was shown to properly simulate streamflow across the basin when calibrated with rain gauge observations however the model showed some limitations in the headwater basins because of the high spatio temporal precipitation variability in complex terrain since the calibration of the hydrological model suffered from uncertainties related to low density rain gauge network it is important to assess how rainfall runoff model calibration results would be affected when bias corrected radar rainfall estimates are used in place of interpolated rain gauge measurements due to the region complex topography the distance from the radar affecting the radar product quality and precipitation seasonality the srem2d error model was regionally calibrated during the four seasons results showed that srem2d reduced significantly the bias in the radar rainfall product particularly in medium and large size basins 5 440 21 536 km2 improvements in the model performance were observed when the srem2d ensemble was used as input to mhd inpe in place of radar estimates for all catchment sizes except for a small basin in r1 where the model performance using radar estimates was already very close to the one of the reference overall srem2d was able to significantly remove the bias in the radar dataset regardless of the basin size furthermore the streamflow ensemble showed a reduction in the systematic error when compared to streamflow simulated with rain gauge for most sub basins the random error increased with the catchment area but the proposed technique reduced the random error in larger basins nine flood events were analyzed in the basin during the study period and the use of srem2d significantly improved streamflow simulations during these events srem2d also reduced the bias of cumulative rainfall and streamflow volumes during the selected flood events moreover both the radar dataset and the srem2d ensemble were able to properly reproduce the flood event time lags and hyetograph and hydrograph shape parameters this study demonstrated the potential of using an error model traditionally applied to satellite precipitation products to correct radar rainfall estimates for real time streamflow monitoring forecasting and flood risk mapping as the methodology was tested only in the iguaçu basin future work should verify the performance of the proposed methodology in other basins of the world to generalize these results to different climatological regions acknowledgments this work was partially supported by the national council for scientific and technological
