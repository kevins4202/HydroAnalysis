12760,an alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm aabf and fluidized bed crystallization fbc coupled system was constructed to examine the feasibility of using phosphorus p metabolic mechanism to enrich p and the availability of large size and high purity vivianite crystals in this study the results demonstrated that the stable operation of aabf system could be maintained by operating the biofilm system through p metabolic mechanism of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and the p concentration of 204 5 3 2 mg l could be obtained the metabolic mode of paos shifted from gam to pam as the pbiofilm increased which led to paos being able to absorb release more p wherein extracellular polymer substance eps and cell both played an indispensable role in the metabolism of p uptake release in the p recovery stage the maximum p recovery efficiency reached 94 6 3 1 and the main crystals formed were vivianite crystals moreover the percentage of fep and cap was 80 93 and 3 9 in precipitate and the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was 83 2 furthermore the size of vivianite crystal increased with the generated vivianite as seed crystal what s more the lca revealed that carbon dioxide equivalent co2 eq emissions sulfur dioxide equivalent so2 eq emissions and phosphate equivalent po4 eq emissions were 13 3 15 1 kg co2 eq kg vivianite 0 10 0 11 kg so2 eq kg vivianite 0 031 0 037 kg po4 eq kg vivianite respectively the ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 was the optimum condition to ensure high p recovery efficiency and reduced potential environmental emissions this process system laid the groundwork for recovering p from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phosphorus enrichment phosphorus content phosphorus recovery vivianite lca data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is a scarce resource 1 and it is also an indispensable component of living organisms and lithium iron phosphate batteries 2 3 meanwhile p can lead to the eutrophication of water bodies if it is discharged indiscriminately 4 6 the p storage is not sufficient to be utilized for 100 years 7 9 fortunately the recovery of p from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps can meet 15 25 of the current p requirements 8 10 which makes up for the shortage of p resources therefore it is necessary to perform research on the recovery of p from wwtps at present the recovery of p as struvite is a common p recovery method 11 12 but an additional source of magnesium is required as the concentration of magnesium in wastewater is lower than that of p and ammonium 13 14 reducing the economic viability of this technology on the contrary vivianite has a good application prospect because of its high economic and industrial value 15 16 and it has attracted considerable attention from many scholars the available p recovery technology can be divided into the recovery of p from sewage sludge and ash but the recovery of p from sludge and ash requires high energy consumption such as heating strong acid treatment and anaerobic digestion equipment 17 18 which are contrary to the national policy of energy saving and emission reduction this has led many researchers to undertake studies on the recovery of p from wastewater nowadays crystallization has been recognized as one of the most effective methods for recovering p from wastewater but the p concentration of domestic sewage is lower than the standard p 50 mg l of recovering p from sewage by crystallization 19 20 many researchers separate and enrich p from sewage by using the membrane method but this has great challenges due to the consumption of membrane caused by membrane fouling and channel clogging which indicates that the membrane method is not suitable for long term p enrichment some previous studies have shown that the alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm aaab system can greatly enrich p from wastewater and obtain a high concentration of p in solution 21 22 hence an aaab system is used to directly enrich p and then the obtained p solution is performed for recovering p as vivianite by the fluidized bed crystallization fbc system after the p concentration of the recirculated solution is stable in this study the current studies are limited to using carbon sources dissolved oxygen do to stimulate the p release from polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos to obtain high concentrations of p in solution 22 23 while these reports neglect to enrich p based on the p uptake release mechanisms of paos even though the p uptake release efficiency is affected by the change of p content in biofilm pbiofilm 21 22 this is completely insufficient for the realization of p enrichment mechanisms if the p enrichment can be promoted based on the metabolic mechanisms of paos in the aaab fbc coupled system the energy consumed by using additional carbon sources and increasing do concentration could be saved meanwhile there is a limit to the p storage capacity of paos in our previous reports 22 23 which may be easily overlooked furthermore the previous report has indicated that it is necessary to maintain a balance between the p concentration in the liquid and the p content in the sludge when the p is recovered 24 otherwise the p concentration in the effluent will not meet stringent discharge standards therefore it is imperative to achieve high p concentration based on the metabolic mechanism of p in paos although a few studies have been carried out on the recovery of p as vivianite obtaining high quality crystals of purity above 95 from the wastewater remains a great challenge 25 26 moreover the size and purity of crystals have a linear relationship with their economic value and industrial value and the production of vivianite can be affected by ph and the molar ratio of fe p 27 28 so it is necessary to optimize the crystallization process of vivianite to obtain high purity and large size crystals meanwhile life cycle assessment lca has been applied to the production processes as a tool for evaluating the impact on the environment in the production process since the policy of energy saving and emission reduction has been stipulated 29 31 moreover lca was used to assess the environmental impact of struvite production by synthetic p solution and seawater in lab scale experiments and the results indicated that the use of seawater could reduce the chemical cost 30 50 and co2 emissions of struvite production 8 40 13 nevertheless there is no research has been undertaken to analyze how to reduce the environmental impact of the vivianite production process to compensate for this deficiency it is necessary to optimize the size and purity of vivianite crystals and assess potential environmental emissions by lca analysis of vivianite crystallization to further facilitate the p enrichment and recovery process a comprehensive resource recovery process for municipal wastewater was proposed in our previous study 22 which focused on the recovery of organic matter and p resources in wastewater were recovered as energy or products that could be used efficiently fig s1 in the p enrichment and recovery process an aabf fbc system was constructed i to investigate the p enrichment performance of biofilm system and obtain a high p concentration based on the metabolic mechanism of p ii to study the feasibility of recovering p as vivianite and the reaction conditions to obtain high crystal purity iii to promote crystal formation and particle size growth iv to assess potential environmental emissions of vivianite crystallization 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater was composed of tap water per liter p provided by kh2po4 10 mg nahco3 40 mg and the nutrients as follows nh4cl 40 mg mgso4 7h2o 90 mg cacl2 2h2o 14 mg edta 2na 3 mg and 40 ml trace element solution as reported by liu et al 32 the content of different elements was shown in supplementary material table s1 in addition the organic medium contained chemical oxygen demand cod 20 000 mg l 1 provided by sodium acetate and the same nutrients as synthetic wastewater ensuring a cod of 200 mg l in the anaerobic phase of the reactor moreover 4 l of tap water was used to add to the recirculated solution then p was released into the solution in the anaerobic phase after p was harvested moreover the ph value was 7 0 8 2 and the temperature was 18 26 c 2 2 system operation the aabf system was a lab scale reactor that was inoculated with activated sludge collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing china the aabf system contained a 6 l reactor a 180 l wastewater tank a 180 l treated wastewater tank a 2 l organic matter tank and a 30 l recirculation tank fig 1 the carrier filling ratio was 40 the system was packed with kaldnes k1 polyethene carrier with 900 m2 m3 average specific surface area and the biomass stabilized at 40 2 4 6 mg carrier moreover the aabf system was exposed to an alternating aerobic environment do concentration 4 0 1 5 mg l and an anaerobic environment with a volume exchange ratio was 100 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the anaerobic stage and the aerobic stage was 4 h and 2 h respectively furthermore the system operation consisted of these parts i during the aerobic phase the inlet valve was closed after the wastewater reached 5 l in the reactor then the wastewater was drained into the effluent tank after 4 h of aeration and agitation ii during the anaerobic phase the inlet valve was closed after the enriched solution reached 5 l in the biofilm reactor 50 ml organic substrate had been pumped into the reactor then the stream was discharged into the recirculation tank after 2 h of agitation iii the p in enrichment tank was concentrated after the reactor has been operated about 15 days and the enriched solution about 6 5 l was harvested when the p concentration was stable moreover a 1 l p enriched solution was pumped into the fbc system inner diameter was 10 cm height was 15 cm effective volume was 1 l at the beginning of the crystallization reaction which needed to be purged with nitrogen gas to keep the anaerobic environment meanwhile ph was controlled by adding the 1 m naoh solution according to the ph online monitor and then the ferrous sulfate solution 2 m was pumped into the fbc system to react with p to form vivianite during the crystallization reaction the upstream speed was 25 m h 1 so that the recovered products with smaller particle sizes could be fully mixed with the solution to generate large particles and the hrt of the crystallizer was 5 h after the crystallization reaction was completed the supernatant was discharged from the effluent outlet and the crystals were collected from the outlet valve below the reactor 2 3 experimental operation the p enrichment solution 26 l from harvest 4th 7th was collected in a 50 l air tight container and used in the vivianite crystallization experiments and the elemental characteristic values for the concentrated solution were presented in table s2 in addition preliminary experiment results indicated the optimum reaction time of 5 h fig s2 all experiments in this study were operated at different ph values 5 6 7 8 9 and fe p molar ratios 1 1 5 2 in the multiple crystallization experiment the generated vivianite was used as the seed crystal to increase the crystal particle size 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 chemical analysis the influent was sampled from the sampling port of reactor after the feed was completed and the effluent was sampled from the sampling port before the solution was drained the chemical oxygen demand cod and phosphorus calculated by p were measured with the standard method 5220 and method 4500 p respectively 33 and the detailed steps were referred to previous reports 21 22 in addition the ph and do were monitored with a hach sl1000 water quality monitor 2 4 2 polymer analysis the total p in the biofilm was measured by the smt method and the detailed steps were referred to the article 9 the sludge 0 2 g was burned in a muffle furnace thermo fisher for 3 h at 450 c then the powder was placed in 3 5 m hydrochloric acid and shaken for 16 h and the p concentration in the supernatant was measured after the 8 min centrifugation eps was extracted by cer method as it was more efficient than the thermal extraction method to extract eps 34 the 10 ml biomass sample was taken to be centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and then the biomass was washed with sodium chloride solution after the supernatant was discarded the biomass was added to the tube which contained 20 ml of 0 1 mm sodium chloride solution then cer 70 g g vss was added to extracted eps with an ice water bath at 500 rpm for 6 h the mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c after the resin particles were removed moreover the supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm pore size membrane to obtain an eps solution and the cell part could be obtained after the precipitate was disrupted with an ultrasonic cell disruptor then the p content and morphology of the eps and cell were measured after the eps solution and cell fraction were freeze dried about 48 h the distribution and species of p in paos in the aabf system were analyzed by using a nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the detailed steps were referred to the previous report 35 the detailed steps were referred to the previous report 21 22 2 4 3 vivianite crystal analysis to qualify the properties and components of the crystal the scanning electron microscope sem hitachi 3400x and the energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds were performed moreover the structure of the crystal was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd bruker advanced d8 with a 2θ range of 5 to 75 the chemical states of the crystal were qualified by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with the thermo escalab 250xi system especially the precipitates were required to be dried at 60 c before the precipitate could be detected the different form of p was determined with the hupfer method fig s3 the residue was washed with deionized water once then the p concentration in the supernatant was determined after the 8 min of centrifugation the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was calculated as follows percentage m p p v m p 2 m v m c where mp is the mass of precipitate g pv is the percentage of vivianite in the precipitate mp is the molar mass of p 31 g mol 1 mv is the molar mass of vivianite 502 g mol 1 mc is the mass of p consumed by the reaction g meanwhile the size of the crystal was analyzed 5 times by using the laser particle size analyzer mastesizer 3000 the detailed steps were as below an amount of the product was added to the wet sampler and the size of crystal was analyzed 5 times by using the laser particle size analyzer at 1500 rpm with the refractive index 1 58 and density 2 68 g cm 3 furthermore the average particle size dx 50 of crystals was calculated and the distribution of crystals with different sizes were painted 2 5 life cycle assessment the effect of vivianite crystallization on the environmental impact of phosphorus enrichment and crystallization systems was assessed by life cycle assessment lca one kilogram of vivianite was used as the functional unit the system boundary included the chemicals and pump the lca was analyzed with the simapro 9 1 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 p uptake release performance the aabf system was continuously operated for 155 d harvest 1st 7th to evaluate the p uptake release mechanism of paos to obtain a high p concentration during the formation stage of biofilm 1 25 d the p concentration of the aerobic effluent was above 0 5 mg l while the cod concentration of anaerobic effluent was much 50 mg l during the stabilization stage of biofilm 25 155 d the p concentration of aerobic effluent in each cycle showed an increasing trend over time which gradually increased from 0 2 0 05 mg l to 1 75 0 25 mg l fig 2a moreover the cod concentration of the effluent was 40 2 5 9 mg l and the p concentration gradually stabilized at 87 2 1 8 mg l harvest 1st 92 7 2 3 mg l harvest 2nd 149 5 2 7 mg l harvest 3rd 173 2 2 8 mg l harvest 4th 193 5 2 9 mg l harvest 5th 204 5 3 2 mg l harvest 6th under the condition of 200 mg l cod fig 2b the concentration of p recovery solution 204 5 3 2 mg l was significantly higher than that 133 mg l reported by tian et al 36 furthermore the p enrichment efficiency was 73 8 fig 2c which was higher than that of the previous report which indicated that the p enrichment efficiency was 48 0 table 1 when the recovery of p from the alternating anaerobic aerobic biofilter 36 taking the stage of harvest 5th as an example the amount of p uptake at the aerobic stage showed an irregular trend which rose from 9 9 mg l to 10 35 mg l and then decreased to 9 7 mg l fig 3a whereas the p removal efficiency decreased from 98 7 to 90 4 fig 3b meanwhile p release from the anaerobic phase gradually decreased from 42 5 mg l to 7 8 mg l moreover the pbiofilm was positively related to p concentration in the recirculated solution the p content increased from 46 7 1 6 mg g ss to 82 5 2 5 mg g ss fig 3c while the p concentration increased from 42 5 0 5 mg l to 173 2 2 1 mg l interestingly the pbiofilm and p concentration in the enrichment solution stabilized at the end of the stage what s more the eps content was stable at 97 5 mg g fig 3d while the pn ps ratio was in the range of 3 2 3 4 which revealed that the changes in p content were not significantly associated with eps content and the p recovery had no effect on biofilm properties after the biofilm was acclimated for 25 days the paos gradually adapted to the environment paos could absorb p in synthetic wastewater so that the p concentration in the effluent was below 0 5 mg l during the start of p harvest stage p in the wastewater could be absorbed by paos subsequently the increased pbiofilm would cause the metabolic model of paos to shift from gam to pam 39 40 which resulted in the uptake of p by paos then an increase in p uptake during the aerobic phase on the other hand glycolysis could generate additional atp to provide equivalents and acetyl coa for pha synthesis so a reduction in glycogen degradation reduced the synthesis of pha 39 40 the pbiofilm stabilized at 82 5 1 6 mg g ss at the end of the p harvest stage which indicated that there was a limitation of p storage capacity in paos and the paos could not absorb more p at this stage moreover the p concentration in the recirculated tank stabilized at 173 2 2 1 mg l which reduced the concentration gradient between the p content in paos and the recirculated solution resulting in the p of the biofilm cannot be released into solutions with the high p concentrations 41 the enriched solution had to be harvested as the p concentration of aerobic effluent was far from meeting the stringent water quality standards moreover the p was readily transferred to a new recirculated solution as the existence of a concentration gradient after p harvesting resulting in the maximum p release exhibited at the beginning of each p harvest stage furthermore paos could restore the glycolytic pathway to produce additional pha thereby increasing the synthesis of pha and glycogen 21 22 3 2 p uptake release metabolism the nmr was used to measure the p form and distribution in eps and cell which was extremely significant for elucidating the p uptake release mechanism by paos the findings indicated that pbiofilm increased from 46 7 1 6 mg g ss to 82 5 2 5 mg g ss at harvest 5th stage and the p content in eps increased from 32 4 mg g ss 69 4 to 57 3 mg g ss 68 6 table 2 moreover the p release in the anaerobic phase decreased from 8 5 mg g ss to 3 mg g ss with the p release in eps decreasing from 4 3 mg g ss to 2 0 mg g ss and the p release in cell decreasing from 4 2 mg g ss to 1 0 mg g ss furthermore four types of p ortho phosphate ortho p and poly phosphate poly p pyro phosphate pyro p mono phosphate mono p were observed in paos fig s4 s5 which was consistent with the previous results 42 wherein the ortho p 68 3 79 9 and poly p 16 0 27 0 were the predominant species in paos moreover the amount of ortho p and poly p contributed 25 8 49 5 and 14 0 63 3 of the p released in eps while the amount of ortho p and poly p comprised 23 0 65 9 and 30 0 31 0 of the p released in cell these results demonstrated that the minimal amount of p release could appear when the p content increased to the limitation of p storage capacity especially eps and cell both played an indispensable role in the metabolism of p uptake release wherein the ortho p and poly p were the major components of p metabolism by eps cell which was consistent with the previous report 7 9 what s more eps and cell were implicated in the transport and storage of p wherein the part of ortho p in eps played a major role in the p release process which was different from previous studies 43 compared with other processes the hrt of the alternating aerobic anaerobic operation was shorter resulting in more p being stored in the eps and the species of p were also affected by the high p concentration solution because the release of p was inhibited when the concentration gradient between pbiofilm and p concentration in the recirculated solution decreased in general the paos could absorb p at the initiation of the p enrichment phase as paos were unsaturated and then the metabolic mode of paos shifted from gam to pam as the pbiofilm increased which led to paos being able to absorb and release more p meanwhile intracellular ortho p and proton h were released into the eps through carrier proteins generating pmf that drove the uptake of the carbon source during the anaerobic phase however the p cannot be completely absorbed as the limitation of p storage of paos resulting in the aerobic effluent does not meet the water quality standard the p in cell was not enough to be completely released into the solution of high p concentration due to the gradual disappearance of concentration gradient paos lose the pmf to absorb carbon sources during the anaerobic phase 44 hence the p harvest was required to keep the system running steadily when the p concentration in the recirculating solution remained stable moreover the saturated p within paos was readily transferred to a new recirculated solution after p harvesting and the capability of p uptake of paos was restored therefore it was extremely significant to operate the biofilm reactor by following the p uptake release mechanism by paos 3 3 the p recovery efficiency during the crystallization of vivianite the effects of different ph 5 6 7 8 9 and the molar ratio of fe p 1 1 5 2 on p recovery efficiency were investigated under the same p condition 180 1 mg l the results indicated that p recovery efficiency increased from 81 3 to 94 6 when ph increased from 5 to 7 however a significant increase in p concentration was observed when ph increased from 7 to 9 and p recovery efficiency decreased from 94 6 3 1 to 80 6 32 1 furthermore the highest p recovery efficiency was 94 6 3 1 at the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 fig s6 the vivianite could dissolve under strongly acidic conditions causing the re dissolution of phosphate ions in the solution which resulted in lower p recovery efficiency and crystal purity on the contrary free hydroxide ions increased under strongly alkaline conditions thereby increasing the chance of the combination of iron ions and hydroxide ions to form the precipitation of fe oh 2 as its saturation indices changed from negative to positive with the increase of ph table s4 while the combination of ferrous ions and phosphate ions reduced furthermore the formation of insoluble fe oh 2 hindered the formation of vivianite allowing p to be released into the solution the supersaturation was increased when the concentration of ferrous ions rose at the same ph condition so the crystallization reaction proceeded in a positive direction and produced more vivianite however too much supersaturation not only increased the dosage but also caused the crystals to nucleate spontaneously forming more small crystals and causing uneven crystal particle size in addition the p recovery efficiency 94 6 3 1 in this process was greater than the 63 reported by previous research 25 which illustrated the great potential of using an alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm and fluidized bed crystallization coupled system for enriching and recovering p 3 4 product purity the purity of the product was closely related to its economic value so it was necessary to explore the crystal purity obtained under the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 the presence of pure struvite in all experiments was confirmed by xrd and xps as shown in fig s7 s9 the product spectrum had sharp peaks with the 2θ of 11 148 13 144 21 759 and 27 769 which was consistent with the vivianite standard spectrum pdf 30 0662 this result showed that the main crystal generated under this condition was vivianite with a diffraction peak intensity of 90 the composition of elements in sludge powders was determined by xps the xps spectrum of crystal exhibited distinct signal peaks of fe 2p o 1s c 1s and p 2p and the binding energies of 712 15 ev 531 43 ev 285 15 ev and 133 74 ev respectively fig 4a the xps spectrum of fe 2p p 2p and o 1s was showed in fig 4b d moreover the spectrum of fe 2p was deconvoluted into two main peaks corresponding to the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 711 8 ev and fe 2p1 2 725 6 ev which was similar to the binding energy of the fe state 45 furthermore the peaks of fe2 appeared at 715 ev 725 ev and 729 ev while the peaks of fe3 appeared at 712 ev and the content of fe2 and fe3 were 88 5 and 11 5 respectively fig 4b in the p2p xps spectrum the peak of phosphate in the precipitate appeared at 133 2 ev 45 and the percentage of phosphate was about 65 6 which illustrated that phosphate mainly existed as vivianite however the binding energy of 132 6 ev corresponded to the peak of organophosphorus the percentage was 35 4 fig 4c which was released by apoptotic microbial and paos but this did not affect the purity of vivianite moreover ferrous iron accounted for 88 5 of the total iron and the percentage of vivianite in the precipitate was 82 so it could be calculated that the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was 83 2 at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 the percentage was consistent with the previous report 70 90 15 16 indicating the potential of this process to obtain high p recovery efficiency and crystal purity in addition the eds analysis showed that the relative contents of the fe p and o elements accounted for a high proportion of the total elements which was consistent with previous reports by zhang et al 25 moreover the analysis of sem revealed that the crystal generated under the optimal conditions was generally recognized as plate like fig s10 and the shapes of the fe p and o elements were closely distributed on the crystal particles indicating that the proportion of fe p o elements accounted for a high proportion in the crystal these results indicated that the products generated under the optimal conditions were mainly the vivianite crystals furthermore the saturation indices were analyzed with the visual minteq and the input to the analysis of saturation was shown in table s3 the results demonstrated that the saturation indices of vivianite were increased from 5 2 to 16 1 with the ph increased from 5 to 9 at fe p 1 1 which revealed the formation of vivianite was reliable moreover the saturation indices of mg3 po4 2 were negative as the magnesium concentration was too weak to induce precipitation however the saturation indices of hydroxyapatite changed from 8 2 to 12 3 table s4 which indicated hydroxyapatite could be generated in this study to investigate the purity of the vivianite precipitate the crystals were fractionated and extracted using the hupfer method the results indicated that the percentage of fep and cap was 80 93 and 3 9 and the highest percentage of fep was 93 at ph 7 fe p 1 5 1 fig s11 in addition the saturation index of hydroxyapatite became positive as the ph increased indicating that the possibility of cap precipitation increased however the saturation index of cap was lower than fep table s4 which indicated that fep was preferentially produced in the vivianite crystallization and ca2 reacted with the residual p to generate hydroxyapatite after vivianite was formed so the low concentration of ca2 has little effect on vivianite crystallization in conclusion ph 8 5 and mg p 1 5 1 was considered to be the optimal operating condition to ensure the purity of vivianite 3 5 size distribution as shown in fig 5a the size of the crystals under each condition remained in the range of 58 15 59 96 μm this result illustrated that the size of vivianite was different from that of the struvite crystallization process which could be achieved by adjusting the molar ratio of mg p and ph 46 to better improve the vivianite crystals in the p recovery process the effect of the number of crystallization times on the crystal size by using vivianite as a seed crystal was explored in this study the results showed that the p recovery efficiency could be kept at 92 2 95 1 after multiple crystallizations table s5 moreover the crystal size of vivianite increased with the increase in crystallization times which increased from 59 5 μm to 215 1 μm table s5 the highest size was much greater than the size in the previous report 46 48 however the crystal particle size of vivianite grew slowly after 3 times of crystallization with the increase in the crystallization times the particle size of the crystals gradually changed from a single peak to a double peak fig 5b which indicated that the particle size of the vivianite crystals would be unevenly distributed as the number of the crystallization increased the fewer the times of crystallization the lower the number of nuclei produced by crystallization resulting in difficulties in the rapid growth of vivianite on the contrary more nuclei were produced when the number of crystallizations increased and the vivianite crystals grew gradually with themselves as a seed crystal 3 6 lca and chemical cost analysis to explore the environmental impact of phosphorus enrichment and crystallization systems the potential environmental factor emissions were assessed by lca the results indicated that the potential environmental emissions changed significantly with the changes in ph and fe p value and the potential carbon dioxide equivalent co2 eq emissions and 1 4 db eq emissions were the main environmental factors fig 6a moreover co2 eq emissions decreased from 16 8 kg co2 eq kg vivianite to 16 4 kg co2 eq kg vivianite with the ph increased from 5 to7 and co2 eq emissions increased from 16 4 kg co2 eq kg vivianite to 18 6 kg co2 eq kg vivianite as ph increased from 7 to 9 fig 6b meanwhile 1 4 db eq emissions sulfur dioxide equivalent so2 eq emissions and phosphate equivalent po4 eq emissions also showed consistent with co2 eq emissions and their values were 13 3 15 1 kg 1 4 db eq kg vivianite 0 10 0 11 kg so2 eq kg vivianite 0 031 0 037 kg po4 eq kg vivianite respectively fig 6c e as shown in fig 6c f sodium acetate was the largest contributor to potential emissions in this coupled system with its contribution to global warming water aquatic ecotox acidification and eutrophication ranging from 51 to 57 33 38 40 45 and 37 42 respectively in addition potassium dihydrogen phosphate was the second largest contributor accounting for 9 11 24 27 18 20 and 18 21 respectively in this study an additional organic source was required to obtain a high phosphorus solution to meet the metabolic demands of paos since a heating step is required in the production of sodium acetate a large amount of energy is consumed resulting in a large increase in co2 eq emissions meanwhile the process of producing dipotassium hydrogen phosphate is a reaction between potassium carbonate and phosphoric acid solution at 80 100 c ph 4 5 with high temperatures and acidity consuming large amounts of energy furthermore although the minimum potential emission occurred at ph 7 and fe p 1 1 the maximum phosphorus recovery efficiency and relatively low potential emission at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 demonstrated that ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 was the optimum condition to ensure phosphorus recovery efficiency and reduced potential environmental emissions chemical costs account for a large proportion of overall costs this study revealed that some chemicals were required to recover 1 kg of vivianite table s6 and the total cost of 2446 9 3054 9 ton vivianite was required to recover 1 kg of vivianite in the aabf fbc system the unit price of the chemical was shown in the table s7 the reason for this large price difference was that a large amount of sodium hydroxide was added to maintain the alkaline environment in this study however it was found that the highest purity and recovery of crystals were achieved at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 and 0 95 kg of feso4 7h2o and 0 03 kg of hcl were required to recover 1 kg of vivianite under the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 corresponding to a total cost of 2468 5 ton vivianite when the chemical costs were considered however when the influent in the p enrichment process uses domestic sewage to recover phosphorus the chemical costs in the aabf system should not be included in the overall chemical costs which reduces the overall chemical costs from 2468 5 ton to 60 3 ton comparatively the total cost of recovering struvite was 318 9 556 7 ton struvite from concentrated wastewater due to expensive reagents mgso4 7h2o and naoh in struvite production 49 which was significantly higher than the cost of recovering p as vivianite at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 moreover the benchmark price of struvite was 500 ton which was cheaper than the benchmark price of vivianite 10 000 ton 50 therefore the recovery of p as vivianite was economically viable by using an alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm and fluidized bed crystallization coupled system however this lca and chemical cost analysis was based on the result of lab scale experiments which was different with the lca analysis of full scale wwtps hence a comprehensive lca and economic analysis on the recovery of p as vivianite from wwtps needed to be considered 4 conclusion the reactor was operated in harvest 1st 7th stages to explore the efficiency p metabolic mechanism of paos and the potential environmental emissions in the aaab fbc coupled system the results showed that determining the operating cycle of the reactor through the p content limitation and p uptake release mechanism could ensure the aerobic effluent meet the water quality requirements and the p concentration of 204 5 3 2 mg l could be obtained the highest p recovery efficiency was 94 6 at the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 moreover the main crystal formed under this condition was vivianite crystals and the crystals were composed of fe p and o elements which were the main elements for making up the vivianite moreover fep was preferentially produced in the vivianite crystallization than cap as the saturation index of cap was lower than fep so the low concentration of ca2 had little effect on vivianite crystallization and the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was 83 2 what s more the crystal size of vivianite increased with the increase of crystallization times it increased from 59 5 μm to 215 1 μm the lca and chemical cost revealed that ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 was the optimum condition to ensure high phosphorus recovery efficiency and reduced potential environmental emissions which indicated that recovering p as vivianite was highly economically viable in

12760,an alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm aabf and fluidized bed crystallization fbc coupled system was constructed to examine the feasibility of using phosphorus p metabolic mechanism to enrich p and the availability of large size and high purity vivianite crystals in this study the results demonstrated that the stable operation of aabf system could be maintained by operating the biofilm system through p metabolic mechanism of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and the p concentration of 204 5 3 2 mg l could be obtained the metabolic mode of paos shifted from gam to pam as the pbiofilm increased which led to paos being able to absorb release more p wherein extracellular polymer substance eps and cell both played an indispensable role in the metabolism of p uptake release in the p recovery stage the maximum p recovery efficiency reached 94 6 3 1 and the main crystals formed were vivianite crystals moreover the percentage of fep and cap was 80 93 and 3 9 in precipitate and the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was 83 2 furthermore the size of vivianite crystal increased with the generated vivianite as seed crystal what s more the lca revealed that carbon dioxide equivalent co2 eq emissions sulfur dioxide equivalent so2 eq emissions and phosphate equivalent po4 eq emissions were 13 3 15 1 kg co2 eq kg vivianite 0 10 0 11 kg so2 eq kg vivianite 0 031 0 037 kg po4 eq kg vivianite respectively the ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 was the optimum condition to ensure high p recovery efficiency and reduced potential environmental emissions this process system laid the groundwork for recovering p from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phosphorus enrichment phosphorus content phosphorus recovery vivianite lca data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is a scarce resource 1 and it is also an indispensable component of living organisms and lithium iron phosphate batteries 2 3 meanwhile p can lead to the eutrophication of water bodies if it is discharged indiscriminately 4 6 the p storage is not sufficient to be utilized for 100 years 7 9 fortunately the recovery of p from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps can meet 15 25 of the current p requirements 8 10 which makes up for the shortage of p resources therefore it is necessary to perform research on the recovery of p from wwtps at present the recovery of p as struvite is a common p recovery method 11 12 but an additional source of magnesium is required as the concentration of magnesium in wastewater is lower than that of p and ammonium 13 14 reducing the economic viability of this technology on the contrary vivianite has a good application prospect because of its high economic and industrial value 15 16 and it has attracted considerable attention from many scholars the available p recovery technology can be divided into the recovery of p from sewage sludge and ash but the recovery of p from sludge and ash requires high energy consumption such as heating strong acid treatment and anaerobic digestion equipment 17 18 which are contrary to the national policy of energy saving and emission reduction this has led many researchers to undertake studies on the recovery of p from wastewater nowadays crystallization has been recognized as one of the most effective methods for recovering p from wastewater but the p concentration of domestic sewage is lower than the standard p 50 mg l of recovering p from sewage by crystallization 19 20 many researchers separate and enrich p from sewage by using the membrane method but this has great challenges due to the consumption of membrane caused by membrane fouling and channel clogging which indicates that the membrane method is not suitable for long term p enrichment some previous studies have shown that the alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm aaab system can greatly enrich p from wastewater and obtain a high concentration of p in solution 21 22 hence an aaab system is used to directly enrich p and then the obtained p solution is performed for recovering p as vivianite by the fluidized bed crystallization fbc system after the p concentration of the recirculated solution is stable in this study the current studies are limited to using carbon sources dissolved oxygen do to stimulate the p release from polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos to obtain high concentrations of p in solution 22 23 while these reports neglect to enrich p based on the p uptake release mechanisms of paos even though the p uptake release efficiency is affected by the change of p content in biofilm pbiofilm 21 22 this is completely insufficient for the realization of p enrichment mechanisms if the p enrichment can be promoted based on the metabolic mechanisms of paos in the aaab fbc coupled system the energy consumed by using additional carbon sources and increasing do concentration could be saved meanwhile there is a limit to the p storage capacity of paos in our previous reports 22 23 which may be easily overlooked furthermore the previous report has indicated that it is necessary to maintain a balance between the p concentration in the liquid and the p content in the sludge when the p is recovered 24 otherwise the p concentration in the effluent will not meet stringent discharge standards therefore it is imperative to achieve high p concentration based on the metabolic mechanism of p in paos although a few studies have been carried out on the recovery of p as vivianite obtaining high quality crystals of purity above 95 from the wastewater remains a great challenge 25 26 moreover the size and purity of crystals have a linear relationship with their economic value and industrial value and the production of vivianite can be affected by ph and the molar ratio of fe p 27 28 so it is necessary to optimize the crystallization process of vivianite to obtain high purity and large size crystals meanwhile life cycle assessment lca has been applied to the production processes as a tool for evaluating the impact on the environment in the production process since the policy of energy saving and emission reduction has been stipulated 29 31 moreover lca was used to assess the environmental impact of struvite production by synthetic p solution and seawater in lab scale experiments and the results indicated that the use of seawater could reduce the chemical cost 30 50 and co2 emissions of struvite production 8 40 13 nevertheless there is no research has been undertaken to analyze how to reduce the environmental impact of the vivianite production process to compensate for this deficiency it is necessary to optimize the size and purity of vivianite crystals and assess potential environmental emissions by lca analysis of vivianite crystallization to further facilitate the p enrichment and recovery process a comprehensive resource recovery process for municipal wastewater was proposed in our previous study 22 which focused on the recovery of organic matter and p resources in wastewater were recovered as energy or products that could be used efficiently fig s1 in the p enrichment and recovery process an aabf fbc system was constructed i to investigate the p enrichment performance of biofilm system and obtain a high p concentration based on the metabolic mechanism of p ii to study the feasibility of recovering p as vivianite and the reaction conditions to obtain high crystal purity iii to promote crystal formation and particle size growth iv to assess potential environmental emissions of vivianite crystallization 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater was composed of tap water per liter p provided by kh2po4 10 mg nahco3 40 mg and the nutrients as follows nh4cl 40 mg mgso4 7h2o 90 mg cacl2 2h2o 14 mg edta 2na 3 mg and 40 ml trace element solution as reported by liu et al 32 the content of different elements was shown in supplementary material table s1 in addition the organic medium contained chemical oxygen demand cod 20 000 mg l 1 provided by sodium acetate and the same nutrients as synthetic wastewater ensuring a cod of 200 mg l in the anaerobic phase of the reactor moreover 4 l of tap water was used to add to the recirculated solution then p was released into the solution in the anaerobic phase after p was harvested moreover the ph value was 7 0 8 2 and the temperature was 18 26 c 2 2 system operation the aabf system was a lab scale reactor that was inoculated with activated sludge collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing china the aabf system contained a 6 l reactor a 180 l wastewater tank a 180 l treated wastewater tank a 2 l organic matter tank and a 30 l recirculation tank fig 1 the carrier filling ratio was 40 the system was packed with kaldnes k1 polyethene carrier with 900 m2 m3 average specific surface area and the biomass stabilized at 40 2 4 6 mg carrier moreover the aabf system was exposed to an alternating aerobic environment do concentration 4 0 1 5 mg l and an anaerobic environment with a volume exchange ratio was 100 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the anaerobic stage and the aerobic stage was 4 h and 2 h respectively furthermore the system operation consisted of these parts i during the aerobic phase the inlet valve was closed after the wastewater reached 5 l in the reactor then the wastewater was drained into the effluent tank after 4 h of aeration and agitation ii during the anaerobic phase the inlet valve was closed after the enriched solution reached 5 l in the biofilm reactor 50 ml organic substrate had been pumped into the reactor then the stream was discharged into the recirculation tank after 2 h of agitation iii the p in enrichment tank was concentrated after the reactor has been operated about 15 days and the enriched solution about 6 5 l was harvested when the p concentration was stable moreover a 1 l p enriched solution was pumped into the fbc system inner diameter was 10 cm height was 15 cm effective volume was 1 l at the beginning of the crystallization reaction which needed to be purged with nitrogen gas to keep the anaerobic environment meanwhile ph was controlled by adding the 1 m naoh solution according to the ph online monitor and then the ferrous sulfate solution 2 m was pumped into the fbc system to react with p to form vivianite during the crystallization reaction the upstream speed was 25 m h 1 so that the recovered products with smaller particle sizes could be fully mixed with the solution to generate large particles and the hrt of the crystallizer was 5 h after the crystallization reaction was completed the supernatant was discharged from the effluent outlet and the crystals were collected from the outlet valve below the reactor 2 3 experimental operation the p enrichment solution 26 l from harvest 4th 7th was collected in a 50 l air tight container and used in the vivianite crystallization experiments and the elemental characteristic values for the concentrated solution were presented in table s2 in addition preliminary experiment results indicated the optimum reaction time of 5 h fig s2 all experiments in this study were operated at different ph values 5 6 7 8 9 and fe p molar ratios 1 1 5 2 in the multiple crystallization experiment the generated vivianite was used as the seed crystal to increase the crystal particle size 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 chemical analysis the influent was sampled from the sampling port of reactor after the feed was completed and the effluent was sampled from the sampling port before the solution was drained the chemical oxygen demand cod and phosphorus calculated by p were measured with the standard method 5220 and method 4500 p respectively 33 and the detailed steps were referred to previous reports 21 22 in addition the ph and do were monitored with a hach sl1000 water quality monitor 2 4 2 polymer analysis the total p in the biofilm was measured by the smt method and the detailed steps were referred to the article 9 the sludge 0 2 g was burned in a muffle furnace thermo fisher for 3 h at 450 c then the powder was placed in 3 5 m hydrochloric acid and shaken for 16 h and the p concentration in the supernatant was measured after the 8 min centrifugation eps was extracted by cer method as it was more efficient than the thermal extraction method to extract eps 34 the 10 ml biomass sample was taken to be centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and then the biomass was washed with sodium chloride solution after the supernatant was discarded the biomass was added to the tube which contained 20 ml of 0 1 mm sodium chloride solution then cer 70 g g vss was added to extracted eps with an ice water bath at 500 rpm for 6 h the mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c after the resin particles were removed moreover the supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm pore size membrane to obtain an eps solution and the cell part could be obtained after the precipitate was disrupted with an ultrasonic cell disruptor then the p content and morphology of the eps and cell were measured after the eps solution and cell fraction were freeze dried about 48 h the distribution and species of p in paos in the aabf system were analyzed by using a nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the detailed steps were referred to the previous report 35 the detailed steps were referred to the previous report 21 22 2 4 3 vivianite crystal analysis to qualify the properties and components of the crystal the scanning electron microscope sem hitachi 3400x and the energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds were performed moreover the structure of the crystal was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd bruker advanced d8 with a 2θ range of 5 to 75 the chemical states of the crystal were qualified by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with the thermo escalab 250xi system especially the precipitates were required to be dried at 60 c before the precipitate could be detected the different form of p was determined with the hupfer method fig s3 the residue was washed with deionized water once then the p concentration in the supernatant was determined after the 8 min of centrifugation the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was calculated as follows percentage m p p v m p 2 m v m c where mp is the mass of precipitate g pv is the percentage of vivianite in the precipitate mp is the molar mass of p 31 g mol 1 mv is the molar mass of vivianite 502 g mol 1 mc is the mass of p consumed by the reaction g meanwhile the size of the crystal was analyzed 5 times by using the laser particle size analyzer mastesizer 3000 the detailed steps were as below an amount of the product was added to the wet sampler and the size of crystal was analyzed 5 times by using the laser particle size analyzer at 1500 rpm with the refractive index 1 58 and density 2 68 g cm 3 furthermore the average particle size dx 50 of crystals was calculated and the distribution of crystals with different sizes were painted 2 5 life cycle assessment the effect of vivianite crystallization on the environmental impact of phosphorus enrichment and crystallization systems was assessed by life cycle assessment lca one kilogram of vivianite was used as the functional unit the system boundary included the chemicals and pump the lca was analyzed with the simapro 9 1 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 p uptake release performance the aabf system was continuously operated for 155 d harvest 1st 7th to evaluate the p uptake release mechanism of paos to obtain a high p concentration during the formation stage of biofilm 1 25 d the p concentration of the aerobic effluent was above 0 5 mg l while the cod concentration of anaerobic effluent was much 50 mg l during the stabilization stage of biofilm 25 155 d the p concentration of aerobic effluent in each cycle showed an increasing trend over time which gradually increased from 0 2 0 05 mg l to 1 75 0 25 mg l fig 2a moreover the cod concentration of the effluent was 40 2 5 9 mg l and the p concentration gradually stabilized at 87 2 1 8 mg l harvest 1st 92 7 2 3 mg l harvest 2nd 149 5 2 7 mg l harvest 3rd 173 2 2 8 mg l harvest 4th 193 5 2 9 mg l harvest 5th 204 5 3 2 mg l harvest 6th under the condition of 200 mg l cod fig 2b the concentration of p recovery solution 204 5 3 2 mg l was significantly higher than that 133 mg l reported by tian et al 36 furthermore the p enrichment efficiency was 73 8 fig 2c which was higher than that of the previous report which indicated that the p enrichment efficiency was 48 0 table 1 when the recovery of p from the alternating anaerobic aerobic biofilter 36 taking the stage of harvest 5th as an example the amount of p uptake at the aerobic stage showed an irregular trend which rose from 9 9 mg l to 10 35 mg l and then decreased to 9 7 mg l fig 3a whereas the p removal efficiency decreased from 98 7 to 90 4 fig 3b meanwhile p release from the anaerobic phase gradually decreased from 42 5 mg l to 7 8 mg l moreover the pbiofilm was positively related to p concentration in the recirculated solution the p content increased from 46 7 1 6 mg g ss to 82 5 2 5 mg g ss fig 3c while the p concentration increased from 42 5 0 5 mg l to 173 2 2 1 mg l interestingly the pbiofilm and p concentration in the enrichment solution stabilized at the end of the stage what s more the eps content was stable at 97 5 mg g fig 3d while the pn ps ratio was in the range of 3 2 3 4 which revealed that the changes in p content were not significantly associated with eps content and the p recovery had no effect on biofilm properties after the biofilm was acclimated for 25 days the paos gradually adapted to the environment paos could absorb p in synthetic wastewater so that the p concentration in the effluent was below 0 5 mg l during the start of p harvest stage p in the wastewater could be absorbed by paos subsequently the increased pbiofilm would cause the metabolic model of paos to shift from gam to pam 39 40 which resulted in the uptake of p by paos then an increase in p uptake during the aerobic phase on the other hand glycolysis could generate additional atp to provide equivalents and acetyl coa for pha synthesis so a reduction in glycogen degradation reduced the synthesis of pha 39 40 the pbiofilm stabilized at 82 5 1 6 mg g ss at the end of the p harvest stage which indicated that there was a limitation of p storage capacity in paos and the paos could not absorb more p at this stage moreover the p concentration in the recirculated tank stabilized at 173 2 2 1 mg l which reduced the concentration gradient between the p content in paos and the recirculated solution resulting in the p of the biofilm cannot be released into solutions with the high p concentrations 41 the enriched solution had to be harvested as the p concentration of aerobic effluent was far from meeting the stringent water quality standards moreover the p was readily transferred to a new recirculated solution as the existence of a concentration gradient after p harvesting resulting in the maximum p release exhibited at the beginning of each p harvest stage furthermore paos could restore the glycolytic pathway to produce additional pha thereby increasing the synthesis of pha and glycogen 21 22 3 2 p uptake release metabolism the nmr was used to measure the p form and distribution in eps and cell which was extremely significant for elucidating the p uptake release mechanism by paos the findings indicated that pbiofilm increased from 46 7 1 6 mg g ss to 82 5 2 5 mg g ss at harvest 5th stage and the p content in eps increased from 32 4 mg g ss 69 4 to 57 3 mg g ss 68 6 table 2 moreover the p release in the anaerobic phase decreased from 8 5 mg g ss to 3 mg g ss with the p release in eps decreasing from 4 3 mg g ss to 2 0 mg g ss and the p release in cell decreasing from 4 2 mg g ss to 1 0 mg g ss furthermore four types of p ortho phosphate ortho p and poly phosphate poly p pyro phosphate pyro p mono phosphate mono p were observed in paos fig s4 s5 which was consistent with the previous results 42 wherein the ortho p 68 3 79 9 and poly p 16 0 27 0 were the predominant species in paos moreover the amount of ortho p and poly p contributed 25 8 49 5 and 14 0 63 3 of the p released in eps while the amount of ortho p and poly p comprised 23 0 65 9 and 30 0 31 0 of the p released in cell these results demonstrated that the minimal amount of p release could appear when the p content increased to the limitation of p storage capacity especially eps and cell both played an indispensable role in the metabolism of p uptake release wherein the ortho p and poly p were the major components of p metabolism by eps cell which was consistent with the previous report 7 9 what s more eps and cell were implicated in the transport and storage of p wherein the part of ortho p in eps played a major role in the p release process which was different from previous studies 43 compared with other processes the hrt of the alternating aerobic anaerobic operation was shorter resulting in more p being stored in the eps and the species of p were also affected by the high p concentration solution because the release of p was inhibited when the concentration gradient between pbiofilm and p concentration in the recirculated solution decreased in general the paos could absorb p at the initiation of the p enrichment phase as paos were unsaturated and then the metabolic mode of paos shifted from gam to pam as the pbiofilm increased which led to paos being able to absorb and release more p meanwhile intracellular ortho p and proton h were released into the eps through carrier proteins generating pmf that drove the uptake of the carbon source during the anaerobic phase however the p cannot be completely absorbed as the limitation of p storage of paos resulting in the aerobic effluent does not meet the water quality standard the p in cell was not enough to be completely released into the solution of high p concentration due to the gradual disappearance of concentration gradient paos lose the pmf to absorb carbon sources during the anaerobic phase 44 hence the p harvest was required to keep the system running steadily when the p concentration in the recirculating solution remained stable moreover the saturated p within paos was readily transferred to a new recirculated solution after p harvesting and the capability of p uptake of paos was restored therefore it was extremely significant to operate the biofilm reactor by following the p uptake release mechanism by paos 3 3 the p recovery efficiency during the crystallization of vivianite the effects of different ph 5 6 7 8 9 and the molar ratio of fe p 1 1 5 2 on p recovery efficiency were investigated under the same p condition 180 1 mg l the results indicated that p recovery efficiency increased from 81 3 to 94 6 when ph increased from 5 to 7 however a significant increase in p concentration was observed when ph increased from 7 to 9 and p recovery efficiency decreased from 94 6 3 1 to 80 6 32 1 furthermore the highest p recovery efficiency was 94 6 3 1 at the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 fig s6 the vivianite could dissolve under strongly acidic conditions causing the re dissolution of phosphate ions in the solution which resulted in lower p recovery efficiency and crystal purity on the contrary free hydroxide ions increased under strongly alkaline conditions thereby increasing the chance of the combination of iron ions and hydroxide ions to form the precipitation of fe oh 2 as its saturation indices changed from negative to positive with the increase of ph table s4 while the combination of ferrous ions and phosphate ions reduced furthermore the formation of insoluble fe oh 2 hindered the formation of vivianite allowing p to be released into the solution the supersaturation was increased when the concentration of ferrous ions rose at the same ph condition so the crystallization reaction proceeded in a positive direction and produced more vivianite however too much supersaturation not only increased the dosage but also caused the crystals to nucleate spontaneously forming more small crystals and causing uneven crystal particle size in addition the p recovery efficiency 94 6 3 1 in this process was greater than the 63 reported by previous research 25 which illustrated the great potential of using an alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm and fluidized bed crystallization coupled system for enriching and recovering p 3 4 product purity the purity of the product was closely related to its economic value so it was necessary to explore the crystal purity obtained under the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 the presence of pure struvite in all experiments was confirmed by xrd and xps as shown in fig s7 s9 the product spectrum had sharp peaks with the 2θ of 11 148 13 144 21 759 and 27 769 which was consistent with the vivianite standard spectrum pdf 30 0662 this result showed that the main crystal generated under this condition was vivianite with a diffraction peak intensity of 90 the composition of elements in sludge powders was determined by xps the xps spectrum of crystal exhibited distinct signal peaks of fe 2p o 1s c 1s and p 2p and the binding energies of 712 15 ev 531 43 ev 285 15 ev and 133 74 ev respectively fig 4a the xps spectrum of fe 2p p 2p and o 1s was showed in fig 4b d moreover the spectrum of fe 2p was deconvoluted into two main peaks corresponding to the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 711 8 ev and fe 2p1 2 725 6 ev which was similar to the binding energy of the fe state 45 furthermore the peaks of fe2 appeared at 715 ev 725 ev and 729 ev while the peaks of fe3 appeared at 712 ev and the content of fe2 and fe3 were 88 5 and 11 5 respectively fig 4b in the p2p xps spectrum the peak of phosphate in the precipitate appeared at 133 2 ev 45 and the percentage of phosphate was about 65 6 which illustrated that phosphate mainly existed as vivianite however the binding energy of 132 6 ev corresponded to the peak of organophosphorus the percentage was 35 4 fig 4c which was released by apoptotic microbial and paos but this did not affect the purity of vivianite moreover ferrous iron accounted for 88 5 of the total iron and the percentage of vivianite in the precipitate was 82 so it could be calculated that the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was 83 2 at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 the percentage was consistent with the previous report 70 90 15 16 indicating the potential of this process to obtain high p recovery efficiency and crystal purity in addition the eds analysis showed that the relative contents of the fe p and o elements accounted for a high proportion of the total elements which was consistent with previous reports by zhang et al 25 moreover the analysis of sem revealed that the crystal generated under the optimal conditions was generally recognized as plate like fig s10 and the shapes of the fe p and o elements were closely distributed on the crystal particles indicating that the proportion of fe p o elements accounted for a high proportion in the crystal these results indicated that the products generated under the optimal conditions were mainly the vivianite crystals furthermore the saturation indices were analyzed with the visual minteq and the input to the analysis of saturation was shown in table s3 the results demonstrated that the saturation indices of vivianite were increased from 5 2 to 16 1 with the ph increased from 5 to 9 at fe p 1 1 which revealed the formation of vivianite was reliable moreover the saturation indices of mg3 po4 2 were negative as the magnesium concentration was too weak to induce precipitation however the saturation indices of hydroxyapatite changed from 8 2 to 12 3 table s4 which indicated hydroxyapatite could be generated in this study to investigate the purity of the vivianite precipitate the crystals were fractionated and extracted using the hupfer method the results indicated that the percentage of fep and cap was 80 93 and 3 9 and the highest percentage of fep was 93 at ph 7 fe p 1 5 1 fig s11 in addition the saturation index of hydroxyapatite became positive as the ph increased indicating that the possibility of cap precipitation increased however the saturation index of cap was lower than fep table s4 which indicated that fep was preferentially produced in the vivianite crystallization and ca2 reacted with the residual p to generate hydroxyapatite after vivianite was formed so the low concentration of ca2 has little effect on vivianite crystallization in conclusion ph 8 5 and mg p 1 5 1 was considered to be the optimal operating condition to ensure the purity of vivianite 3 5 size distribution as shown in fig 5a the size of the crystals under each condition remained in the range of 58 15 59 96 μm this result illustrated that the size of vivianite was different from that of the struvite crystallization process which could be achieved by adjusting the molar ratio of mg p and ph 46 to better improve the vivianite crystals in the p recovery process the effect of the number of crystallization times on the crystal size by using vivianite as a seed crystal was explored in this study the results showed that the p recovery efficiency could be kept at 92 2 95 1 after multiple crystallizations table s5 moreover the crystal size of vivianite increased with the increase in crystallization times which increased from 59 5 μm to 215 1 μm table s5 the highest size was much greater than the size in the previous report 46 48 however the crystal particle size of vivianite grew slowly after 3 times of crystallization with the increase in the crystallization times the particle size of the crystals gradually changed from a single peak to a double peak fig 5b which indicated that the particle size of the vivianite crystals would be unevenly distributed as the number of the crystallization increased the fewer the times of crystallization the lower the number of nuclei produced by crystallization resulting in difficulties in the rapid growth of vivianite on the contrary more nuclei were produced when the number of crystallizations increased and the vivianite crystals grew gradually with themselves as a seed crystal 3 6 lca and chemical cost analysis to explore the environmental impact of phosphorus enrichment and crystallization systems the potential environmental factor emissions were assessed by lca the results indicated that the potential environmental emissions changed significantly with the changes in ph and fe p value and the potential carbon dioxide equivalent co2 eq emissions and 1 4 db eq emissions were the main environmental factors fig 6a moreover co2 eq emissions decreased from 16 8 kg co2 eq kg vivianite to 16 4 kg co2 eq kg vivianite with the ph increased from 5 to7 and co2 eq emissions increased from 16 4 kg co2 eq kg vivianite to 18 6 kg co2 eq kg vivianite as ph increased from 7 to 9 fig 6b meanwhile 1 4 db eq emissions sulfur dioxide equivalent so2 eq emissions and phosphate equivalent po4 eq emissions also showed consistent with co2 eq emissions and their values were 13 3 15 1 kg 1 4 db eq kg vivianite 0 10 0 11 kg so2 eq kg vivianite 0 031 0 037 kg po4 eq kg vivianite respectively fig 6c e as shown in fig 6c f sodium acetate was the largest contributor to potential emissions in this coupled system with its contribution to global warming water aquatic ecotox acidification and eutrophication ranging from 51 to 57 33 38 40 45 and 37 42 respectively in addition potassium dihydrogen phosphate was the second largest contributor accounting for 9 11 24 27 18 20 and 18 21 respectively in this study an additional organic source was required to obtain a high phosphorus solution to meet the metabolic demands of paos since a heating step is required in the production of sodium acetate a large amount of energy is consumed resulting in a large increase in co2 eq emissions meanwhile the process of producing dipotassium hydrogen phosphate is a reaction between potassium carbonate and phosphoric acid solution at 80 100 c ph 4 5 with high temperatures and acidity consuming large amounts of energy furthermore although the minimum potential emission occurred at ph 7 and fe p 1 1 the maximum phosphorus recovery efficiency and relatively low potential emission at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 demonstrated that ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 was the optimum condition to ensure phosphorus recovery efficiency and reduced potential environmental emissions chemical costs account for a large proportion of overall costs this study revealed that some chemicals were required to recover 1 kg of vivianite table s6 and the total cost of 2446 9 3054 9 ton vivianite was required to recover 1 kg of vivianite in the aabf fbc system the unit price of the chemical was shown in the table s7 the reason for this large price difference was that a large amount of sodium hydroxide was added to maintain the alkaline environment in this study however it was found that the highest purity and recovery of crystals were achieved at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 and 0 95 kg of feso4 7h2o and 0 03 kg of hcl were required to recover 1 kg of vivianite under the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 corresponding to a total cost of 2468 5 ton vivianite when the chemical costs were considered however when the influent in the p enrichment process uses domestic sewage to recover phosphorus the chemical costs in the aabf system should not be included in the overall chemical costs which reduces the overall chemical costs from 2468 5 ton to 60 3 ton comparatively the total cost of recovering struvite was 318 9 556 7 ton struvite from concentrated wastewater due to expensive reagents mgso4 7h2o and naoh in struvite production 49 which was significantly higher than the cost of recovering p as vivianite at ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 moreover the benchmark price of struvite was 500 ton which was cheaper than the benchmark price of vivianite 10 000 ton 50 therefore the recovery of p as vivianite was economically viable by using an alternating aerobic anaerobic biofilm and fluidized bed crystallization coupled system however this lca and chemical cost analysis was based on the result of lab scale experiments which was different with the lca analysis of full scale wwtps hence a comprehensive lca and economic analysis on the recovery of p as vivianite from wwtps needed to be considered 4 conclusion the reactor was operated in harvest 1st 7th stages to explore the efficiency p metabolic mechanism of paos and the potential environmental emissions in the aaab fbc coupled system the results showed that determining the operating cycle of the reactor through the p content limitation and p uptake release mechanism could ensure the aerobic effluent meet the water quality requirements and the p concentration of 204 5 3 2 mg l could be obtained the highest p recovery efficiency was 94 6 at the condition of ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 moreover the main crystal formed under this condition was vivianite crystals and the crystals were composed of fe p and o elements which were the main elements for making up the vivianite moreover fep was preferentially produced in the vivianite crystallization than cap as the saturation index of cap was lower than fep so the low concentration of ca2 had little effect on vivianite crystallization and the percentage of phosphate used to synthesize vivianite was 83 2 what s more the crystal size of vivianite increased with the increase of crystallization times it increased from 59 5 μm to 215 1 μm the lca and chemical cost revealed that ph 7 and fe p 1 5 1 was the optimum condition to ensure high phosphorus recovery efficiency and reduced potential environmental emissions which indicated that recovering p as vivianite was highly economically viable in conclusion this work demonstrated the feasibility of operating a reactor based on the p uptake release mechanism by paos in the aaab fbc coupled system and high purity vivianite crystals could be obtained the research provided theoretical support for the full scale operation of the aaab fbc coupled system of recovering p as vivianite in wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors

12761,this study is aimed to aid in the horizontal flow constructed wetland hfcw design by analysing their treatment dynamics using secondary datasets n 1232 prediction of effluent biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp was carried out via machine learning algorithms multiple linear regression and support vector regression svr out of the two models svr resulted in a better prediction of all the effluent parameters in mg l as well as in g m3 d the prediction of nh4 n and tn g m3 d could be performed with the highest accuracy r2 and root mean square error 0 847 and 0 44 and 0 947 and 0 18 respectively the classification of the dataset according to organic loading rate olr enhanced the performance of svr for bod high olr cod low olr and tp low olr the performance of all the trials was acceptable in the training and validation stages in 3 fold cross validation which was helpful in reducing the mean square error value by 68 19 and increasing the r2 value by up to 16 13 areal removal rate k m d values computed by the reverse p k c approach using the predicted effluent concentrations were found to be highly correlated with actual k values for bod cod and tn r2 0 954 0 948 and 0 819 respectively these k values can be used for the customized design of hfcws for organics and nitrogen removal and might also help to achieve the targeted discharge standards in hfcws graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations nh4 n ammonium nitrogen k m d areal removal rate bod biological oxygen demand cod

svr data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws provide an environment conducive to the treatment of wastewater by employing the transformation capabilities of microorganisms in a nature simulating environment 1 the type of microorganisms enriched in these wetlands is dependent upon the physicochemical environment the plants growing in the wetlands the influent wastewater characteristics and the nature of the substrate media of the cw 2 3 over the years cws have emerged as a competent technology in terms of ease of operation and maintenance and cost effective nature particularly in areas where land availability is not a significant factor however due to their complex nature diversity in the composition of wastewater and a variety of interdependent physical chemical and biological factors the performance of cw is highly variable which poses challenges in setting design guidelines 4 horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws are a type of cws where the direction of flow of wastewater is largely horizontal the hfcws are generally designed to utilize the natural terrain of the area for wastewater flow and hence they don t require extra pumping energy 5 if aeration is not provided the hfcws can achieve high degrees of nitrogen removal due to the formation of anoxic stretches at the bottom 6 subsurface flow wetlands provide an additional advantage of no direct exposure of wastewater to the environment this largely reduces the problems of odor and insects that are frequently associated with free water surface wetlands the main limitation to the adoption of cws as a general practice for wastewater treatment is the land area requirement therefore strategies that can improve the design of cws to reduce land area requirements are in demand the design of cws is dependent on the quality of the influent as well as the intended usage however the complex nature and a variety of interdependent factors make designs based on one or a few parameters unreliable 7 hence a scope is generally left and the wetlands are largely over designed 8 machine learning methods use computational techniques to understand the complex interactions between many factors and are capable of deducing non linear relationships between the input and output 9 they are known to possess superior prediction performance than empirical or statistical methods 10 11 although artificial neural network ann based methods have been reported to be a better predictor of denitrification rates 12 and total coliforms 13 in cw than the traditional multiple linear regression based mlr models the support vector regression svr based models outperform ann with respect to overfitting prevention and robustness to data noise especially in limited data sets 14 15 a comparative account of the three models with their accuracy in terms of performance loss of training error and data handling are given in table 1 in recent modeling studies k fold cross validation has been applied widely 16 yang et al 17 have applied k fold cross validation to predict nitrate nitrogen isotopic composition using an svr model islam et al 18 have conducted a study in coastal aquifers in bangladesh using 3 fold cross validation techniques to study nitrate concentration susceptibility the technique has been adopted for the prediction of seasonal waste generation 18 recent literature suggests that k fold cross validation is favourable in minimizing testing data uncertainties and overfitting issues 1 1 importance of this study the design of cws is dependent on the quality of influent as well as the local effluent standards in force previous studies have indicated that the hfcws operating in the field are largely under loaded by design which means that the actual area of cws are larger as compared to the calculated area from the p k c method 8 k values play an important role in the area calculation of hfcws the higher the k values the higher is the removal of pollutants however k values are case specific and dependent upon a large number of factors and therefore are difficult to predict by empirical equations therefore in this study we used the predicted effluent parameters to calculate the k values according to the different input parameters these k values can be further used for case specific customization of the hfcws design 1 2 objective of this study the main objective of this study was the prediction of chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp using mlr and svr techniques the robust prediction of outlet parameters can be used to calculate the predicted k values that would aid in customizing the design of hfcws 2 material and methodology 2 1 data collection the collection of secondary data has been done using research publications collected from sources like web of science pubmed and scopus performance data on a total of 111 hfcws treating only domestic wastewater and utilizing gravel and sand as wetland filler were obtained these papers were published between 2002 and 2021 this study was performed on the secondary data of hfcws treating only domestic wastewater utilizing gravel and sand as wetland filler data on the operational parameters of these cws like hydraulic loading rate hlr organic loading rate olr hydraulic retention time hrt filter media etc design parameters like surface area and depth and pollutant concentrations influent and effluent concentrations of bod cod nh4 n tn and tp in mg l were extracted from the respective papers and relevant calculations were carried out to find the missing data as described previously 8 in this study the effluent parameters have been predicted in two units mg l and g m3 d the former was used as it is the commonly reported unit in literature while the latter was used to incorporate the effect of detention time per unit volume in the horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws from the literature derived values of organics usually in mg l the respective olrs in g m3 d were calculated using the formula flow rate m 3 day inflow bod mg l area of constructed wetlands m 2 depth of media m this was done to normalize the loading rates with respect to the wetland volume and retention time the parameters in both the concentration units mg l and g m3 d were used for prediction purposes the methodology followed for the analysis is shown in fig 1 2 2 data pre processing data pre processing is a data extraction and analysis process which is used to convert the raw data into a comprehendible format that can be analysed by machine learning 24 data pre processing techniques improve the efficiency of the predicted results 9 certain values were missing from some of the datasets these datasets were eliminated from the analysis there were some outliers in the dataset an outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from datasets 25 26 these outliers were detected from the 111 hfcws datasets by plotting the box and whisker plot and removed from the datasets effluent concentrations were transformed in volumetric loading rate for applying ml the statistical characteristics of the data are shown in table 2 the percent relative standard deviation of the data varied between 0 35 and 16 93 with respect to the mean which shows that the dataset is reliable after finalizing the input dataset it was divided into two groups the training dataset 80 and the testing dataset 20 27 2 2 1 validity of assumptions in machine learning ml the validity of assumptions in machine learning was tested using the appropriate code in python script the following tests were performed durbin watson dw statistic was used to test for autocorrelation in a regression model s output the dw statistic ranges from zero to four with a value of 2 0 indicating zero autocorrelation values below 2 0 mean there is positive autocorrelation and above 2 0 indicate negative autocorrelation dw was calculated using the following eq 1 28 1 dw d t 2 t e t e t 1 2 t 1 t e t 2 where e t are residuals from ols regression e t 1 are first order differences of residual homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances was used to test whether the assumption of equal or similar variances in different parameters being compared holds true this is an important assumption of parametric statistical tests because they are sensitive to any dissimilarities uneven variances in datasets result in biased and skewed test results 29 no multicollinearity was checked by plotting the heat map correlation 30 the goal of clustered heatmap is to build associations between both the data points and their features for the applicability of machine learning algorithms the data should be normally distributed normal distribution also known as the gaussian distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean 29 to verify whether the data follows the normal distribution the probability distribution factor was calculated using the eq 2 29 2 f x 1 σ 2 π e 1 2 x μ σ 2 where f x probability distribution factor σ standard deviation μ mean 2 3 feature selection the main objective of feature selection is to find the most pertinent input parameter from datasets the feature selection was carried out using pearson correlation analysis in this study the secondary data of hfcw using only gravel and sand as wetland fillers were collated and used for prediction this was done to minimize the variations due to filler media that s why wetland fillers have not been incorporated as a feature during feature selection similarly as the effect of plant assimilation is minimal in cw 30 the types of plant species were also not incorporated in the feature list 2 3 1 pearson correlation analysis in this study feature selection has been carried out by using the pearson coefficient σij and p test σij is the quickest and easiest method of feature selection 31 the σij values calculated between input and output parameters show the linear relationship ranges between 1 r 1 here the negative sign 1 shows a strong indirect correlation and the positive sign 1 shows a strong direct correlation between the two variables the calculation of σij was performed on microsoft excel and p values were calculated using minitab software the pearson correlation coefficient is calculated 32 using eq 3 3 σ i j cov f i f j var f i var f j where σij is a correlation coefficient between a given feature fi and all other features of the dataset fj cov is covariance and var is a variance 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa is used to determine the impact of one or more input parameters on the output variables this analysis is beneficial for improving the prediction of the model accuracy 32 in sensitivity analysis one input parameter is varied while keeping other parameters constant and the changes in the output variables are determined the greater the percentage change in the output value the more significant is the impact on the system and vice versa 33 although sensitivity analysis is more frequently performed after model generation to determine the relative contribution of the input variables this analysis can also be used to select input variables as suggested by islam et al 18 here the main objective of performing the sensitivity analysis was to observe the effects of feature changes on the optimal solutions of the machine learning model so that the features showing the maximum effect on the ml model can be selected many approaches have been followed for performing sensitivity analysis such as variance decomposition elementary effect etc in this study one at a time sensitivity analysis was performed on the datasets in which one parameter was changed and others were kept constant 28 the sensitivity indicator i e the relative difference between impact results with a modified parameter and reference values for the temporal parameter was calculated by the eq 4 28 4 relative difference n t av n t av ref n t av ref where n t av is the actual value at time t for the calculation ref indicates the reference calculation scenario effluents value after 10 change in input parameter with corresponding the actual values 2 4 machine learning algorithms two types of approaches were applied on the data set for the prediction of effluents from hfcws one is mlr and the other is svr the accuracy of predicted results using machine learning ml was determined by using coefficients of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse r2 indicates the accuracy of the model on datasets which ranges from 0 to 100 it also reflects how well the data fits on the regression model the higher r2 values indicate smaller differences between the testing and training datasets 33 rmse is the sd of the predicted error it shows how far the data is concentrated from the regression line it also represents the capability of the predictive method 34 the r2 and rmse were calculated using equations 5 and 6 respectively 30 35 5 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y y i 2 6 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n where yi is the true value y i is the average observed value x i is the forecast value by the model and n is the number of observations 2 4 1 multiple linear regression mlr mlr is a statistical tool that can be used for analysing the relationship between a single dependent and various independent variables the purpose of mlr is to predict the single dependent variable by using the independent variables 1 mlr is denoted as a line as shown in eq 7 36 7 y i β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β p x n e i where i 1 2 3 n yi and xi are dependent and independent variables respectively ei is intercept 2 4 2 support vector regression svr svr algorithm is based on the same principle as the support vector machines svms to predict discrete values the basic idea behind svr is to find the best fit line in svms this best fit line is an optimal hyperplane that has the maximum number of data points lying on the plane 9 37 svr is mathematically predicted by eq 8 9 8 f x i i 1 n w i φ x i b where w i and b are the parameters of the linear svr function and φ x i is the nonlinear svr function svr models are categorized into two types linear svm and non linear svm in this study a non linear svm mathematical model is used for prediction the nonlinear svr function the kernel function k x i x j ϕ x i ϕ x j is calculated and applied to make the inner products to evaluate the space and analyse the feature separating space 22 2 4 3 k fold cross validation the performance of classification algorithms was evaluated by using k fold validation the purpose of this study was to explore whether k fold cross validation should be repeatedly performed for obtaining reliable accuracy estimates mlr and svr models have been combined with k fold cross validation cv method to predict the effluent parameters k fold cross validation may reduce input dataset partition uncertainties and minimize overfitting issues the mean square error mse was calculated by eq 9 16 38 9 mse 1 n y i f x i 2 where n total number of observations yi the response value of the ith observation f xi the predicted response value of the ith observation the overall test mse was calculated by eq 5 27 10 test mse 1 k mse i where k is the number of folds msei is the test mse on the ith iteration 2 5 k value calculation using p k c approach k value can be computed by applying the reverse order p k c approach using eq 11 8 39 11 a pq i k c i c c o c 1 p 1 where co outlet concentration in mg l k first order areal removal rate coefficient in m d p apparent number of tanks in series c background concentration in mg l ci inlet concentration in mg l qi influent flow rate in m3 d 3 results and discussion in this paper the secondary data of 111 hfcw was used to predict the effluent parameter concentrations before the application of ml algorithms the collected data was pre processed to identify and rectify issues in the dataset a set of validation tests were performed to ascertain the suitability of the data for ml algorithms 3 1 data pre processing the durban watson statistics were used to check autocorrelation in the input variables with respect to output variables of a statistical regression analysis supplementary data most of the values were found to lie in the acceptable range of 1 5 to 2 5 28 the results show that autocorrelation exists and the low standard error values mean that the predictors are significant homoscedasticity was performed to check the uneven variances in datasets analysis of heteroscedasticity scatters plots between the design and effluents variables values supplementary data file show a classic cone shaped pattern of heteroscedasticity strong positive associations were found for bod effluent nh4 n effluent tn effluent tp effluent temperature wetland area tn effluent tp effluent nh4 n effluent temperature wetland area detention time nh4 n effluent wetland area detention time depth of filter media bod effluent tn effluent tp effluent wetland area detention time temperature bod effluent nh4 n effluent no multicollinearity was checked by plotting a correlation heat map as shown in fig 2 this type of heatmap implements clustering as part of the process of grouping similar features the correlation heat map was found to vary between 0 1 to 0 55 mostly but it goes up to 0 85 in some variables which means no multicollinearity exists in 111 hfcws datasets fig 2 shows that independent variables are not highly correlated with each other outliers in the data of 111 hfcws were checked by plotting the box and whisker graph using python coding as shown in fig 3 outliers were removed from datasets to increase the efficiency of machine learning based systems gaussian distribution curves supplementary data were plotted to determine the behaviour of datasets as symmetric unimodal and asymptotic the parameters bod effluent nh4 n effluent tn effluent tp effluent depth of filter media temperature design flow detention time and wetland area were following the normal distribution curve 3 2 feature selection 3 2 1 pearson correlation analysis table 3 shows the correlation between input variables and effluents mg l in our dataset along with the respective p values in brackets table 4 shows the correlation between input variables and effluents in terms of volumetric loading rates g m3 d and their respective p values the negative values in tables 3 and 4 indicate a negative correlation between the respective variables whereas positive values indicate a positive correlation apart from the influent concentrations some design and operational variables showed a strong correlation with effluents concentration with a significant p value 0 05 highlighted in bold font in tables 3 and 4 these include temperature design flow wetland area depth and detention time these parameters are expected to provide a better prediction of the effluent output parameters with good accuracy 25 and were thus selected as input parameters along with the inlet concentrations for ml algorithms 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis to perform sensitivity analysis the data of the input variable was changed by 10 while keeping another input parameter constant and the percentage change in effluent parameters bodout tnout tknout and tpout was measured by using a machine learning approach the same approach was applied to other input parameters and the measured results are shown in table 5 the highest change in bodout tnout tknout and tpout was found due to a change in the temperature and the depth of wetland media as shown in table 8 the sensitivity analysis is used to descript the contribution of the input variables to the results after the model has been built the utility of the sensitivity analysis was to find the most sensitive parameter with respect to the effluent s parameter a 10 change in temperature led to a significant change in the effluent parameters this is expected as an increase in temperature may increase biological reaction and removal efficiency or vice versa 21 a 10 change in wetland media depth and detention time also affected the effluents parameter as shown in table 8 this might happen as an increase in wetland depth might lead to the generation of an anoxic or anaerobic zone this might improve the removal efficiencies of certain parameters like tn and tp an increase in detention time is expected to provide sufficient time for the decomposition of organic waste in the wastewater which might lead to improvement in the removal efficiency of pollutants 21 actual and predicted values of bod tn nh4 n and tp effluents have been plotted as shown in supplementary data by a 10 change in the input values 3 3 prediction of effluent concentrations using mlr and svr machine learning ml model after training the model on the hfcws dataset n 1232 using two ml algorithms mlr and svr the model metrics r2 and rmse were estimated for testing and training datasets table 6 shows the r2 of predicted effluents in mg l bod cod tn nh4 n and tp using mlr and svr methods when the pollutant concentrations were used in mg l the mlr algorithm performed well for nh4 n and tn prediction with an r2 of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively the performance of this algorithm was however poor for bod r2 0 300 to 0 339 and cod r2 0 290 to 0 400 prediction and only slightly better for tp prediction r2 0 400 to 0 513 table 6 on the other hand when the svr method was used the prediction of bod and tp was considerably improved r2 0 52 0 60 and 0 6 to 0 8 respectively the prediction of other parameters also improved and the best prediction was observed in the case of tn where the r2 values reached 0 87 0 9 when pollutant concentrations in volumetric terms mg m3 d were used as input table 7 a better correlation was observed between the actual concentrations and the predicted concentrations using the mlr algorithm for all the pollutants the best correlation was observed in the case of tn r2 0 639 to 0 900 followed by nh4 n r2 0 634 to 0 800 and tp r2 0 605 to 0 700 the performance of the mlr algorithm was still poor for bod r2 0 497 to 0 600 and cod r2 0 477 to 0 500 as compared to the mlr algorithm the svr algorithm performed better the best predictions were observed for tn r2 0 900 to 0 949 followed by nh4 n r2 0 815 to 0 900 however in some cases a high variation between the training and testing r2 values was observed e g bod 0 4 vs 0 732 and tp 0 4 vs 0 705 respectively the reason for this variability could be the large variations in the influent concentrations and the nature of the wastewater 9 for effluent cod prediction the performance of svr was still poor r2 0 400 to 0 455 overall the accuracy of prediction of effluents using the svr model is very good as compared to the mlr model this could be due to the fact that the mlr method is a linear fit model while svr is a non linear fit 9 22 the order of decreasing r2 in both svr and mlr algorithms was found to be tn nh4 n tp bod cod a previous study by zhang et al 24 also stated that the prediction of tn and nh4 n can be performed with higher accuracy using the svr model similarly lian sheng et al 40 also reported a strong correlation r2 0 91 between tn and nh4 n effluents predicted using the svr method and their loading rates 3 4 detailed analysis of effluent concentrations predicted using mlr and svr the predicted and actual effluent concentrations in mg l and volumetric loading rate g m3 d of different effluent parameters cod tn nh4 n and tp effluents in mg l and g m3 day are shown in fig 4 for mlr models the corresponding graphs for the svr algorithm are shown in supplementary data the values on the x axis have been ordered according to the increasing organic loading rate when the pollutant concentration in mg l was used for bod and cod prediction using mlr the predicted values of low olr hfcws were found to be lower than the actual values whereas at higher olr these values were found to be higher than the actual values fig 4 this behaviour could be observed due to the differences in the composition of high olr e g primary treated and low olr e g secondary treated wastewater therefore to further improve the effluent pollutant prediction the dataset of hfcws was divided into two parts low olr 5 to 30 g m3 d and high olr 30 to 150 g m3 d the 30 g m3 d cut off was chosen as a trade off between the type of wastewater primary vs secondary and the number of datasets in each class lower olr and high olr 3 5 effluent prediction using dataset classified according to olr the r2 values between actual and predicted effluent concentrations for low olr and high olr datasets using predicted pollutant concentration from mlr and svr methods are shown in tables 5 and 6 when the pollutant concentration was used in terms of mg l the classification of data lead to improvement in the r2 values for the mlr algorithm especially in the high olr dataset the best accuracy was observed in the case of tn prediction while the r2 values for the low olr dataset were slightly reduced the corresponding values for the high olr dataset were considerably improved for tn prediction and reached values of 0 900 to 0 957 table 6 a similar trend was observed in the case of nh4 n where the prediction of a high olr dataset was significantly improved with an r2 of 0 841 to 0 910 for tp prediction the r2 values were improved for low olr r2 0 500 to 0 567 but reduced for the high olr dataset with a high degree of variation for testing and training set r2 0 328 vs 0 600 while for cod the predicted values remained more or less similar following the classification of the dataset the bod values remained similar at low olr but considerably improved at higher olr r2 0 589 to 0 601 for the prediction of pollutant concentration mg l using svr similar trends were observed for both bod and cod the prediction at lower olr remained more or less similar whereas the prediction at higher olr was improved r2 0 609 to 0 800 and 0 494 to 0 800 respectively for the remaining pollutants nh4 n tn and tp the prediction performance was reduced at low olr and it was improved at high olr when the volumetric pollutant concentrations were used for prediction using mlr table 7 the effluent bod and cod predictions improved at lower olr r2 0 597 to 0 600 and 0 700 to 0 817 respectively nh4 n prediction remained similar before and after dataset classification tn prediction was found to worsen at lower olr whereas tp prediction was found to worsen at both high and low olr when svr was used to predict volumetric pollutant concentrations the bod prediction showed high variations in r2 values between the training and testing set with overall r2 remaining similar to the unclassified dataset table 7 the effluent cod prediction was improved at low olr r2 0 600 to 0 849 tn prediction was marginally improved at high olr whereas nh4 n prediction didn t show much effect on data classification on the other hand tp prediction was considerably improved at lower olr overall classifying the dataset into low olr and high olr datasets may lead to better prediction of bod mg l at higher olr and cod g m3 d at lower olr while nh4 n and tn appear to be better predicted in terms of mg l at high olr after classification the corresponding values in g m3 d reveal no such advantage of data classification in nh4 n and tn prediction dataset classification showed no advantage to tp prediction in mg l but in volumetric terms prediction at lower olr could be achieved with high accuracy after classifying the dataset according to olr 3 6 model expression equations for mlr multiple linear regression using python coding was applied on 111 hfcws datasets and the predicted equations of effluent parameters in mg l are given below eqs 12 16 12 b o d effluent 0 443 x 1 0 178 x 2 0 041 x 3 0 0021 x 4 1 275 x 5 0 113 x 6 0 0268

shows how well the ml is expected to be executed on unforeseen datasets 41 the smaller the value of rmse the better the algorithm model 31 after the prediction of effluent concentrations rmse was used to assess the accuracy and data fitting of the algorithm table 8 rmse was found to be very low for the svr model for all the effluents in mg l and g m3 d these results are in accordance with a previous study 42 in which the svr model was reported to be better as compared to the mlr model in terms of the accuracy of prediction results lower rmse overall for the svr model rmse was observed to be lower in the case of effluents in g m3 d as compared to the effluents in mg l for prediction of cod 0 12 tn 0 18 bod 0 36 nh4 n 0 44 effluents whereas the reverse was found to be true in case of tp effluents 0 23 svr this might have happened due to the fact that the variation of datasets is lower in the case of effluents in g m3 d as compared to the same values in mg l 30 these results are comparable with those of guo et al 9 43 who reported similar low values for effluent bod and cod prediction using the svr method 3 8 k fold cross validation datasets of 111 hfcws were collected between 2002 and 2021 20 years k k 3 fold cross validation was performed in three trials in the first trial training was performed on 2002 08 datasets testing on 2015 21 datasets and validation was performed on 2009 15 datasets in a similar way datasets were shuffled in trail 2 and trial 3 fig 5 mse values obtained in trials 1 2 and 3 were 87 29 49 29 and 27 76 k fold cross validation was helpful to reduce the mse value by 68 19 and increase the r2 value by 16 13 the r2 of training and testing datasets values are shown in the supplementary file the use of k fold validation is effective in minimization of bias in the selection of testing sets also helps to neutralize the prediction errors 3 9 calculation of predicted k values in a previous study from our group the k values were improved by removing the lower olr cws due to underloaded systems and the data were further classified based on depth olr and type of treatment these customized k values were further adapted for optimizing the design of cws 4 as a next step towards the customization of k values in this work the machine learning approach was applied to predict effluent concentrations after predicting the effluent concentration first order areal rate coefficient k m d values were calculated by using the reverse p k c approach 44 the relationship between the actual k values k values calculated using actual influent and effluent concentrations given in literature and the predicted k values calculated using influent concentrations from literature and effluent concentrations predicted using mlr and svr algorithms is shown in fig 6 the accuracy of predicted k values in the svr model is better as compared to the mlr model actual k values derived by using the p k c approach lie within the range of 0 006 to 0 40 m d whereas the predicted k values lie in the range of 0 11 to 0 90 m d in the case of the mlr model and 0 07 to 0 76 m d in the case of the svr model k values of nh4 n shows a negative predicted value in the case of higher olr cws in both mlr and svr model this observation shows that the prediction efficiency is lower on the high olr side this might have happened due to large variations in datasets on the high olr side 45 r2 of both k1 and k2 values which were calculated using predicted effluents of bod cod nh4 n and tn in mg l and g m3 d are higher for the svr model as compared to the mlr model r2 of k2 values calculated using effluent in volumetric loading rate are fairly good but lower as compared to the r2 of k2 values calculated using effluent in mg l higher r2 was obtained in the case of the svr model in the prediction of kbod and kcod r2 0 982 and 0 968 respectively as compared to knh4 n and ktn r2 0 845 and 0 889 respectively whereas ktp r2 0 612 could not be predicted accurately using either of the two methods these k values can be further used for the calculation of the area of hfcws using different input parameters and will be helpful in optimizing the design of cws in terms of area this robust prediction using the svr algorithm is a realistic way to support the design of hfcws 9 by inserting the raw inputs the output results of effluents can be predicted using the ml model which can be used to further calculate the k values in different scenarios these results offer decision making solutions regarding the construction investment of hfcws by further increasing the dataset this method could be reliably used to optimize the design of cws 30 3 10 validation of algorithm using primary data validation of the predicted k values was carried out using the primary data from two hfcws deep wetlands treating domestic wastewater cw1 and hospital wastewater cw2 14 months average data of effluents and influents concentrations of cw1 and cw2 are shown in table 10 k values of cw1 and cw2 were calculated using the first order plug flow equation and compared with the k values predicted using mlr and svr methods it has been found that k values calculated using the method are much closer to the actual k values as shown in table 10 it indicates that the svr method gives a better prediction of k values as compared to the mlr method as also suggested by other researchers 9 46 4 conclusion a machine learning approach utilizing mlr and svr algorithms was used to predict the effluent parameter concentrations in hfcws using the selected input features svr model was found to perform with better accuracy as compared to mlr model for the prediction of bod cod nh4 n and tn when datasets were used in g m3 d nh4 n and tn could be predicted with high accuracy of r2 0 847 and 0 947 and root mean square error rmse of 0 44 and 0 18 respectively was observed classification of dataset on the basis of olr led to better prediction of bod mg l at high olr r2 0 609 cod g m3 d at low olr r2 0 746 and tp g m3 d at low olr r2 0 806 k values calculated by the reverse p k c approach using the effluent concentrations predicted with the svr model were found to be highly correlated to the actual k values of bod cod and tn the observed r2 between the two was in the range of 0 889 to 0 982 and 0 819 to 0 954 respectively for values in mg l and g m3 d thus the svr algorithm can be applied for predicting the k values for bod cod and tn with high confidence that can be helpful to optimize the design of hfcws in terms of area requirement for organics and nitrogen removal the reliability of the svr algorithm can be further enhanced by the incorporation of more data declaration of competing interest the

12761,this study is aimed to aid in the horizontal flow constructed wetland hfcw design by analysing their treatment dynamics using secondary datasets n 1232 prediction of effluent biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp was carried out via machine learning algorithms multiple linear regression and support vector

highest accuracy r2 and root mean square error 0 847 and 0 44 and 0 947 and 0 18 respectively the classification of the dataset according to organic loading rate olr enhanced the performance of svr

svr data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws provide an environment conducive to the treatment of wastewater by employing the transformation capabilities of microorganisms in a nature simulating environment 1 the type of microorganisms enriched in these wetlands is dependent upon the physicochemical environment the plants growing in the wetlands the influent wastewater characteristics and the nature of the substrate media of the cw 2 3 over the years cws have emerged as a competent technology in terms of ease of operation and maintenance and cost effective nature particularly in areas where land availability is not a significant factor however due to their complex nature diversity in the composition of wastewater and a variety of interdependent physical chemical and biological factors the performance of cw is highly variable which poses challenges in setting design guidelines 4 horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws are a type of cws where the direction of flow of wastewater is largely horizontal the hfcws are generally designed to utilize the natural terrain of the area for wastewater flow and hence they don t require extra pumping energy 5 if aeration is not provided the hfcws can achieve high degrees of nitrogen removal due to the formation of anoxic stretches at the bottom 6 subsurface flow wetlands provide an additional advantage of no direct exposure of wastewater to the environment this largely reduces the problems of odor and insects that are frequently associated with free water surface wetlands the main limitation to the adoption of cws as a general practice for wastewater treatment is the land area requirement therefore strategies that can improve the design of cws to reduce land area requirements are in demand the design of cws is dependent on the quality of the influent as well as the intended usage however the complex nature and a variety of interdependent factors make designs based on one or a few parameters unreliable 7 hence a scope is generally left and the wetlands are largely over designed 8 machine learning methods use computational techniques to understand the complex interactions between many factors and are capable of deducing non linear relationships between the input and output 9 they are known to possess superior prediction performance than empirical or statistical methods 10 11 although artificial neural network ann based methods have been reported to be a better predictor of denitrification rates 12 and total coliforms 13 in cw than the traditional multiple linear regression based mlr models the support vector regression svr based models outperform ann with respect to overfitting prevention and robustness to data noise especially in limited data sets 14 15 a comparative account of the three models with their accuracy in terms of performance loss of training error and data handling are given in table 1 in recent modeling studies k fold cross validation has been applied widely 16 yang et al 17 have applied k fold cross validation to predict nitrate nitrogen isotopic composition using an svr model islam et al 18 have conducted a study in coastal aquifers in bangladesh using 3 fold cross validation techniques to study nitrate concentration susceptibility the technique has been adopted for the prediction of seasonal waste generation 18 recent literature suggests that k fold cross validation is favourable in minimizing testing data uncertainties and overfitting issues 1 1 importance of this study the design of cws is dependent on the quality of influent as well as the local effluent standards in force previous studies have indicated that the hfcws operating in the field are largely under loaded by design which means that the actual area of cws are larger as compared to the calculated area from the p k c method 8 k values play an important role in the area calculation of hfcws the higher the k values the higher is the removal of pollutants however k values are case specific and dependent upon a large number of factors and therefore are difficult to predict by empirical equations therefore in this study we used the predicted effluent parameters to calculate the k values according to the different input parameters these k values can be further used for case specific customization of the hfcws design 1 2 objective of this study the main objective of this study was the prediction of chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp using mlr and svr techniques the robust prediction of outlet parameters can be used to calculate the predicted k values that would aid in customizing the design of hfcws 2 material and methodology 2 1 data collection the collection of secondary data has been done using research publications collected from sources like web of science pubmed and scopus performance data on a total of 111 hfcws treating only domestic wastewater and utilizing gravel and sand as wetland filler were obtained these papers were published between 2002 and 2021 this study was performed on the secondary data of hfcws treating only domestic wastewater utilizing gravel and sand as wetland filler data on the operational parameters of these cws like hydraulic loading rate hlr organic loading rate olr hydraulic retention time hrt filter media etc design parameters like surface area and depth and pollutant concentrations influent and effluent concentrations of bod cod nh4 n tn and tp in mg l were extracted from the respective papers and relevant calculations were carried out to find the missing data as described previously 8 in this study the effluent parameters have been predicted in two units mg l and g m3 d the former was used as it is the commonly reported unit in literature while the latter was used to incorporate the effect of detention time per unit volume in the horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws from the literature derived values of organics usually in mg l the respective olrs in g m3 d were calculated using the formula flow rate m 3 day inflow bod mg l area of constructed wetlands m 2 depth of media m this was done to normalize the loading rates with respect to the wetland volume and retention time the parameters in both the concentration units mg l and g m3 d were used for prediction purposes the methodology followed for the analysis is shown in fig 1 2 2 data pre processing data pre processing is a data extraction and analysis process which is used to convert the raw data into a comprehendible format that can be analysed by machine learning 24 data pre processing techniques improve the efficiency of the predicted results 9 certain values were missing from some of the datasets these datasets were eliminated from the analysis there were some outliers in the dataset an outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from datasets 25 26 these outliers were detected from the 111 hfcws datasets by plotting the box and whisker plot and removed from the datasets effluent concentrations were transformed in volumetric loading rate for applying ml the statistical characteristics of the data are shown in table 2 the percent relative standard deviation of the data varied between 0 35 and 16 93 with respect to the mean which shows that the dataset is reliable after finalizing the input dataset it was divided into two groups the training dataset 80 and the testing dataset 20 27 2 2 1 validity of assumptions in machine learning ml the validity of assumptions in machine learning was tested using the appropriate code in python script the following tests were performed durbin watson dw statistic was used to test for autocorrelation in a regression model s output the dw statistic ranges from zero to four with a value of 2 0 indicating zero autocorrelation values below 2 0 mean there is positive autocorrelation and above 2 0 indicate negative autocorrelation dw was calculated using the following eq 1 28 1 dw d t 2 t e t e t 1 2 t 1 t e t 2 where e t are residuals from ols regression e t 1 are first order differences of residual homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances was used to test whether the assumption of equal or similar variances in different parameters being compared holds true this is an important assumption of parametric statistical tests because they are sensitive to any dissimilarities uneven variances in datasets result in biased and skewed test results 29 no multicollinearity was checked by plotting the heat map correlation 30 the goal of clustered heatmap is to build associations between both the data points and their features for the applicability of machine learning algorithms the data should be normally distributed normal distribution also known as the gaussian distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean 29 to verify whether the data follows the normal distribution the probability distribution factor was calculated using the eq 2 29 2 f x 1 σ 2 π e 1 2 x μ σ 2 where f x probability distribution factor σ standard deviation μ mean 2 3 feature selection the main objective of feature selection is to find the most pertinent input parameter from datasets the feature selection was carried out using pearson correlation analysis in this study the secondary data of hfcw using only gravel and sand as wetland fillers were collated and used for prediction this was done to minimize the variations due to filler media that s why wetland fillers have not been incorporated as a feature during feature selection similarly as the effect of plant assimilation is minimal in cw 30 the types of plant species were also not incorporated in the feature list 2 3 1 pearson correlation analysis in this study feature selection has been carried out by using the pearson coefficient σij and p test σij is the quickest and easiest method of feature selection 31 the σij values calculated between input and output parameters show the linear relationship ranges between 1 r 1 here the negative sign 1 shows a strong indirect correlation and the positive sign 1 shows a strong direct correlation between the two variables the calculation of σij was performed on microsoft excel and p values were calculated using minitab software the pearson correlation coefficient is calculated 32 using eq 3 3 σ i j cov f i f j var f i var f j where σij is a correlation coefficient between a given feature fi and all other features of the dataset fj cov is covariance and var is a variance 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa is used to determine the impact of one or more input parameters on the output variables this analysis is beneficial for improving the prediction of the model accuracy 32 in sensitivity analysis one input parameter is varied while keeping other parameters constant and the changes in the output variables are determined the greater the percentage change in the output value the more significant is the impact on the system and vice versa 33 although sensitivity analysis is more frequently performed after model generation to determine the relative contribution of the input variables this analysis can also be used to select input variables as suggested by islam et al 18 here the main objective of performing the sensitivity analysis was to observe the effects of feature changes on the optimal solutions of the machine learning model so that the features showing the maximum effect on the ml model can be selected many approaches have been followed for performing sensitivity analysis such as variance decomposition elementary effect etc in this study one at a time sensitivity analysis was performed on the datasets in which one parameter was changed and others were kept constant 28 the sensitivity indicator i e the relative difference between impact results with a modified parameter and reference values for the temporal parameter was calculated by the eq 4 28 4 relative difference n t av n t av ref n t av ref where n t av is the actual value at time t for the calculation ref indicates the reference calculation scenario effluents value after 10 change in input parameter with corresponding the actual values 2 4 machine learning algorithms two types of approaches were applied on the data set for the prediction of effluents from hfcws one is mlr and the other is svr the accuracy of predicted results using machine learning ml was determined by using coefficients of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse r2 indicates the accuracy of the model on datasets which ranges from 0 to 100 it also reflects how well the data fits on the regression model the higher r2 values indicate smaller differences between the testing and training datasets 33 rmse is the sd of the predicted error it shows how far the data is concentrated from the regression line it also represents the capability of the predictive method 34 the r2 and rmse were calculated using equations 5 and 6 respectively 30 35 5 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y y i 2 6 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n where yi is the true value y i is the average observed value x i is the forecast value by the model and n is the number of observations 2 4 1 multiple linear regression mlr mlr is a statistical tool that can be used for analysing the relationship between a single dependent and various independent variables the purpose of mlr is to predict the single dependent variable by using the independent variables 1 mlr is denoted as a line as shown in eq 7 36 7 y i β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β p x n e i where i 1 2 3 n yi and xi are dependent and independent variables respectively ei is intercept 2 4 2 support vector regression svr svr algorithm is based on the same principle as the support vector machines svms to predict discrete values the basic idea behind svr is to find the best fit line in svms this best fit line is an optimal hyperplane that has the maximum number of data points lying on the plane 9 37 svr is mathematically predicted by eq 8 9 8 f x i i 1 n w i φ x i b where w i and b are the parameters of the linear svr function and φ x i is the nonlinear svr function svr models are categorized into two types linear svm and non linear svm in this study a non linear svm mathematical model is used for prediction the nonlinear svr function the kernel function k x i x j ϕ x i ϕ x j is calculated and applied to make the inner products to evaluate the space and analyse the feature separating space 22 2 4 3 k fold cross validation the performance of classification algorithms was evaluated by using k fold validation the purpose of this study was to explore whether k fold cross validation should be repeatedly performed for obtaining reliable accuracy estimates mlr and svr models have been combined with k fold cross validation cv method to predict the effluent parameters k fold cross validation may reduce input dataset partition uncertainties and minimize overfitting issues the mean square error mse was calculated by eq 9 16 38 9 mse 1 n y i f x i 2 where n total number of observations yi the response value of the ith observation f xi the predicted response value of the ith observation the overall test mse was calculated by eq 5 27 10 test mse 1 k mse i where k is the number of folds msei is the test mse on the ith iteration 2 5 k value calculation using p k c approach k value can be computed by applying the reverse order p k c approach using eq 11 8 39 11 a pq i k c i c c o c 1 p 1 where co outlet concentration in mg l k first order areal removal rate coefficient in m d p apparent number of tanks in series c background concentration in mg l ci inlet concentration in mg l qi influent flow rate in m3 d 3 results and discussion in this paper the secondary data of 111 hfcw was used to predict the effluent parameter concentrations before the application of ml algorithms the collected data was pre processed to identify and rectify issues in the dataset a set of validation tests were performed to ascertain the suitability of the data for ml algorithms 3 1 data pre processing the durban watson statistics were used to check autocorrelation in the input variables with respect to output variables of a statistical regression analysis supplementary data most of the values were found to lie in the acceptable range of 1 5 to 2 5 28 the results show that autocorrelation exists and the low standard error values mean that the predictors are significant homoscedasticity was performed to check the uneven variances in datasets analysis of heteroscedasticity scatters plots between the design and effluents variables values supplementary data file show a classic cone shaped pattern of heteroscedasticity strong positive associations were found for bod effluent nh4 n effluent tn effluent tp effluent temperature wetland area tn effluent tp effluent nh4 n effluent temperature wetland area detention time nh4 n effluent wetland area detention time depth of filter media bod effluent tn effluent tp effluent wetland area detention time temperature bod effluent nh4 n effluent no multicollinearity was checked by plotting a correlation heat map as shown in fig 2 this type of heatmap implements clustering as part of the process of grouping similar features the correlation heat map was found to vary between 0 1 to 0 55 mostly but it goes up to 0 85 in some variables which means no multicollinearity exists in 111 hfcws datasets fig 2 shows that independent variables are not highly correlated with each other outliers in the data of 111 hfcws were checked by plotting the box and whisker graph using python coding as shown in fig 3 outliers were removed from datasets to increase the efficiency of machine learning based systems gaussian distribution curves supplementary data were plotted to determine the behaviour of datasets as symmetric unimodal and asymptotic the parameters bod effluent nh4 n effluent tn effluent tp effluent depth of filter media temperature design flow detention time and wetland area were following the normal distribution curve 3 2 feature selection 3 2 1 pearson correlation analysis table 3 shows the correlation between input variables and effluents mg l in our dataset along with the respective p values in brackets table 4 shows the correlation between input variables and effluents in terms of volumetric loading rates g m3 d and their respective p values the negative values in tables 3 and 4 indicate a negative correlation between the respective variables whereas positive values indicate a positive correlation apart from the influent concentrations some design and operational variables showed a strong correlation with effluents concentration with a significant p value 0 05 highlighted in bold font in tables 3 and 4 these include temperature design flow wetland area depth and detention time these parameters are expected to provide a better prediction of the effluent output parameters with good accuracy 25 and were thus selected as input parameters along with the inlet concentrations for ml algorithms 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis to perform sensitivity analysis the data of the input variable was changed by 10 while keeping another input parameter constant and the percentage change in effluent parameters bodout tnout tknout and tpout was measured by using a machine learning approach the same approach was applied to other input parameters and the measured results are shown in table 5 the highest change in bodout tnout tknout and tpout was found due to a change in the temperature and the depth of wetland media as shown in table 8 the sensitivity analysis is used to descript the contribution of the input variables to the results after the model has been built the utility of the sensitivity analysis was to find the most sensitive parameter with respect to the effluent s parameter a 10 change in temperature led to a significant change in the effluent parameters this is expected as an increase in temperature may increase biological reaction and removal efficiency or vice versa 21 a 10 change in wetland media depth and detention time also affected the effluents parameter as shown in table 8 this might happen as an increase in wetland depth might lead to the generation of an anoxic or anaerobic zone this might improve the removal efficiencies of certain parameters like tn and tp an increase in detention time is expected to provide sufficient time for the decomposition of organic waste in the wastewater which might lead to improvement in the removal efficiency of pollutants 21 actual and predicted values of bod tn nh4 n and tp effluents have been plotted as shown in supplementary data by a 10 change in the input values 3 3 prediction of effluent concentrations using mlr and svr machine learning ml model after training the model on the hfcws dataset n 1232 using two ml algorithms mlr and svr the model metrics r2 and rmse were estimated for testing and training datasets table 6 shows the r2 of predicted effluents in mg l bod cod tn nh4 n and tp using mlr and svr methods when the pollutant concentrations were used in mg l the mlr algorithm performed well for nh4 n and tn prediction with an r2 of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively the performance of this algorithm was however poor for bod r2 0 300 to 0 339 and cod r2 0 290 to 0 400 prediction and only slightly better for tp prediction r2 0 400 to 0 513 table 6 on the other hand when the svr method was used the prediction of bod and tp was considerably improved r2 0 52 0 60 and 0 6 to 0 8 respectively the prediction of other parameters also improved and the best prediction was observed in the case of tn where the r2 values reached 0 87 0 9 when pollutant concentrations in volumetric terms mg m3 d were used as input table 7 a better correlation was observed between the actual concentrations and the predicted concentrations using the mlr algorithm for all the pollutants the best correlation was observed in the case of tn r2 0 639 to 0 900 followed by nh4 n r2 0 634 to 0 800 and tp r2 0 605 to 0 700 the performance of the mlr algorithm was still poor for bod r2 0 497 to 0 600 and cod r2 0 477 to 0 500 as compared to the mlr algorithm the svr algorithm performed better the best predictions were observed for tn r2 0 900 to 0 949 followed by nh4 n r2 0 815 to 0 900 however in some cases a high variation between the training and testing r2 values was observed e g bod 0 4 vs 0 732 and tp 0 4 vs 0 705 respectively the reason for this variability could be the large variations in the influent concentrations and the nature of the wastewater 9 for effluent cod prediction the performance of svr was still poor r2 0 400 to 0 455 overall the accuracy of prediction of effluents using the svr model is very good as compared to the mlr model this could be due to the fact that the mlr method is a linear fit model while svr is a non linear fit 9 22 the order of decreasing r2 in both svr and mlr algorithms was found to be tn nh4 n tp bod cod a previous study by zhang et al 24 also stated that the prediction of tn and nh4 n can be performed with higher accuracy using the svr model similarly lian sheng et al 40 also reported a strong correlation r2 0 91 between tn and nh4 n effluents predicted using the svr method and their loading rates 3 4 detailed analysis of effluent concentrations predicted using mlr and svr the predicted and actual effluent concentrations in mg l and volumetric loading rate g m3 d of different effluent parameters cod tn nh4 n and tp effluents in mg l and g m3 day are shown in fig 4 for mlr models the corresponding graphs for the svr algorithm are shown in supplementary data the values on the x axis have been ordered according to the increasing organic loading rate when the pollutant concentration in mg l was used for bod and cod prediction using mlr the predicted values of low olr hfcws were found to be lower than the actual values whereas at higher olr these values were found to be higher than the actual values fig 4 this behaviour could be observed due to the differences in the composition of high olr e g primary treated and low olr e g secondary treated wastewater therefore to further improve the effluent pollutant prediction the dataset of hfcws was divided into two parts low olr 5 to 30 g m3 d and high olr 30 to 150 g m3 d the 30 g m3 d cut off was chosen as a trade off between the type of wastewater primary vs secondary and the number of datasets in each class lower olr and high olr 3 5 effluent prediction using dataset classified according to olr the r2 values between actual and predicted effluent concentrations for low olr and high olr datasets using predicted pollutant concentration from mlr and svr methods are shown in tables 5 and 6 when the pollutant concentration was used in terms of mg l the classification of data lead to improvement in the r2 values for the mlr algorithm especially in the high olr dataset the best accuracy was observed in the case of tn prediction while the r2 values for the low olr dataset were slightly reduced the corresponding values for the high olr dataset were considerably improved for tn prediction and reached values of 0 900 to 0 957 table 6 a similar trend was observed in the case of nh4 n where the prediction of a high olr dataset was significantly improved with an r2 of 0 841 to 0 910 for tp prediction the r2 values were improved for low olr r2 0 500 to 0 567 but reduced for the high olr dataset with a high degree of variation for testing and training set r2 0 328 vs 0 600 while for cod the predicted values remained more or less similar following the classification of the dataset the bod values remained similar at low olr but considerably improved at higher olr r2 0 589 to 0 601 for the prediction of pollutant concentration mg l using svr similar trends were observed for both bod and cod the prediction at lower olr remained more or less similar whereas the prediction at higher olr was improved r2 0 609 to 0 800 and 0 494 to 0 800 respectively for the remaining pollutants nh4 n tn and tp the prediction performance was reduced at low olr and it was improved at high olr when the volumetric pollutant concentrations were used for prediction using mlr table 7 the effluent bod and cod predictions improved at lower olr r2 0 597 to 0 600 and 0 700 to 0 817 respectively nh4 n prediction remained similar before and after dataset classification tn prediction was found to worsen at lower olr whereas tp prediction was found to worsen at both high and low olr when svr was used to predict volumetric pollutant concentrations the bod prediction showed high variations in r2 values between the training and testing set with overall r2 remaining similar to the unclassified dataset table 7 the effluent cod prediction was improved at low olr r2 0 600 to 0 849 tn prediction was marginally improved at high olr whereas nh4 n prediction didn t show much effect on data classification on the other hand tp prediction was considerably improved at lower olr overall classifying the dataset into low olr and high olr datasets may lead to better prediction of bod mg l at higher olr and cod g m3 d at lower olr while nh4 n and tn appear to be better predicted in terms of mg l at high olr after classification the corresponding values in g m3 d reveal no such advantage of data classification in nh4 n and tn prediction dataset classification showed no advantage to tp prediction in mg l but in volumetric terms prediction at lower olr could be achieved with high accuracy after classifying the dataset according to olr 3 6 model expression equations for mlr multiple linear regression using python coding was

shows how well the ml is expected to be executed on unforeseen datasets 41 the smaller the value of rmse the better the algorithm model 31 after the prediction of effluent concentrations rmse was used to assess the accuracy and data fitting of the algorithm table 8 rmse was found to be very low for the svr model for all the effluents in mg l and g m3 d these results are in accordance with a previous study 42 in which the svr model was reported to be better as compared to the mlr model in terms of the accuracy of prediction results lower rmse overall for the svr model rmse was observed to be lower in the case of effluents in g m3 d as compared to the effluents in mg l for prediction of cod 0 12 tn 0 18 bod 0 36 nh4 n 0 44 effluents whereas the reverse was found to be true in case of tp effluents 0 23 svr this might have happened due to the fact that the variation of datasets is lower in the case of effluents in g m3 d as compared to the same values in mg l 30 these results are comparable with those of guo et al 9 43 who reported similar low values for effluent bod and cod prediction using the svr method 3 8 k fold cross validation datasets of 111 hfcws were collected between 2002 and 2021 20 years k k 3 fold cross validation was performed in three trials in the first trial training was performed on 2002 08 datasets testing on 2015 21 datasets and validation was performed on 2009 15 datasets in a similar way datasets were shuffled in trail 2 and trial 3 fig 5 mse values obtained in trials 1 2 and 3 were 87 29 49 29 and 27 76 k fold cross validation was helpful to reduce the mse value by 68 19 and increase the r2 value by 16 13 the r2 of training and testing datasets values are shown in the supplementary file the use of k fold validation is effective in minimization of bias in the selection of testing sets also helps to neutralize the prediction errors 3 9 calculation of predicted k values in a previous study from our group the k values were improved by removing the lower olr cws due to underloaded systems and the data were further classified based on depth olr and type of treatment these customized k values were further adapted for optimizing the design of cws 4 as a next step towards the customization of k values in this work the machine learning approach was applied to predict effluent concentrations after predicting the effluent concentration first order areal rate coefficient k m d values were calculated by using the reverse p k c approach 44 the relationship between the actual k values k values calculated using actual influent and effluent concentrations given in literature and the predicted k values calculated using influent concentrations from literature and effluent concentrations predicted using mlr and svr algorithms is shown in fig 6 the accuracy of predicted k values in the svr model is better as compared to the mlr model actual k values derived by using the p k c approach lie within the range of 0 006 to 0 40 m d whereas the predicted k values lie in the range of 0 11 to 0 90 m d in the case of the mlr model and 0 07 to 0 76 m d in the case of the svr model k values of nh4 n shows a negative predicted value in the case of higher olr cws in both mlr and svr model this observation shows that the prediction efficiency is lower on the high olr side this might have happened due to large variations in datasets on the high olr side 45 r2 of both k1 and k2 values which were calculated using predicted effluents of bod cod nh4 n and tn in mg l and g m3 d are higher for the svr model as compared to the mlr model r2 of k2 values calculated using effluent in volumetric loading rate are fairly good but lower as compared to the r2 of k2 values calculated using effluent in mg l higher r2 was obtained in the case of the svr model in the prediction of kbod and kcod r2 0 982 and 0 968 respectively as compared to knh4 n and ktn r2 0 845 and 0 889 respectively whereas ktp r2 0 612 could not be predicted accurately using either of the two methods these k values can be further used for the calculation of the area of hfcws using different input parameters and will be helpful in optimizing the design of cws in terms of area this robust prediction using the svr algorithm is a realistic way to support the design of hfcws 9 by inserting the raw inputs the output results of effluents can be predicted using the ml model which can be used to further calculate the k values in different scenarios these results offer decision making solutions regarding the construction investment of hfcws by further increasing the dataset this method could be reliably used to optimize the design of cws 30 3 10 validation of algorithm using primary data validation of the predicted k values was carried out using the primary data from two hfcws deep wetlands treating domestic wastewater cw1 and hospital wastewater cw2 14 months average data of effluents and influents concentrations of cw1 and cw2 are shown in table 10 k values of cw1 and cw2 were calculated using the first order plug flow equation and compared with the k values predicted using mlr and svr methods it has been found that k values calculated using the method are much closer to the actual k values as shown in table 10 it indicates that the svr method gives a better prediction of k values as compared to the mlr method as also suggested by other researchers 9 46 4 conclusion a machine learning approach utilizing mlr and svr algorithms was used to predict the effluent parameter concentrations in hfcws using the selected input features svr model was found to perform with better accuracy as compared to mlr model for the prediction of bod cod nh4 n and tn when datasets were used in g m3 d nh4 n and tn could be predicted with high accuracy of r2 0 847 and 0 947 and root mean square error rmse of 0 44 and 0 18 respectively was observed classification of dataset on the basis of olr led to better prediction of bod mg l at high olr r2 0 609 cod g m3 d at low olr r2 0 746 and tp g m3 d at low olr r2 0 806 k values calculated by the reverse p k c approach using the effluent concentrations predicted with the svr model were found to be highly correlated to the actual k values of bod cod and tn the observed r2 between the two was in the range of 0 889 to 0 982 and 0 819 to 0 954 respectively for values in mg l and g m3 d thus the svr algorithm can be applied for predicting the k values for bod cod and tn with high confidence that can be helpful to optimize the design of hfcws in terms of area requirement for organics and nitrogen removal the reliability of the svr algorithm can be further enhanced by the incorporation of more data declaration of competing interest the

12762,a coffee ground composite membrane for copper adsorption was prepared using used coffee grounds and polycaprolactone a biodegradable polymer the prepared sample shows a removal efficiency of 90 or more in 4 h at a concentration of 100 μm 13 45 ppm which satisfies the drinking water acceptance criteria of 1 5 mg l 1 set by the world health organization the functional groups of the coffee composite filter were analyzed with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the surface of the filter membrane was analyzed using scanning electron microscope uv vis spectrophotometry confirmed the adsorption capacity and amount of cu ii adsorption of the filter or coffee grounds and langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and fritz schlunder isotherms were used to investigate the removal mechanism the kinetic studies were also performed to clearly demonstrate the adsorption process keywords coffee cu ii adsorption filter composite data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction recently there has been an increase in copper ion containing wastewater discharge from excavation operations or general industrial sites 1 in particular since copper exhibits excellent electrical properties as electrode materials for semiconductor devices an economic method to treat and recycle copper in wastewater is required copper is a well known highly toxic material that can cause hemolysis and cirrhosis while damaging renal tubules the brain and other organs 2 3 therefore the allowance standard for copper emission from wastewater treating plants in korea is regulated to under 3 mg l 1 4 the world health organization who has determined an acceptable limit for copper concentration in drinking water of 1 5 mg l 1 5 there are several methods to remove heavy metal contaminants from wastewater such as adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane microfiltration and ultrafiltration 6 8 among them as a method to remove copper from industrial wastewater the hydroxide precipitation method in which lime cao is used to precipitate cu oh 2 is primarily used 9 however this process is costly due to additional processing steps to remove residual sludge after adsorption 10 and the additional cost of large amounts of lime used to adsorb small amount of copper ions in the third step of the process 11 12 hence there is a clear need to replace lime so used coffee grounds a natural waste have been considered 13 15 as the international coffee market increases every year used coffee grounds are a problem in society 0 68 tons of coffee grounds are generated per 1 ton of coffee produced 16 and the coffee grounds generated in this way cannot be used as animal feed or fertilizers due to the caffeine so they are landfilled 17 however greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide generated by anaerobic decomposition in the landfill are the main culprits of environmental pollution therefore to reduce the amount of coffee grounds a method for recycling them as a heavy metal adsorbent has been proposed first the surface of coffee grounds has a porous structure and is composed of functional groups such as hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups exhibit negative charges 15 18 19 therefore it is possible to form an ionic bond with positive charged heavy metals in wastewater or physically adsorb to them by applying this principle many studies are being conducted to remove heavy metal ions in wastewater using coffee grounds in a study by nam et al coffee grounds were used as an adsorbent to remove arsenic as in wastewater according to the study the maximum adsorption capacity of 1 g of coffee grounds in 1 00 mm arsenic solution was 6 44 mg l 1 and the adsorption properties improved as the concentration of arsenic and amount of coffee grounds increased however since arsenic exists as an anion in wastewater it cannot interact with the coffee grounds due to the repulsive interactions therefore only physical adsorption was achieved by the porous surface of the coffee grounds 20 kyzas research aimed to remove copper and chromium ions from aqueous solutions using coffee grounds the maximum adsorption capacity of coffee grounds reached 70 mg g 1 for cu ii and 45 mg g 1 for cr vi and adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 120 min 21 in another study by oliveira et al cu ii cd ii and zn ii in aqueous solution were removed using untreated coffee grounds as an adsorbent in all three cases adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 72 h and the adsorption efficiency reached 89 98 in the equilibrium state of cu ii 65 85 in the case of cd ii and 48 79 in the case of zn ii 22 however when coffee grounds themselves are used as adsorbents there is a limitation in that the adsorbed coffee grounds must be filtered with a separate filter for this reason as an alternative a type of membrane applicable to the advanced oxidation process is attracting attention 23 the membrane has the dual functionality of adsorption and physical filtration and provides other advantages such as high removal efficiency low operating pressure high water flux and low footprint 24 since the membrane filter uses ion exchange to bind heavy metal ions it is characterized by its high affinity for ions and molecules 25 26 and the large surface area which is a characteristic of nanofibers has a significant effect on the adsorption and removal efficiency of contaminants in wastewater 27 in this study a nanofibrous membrane filter was prepared by electrospinning coffee grounds with polycaprolactone a biodegradable polymer for copper removal the functional groups of the membrane were analyzed through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the surface of the adsorption membrane was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy sem uv vis spectrophotometry was performed to confirm the adsorption capacity and amount of cu ii adsorption of the prepared filter and langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and fritz schlunder isotherms were used to explain the adsorption parameters the kinetic studies were also carried out to further reveal the adsorption process 2 experimental 2 1 materials starbucks discarded house blend coffee capsules were used for the coffee grounds in this experiment the coffee grounds were dried at 60 c for 24 h with no extra washing or grinding process polycaprolactone pcl mn 80 000 g mol was purchased from sigma aldrich formic acid 99 0 and ethanol 94 5 were purchased from samchun chemicals korea and acetic acid acetic acid 99 7 was purchased from sigma aldrich copper ii chloride cucl2 99 ammonium chloride 99 5 bis cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone bco 99 0 ammonium citrate tribasic triammonium citrate 97 ammonium hydroxide solution nh3 h2o and acetaldehyde 99 5 were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 manufacturing process the membrane filter for copper ion removal was prepared in two different ways i electrospinning coffee grounds by dissolving them with pcl blended sample type i and ii electrospraying coffee grounds with pcl electrospinning electrosprayed sample type ii as shown in fig 1a in the case of type i 15 wt pcl solution in acetic acid and 20 wt coffee grounds solution in formic acid were mixed at a 8 2 ratio and then electrospun for type ii 15 wt pcl solution prepared in a 3 1 acetic acid to formic acid ratio was electrospun and separately coffee grounds dispersed in ethanol 4 wt were electrosprayed fig 1b the ratio of acetic acid to formic acid for the best spinnability of pcl fibers was selected in accordance with previous studies in general formic acid is effective in dissolving high molecular weight polymers and is electrically conductive thus helping in nanofiber electrospinning the diameter of pcl fibers varies from 141 nm to 282 nm as formic acid content decreases from 50 to 0 respectively 28 30 in this study a mixture of 75 acetic acid and 25 formic acid was chosen to spin uniform bead free fibers moreover pcl is not included in the cu ii adsorption chemistry therefore the cu ii removal performance should not be significantly changed by the solvent conditions an 18g id 0 84 mm od 1 27 mm nozzle was used for electrospinning of the blended solution and spun at a flow rate of 0 3 ml h 1 for 2 h the distance between the drum collector and nozzle was fixed to 10 cm and the voltage was set to 15 5 kv the electrospinning environment was set at a room temperature of 25 c and a relative humidity of 40 50 for the electrosprayed sample in which electrospraying and electrospinning were performed simultaneously a 20g id 0 60 mm od 0 91 mm nozzle was used for the pcl solution and the solution was spun at a flow rate of 0 3 ml h 1 for 2 h similarly the distance from the drum collector to nozzle was fixed at 10 cm and the voltage was set to 15 5 kv a 14g id 1 6 mm od 2 1 mm nozzle was used to prevent clogging of the nozzle by coffee grounds during electrospraying in addition this solution was spun for 2 h at a flow rate of 0 3 ml h 1 to match the content of the coffee grounds as in the blended sample the distance between the drum collector and nozzle was fixed at 5 cm and electrospraying was performed at a voltage of 18 kv 2 3 characterization to evaluate the adsorption characteristics of copper ions by the prepared membranes cucl2 was dissolved in di water to model wastewater an isothermal adsorption experiment was conducted under equal weight conditions in which the amount of adsorbent was fixed and the concentration of cu ii was varied in the cu modeled wastewater prior to the experiment cu wastewater was prepared at concentrations of 50 100 150 250 500 and 1000 μm which are 3 18 6 35 9 53 15 9 31 8 and 63 5 ppm respectively the initial ph of the wastewater was 5 0 after that a nanofibrous membrane coffee content in the membrane 0 13 mg cm 2 was cut to 6 cm 3 2 cm dipped in a 5 ml cucl2 solution and stirred at 230 rpm at 35 c for 4 h to check maximum adsorption capacity in addition as a comparison group 2 5 mg of coffee grounds that is same mass of coffee contained in the electrospun or electrosprayed membrane were tested by same method to measure the amount of copper ions removed as a function of reaction time another nanofiber membrane with dimensions of 6 cm 3 2 cm coffee content 2 49 mg or 2 5 mg of coffee grounds was placed into 5 ml of a 100 μm solution and the adsorption capacity was measured at 35 c and 230 rpm for up to 6 h separately to quantify the quick copper ions absorption the filter membrane or 0 6 mg of coffee grounds were placed on a syringe filter tarsons india diameter 25 mm and 10 30 50 70 and 90 ml h 1 of cu wastewater were flowed the surface of the prepared fiber was analyzed under a voltage of 15 kv through an sem nova nanosem450 fei usa the diameter of the nanofiber was measured from at least 100 fibers the c1s peak spectrum was found using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer system thermo fisher scientific usa to determine the surface chemical composition of the prepared samples the specific surface area and pore volume of the sample were analyzed by multiport chemisorption physisorption micropore analyzer 3flex micromeritics usa uv vis spectrophotometric analysis was performed to measure the amount of copper ions remaining in the cucl2 solution to detect copper ions yang et al s 31 acetaldehyde bis cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone bco method was used 1 4 ml triammonium citrate 20 g triammonium citrate in 100 ml distilled water 1

the heavy metal removal efficiency re was obtained by eq 2 2 re c 0 c e c 0 100 3 results and discussions 3 1 morphological analysis as can be seen in fig 2b the coffee grounds before being spun looked uneven overall due to their smooth and angular surfaces the fiber diameter measured is 91 3 32 5 nm in a blended sample fig 2a left panel and 299 9 84 2 nm in an electrosprayed sample fig 2b left panel we presume that the fiber diameter differs with the spinning method because the spinning distance influences a lot in the case of electrically sprayed coffee grounds the nozzle is located about 5 cm away from the drum collector because coffee grounds with large particles have to be coated on the fiber for this reason it seems that ethanol was deposited on the fiber before it was sufficiently evaporated and thin fibers were not formed due to moisture fig 2b shows that small particles of coffee grounds are located between fibers the coffee grounds collected in the fiber serves to adsorb copper ions contained in the wastewater as shown by the microscopic images in the right panels of fig 2a and b after the adsorption test the overall structure remained intact no broken fibers were observed the diameters of the blended and electrosprayed fibers were 97 8 61 9 and 310 8 94 7 nm respectively the as spun fiber diameter before the test differed by merely 1 6 the tga results also confirmed that the pcl fibers and blended electrosprayed coffee materials were conserved after the adsorption test not shown here the rapid weight loss at 300 425 c was caused by the thermal decomposition of the pcl polymer chain 32 coffee releases volatile elements at 257 400 c 33 the tga curves of pcl and coffee materials had no significant changes during the adsorption test furthermore the coffee particles in the electrosprayed sample were preserved well thereafter we conducted xps analysis to understand the surface chemical composition of the prepared adsorption membranes curve fitting of the c1s spectrum was performed using the gaussian lorentzian peak shape after linear background correction the c 1s xps spectrum of pcl showed typical peaks of c c c h c o c and o c o bonds at 284 5 285 5 and 288 7 ev fig 3a the coffee grounds exhibited more diverse functional groups such as c c c h c o c c oh c o and o c oh at 284 5 285 5 287 2 and 289 1 ev respectively fig 3b as expected the electrosprayed sample presented overlapping signals of pcl and the coffee grounds because they were sequentially deposited by electrospinning and electrospray fig 3c the blended sample also presented overlapped signals but the signals of the functional groups of the coffee grounds were weaker than those of the electrosprayed sample fig 3d the relative weakness of the signals of the functional groups of the coffee grounds was reasonable as these functional groups were partially buried in pcl during the blending process 3 2 isothermal adsorption test in order to check the prepared adsorption membranes for the adsorption performance we put them in standard solutions having initial concentrations of 50 100 150 250 500 and 1000 mm and stirred respectively after stirring at 35 c at a speed of 230 rpm for 4 h we conducted uv vis spectrophotometry of the solutions with the adsorption membrane removed in order to analyze a trace of copper present in the solution with uv vis spectrophotometer chelation should be done by adding a polymer such as polyethylenimine pei 34 however there is an issue in that an extract such as caffeine is produced from the coffee added into the adsorption membrane resulting in peak interference making it impossible to analyze accurately the maximum peak of uv vis spectra of caffeine dissolved in water was observed at the 272 nm wavelength band 35 and the maximum peak of uv vis spectra of copper chelate made in reaction with pei was observed at the 275 nm wavelength band 34 therefore for the detection of copper we added a bco solution so that we could observe the maximum peak at the 545 nm wavelength band 31 the effect of ph conditions on the removal of cu ii ions was evaluated at ph 2 10 concentration 100 μm the removal rate was only 2 62 at ph 2 but dramatically increased to 99 1 at ph 5 from ph 6 to 10 the removal efficiency was higher than 91 9 but was mainly contributed by hydroxide precipitation under the alkaline condition it is well known process referred to ref 36 37 as the reaction follows cu2 aq 2naoh aq cu oh 2 s 2na aq therefore in this study all the cu ii removal test was carried out by fixing the ph to 5 to disregards the unexpected precipitation as shown in fig 4a in the case of coffee grounds copper ions in wastewater were completely removed when the initial concentration is 150 μm or less and the removal performance was 91 1 at a concentration of 250 μm also in the case of the electrosprayed sample most of the copper ions were removed at an initial concentration of 150 μm or less and the removal efficiency was 82 1 at a concentration of 250 μm or less this is because the particles of coffee grounds are located between nanofibers of pcl while maintaining large particle sizes and porous surfaces without being dissolved or affected in a solvent thereby having favorable conditions for adsorption the copper removal efficiencies of blended samples in standard solutions with initial concentrations of 50 and 100 μm were 97 0 and 96 9 respectively meaning most copper ions in the standard solution were removed however in a 250 μm solution it was 66 4 meaning the higher the concentration of the standard solution the lower the removal efficiency the graph comparing the amount of copper ions adsorbed per adsorbent mg g 1 shown in fig 4b we find that the three samples represented high copper removal efficiency in common at concentrations of 50 μm and 100 μm in particular at the concentration of 100 μm coffee grounds and electroprayed sample showed similar adsorption amounts and blended sample also showed adsorption amount of 12 3 mg g 1 however at the concentration of 150 μm at which the adsorption efficiency of the blended sample decreased a large difference in adsorption amount occurred from the other two samples at the concentration of 250 μm the adsorption efficiency in all samples decreased however the adsorption amount increased compared to that at the concentration of 150 μm respectively this was because the concentration of copper ions present in the standard solution is higher than the maximum possible adsorption amount of each adsorbent in addition in the case of 50 μm and 100 μm we interpret that the adsorption amount is smaller than 150 μm despite the highest removal efficiency because the concentration of copper ions contained in the standard solution is low when applying an adsorption membrane to actual sites it is important to completely remove a trace of copper so we set 100 μm the higher among the concentrations showing the maximum removal rate as the optimal initial concentration the specific surface areas of the composite materials were measured using bet the surface area of the blended sample was 5 9 m2 g whereas that of the electrosprayed sample was 3 7 m2 g therefore the smaller the fiber diameter the larger the surface area the blended fibers had larger surface areas than the electrosprayed fibers because the diameter of the former was three times smaller than that of the latter however this did not lead to a higher cu ii removal efficiency according to fig 4 hence removal efficiency was determined by not only the specific surface area but also the surface functional groups therefore the higher removal efficiency of the electrosprayed sample relative to the blended sample suggested that the molecular structure or chemistry of the original coffee grounds was conserved better during the electrospray process than in the blended solution thereafter the adsorption results were plotted to several isotherm models that contain two or more parameters to explain the adsorption mechanism at equilibrium the plotting of adsorption isotherms in linear regression is inappropriate for selecting best fitting models as it leads to unreliable conclusions 38 therefore nonlinear regression was used to estimate the parameters of the isotherms fig 5 three mathematical error functions were used to determine the suitability of each isotherm the coefficient of determination r2 sum of absolute error sae and chi square χ2 were calculated from the isotherms table 1 and fig 5 langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms are simple two parameter models to investigate the mechanism of adsorbent adsorbate interactions at equilibrium langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is based on a model that the bonding force of adsorption acts as the thickness of the monomolecular layer and no further adsorption occurs on the monomolecular layer thus langmuir adsorption is called monomolecular adsorption which was applied to the equation as follows eq 3 39 3 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e here kl is the langmuir constant related to the adsorption rate l mg 1 and qmax is the langmuir adsorption amount mg g 1 indicating the theoretical maximum monomolecular layer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent used in addition the freundlich adsorption isotherm equation is derived by introducing the fact that adsorption heat exponentially decreases with the degree of surface coverage in the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation this means that adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent where the energy distribution is not uniform and varies with the surface coverage rate the freundlich adsorption isotherm is applicable not only to the monomolecular layer adsorption but also to the polymolecular layer adsorption 40 taking logs on both sides of the relevant equation we can express non linear equation as follows eq 4 41 4 q e k f c e 1 n k f and n are freundlich constants k f is a measure of the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent l mg 1 and the larger it is the better the adsorption capacity is n represents the heterogeneity in the case of a fiber formed adsorption membrane the k f value was 13 23 for the blended sample and 19 72 for the electrosprayed sample which was lower than 25 52 for the result of coffee grounds this is consistent with the results of the previous adsorption experiments that show the copper removal efficiency of the nanofiber adsorption membrane is lower than that of the coffee grounds the langmuir equation enables us to determine the suitability of the adsorption process using the dimensionless separation coefficient r l 5 r l 1 1 k l c o when the dimensionless separation coefficient is in the range of 0 r l 1 the adsorption treatment is deemed to be suitable 42 as the dimensionless separation coefficient r l obtained through the experiment was 0 0066 for the blended sample 0 0030 for the coffee grounds and 0 0053 for the electroprayed sample the adsorption process of each sample can be presumed to be in the suitable range the maximum adsorption amount q max available from the y intercept of the langmuir adsorption isothermal graph was found to be 25 91 45 31 and 35 39 mg g 1 respectively in addition the adsorption process can be differentiated by the freundlich constant n n 1 means a chemical adsorption process and n 1 means a physical adsorption process 43 the n derived as a result of the experiment was found to be 4 6 or more in all samples indicating that the physical adsorption process was dominant overall in particular in the adsorption membrane samples it is presumed that physical adsorption of nanofibers was made in the form of a complicated mat rather than adsorption by ionic bonding in addition the values of the separation coefficient 1 n which is the reciprocal of n enter within the excellent adsorption operation range of 0 1 to 0 5 where adsorption can easily occur 44 the redlich peterson and fritz schlunder adsorption isotherms include three and four parameters respectively the equations of these multiparameter isotherm models were derived by the modification of the elements in the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the redlich peterson adsorption isotherm is an empirical model containing three parameters and it can be utilized for various adsorption equilibria covering a wide range of concentrations moreover it is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption systems owing to its versatility and we can express the isotherm equation as follows 45 6 q e k r c e 1 a r c e g where k r and a r are the redlich peterson isotherm constant l g 1 and l mg 1 respectively and the exponent g assumes a value between 1 and 0 this model can be reduced to a freundlich isotherm equation when the adsorbent concentration is high enough in the liquid phase the fritz schlunder isotherm involves four parameters and was derived by fritz and schlunder via an empirical extension of the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations 46 a wide range of experimental results can be interpreted with this model due to the various coefficients included in the isotherm equation and the mathematically modified form is as follows 7 q e a c e α 1 b c e β where a and b are the fritz schluder constant l g 1 and α and β are the fritz schlunder exponents when α β 1 the fritz schlunder model becomes a langmuir isotherm model but at high concentration it reduces into a freundlich isotherm model 47 among the four adsorption isotherm models the fritz schlunder model showed the best result in terms of error functions yielding the highest r2 values and the lowest sae and χ2 for all samples table 2 hence the fritz schlunder isotherm was suitable for the experimental data and the adsorption mechanism could not be solely explained by homogeneous monolayer adsorption since the fritz schlunder isotherm is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the adsorption processes of all three samples exhibited the characteristics of both monolayer and multilayer adsorption 48 isotherm studies suggested that the adsorption process of all samples was analogous it was well fitted with the langmuir absorption model at low concentrations of cu ii but it followed the freundlich adsorption model with increasing cu ii concentration 3 3 adsorption kinetics thereafter in order to see the copper removal efficiency differ with the adsorption time we conducted adsorption experiments with different times at a standard concentration of 100 μm we applied the adsorption time changing from the minimum of 1 min to the maximum of 360 min and the results are summarized in fig 6 in the case of coffee grounds and blended samples the removal rate was found to be 90 or higher when the adsorption time was 2 h or longer but in the case of electrosprayed samples the removal rate was seen to be below 80 for the electrosprayed sample there might be uneven spinning carried out due to the influence of the particle size of the bulk coffee grounds in the spinning process in addition as seen in the results up to the first 10 min of adsorption on fig 6b and unlike the adsorption results for 2 h the adsorption membranes prepared in electrospinning showed higher adsorption performance in a short time than coffee grounds the electrospun composite membranes exhibited better adsorption than the coffee grounds within the first 10 min because their specific surface area was larger than that of the coffee grounds hence the three dimensional structure of the electrospun membranes significantly affected their surface areas a large surface area can provide a large number of surface functional groups for the adsorption of copper ions thus there may have been more active functional groups exposed on the surfaces of the electrosprayed and blended samples than those on the coffee grounds in the first 10 min as the coffee grounds of the electrosprayed sample were evenly deposited on its surface through the electrospray process whereas those of the blended sample were homogeneously dispersed through blending and electrospinning by contrast the coffee grounds were in powdered form and it took time for their dispersion in the aqueous solutions of copper ions to fully harness their functional groups for copper ion adsorption therefore the removal rate of copper ions was higher with the electrospun membranes than with the coffee grounds within the first 10 min however the total number of available functional groups was larger on the coffee grounds than those on the electrosprayed and blended samples because some active functional groups were buried in the electrospun membranes therefore the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium was higher for the coffee grounds than the electrosprayed and blended samples from this result we presume that the adsorption membranes prepared are suitable for applications to heavy metal wastewater of low concentration only for a short period of time kinetic studies were conducted to investigate the rate determining step in the adsorption process of cu ii by the absorbents the adsorption data were fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model and the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model fig 7 the kinetic constants and error deviation data resulting from the fitting are shown in table 3 the linearized equations of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are expressed as eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e t where q t is the adsorption capacity at contact time t mg g 1 q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively and t min is the contact time the r2 values of the pseudo second order kinetic model were 0 999 for the coffee grounds and the blended sample and 0 996 for the electrosprayed sample these values were markedly higher than those obtained with the pseudo first order model in addition the sae and χ2 values were lower and the calculated q e was much closer to the experimental q e with the pseudo second order model than the pseudo first order model indicating that the pseudo second order model coincided more with our experimental adsorption process hence chemisorption was a rate determining step in cu ii adsorption on the coffee grounds blended sample and electrosprayed sample 49 for further kinetic study the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model was employed it can provide an interpretation of the adsorption rate which is controlled by the speed of adsorbate diffusion in adsorbents the equation of this model is as follows 50 10 q t k id t 1 2 c where k id is the constant of the intraparticle diffusion rate mg g 1 min1 2 c is a constant implying the thickness of boundary layer mg g 1 and q t is the adsorption capacity corresponding to the reaction contact time mg g 1 a straight weber morris curve means that intraparticle diffusion affects the adsorption rate if the curve passes through the origin of the graph then intraparticle diffusion is the only rate determining step 51 as shown in fig 7c the curves from the diffusion model were roughly divided into two straight lines with different slopes and indicated that intraparticle diffusion was not the only rate determining step neither line passes through the origin of the graph the two straight lines implied that the diffusion process for the coffee grounds electrosprayed sample and blended sample consisted of boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion the slope corresponding to boundary layer diffusion was larger than that corresponding to intraparticle diffusion thus the main rate determining step was intraparticle diffusion 3 4 adsorption performance according to flow rate when we apply the adsorption membrane to copper wastewater in the actual field it is necessary to compare the adsorption performance depending on the flow rate therefore after putting 5 ml of solution of standard concentration of 100 μm into a syringe we measured the copper removal efficiency of the adsorption membrane while varying the syringe pump flow rates to 10 30 50 70 and 90 ml h 1 with adsorption membranes applied to a syringe filter with a diameter of 25 mm the area is approximately 4 9 cm2 which is smaller than the area of the isothermal adsorption film for previously conducted experiment therefore we conducted the experiment by calculating the amount of coffee grounds contained in the area as 0 6 mg and the results were summarized as in fig 8 in the case of the electrosprayed sample 54 7 of copper ions were removed when 5 ml of artificial wastewater entirely passed the adsorption membrane at a flow rate of 10 ml h 1 on the other hand in the case of the blended sample 52 8 of copper ions were removed and the copper removal rate was lower than that of the electrosprayed sample at all flow rates in both samples the average removal rate tends to decrease as the flow rate increases because artificial wastewater contacts the nanofiber adsorption membrane resulting in reduced time for adsorption in addition its adsorption performance was degraded by 50 compared to the 4 h adsorption results shown in the previous experiment because the adsorption time was shorter than 4 h and the area in contact with wastewater was reduced which seemed to affect the performance of the adsorption membranes 4 conclusions we prepared the nanofiber adsorption membrane for copper ions removal by electrospinning using coffee grounds and pcls and in order to check the difference in performance between samples following the spinning method we prepared samples by electrospinning after blending coffee grounds and pcls and samples by electrospraying and electrospinning them in separate for comparing with additionally prepared adsorption membranes we put coffee grounds to test as a reference sample when we cut the prepared adsorption membrane to a size of 6 cm 3 2 cm coffee content 2 49 mg and introduced into artificial copper wastewater of 50 100 150 and 250 μm the removal efficiency for 50 μm and 100 μm after 4 h was over 96 9 and the removal efficiency of blended sample of 150 μm or higher was reduced to 77 3 applying the results of the experiment to langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and fritz schlunder adsorption isotherm equations to grasp the adsorption characteristics of each adsorbent as a result it was found that the adsorption process on the nanofiber membranes containing coffee grounds was best fitted with the fritz schlunder adsorption isotherm in addition the kinetic studies also revealed that the absorption process was governed by the pseudo second order kinetic model and the diffusion process was consisted of boundary and intra particle diffusions while the intra particle diffusion is a rate determining step in addition when we conducted adsorption in artificial wastewater of 100 μm for up to 6 h nanofiber adsorption membranes showed higher adsorption efficiency by up to 56 6 than coffee grounds in an environment of adsorption for 10 min finally when we inserted an adsorption membrane into a syringe filter of 25 mm diameter and conducted an adsorption experiment at a flow rate of 10 90 ml h 1 the electrosprayed sample showed copper ion removal efficiency up to 54 7 the copper adsorption membrane prepared in this study using coffee grounds makes sense in that it enables us to remove copper that causes environmental pollution by recycling coffee grounds which is a daily waste discarded in who s drinking water acceptance criteria the copper concentration is 1 5 mg l 1 and the blended sample prepared in this study showed removal efficiency of 90 or more upon adsorption for 4 h or more at a concentration of 100 μm 13 45 ppm to meet the criteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

12762,a coffee ground composite membrane for copper adsorption was prepared using used coffee grounds and polycaprolactone a biodegradable polymer the prepared sample shows a removal efficiency of 90 or more in 4 h at a concentration of 100 μm 13 45 ppm which satisfies the drinking water acceptance criteria of 1 5 mg l 1 set by the world health organization the functional groups of the coffee composite filter were analyzed with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the surface of the filter membrane was analyzed using scanning electron microscope uv vis spectrophotometry confirmed the adsorption capacity and amount of cu ii adsorption of the filter or coffee grounds and langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and fritz schlunder isotherms were used to investigate the removal mechanism the kinetic studies were also performed to clearly demonstrate the adsorption process keywords coffee cu ii adsorption filter composite data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction recently there has been an increase in copper ion containing wastewater discharge from excavation operations or general industrial sites 1 in particular since copper exhibits excellent electrical properties as electrode materials for semiconductor devices an economic method to treat and recycle copper in wastewater is required copper is a well known highly toxic material that can cause hemolysis and cirrhosis while damaging renal tubules the brain and other organs 2 3 therefore the allowance standard for copper emission from wastewater treating plants in korea is regulated to under 3 mg l 1 4 the world health organization who has determined an acceptable limit for copper concentration in drinking water of 1 5 mg l 1 5 there are several methods to remove heavy metal contaminants from wastewater such as adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane microfiltration and ultrafiltration 6 8 among them as a method to remove copper from industrial wastewater the hydroxide precipitation method in which lime cao is used to precipitate cu oh 2 is primarily used 9 however this process is costly due to additional processing steps to remove residual sludge after adsorption 10 and the additional cost of large amounts of lime used to adsorb small amount of copper ions in the third step of the process 11 12 hence there is a clear need to replace lime so used coffee grounds a natural waste have been considered 13 15 as the international coffee market increases every year used coffee grounds are a problem in society 0 68 tons of coffee grounds are generated per 1 ton of coffee produced 16 and the coffee grounds generated in this way cannot be used as animal feed or fertilizers due to the caffeine so they are landfilled 17 however greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide generated by anaerobic decomposition in the landfill are the main culprits of environmental pollution therefore to reduce the amount of coffee grounds a method for recycling them as a heavy metal adsorbent has been proposed first the surface of coffee grounds has a porous structure and is composed of functional groups such as hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups exhibit negative charges 15 18 19 therefore it is possible to form an ionic bond with positive charged heavy metals in wastewater or physically adsorb to them by applying this principle many studies are being conducted to remove heavy metal ions in wastewater using coffee grounds in a study by nam et al coffee grounds were used as an adsorbent to remove arsenic as in wastewater according to the study the maximum adsorption capacity of 1 g of coffee grounds in 1 00 mm arsenic solution was 6 44 mg l 1 and the adsorption properties improved as the concentration of arsenic and amount of coffee grounds increased however since arsenic exists as an anion in wastewater it cannot interact with the coffee grounds due to the repulsive interactions therefore only physical adsorption was achieved by the porous surface of the coffee grounds 20 kyzas research aimed to remove copper and chromium ions from aqueous solutions using coffee grounds the maximum adsorption capacity of coffee grounds reached 70 mg g 1 for cu ii and 45 mg g 1 for cr vi and adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 120 min 21 in another study by oliveira et al cu ii cd ii and zn ii in aqueous solution were removed using untreated coffee grounds as an adsorbent in all three cases adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 72 h and the adsorption efficiency reached 89 98 in the equilibrium state of cu ii 65 85 in the case of cd ii and 48 79 in the case of zn ii 22 however when coffee grounds themselves are used as adsorbents there is a limitation in that the adsorbed coffee grounds must be filtered with a separate filter for this reason as an alternative a type of membrane applicable to the advanced oxidation process is attracting attention 23 the membrane has the dual functionality of adsorption and physical filtration and provides other advantages such as high removal efficiency low operating pressure high water flux and low footprint 24 since the membrane filter uses ion exchange to bind heavy metal ions it is characterized by its high affinity for ions and molecules 25 26 and the large surface area which is a characteristic of nanofibers has a significant effect on the adsorption and removal efficiency of contaminants in wastewater 27 in this study a nanofibrous membrane filter was prepared by electrospinning coffee grounds with polycaprolactone a biodegradable polymer for copper removal the functional groups of the membrane were analyzed through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the surface of the adsorption membrane was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy sem uv vis spectrophotometry was performed to confirm the adsorption capacity and amount of cu ii adsorption of the prepared filter and langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and fritz schlunder isotherms were used to explain the adsorption parameters the kinetic studies were also carried out to further reveal the adsorption process 2 experimental 2 1 materials starbucks discarded house blend coffee capsules were used for the coffee grounds in this experiment the coffee grounds were dried at 60 c for 24 h with no extra washing or grinding process polycaprolactone pcl mn 80 000 g mol was purchased from sigma aldrich formic acid 99 0 and ethanol 94 5 were purchased from samchun chemicals korea and acetic acid acetic acid 99 7 was purchased from sigma aldrich copper ii chloride cucl2 99 ammonium chloride 99 5 bis cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone bco 99 0 ammonium citrate tribasic triammonium citrate 97 ammonium hydroxide solution nh3 h2o and acetaldehyde 99 5 were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 manufacturing process the membrane filter for copper ion removal was prepared in two different ways i electrospinning coffee grounds by dissolving them with pcl blended sample type i and ii electrospraying coffee grounds with pcl electrospinning electrosprayed sample type ii as shown in fig 1a in the case of type i 15 wt pcl solution in acetic acid and 20 wt coffee grounds solution in formic acid were mixed at a 8 2 ratio and then electrospun for type ii 15 wt pcl solution prepared in a 3 1 acetic acid to formic acid ratio was electrospun and separately coffee grounds dispersed in ethanol 4 wt were electrosprayed fig 1b the ratio of acetic acid to formic acid for the best spinnability of pcl fibers was selected in accordance with previous studies in general formic acid is effective in dissolving high molecular weight polymers and is electrically conductive thus helping in nanofiber electrospinning the diameter of pcl fibers varies from 141 nm to 282 nm as formic acid content decreases from 50 to 0 respectively 28 30 in this study a mixture of 75 acetic acid and 25 formic acid was chosen to spin uniform bead free fibers moreover pcl is not included in the cu ii adsorption chemistry therefore the cu ii removal performance should not be significantly changed by the solvent conditions an 18g id 0 84 mm od 1 27 mm nozzle was used for electrospinning of the blended solution and spun at a flow rate of 0 3 ml h 1 for 2 h the distance between the drum collector and nozzle was fixed to 10 cm and the voltage was set to 15 5 kv the electrospinning environment was set at a room temperature of 25 c and a relative humidity of 40 50 for the electrosprayed sample in which electrospraying and electrospinning were performed simultaneously a 20g id 0 60 mm od 0 91 mm nozzle was used for the pcl solution and the solution was spun at a flow rate of 0 3 ml h 1 for 2 h similarly the distance from the drum collector to nozzle was fixed at 10 cm and the voltage was set to 15 5 kv a 14g id 1 6 mm od 2 1 mm nozzle was used to prevent clogging of the nozzle by coffee grounds during electrospraying in addition this solution was spun for 2 h at a flow rate of 0 3 ml h 1 to match the content of the coffee grounds as in the blended sample the distance between the drum collector and nozzle was fixed at 5 cm and electrospraying was performed at a voltage of 18 kv 2 3 characterization to evaluate the adsorption characteristics of copper ions by the prepared membranes cucl2 was dissolved in di water to model wastewater an isothermal adsorption experiment was conducted under equal weight conditions in which the amount of adsorbent was fixed and the concentration of cu ii was varied in the cu modeled wastewater prior to the experiment cu wastewater was prepared at concentrations of 50 100 150 250 500 and 1000 μm which are 3 18 6 35 9 53 15 9 31 8 and 63 5 ppm respectively the initial ph of the wastewater was 5 0 after that a nanofibrous membrane coffee content in the membrane 0 13 mg cm 2 was cut to 6 cm 3 2 cm dipped in a 5 ml cucl2 solution and stirred at 230 rpm at 35 c for 4 h to check maximum adsorption capacity in addition as a comparison group 2 5 mg of coffee grounds that is same mass of coffee contained in the electrospun or electrosprayed membrane were tested by same method to measure the amount of copper ions removed as a function of reaction time another nanofiber membrane with dimensions of 6 cm 3 2 cm coffee content 2 49 mg or 2 5 mg of coffee grounds was placed into 5 ml of a 100 μm solution and the adsorption capacity was measured at 35 c and 230 rpm for up to 6 h separately to quantify the quick copper ions absorption the filter membrane or 0 6 mg of coffee grounds were placed on a syringe filter tarsons india diameter 25 mm and 10 30 50 70 and 90 ml h 1 of cu wastewater were flowed the surface of the prepared fiber was analyzed under a voltage of 15 kv through an sem nova nanosem450 fei usa the diameter of the nanofiber was measured from at least 100 fibers the c1s peak spectrum was found using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer system thermo fisher scientific usa to determine the surface chemical composition of the prepared samples the specific surface area and pore volume of the sample were analyzed by multiport chemisorption physisorption micropore analyzer 3flex micromeritics usa uv vis spectrophotometric analysis was performed to measure the amount of copper ions remaining in the cucl2 solution to detect copper ions yang et al s 31 acetaldehyde bis cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone bco method was used 1 4 ml triammonium citrate 20 g triammonium citrate in 100 ml distilled water 1

the heavy metal removal efficiency re was obtained by eq 2 2 re c 0 c e c 0 100 3 results and discussions 3 1 morphological analysis as can be seen in fig 2b the coffee grounds before being spun looked uneven overall due to their smooth and angular surfaces the fiber diameter measured is 91 3 32 5 nm in a blended sample fig 2a left panel and 299 9 84 2 nm in an electrosprayed sample fig 2b left panel we presume that the fiber diameter differs with the spinning method because the spinning distance influences a lot in the case of electrically sprayed coffee grounds the nozzle is located about 5 cm away from the drum collector because coffee grounds with large particles have to be coated on the fiber for this reason it seems that ethanol was deposited on the fiber before it was sufficiently evaporated and thin fibers were not formed due to moisture fig 2b shows that small particles of coffee grounds are located between fibers the coffee grounds collected in the fiber serves to adsorb copper ions contained in the wastewater as shown by the microscopic images in the right panels of fig 2a and b after the adsorption test the overall structure remained intact no broken fibers were observed the diameters of the blended and electrosprayed fibers were 97 8 61 9 and 310 8 94 7 nm respectively the as spun fiber diameter before the test differed by merely 1 6 the tga results also confirmed that the pcl fibers and blended electrosprayed coffee materials were conserved after the adsorption test not shown here the rapid weight loss at 300 425 c was caused by the thermal decomposition of the pcl polymer chain 32 coffee releases volatile elements at 257 400 c 33 the tga curves of pcl and coffee materials had no significant changes during the adsorption test furthermore the coffee particles in the electrosprayed sample were preserved well thereafter we conducted xps analysis to understand the surface chemical composition of the prepared adsorption membranes curve fitting of the c1s spectrum was performed using the gaussian lorentzian peak shape after linear background correction the c 1s xps spectrum of pcl showed typical peaks of c c c h c o c and o c o bonds at 284 5 285 5 and 288 7 ev fig 3a the coffee grounds exhibited more diverse functional groups such as c c c h c o c c oh c o and o c oh at 284 5 285 5 287 2 and 289 1 ev respectively fig 3b as expected the electrosprayed sample presented overlapping signals of pcl and the coffee grounds because they were sequentially deposited by electrospinning and electrospray fig 3c the blended sample also presented overlapped signals but the signals of the functional groups of the coffee grounds were weaker than those of the electrosprayed sample fig 3d the relative weakness of the signals of the functional groups of the coffee grounds was reasonable as these functional groups were partially buried in pcl during the blending process 3 2 isothermal adsorption test in order to check the prepared adsorption membranes for the adsorption performance we put them in standard solutions having initial concentrations of 50 100 150 250 500 and 1000 mm and stirred respectively after stirring at 35 c at a speed of 230 rpm for 4 h we conducted uv vis spectrophotometry of the solutions with the adsorption membrane removed in order to analyze a trace of copper present in the solution with uv vis spectrophotometer chelation should be done by adding a polymer such as polyethylenimine pei 34 however there is an issue in that an extract such as caffeine is produced from the coffee added into the adsorption membrane resulting in peak interference making it impossible to analyze accurately the maximum peak of uv vis spectra of caffeine dissolved in water was observed at the 272 nm wavelength band 35 and the maximum peak of uv vis spectra of copper chelate made in reaction with pei was observed at the 275 nm wavelength band 34 therefore for the detection of copper we added a bco solution so that we could observe the maximum peak at the 545 nm wavelength band 31 the effect of ph conditions on the removal of cu ii ions was evaluated at ph 2 10 concentration 100 μm the removal rate was only 2 62 at ph 2 but dramatically increased to 99 1 at ph 5 from ph 6 to 10 the removal efficiency was higher than 91 9 but was mainly contributed by hydroxide precipitation under the alkaline condition it is well known process referred to ref 36 37 as the reaction follows cu2 aq 2naoh aq cu oh 2 s 2na aq therefore in this study all the cu ii removal test was carried out by fixing the ph to 5 to disregards the unexpected precipitation as shown in fig 4a in the case of coffee grounds copper ions in wastewater were completely removed when the initial concentration is 150 μm or less and the removal performance was 91 1 at a concentration of 250 μm also in the case of the electrosprayed sample most of the copper ions were removed at an initial concentration of 150 μm or less and the removal efficiency was 82 1 at a concentration of 250 μm or less this is because the particles of coffee grounds are located between nanofibers of pcl while maintaining large particle sizes and porous surfaces without being dissolved or affected in a solvent thereby having favorable conditions for adsorption the copper removal efficiencies of blended samples in standard solutions with initial concentrations of 50 and 100 μm were 97 0 and 96 9 respectively meaning most copper ions in the standard solution were removed however in a 250 μm solution it was 66 4 meaning the higher the concentration of the standard solution the lower the removal efficiency the graph comparing the amount of copper ions adsorbed per adsorbent mg g 1 shown in fig 4b we find that the three samples represented high copper removal efficiency in common at concentrations of 50 μm and 100 μm in particular at the concentration of 100 μm coffee grounds and electroprayed sample showed similar adsorption amounts and blended sample also showed adsorption amount of 12 3 mg g 1 however at the concentration of 150 μm at which the adsorption efficiency of the blended sample decreased a large difference in adsorption amount occurred from the other two samples at the concentration of 250 μm the adsorption efficiency in all samples decreased however the adsorption amount increased compared to that at the concentration of 150 μm respectively this was because the concentration of copper ions present in the standard solution is higher than the maximum possible adsorption amount of each adsorbent in addition in the case of 50 μm and 100 μm we interpret that the adsorption amount is smaller than 150 μm despite the highest removal efficiency because the concentration of copper ions contained in the standard solution is low when applying an adsorption membrane to actual sites it is important to completely remove a trace of copper so we set 100 μm the higher among the concentrations showing the maximum removal rate as the optimal initial concentration the specific surface areas of the composite materials were measured using bet the surface area of the blended sample was 5 9 m2 g whereas that of the electrosprayed sample was 3 7 m2 g therefore the smaller the fiber diameter the larger the surface area the blended fibers had larger surface areas than the electrosprayed fibers because the diameter of the former was three times smaller than that of the latter however this did not lead to a higher cu ii removal efficiency according to fig 4 hence removal efficiency was determined by not only the specific surface area but also the surface functional groups therefore the higher removal efficiency of the electrosprayed sample relative to the blended sample suggested that the molecular structure or chemistry of the original coffee grounds was conserved better during the electrospray process than in the blended solution thereafter the adsorption results were plotted to several isotherm models that contain two or more parameters to explain the adsorption mechanism at equilibrium the plotting of adsorption isotherms in linear regression is inappropriate for selecting best fitting models as it leads to unreliable conclusions 38 therefore nonlinear regression was used to estimate the parameters of the isotherms fig 5 three mathematical error functions were used to determine the suitability of each isotherm the coefficient of determination r2 sum of absolute error sae and chi square χ2 were calculated from the isotherms table 1 and fig 5 langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms are simple two parameter models to investigate the mechanism of adsorbent adsorbate interactions at equilibrium langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is based on a model that the bonding force of adsorption acts as the thickness of the monomolecular layer and no further adsorption occurs on the monomolecular layer thus langmuir adsorption is called monomolecular adsorption which was applied to the equation as follows eq 3 39 3 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e here kl is the langmuir constant related to the adsorption rate l mg 1 and qmax is the langmuir adsorption amount mg g 1 indicating the theoretical maximum monomolecular layer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent used in addition the freundlich adsorption isotherm equation is derived by introducing the fact that adsorption heat exponentially decreases with the degree of surface coverage in the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation this means that adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent where the energy distribution is not uniform and varies with the surface coverage rate the freundlich adsorption isotherm is applicable not only to the monomolecular layer adsorption but also to the polymolecular layer adsorption 40 taking logs on both sides of the relevant equation we can express non linear equation as follows eq 4 41 4 q e k f c e 1 n k f and n are freundlich constants k f is a measure of the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent l mg 1 and the larger it is the better the adsorption capacity is n represents the heterogeneity in the case of a fiber formed adsorption membrane the k f value was 13 23 for the blended sample and 19 72 for the electrosprayed sample which was lower than 25 52 for the result of coffee grounds this is consistent with the results of the previous adsorption experiments that show the copper removal efficiency of the nanofiber adsorption membrane is lower than that of the coffee grounds the langmuir equation enables us to determine the suitability of the adsorption process using the dimensionless separation coefficient r l 5 r l 1 1 k l c o when the dimensionless separation coefficient is in the range of 0 r l 1 the adsorption treatment is deemed to be suitable 42 as the dimensionless separation coefficient r l obtained through the experiment was 0 0066 for the blended sample 0 0030 for the coffee grounds and 0 0053 for the electroprayed sample the adsorption process of each sample can be presumed to be in the suitable range the maximum adsorption amount q max available from the y intercept of the langmuir adsorption isothermal graph was found to be 25 91 45 31 and 35 39 mg g 1 respectively in addition the adsorption process can be differentiated by the freundlich constant n n 1 means a chemical adsorption process and n 1 means a physical adsorption process 43 the n derived as a result of the experiment was found to be 4 6 or more in all samples indicating that the physical adsorption process was dominant overall in particular in the adsorption membrane samples it is presumed that physical adsorption of nanofibers was made in the form of a complicated mat rather than adsorption by ionic bonding in addition the values of the separation coefficient 1 n which is the reciprocal of n enter within the excellent adsorption operation range of 0 1 to 0 5 where adsorption can easily occur 44 the redlich peterson and fritz schlunder adsorption isotherms include three and four parameters respectively the equations of these multiparameter isotherm models were derived by the modification of the elements in the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the redlich peterson adsorption isotherm is an empirical model containing three parameters and it can be utilized for various adsorption equilibria covering a wide range of concentrations moreover it is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption systems owing to its versatility and we can express the isotherm equation as follows 45 6 q e k r c e 1 a r c e g where k r and a r are the redlich peterson isotherm constant l g 1 and l mg 1 respectively and the exponent g assumes a value between 1 and 0 this model can be reduced to a freundlich isotherm equation when the adsorbent concentration is high enough in the liquid phase the fritz schlunder isotherm involves four parameters and was derived by fritz and schlunder via an empirical extension of the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations 46 a wide range of experimental results can be interpreted with this model due to the various coefficients included in the isotherm equation and the mathematically modified form is as follows 7 q e a c e α 1 b c e β where a and b are the fritz schluder constant l g 1 and α and β are the fritz schlunder exponents when α β 1 the fritz schlunder model becomes a langmuir isotherm model but at high concentration it reduces into a freundlich isotherm model 47 among the four adsorption isotherm models the fritz schlunder model showed the best result in terms of error functions yielding the highest r2 values and the lowest sae and χ2 for all samples table 2 hence the fritz schlunder isotherm was suitable for the experimental data and the adsorption mechanism could not be solely explained by homogeneous monolayer adsorption since the fritz schlunder isotherm is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the adsorption processes of all three samples exhibited the characteristics of both monolayer and multilayer adsorption 48 isotherm studies suggested that the adsorption process of all samples was analogous it was well fitted with the langmuir absorption model at low concentrations of cu ii but it followed the freundlich adsorption model with increasing cu ii concentration 3 3 adsorption kinetics thereafter in order to see the copper removal efficiency differ with the adsorption time we conducted adsorption experiments with different times at a standard concentration of 100 μm we applied the adsorption time changing from the minimum of 1 min to the maximum of 360 min and the results are summarized in fig 6 in the case of coffee grounds and blended samples the removal rate was found to be 90 or higher when the adsorption time was 2 h or longer but in the case of electrosprayed samples the removal rate was seen to be below 80 for the electrosprayed sample there might be uneven spinning carried out due to the influence of the particle size of the bulk coffee grounds in the spinning process in addition as seen in the results up to the first 10 min of adsorption on fig 6b and unlike the adsorption results for 2 h the adsorption membranes prepared in electrospinning showed higher adsorption performance in a short time than coffee grounds the electrospun composite membranes exhibited better adsorption than the coffee grounds within the first 10 min because their specific surface area was larger than that of the coffee grounds hence the three dimensional structure of the electrospun membranes significantly affected their surface areas a large surface area can provide a large number of surface functional groups for the adsorption of copper ions thus there may have been more active functional groups exposed on the surfaces of the electrosprayed and blended samples than those on the coffee grounds in the first 10 min as the coffee grounds of the electrosprayed sample were evenly deposited on its surface through the electrospray process whereas those of the blended sample were homogeneously dispersed through blending and electrospinning by contrast the coffee grounds were in powdered form and it took time for their dispersion in the aqueous solutions of copper ions to fully harness their functional groups for copper ion adsorption therefore the removal rate of copper ions was higher with the electrospun membranes than with the coffee grounds within the first 10 min however the total number of available functional groups was larger on the coffee grounds than those on the electrosprayed and blended samples because some active functional groups were buried in the electrospun membranes therefore the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium was higher for the coffee grounds than the electrosprayed and blended samples from this result we presume that the adsorption membranes prepared are suitable for applications to heavy metal wastewater of low concentration only for a short period of time kinetic studies were conducted to investigate the rate determining step in the adsorption process of cu ii by the absorbents the adsorption data were fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model and the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model fig 7 the kinetic constants and error deviation data resulting from the fitting are shown in table 3 the linearized equations of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are expressed as eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e t where q t is the adsorption capacity at contact time t mg g 1 q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively and t min is the contact time the r2 values of the pseudo second order kinetic model were 0 999 for the coffee grounds and the blended sample and 0 996 for the electrosprayed sample these values were markedly higher than those obtained with the pseudo first order model in addition the sae and χ2 values were lower and the calculated q e was much closer to the experimental q e with the pseudo second order model than the pseudo first order model indicating that the pseudo second order model coincided more with our experimental adsorption process hence chemisorption was a rate determining step in cu ii adsorption on the coffee grounds blended sample and electrosprayed sample 49 for further kinetic study the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model was employed it can provide an interpretation of the adsorption rate which is controlled by the speed of adsorbate diffusion in adsorbents the equation of this model is as follows 50 10 q t k id t 1 2 c where k id is the constant of the intraparticle diffusion rate mg g 1 min1 2 c is a constant implying the thickness of boundary layer mg g 1 and q t is the adsorption capacity corresponding to the reaction contact time mg g 1 a straight weber morris curve means that intraparticle diffusion affects the adsorption rate if the curve passes through the origin of the graph then intraparticle diffusion is the only rate determining step 51 as shown in fig 7c the curves from the diffusion model were roughly divided into two straight lines with different slopes and indicated that intraparticle diffusion was not the only rate determining step neither line passes through the origin of the graph the two straight lines implied that the diffusion process for the coffee grounds electrosprayed sample and blended sample consisted of boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion the slope corresponding to boundary layer diffusion was larger than that corresponding to intraparticle diffusion thus the main rate determining step was intraparticle diffusion 3 4 adsorption performance according to flow rate when we apply the adsorption membrane to copper wastewater in the actual field it is necessary to compare the adsorption performance depending on the flow rate therefore after putting 5 ml of solution of standard concentration of 100 μm into a syringe we measured the copper removal efficiency of the adsorption membrane while varying the syringe pump flow rates to 10 30 50 70 and 90 ml h 1 with adsorption membranes applied to a syringe filter with a diameter of 25 mm the area is approximately 4 9 cm2 which is smaller than the area of the isothermal adsorption film for previously conducted experiment therefore we conducted the experiment by calculating the amount of coffee grounds contained in the area as 0 6 mg and the results were summarized as in fig 8 in the case of the electrosprayed sample 54 7 of copper ions were removed when 5 ml of artificial wastewater entirely passed the adsorption membrane at a flow rate of 10 ml h 1 on the other hand in the case of the blended sample 52 8 of copper ions were removed and the copper removal rate was lower than that of the electrosprayed sample at all flow rates in both samples the average removal rate tends to decrease as the flow rate increases because artificial wastewater contacts the nanofiber adsorption membrane resulting in reduced time for adsorption in addition its adsorption performance was degraded by 50 compared to the 4 h adsorption results shown in the previous experiment because the adsorption time was shorter than 4 h and the area in contact with wastewater was reduced which seemed to affect the performance of the adsorption membranes 4 conclusions we prepared the nanofiber adsorption membrane for copper ions removal by electrospinning using coffee grounds and pcls and in order to check the difference in performance between samples following the spinning method we prepared samples by electrospinning after blending coffee grounds and pcls and samples by electrospraying and electrospinning them in separate for comparing with additionally prepared adsorption membranes we put coffee grounds to test as a reference sample when we cut the prepared adsorption membrane to a size of 6 cm 3 2 cm coffee content 2 49 mg and introduced into artificial copper wastewater of 50 100 150 and 250 μm the removal efficiency for 50 μm and 100 μm after 4 h was over 96 9 and the removal efficiency of blended sample of 150 μm or higher was reduced to 77 3 applying the results of the experiment to langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and fritz schlunder adsorption isotherm equations to grasp the adsorption characteristics of each adsorbent as a result it was found that the adsorption process on the nanofiber membranes containing coffee grounds was best fitted with the fritz schlunder adsorption isotherm in addition the kinetic studies also revealed that the absorption process was governed by the pseudo second order kinetic model and the diffusion process was consisted of boundary and intra particle diffusions while the intra particle diffusion is a rate determining step in addition when we conducted adsorption in artificial wastewater of 100 μm for up to 6 h nanofiber adsorption membranes showed higher adsorption efficiency by up to 56 6 than coffee grounds in an environment of adsorption for 10 min finally when we inserted an adsorption membrane into a syringe filter of 25 mm diameter and conducted an adsorption experiment at a flow rate of 10 90 ml h 1 the electrosprayed sample showed copper ion removal efficiency up to 54 7 the copper adsorption membrane prepared in this study using coffee grounds makes sense in that it enables us to remove copper that causes environmental pollution by recycling coffee grounds which is a daily waste discarded in who s drinking water acceptance criteria the copper concentration is 1 5 mg l 1 and the blended sample prepared in this study showed removal efficiency of 90 or more upon adsorption for 4 h or more at a concentration of 100 μm 13 45 ppm to meet the criteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

12763,oxygen availability during different stages of biological nutrient removal bnr plays utmost critical role in all wastewater treatment techniques inadequate aeration control results in low treatment efficiencies and may lead to significantly higher costs hence a strategically designed aeration scheme is very crucial this study was carried out with the objective of maximising nitrogen and phosphorus removal from sewage by implementing an optimised aeration strategy to achieve this a 4 hour anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa cycle based on dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp values was strategically designed implemented and monitored in a 4 5 l laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr on an average feed waste consisted of 170 mg l of biological oxygen demand bod 228 mg l of chemical oxygen demand cod 64 mg l of total nitrogen tn and 33 mg l of ortho phosphate po4 3 the average bod cod tn and po4 3 loading rates of 0 510 0 684 0 192 and 0 099 kg m3 d respectively were applied to the reactor during the 90 day operation of the sbr it was observed that bod cod tn and po4 3 removal were achieved with 91 93 90 and 75 efficiencies with removal rates of 0 477 0 614 0 173 and 0 075 kg m3 d respectively also the cycle study revealed that p removal occurred during the aerobic phase while n removal occurred during the anoxic phase through denitrification a mass balance analysis for n also revealed that denitrification and microbial uptake accounted for 59 and 41 of nitrogen removal respectively study revealed that nutrient removal was achieved successfully while avoiding any unnecessary extended aeration costs such aeration strategy based on do and orp values could be deployed not only to optimise the aeration phase lengths but could also be used for dynamic process control to manage fluctuations in influent characteristics and system conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic aerobic anoxic cycle

introduction in developing nations sewage flow into freshwater systems is prevalent 1 according to central pollution control board cpcb india generates 72 368 mld of sewage however only 20 236 mld 28 is treated before disposal the remaining 52 132 mld is dumped untreated 2 to minimize health and environmental concerns these elements must be reduced to permissible levels to avoid eutrophication oxygen depletion and toxicity nutrients organic pollutants and pathogens must be removed from wastewater 3 4 the wastewater treatment protects surface waterways promoting sustainable development 5 6 traditional sewage treatment technologies are slowly becoming obsolete with time one of the newer techniques sequencing batch reactor sbr is better suited as automated control technology in the industry hence it is a research hotspot in sewage treatment 7 in india out of 1591 sewage treatment plants stps 490 stps having a total treatment capacity of 10 638 mld are sbr based 2 the sbr incorporates equalization biodegradation and sedimentation in one tank without return sludge 7 sbr is a readily attainable highly operational on timescale versatile technology for various contaminants 8 9 nitrogen n and phosphorus p cause eutrophication in water bodies so the removal of these nutrients is necessary in typical biological nutrient removal bnr systems nh4 is removed by aerobic nitrification followed by anoxic denitrification 10 12 p is removed biologically by enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr using the ability of phosphate accumulating organisms paos to take up p in excess of metabolic requirements and store it intracellularly as polyphosphate 13 14 this metabolic phenotype is promoted by a cycle of providing organic carbon predominantly as volatile fatty acids vfas to bacteria and then exposing them to anaerobic followed by aerobic environments paos store vfas as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha under anaerobic conditions by hydrolyzing polyphosphate and glycogen in the subsequent aerobic stage stored pha is metabolised to provide energy for growth and polyphosphate storage replenishment all bnr systems incorporate an anaerobic phase zone characterised by the absence of free oxygen and nitrate an anoxic phase zone containing nitrate but no free oxygen an aerobic zone phase containing ample free oxygen timely attainment and termination of these phases are crucial for the successful operation of any biological treatment system achieving nutrient removal from wastewater is a challenging task due to high levels of fluctuations in influent quality and lack of effective process control parameters inefficient operation of biological treatment systems may not only lead to poor effluent quality but also results in higher treatment costs due to suboptimal aeration control researchers have made several attempts to achieve desirable treatment efficiencies while minimising the aeration costs one approach towards reducing the treatment costs is to cultivate and use microbial consortium that enables more energy efficient conversion pathways such as nitritation denitritation n removal via nitrite pathway and anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation to nitrogen gas zekker et al 15 developed a novel technique to develop and sustain anammox activity for treating low temperature main stream sewage by switching it with more favourable side stream biogas plant effluent zekker et al 16 used nitritation anammox to successfully treat high c n ratio yeast factory wastewater with high do concentration zekker et al 17 studied the ameliorating effect of nitrate on nitrite inhibition during treatment of sewage via denitrifying phosphate removal dpr process which utilise nitrate instead of oxygen as electron acceptor hence reducing aeration costs another approach towards making the treatment process more economical is to optimise the aeration phase lengths simple time based process control may lead to under aeration or over aeration depending upon the variations in the strength of incoming wastewater in this regard dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp are two parameters that can reflect the state of the biological system while do represents the concentration of free oxygen available orp values represent the wastewater s potential to promote or limit certain biochemical redox reactions such as cbod carbonaceous bod degradation nitrification denitrification etc an oxidative solution positive orp is typically capable of absorbing an electron whereas a reductive solution negative orp is typically capable of donating an electron many studies have shown that do and orp could be used to monitor and control nutrient removal from wastewater 18 20 studies have also identified specific trends and critical points in do and orp profiles that are indicative of a certain stage of nutrient removal 21 22 in a recent study 24 aeration time was controlled by real time do and orp monitoring to successfully achieve nitritation denitrification in nitrogen rich wastewater in another study 25 aeration strategy based on orp was successfully developed to achieve nitritation anammox in a sbr treating high strength reject wastewater from biogas plant do and orp values are not only helpful for understanding the environment of the biological systems but are also convenient and affordable to monitor continuously this study focussed on designing and implementing an efficient aeration strategy to achieve biological nutrient removal the study was undertaken to achieve the following objectives i to design an aeration strategy based on do and orp values for anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa cycle sbr ii to implement the designed aeration strategy in sbr to achieve maximum n and p removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale sbr set up the sbr setup installed in the laboratory to carry out this study is depicted in fig 1 a column type reactor was fabricated from a clear transparent perspex pipe the reactor had a volume of 5 5 l with a length and inner diameter of 70 cm and 10 cm respectively the working volume of the reactor was kept at 4 5 l the feeding was done through a port provided near the bottom of the reactor the effluent port was provided in the middle of the working length to facilitate the exchange ratio of 50 another port was provided at 25 of the working length from the bottom for sludge wasting the feed tank was kept at a height such that the feeding occurred through gravity flow via a solenoid valve similarly decantation was also done with a solenoid valve connected to the effluent port for aeration an air pump sobo sb 348a with a capacity of 5 l min was used delivering the air through a fine bubble stone diffuser placed at the bottom of the reactor the air pump was fitted with a rotameter to control the aeration rate a mechanical mixer working at a constant speed of 120 rpm was also provided over the top of the reactor the solenoid valves mixer and air pump were all connected to the automatic timers to facilitate the cycle based automation of the sbr operation 2 2 analytical methods all the sampling protocols for

by microbial mass for metabolism 2 5 sbr start up and operation strategy the sbr was inoculated with flocculant sludge collected from the recycle line of the secondary clarifier of an operational stp based on activated sludge process after seeding the initial mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration in the reactor was 5796 mg l the flocculant sludge taken from the stp had been developed for a settling period of 90 min the initial operation strategy was designed to promote the retention of denser biomass flocs within the reactor while washing out of the flocs with poor density and settleability this was achieved by applying selection pressure by gradually shortening the settling time in the subsequent operational cycles the settling time was kept at 90 min for the first six cycles as shown in fig 2 when the settling time was reduced to 60 min the mlvss dropped from 5796 mg l to 5190 mg l while effluent volatile suspended solids evss hiked from 115 mg l to 1442 mg l in the 7th cycle though the mlvss and evss values altered significantly in the immediate cycle after the settling time was reduced these values stabilized over the next few cycles similar patterns were observed in the subsequent cycles till the settling time was finally reduced to 5 min in the 25th cycle in the subsequent five cycles the mlvss and evss stabilized with 4996 mg l and 125 mg l respectively after the 30th cycle this start up strategy of the sbr was carried out for 30 cycles over the span of 6 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 aeration strategy design after acclimatizing the sludge for 5 min settling time the next step was to design an effective aeration strategy for the sbr to achieve this a preliminary aoa cycle was implemented in the sbr the preliminary cycle comprised a 60 min of anaerobic phase including fill for first 10 min followed by extended durations of aeration and non aeration phases the mlvss concentration was maintained at close to 5000 mg l the do and orp levels within the sbr were continuously monitored for several cycles the do and orp profiles were used as indicators to determine duration of aerobic and anoxic phases required to treat the sewage feed effectively based on the do and orp profiles the aerobic and anoxic phase lengths were gradually condensed do orp and oxidized n nitrate n nitrite n profile of one such cycle is shown in fig 3 as aeration started after the 60th min do level showed a small rise till 70th min after that it remained almost constant till 160th min this constant do level during the aeration phase indicates high oxygen uptake rate by micro organisms for degradation of organic matter and nitrification the first critical point cp1 was observed at 160th min after which do rose abruptly due to a sudden decline in oxygen uptake rate marking the end of nitrification as can be confirmed from the n profile as aeration was stopped after the 210th minute do and orp level dropped steeply till 220th minute due to the drop in free oxygen level after that do level became almost constant while orp showed a sudden drop again after 240th minute cp2 indicating depletion of combined form of oxygen i e reduction of no3 and no2 to n2 gas this sudden drop in orp value indicated the end of denitrification accounting for the variations observed in the characteristics of the sewage several such runs of the preliminary cycle monitoring revealed that optimum durations required for aerobic and anoxic phases were 120 min and 40 min respectively after optimising the aerobic and anoxic phase lengths the steady operation of the sbr was carried out for the next 90 days depicted as day 1 to day 90 as per the findings of preliminary cycle analysis the operational cycle strategy opted for the steady operation of the reactor is shown in fig 4 the cycle duration was 4 h resulting in six cycles a day during this span of 90 days approximately 200 ml of mixed liquor was wasted every day to maintain a steady mlvss concentration of around 5000 mg l in the reactor the hydraulic retention time was 8 h and the average bod cod tn and po4 3 loading rates of 0 510 0 684 0 192 and 0 099 kg m3 d respectively were applied to the reactor a comparison between the physical characteristics of the initial seed sludge and the 60th day sludge is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the density and settleability of the sludge improved significantly over time 3 2 long term performance of the sbr the day wise performance of the sbr system for the 90 days is shown in figs 5a 5c as depicted in fig 5a from day 1 to day 17 the effluent cod values fluctuated between 70 mg l and 85 mg l accounting for an average removal efficiency of 63 the effluent cod value was reduced from 51 mg l to 38 mg l from day 20 to day 40 since day 41 effluent cod achieved a stable value of 25 mg l to 30 mg l providing an average removal efficiency of 89 and removal rate of 0 614 kg m3 d average effluent characteristics during the steady operation of the reactor are shown in table 3 the average effluent bod value of 14 5 mg l suggests that more than 91 bod removal was achieved fig 5b depicts the tn removal performance of the sbr during the 90 day duration tn values for effluent ranged from 16 mg l to 31 mg l for the first 41 days from day 44 the effluent tn concentration became steady in the range of 8 mg l to 12 mg l providing an average tn removal efficiency of 86 and removal rate of 0 173 kg m3 d as shown in table 3 the average effluent tkn concentration was 2 mg l indicating that most of the residual tn in the effluent was due to the presence of oxidized forms of nitrogen i e no3 and no2 ortho phosphate po4 3 removal performance of the reactor is shown in fig 5c for the first 32 days the average po4 3 concentration in the effluent was 14 mg l 18 mg l accounting for the removal efficiency of 58 only this po4 3 removal efficiency got improved from day 35 onwards from day 35 to day 90 average po4 3 concentration in the effluent was in the range of 8 4 mg l to 10 5 mg l resulting in average removal efficiency of over 73 and removal rate of 0 075 kg m3 d the overall long term performance of the sbr in terms of cod tn and po4 3 removal over the 90 day is depicted in fig 6 3 3 cycle performance of the sbr the cycle performance of the reactor during the fill and react phase was investigated for several cycles over the 90 day operation of the system average cycle performance of the sbr during 8 cycles analyzed between the day 40 and 90 is presented in figs 7a and 7b the operation cycle started with 10 min of mixed fill as new substrate was added in the reactor the cod and po4 3 gradually increased from an initial concentration of 24 mg l to 159 mg l and 10 mg l to 23 mg l respectively by the end of 10 min fig 7a in the next 50 min i e till 60th min anaerobic conditions prevailed in the reactor a gradual decline in cod was observed and was found to be 90 mg l at the end of the anaerobic phase this consumption of cod could be attributed to the ability of paos to uptake vfas during anaerobic conditions as this uptake occurs intracellularly stored poly phosphate gets hydrolyzed and ortho phosphate gets released in the liquid phase 27 28 this explains the observed increase in po4 3 concentration during the anaerobic phase after 60 min the aerobic phase started and continued for the next 120 min i e till the 180th min during this time the available cod got oxidized consistently by the end of the aerobic phase the cod concentration came down to 42 mg l studies have reported that aerobically paos oxidize stored pha and uptake p as poly phosphate thus reducing the p concentration in the liquid phase 28 29 the results were found to be consistent with these studies as the po4 3 concentration got reduced to 12 mg l by the end of the aerobic phase the residual concentration of po4 3 could be attributed to limited availability of vfas in the anaerobic phase presence of residual no3 and no2 from the previous cycle due to incomplete denitrification and presence of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos the presence of one or more of these conditions have been reported to hinder the ebpr process 13 29 30 fig 7b shows the n profile during the fill and react phase of the cycle during the fill phase tkn concentration in the reactor increased from 5 mg l to 37 mg l while the oxidized n concentration diluted from 8 mg l to 4 mg l it was so because the tn content of incoming feed waste comprised 98 tkn and 0 oxidized n the concentrations of tkn no3 and no2 remained almost constant throughout the rest of the anaerobic phase i e till 60th min of the cycle during 120 min of aerobic phase the nitrification process took place the tkn concentration was found to fall significantly in the first 60 min the cause of this n consumption has been reported to be the action of ammonia oxidising bacteria aobs that converts ammonia into nitrite which further gets oxidized to nitrate under the action of nitrite oxidising bacteria nobs 31 32 during nitrification as tkn gets consumed the concentration of oxidized n rises by the end of the aerobic phase tkn concentration fell from 37 mg l to 2 mg l whereas no3 concentration increased from 3 mg l to 25 mg l no2 concentration was found to be as 2 mg l as result of oxidation to no3 during 40 min of anoxic phase the oxidized n concentration declined over time this can be explained by the action of denitrifiers that reduce nitrate to nitrite and then to nitrogen gas using available organic matter in the absence of free oxygen 23 33 the concentration of oxidized n fell from 27 mg l to 11 mg l insufficient availability of readily degradable organic matter during the anoxic phase resulted in incomplete reduction of no3 and no2 many studies have shown that almost complete denitrification can be achieved by providing an external carbon source during the anoxic phase 34 37 a mass balance analysis for n was also performed for the cycle from eq 1 2 tn i 68 mg l 2 25 l 153 mg 3 tn e 14 mg l 2 25 l 31 5 mg 4 tn d 27 11 mg l 4 5 l 72 mg fig 7b substituting eqs 2 4 in eq 1 the value of tnu was found to be 49 5 mg this suggests that denitrification accounted for 59 of the total nitrogen removal while microbial uptake accounted for 41 also the tn content of the sludge was measured and found to be 268 mg g vss also the sludge wasting was being done at the rate of 200 ml day and mlvss value being maintained at 5000 mg l the amount of tn flushed out of the reactor each day came out to be 268 mg day equating to 44 7 mg cycle this experimental value was very close to the value obtained from the steady state mass balance analysis of the cycle 4 conclusion lab scale investigation was conducted to develop an optimum aeration strategy based on do and orp profiles of the sbr system treating sewage after acclimatizing the sludge for 30 cycles to attain a short settling time of 5 min a preliminary aoa cycle was implemented in the sbr with extended aerobic and anoxic phase durations the patterns and critical points of do and orp profiles of the preliminary cycle suggested that aerobic and anoxic phase durations of 120 min and 40 min respectively were adequate to treat the sewage this kind of aeration control strategy based on do and orp profiling would be particularly beneficial for automation of full scale plants that require dynamic process control rather than fixed phase durations due to influent characteristic variations and biological system conditions based on the findings of the preliminary cycle monitoring a 4 hour aoa cycle was designed and operated in sbr for 90 days to achieve n and p removal from sewage long term reactor operation with a 4 hour aoa cycle strategy proved effective in achieving bnr bod cod tn and po4 3 removal were achieved with 91 93 90 and 75 efficiencies respectively cycle analysis showed that p removal occurred during the anaerobic phase while n removal occurred during the anoxic phase it was also concluded that the limited availability of c during the anoxic phase resulted in incomplete dentification mass balance analysis for n suggested that denitrification accounted for 59 of the total nitrogen removal achieved while microbial uptake accounted for 41 of the removal declaration of competing interest the

12763,oxygen availability during different stages of biological nutrient removal bnr plays utmost critical role in all wastewater treatment techniques inadequate aeration control results in low treatment efficiencies and may lead to significantly higher costs hence a strategically designed aeration scheme is very crucial this study was carried out with the objective of maximising nitrogen and phosphorus removal from sewage by implementing an optimised aeration strategy to achieve this a 4 hour anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa cycle based on dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp values was strategically designed implemented and monitored in a 4 5 l laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr on an average feed waste consisted of 170 mg l of biological oxygen demand bod 228 mg l of chemical oxygen demand cod 64 mg l of total nitrogen tn and 33 mg l of ortho phosphate po4 3 the average bod cod tn and po4 3 loading rates of 0 510 0 684 0 192 and 0 099 kg m3 d respectively were applied to the reactor during the 90 day operation of the sbr it was observed that bod cod tn and po4 3 removal were achieved with 91 93 90 and 75 efficiencies with removal rates of 0 477 0 614 0 173 and 0 075 kg m3 d respectively also the cycle study revealed that p removal occurred during the aerobic phase while n removal occurred during the anoxic phase through denitrification a mass balance analysis for n also revealed that denitrification and microbial uptake accounted for 59 and 41 of nitrogen removal respectively study revealed that nutrient removal was achieved successfully while avoiding any unnecessary extended aeration costs such aeration strategy based on do and orp values could be deployed not only to optimise the aeration phase lengths but could also be used for dynamic process control to manage fluctuations in influent characteristics and system conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic aerobic anoxic cycle

introduction in developing nations sewage flow into freshwater systems is prevalent 1 according to central pollution control board cpcb india generates 72 368 mld of sewage however only 20 236 mld 28 is treated before disposal the remaining 52 132 mld is dumped untreated 2 to minimize health and environmental concerns these elements must be reduced to permissible levels to avoid eutrophication oxygen depletion and toxicity nutrients organic pollutants and pathogens must be removed from wastewater 3 4 the wastewater treatment protects surface waterways promoting sustainable development 5 6 traditional sewage treatment technologies are slowly becoming obsolete with time one of the newer techniques sequencing batch reactor sbr is better suited as automated control technology in the industry hence it is a research hotspot in sewage treatment 7 in india out of 1591 sewage treatment plants stps 490 stps having a total treatment capacity of 10 638 mld are sbr based 2 the sbr incorporates equalization biodegradation and sedimentation in one tank without return sludge 7 sbr is a readily attainable highly operational on timescale versatile technology for various contaminants 8 9 nitrogen n and phosphorus p cause eutrophication in water bodies so the removal of these nutrients is necessary in typical biological nutrient removal bnr systems nh4 is removed by aerobic nitrification followed by anoxic denitrification 10 12 p is removed biologically by enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr using the ability of phosphate accumulating organisms paos to take up p in excess of metabolic requirements and store it intracellularly as polyphosphate 13 14 this metabolic phenotype is promoted by a cycle of providing organic carbon predominantly as volatile fatty acids vfas to bacteria and then exposing them to anaerobic followed by aerobic environments paos store vfas as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha under anaerobic conditions by hydrolyzing polyphosphate and glycogen in the subsequent aerobic stage stored pha is metabolised to provide energy for growth and polyphosphate storage replenishment all bnr systems incorporate an anaerobic phase zone characterised by the absence of free oxygen and nitrate an anoxic phase zone containing nitrate but no free oxygen an aerobic zone phase containing ample free oxygen timely attainment and termination of these phases are crucial for the successful operation of any biological treatment system achieving nutrient removal from wastewater is a challenging task due to high levels of fluctuations in influent quality and lack of effective process control parameters inefficient operation of biological treatment systems may not only lead to poor effluent quality but also results in higher treatment costs due to suboptimal aeration control researchers have made several attempts to achieve desirable treatment efficiencies while minimising the aeration costs one approach towards reducing the treatment costs is to cultivate and use microbial consortium that enables more energy efficient conversion pathways such as nitritation denitritation n removal via nitrite pathway and anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation to nitrogen gas zekker et al 15 developed a novel technique to develop and sustain anammox activity for treating low temperature main stream sewage by switching it with more favourable side stream biogas plant effluent zekker et al 16 used nitritation anammox to successfully treat high c n ratio yeast factory wastewater with high do concentration zekker et al 17 studied the ameliorating effect of nitrate on nitrite inhibition during treatment of sewage via denitrifying phosphate removal dpr process which utilise nitrate instead of oxygen as electron acceptor hence reducing aeration costs another approach towards making the treatment process more economical is to optimise the aeration phase lengths simple time based process control may lead to under aeration or over aeration depending upon the variations in the strength of incoming wastewater in this regard dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp are two parameters that can reflect the state of the biological system while do represents the concentration of free oxygen available orp values represent the wastewater s potential to promote or limit certain biochemical redox reactions such as cbod carbonaceous bod degradation nitrification denitrification etc an oxidative solution positive orp is typically capable of absorbing an electron whereas a reductive solution negative orp is typically capable of donating an electron many studies have shown that do and orp could be used to monitor and control nutrient removal from wastewater 18 20 studies have also identified specific trends and critical points in do and orp profiles that are indicative of a certain stage of nutrient removal 21 22 in a recent study 24 aeration time was controlled by real time do and orp monitoring to successfully achieve nitritation denitrification in nitrogen rich wastewater in another study 25 aeration strategy based on orp was successfully developed to achieve nitritation anammox in a sbr treating high strength reject wastewater from biogas plant do and orp values are not only helpful for understanding the environment of the biological systems but are also convenient and affordable to monitor continuously this study focussed on designing and implementing an efficient aeration strategy to achieve biological nutrient removal the study was undertaken to achieve the following objectives i to design an aeration strategy based on do and orp values for anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa cycle sbr ii to implement the designed aeration strategy in sbr to achieve maximum n and p removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale sbr set up the sbr setup installed in the laboratory to carry out this study is depicted in fig 1 a column type reactor was fabricated from a clear transparent perspex pipe the reactor had a volume of 5 5 l with a length and inner diameter of 70 cm and 10 cm respectively the working volume of the reactor was kept at 4 5 l the feeding was done through a port provided near the bottom of the reactor the effluent port was provided in the middle of the working length to facilitate the exchange ratio of 50 another port was provided at 25 of the working length from the bottom for sludge wasting the feed tank was kept at a height such that the feeding occurred through gravity flow via a solenoid valve similarly decantation was also done with a solenoid valve connected to the effluent port for aeration an air pump sobo sb 348a with a capacity of 5 l min was used delivering the air through a fine bubble stone diffuser placed at the bottom of the reactor the air pump was fitted with a rotameter to control the aeration rate a mechanical mixer working at a constant speed of 120 rpm was also provided over the top of the reactor the solenoid valves mixer and air pump were all connected to the automatic timers to facilitate the cycle based automation of the sbr operation 2 2 analytical methods all the sampling protocols for collection handling and storage of the samples were followed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and waste water apha 2017 26 to ensure the accuracy of the results duplicate samples were taken for analysis chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and reactive phosphorus or ortho phosphate po4 3 concentrations were analyzed with the hach spectrophotometer dr 6000 using hach testing kits biological oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss volatile suspended solids vss sludge volume index svi and specific gravity sg were measured as per standard methods apha 2017 hach probe ph 201 was used to measure ph cod and bod were analyzed with unfiltered samples while n and p were analyzed with filtered samples all the sample filtering required for analysis was done with 0 45 micron whatman filter paper 2 3 feed wastewater the sewage was collected from a nearby pumping station the wastewater was collected in a 20 l container on a daily basis the feed of influent tank was prepared by filtering the collected wastewater through a 0 6 mm mesh screen to remove coarse solids the characteristics of the influent used in the study are shown in table 1 2 4 nitrogen mass balance analysis assuming ideal steady state condition of the reactor n mass balance can be represented as 1 tni tn e tn d tn u tn i total nitrogen present in the feed tn e total nitrogen present in the effluent tn d total nitrogen consumed within the reactor during denitrification tn u total nitrogen uptake by microbial mass for metabolism 2 5 sbr start up and operation strategy the sbr was inoculated with flocculant sludge collected from the recycle line of the secondary clarifier of an operational stp based on activated sludge process after seeding the initial mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration in the reactor was 5796 mg l the flocculant sludge taken from the stp had been developed for a settling period of 90 min the initial operation strategy was designed to promote the retention of denser biomass flocs within the reactor while washing out of the flocs with poor density and settleability this was achieved by applying selection pressure by gradually shortening the settling time in the subsequent operational cycles the settling time was kept at 90 min for the first six cycles as shown in fig 2 when the settling time was reduced to 60 min the mlvss dropped from 5796 mg l to 5190 mg l while effluent volatile suspended solids evss hiked from 115 mg l to 1442 mg l in the 7th cycle though the mlvss and evss values altered significantly in the immediate cycle after the settling time was reduced these values stabilized over the next few cycles similar patterns were observed in the subsequent cycles till the settling time was finally reduced to 5 min in the 25th cycle in the subsequent five cycles the mlvss and evss stabilized with 4996 mg l and 125 mg l respectively after the 30th cycle this start up strategy of the sbr was carried out for 30 cycles over the span of 6 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 aeration strategy design after acclimatizing the sludge for 5 min settling time the next step was to design an effective aeration strategy for the sbr to achieve this a preliminary aoa cycle was implemented in the sbr the preliminary cycle comprised a 60 min of anaerobic phase including fill for first 10 min followed by extended durations of aeration and non aeration phases the mlvss concentration was maintained at close to 5000 mg l the do and orp levels within the sbr were continuously monitored for several cycles the do and orp profiles were used as indicators to determine duration of aerobic and anoxic phases required to treat the sewage feed effectively based on the do and orp profiles the aerobic and anoxic phase lengths were gradually condensed do orp and oxidized n nitrate n nitrite n profile of one such cycle is shown in fig 3 as aeration started after the 60th min do level showed a small rise till 70th min after that it remained almost constant till 160th min this constant do level during the aeration phase indicates high oxygen uptake rate by micro organisms for degradation of organic matter and nitrification the first critical point cp1 was observed at 160th min after which do rose abruptly due to a sudden decline in oxygen uptake rate marking the end of nitrification as can be confirmed from the n profile as aeration was stopped after the 210th minute do and orp level dropped steeply till 220th minute due to the drop in free oxygen level after that do level became almost constant while orp showed a sudden drop again after 240th minute cp2 indicating depletion of combined form of oxygen i e reduction of no3 and no2 to n2 gas this sudden drop in orp value indicated the end of denitrification accounting for the variations observed in the characteristics of the sewage several such runs of the preliminary cycle monitoring revealed that optimum durations required for aerobic and anoxic phases were 120 min and 40 min respectively after optimising the aerobic and anoxic phase lengths the steady operation of the sbr was carried out for the next 90 days depicted as day 1 to day 90 as per the findings of preliminary cycle analysis the operational cycle strategy opted for the steady operation of the reactor is shown in fig 4 the cycle duration was 4 h resulting in six cycles a day during this span of 90 days approximately 200 ml of mixed liquor was wasted every day to maintain a steady mlvss concentration of around 5000 mg l in the reactor the hydraulic retention time was 8 h and the average bod cod tn and po4 3 loading rates of 0 510 0 684 0 192 and 0 099 kg m3 d respectively were applied to the reactor a comparison between the physical characteristics of the initial seed sludge and the 60th day sludge is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the density and settleability of the sludge improved significantly over time 3 2 long term performance of the sbr the day wise performance of the sbr system for the 90 days is shown in figs 5a 5c as depicted in fig 5a from day 1 to day 17 the effluent cod values fluctuated between 70 mg l and 85 mg l accounting for an average removal efficiency of 63 the effluent cod value was reduced from 51 mg l to 38 mg l from day 20 to day 40 since day 41 effluent cod achieved a stable value of 25 mg l to 30 mg l providing an average removal efficiency of 89 and removal rate of 0 614 kg m3 d average effluent characteristics during the steady operation of the reactor are shown in table 3 the average effluent bod value of 14 5 mg l suggests that more than 91 bod removal was achieved fig 5b depicts the tn removal performance of the sbr during the 90 day duration tn values for effluent ranged from 16 mg l to 31 mg l for the first 41 days from day 44 the effluent tn concentration became steady in the range of 8 mg l to 12 mg l providing an average tn removal efficiency of 86 and removal rate of 0 173 kg m3 d as shown in table 3 the average effluent tkn concentration was 2 mg l indicating that most of the residual tn in the effluent was due to the presence of oxidized forms of nitrogen i e no3 and no2 ortho phosphate po4 3 removal performance of the reactor is shown in fig 5c for the first 32 days the average po4 3 concentration in the effluent was 14 mg l 18 mg l accounting for the removal efficiency of 58 only this po4 3 removal efficiency got improved from day 35 onwards from day 35 to day 90 average po4 3 concentration in the effluent was in the range of 8 4 mg l to 10 5 mg l resulting in average removal efficiency of over 73 and removal rate of 0 075 kg m3 d the overall long term performance of the sbr in terms of cod tn and po4 3 removal over the 90 day is depicted in fig 6 3 3 cycle performance of the sbr the cycle performance of the reactor during the fill and react phase was investigated for several cycles over the 90 day operation of the system average cycle performance of the sbr during 8 cycles analyzed between the day 40 and 90 is presented in figs 7a and 7b the operation cycle started with 10 min of mixed fill as new substrate was added in the reactor the cod and po4 3 gradually increased from an initial concentration of 24 mg l to 159 mg l and 10 mg l to 23 mg l respectively by the end of 10 min fig 7a in the next 50 min i e till 60th min anaerobic conditions prevailed in the reactor a gradual decline in cod was observed and was found to be 90 mg l at the end of the anaerobic phase this consumption of cod could be attributed to the ability of paos to uptake vfas during anaerobic conditions as this uptake occurs intracellularly stored poly phosphate gets hydrolyzed and ortho phosphate gets released in the liquid phase 27 28 this explains the observed increase in po4 3 concentration during the anaerobic phase after 60 min the aerobic phase started and continued for the next 120 min i e till the 180th min during this time the available cod got oxidized consistently by the end of the aerobic phase the cod concentration came down to 42 mg l studies have reported that aerobically paos oxidize stored pha and uptake p as poly phosphate thus reducing the p concentration in the liquid phase 28 29 the results were found to be consistent with these studies as the po4 3 concentration got reduced to 12 mg l by the end of the aerobic phase the residual concentration of po4 3 could be attributed to limited availability of vfas in the anaerobic phase presence of residual no3 and no2 from the previous cycle due to incomplete denitrification and presence of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos the presence of one or more of these conditions have been reported to hinder the ebpr process 13 29 30 fig 7b shows the n profile during the fill and react phase of the cycle during the fill phase tkn concentration in the reactor increased from 5 mg l to 37 mg l while the oxidized n concentration diluted from 8 mg l to 4 mg l it was so because the tn content of incoming feed waste comprised 98 tkn and 0 oxidized n the concentrations of tkn no3 and no2 remained almost constant throughout the rest of the anaerobic phase i e till 60th min of the cycle during 120 min of aerobic phase the nitrification process took place the tkn concentration was found to fall significantly in the first 60 min the cause of this n consumption has been reported to be the action of ammonia oxidising bacteria aobs that converts ammonia into nitrite which further gets oxidized to nitrate under the action of nitrite oxidising bacteria nobs 31 32 during nitrification as tkn gets consumed the concentration of oxidized n rises by the end of the aerobic phase tkn concentration fell from 37 mg l to 2 mg l whereas no3 concentration increased from 3 mg l to 25 mg l no2 concentration was found to be as 2 mg l as result of oxidation to no3 during 40 min of anoxic phase the oxidized n concentration declined over time this can be explained by the action of denitrifiers that reduce nitrate to nitrite and then to nitrogen gas using available organic matter in the absence of free oxygen 23 33 the concentration of oxidized n fell from 27 mg l to 11 mg l insufficient availability of readily degradable organic matter during the anoxic phase resulted in incomplete reduction of no3 and no2 many studies have shown that almost complete denitrification can be achieved by providing an external carbon source during the anoxic phase 34 37 a mass balance analysis for n was also performed for the cycle from eq 1 2 tn i 68 mg l 2 25 l 153 mg 3 tn e 14 mg l 2 25 l 31 5 mg 4 tn d 27 11 mg l 4 5 l 72 mg fig 7b substituting eqs 2 4 in eq 1 the value of tnu

12764,with population surge and vigorous industrialization scarcity of freshwater is intensifying day by day reutilization of treated wastewater has been regarded as the most promising effort to counteract this global issue to meet the current need of sustainable development researchers are emphasizing on practicing the green technologies to purify wastewater in such regard vermifiltration vf being a natural and eco friendly technology can be a wise selection for treating the domestic sewage the present review includes a brief discussion on the performance of vf in remediating the domestic sewage in addition the life cycle assessment lca and life cycle impact assessment lcia of the vf technology have been explored and the results are compared with those of the conventional and non conventional wastewater remediation technologies it is found that vf is a standalone technology delivering enormous benefits including negotiation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions decentralized treatment facility energy efficiency value added byproduct generation contribution to circular bioeconomy and preservation of local aesthetics the main objective of this review work is to bring all the aspects related to vf of domestic sewage to the attention of the prolific researchers for establishing vf technology as a sustainable domestic sewage treatment alternative in near future satisfying the zero discharge concept graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords vermifilter lca circular bioeconomy sustainable development green technology data availability all data models and code generated or used during the study appear in the submitted article 1 introduction the unrestrained population growth urbanization and intense industrial activities have brought about the consumption of enormous quantity of freshwater and discharge of huge amount of wastewater containing hazardous contaminants such as organics nutrients pathogens etc 1 2 according to the un world water development report 2020 a six fold increase in the water utilization over the past century has been observed with an increasing rate of almost 1 per year 3 the presence of the abovementioned pollutants in the aquatic environment exhibits the concerns like eutrophication and depletion of dissolved oxygen do thereby making the environment adverse for the aquatic lives to thrive in extreme conditions the human beings may also get affected as we share the food chain with the fishes 2 4 the situation becomes even worse when the consumers are compelled to use the contaminated water or buy freshwater at high cost hence to overcome the scarcity of clean water the treatment and reuse of wastewater have become the compulsory choice for the competent authorities 2 5 it has been reported that the domestic wastewater coming from various towns and cities has been the biggest source of water pollution in india 6 generally 75 80 of the freshwater supplied to the communities becomes wastewater 7 as per the reports of the status of sewage treatment plants 2021 published by cpcb in india approximately 29 129 mld swage has been produced by all the class i cities and class ii towns together estimated as per the population in 2001 census which is expected to be 33 212 mld at present considering 30 growth in urban population per decade on the other hand the existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps facilitate the treatment capacity up to 7933 mld which is just 23 88 of the current domestic sewage generation meanwhile the actual capacity utilization factor of the existing sewage treatment plants stps is 0 722 practically only 13 5 of the generated domestic sewage avails the centralized treatment facility and the remaining gets directly discharged into the waterbodies deteriorating the water quality 8 moreover the domestic sewage is enriched with nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p hence in order to meet the stringent surface water discharge norms to satisfy the accrescent need for the clean water and from the perspective of nutrient recovery the treatment of domestic sewage is of utmost importance 6 9 the conventional wwtps employed to overcome the water crisis necessitate large material and energy input furthermore the greenhouse gas ghg emissions from the wwtps can potentially damage the environment 10 in addition as a byproduct of wastewater treatment enormous quantity of sludge is produced in wwtps imposing additional monetary requirements which in turn makes the wwtps unsustainable 11 the physical and chemical wastewater treatment methods are found to be costly as well as incompetent in removing the targeted pollutants from the wastewater cutting down their acceptability as the sustainable wastewater remediation methods 12 13 as a solution to the aforesaid problems the biological wastewater treatment methods have gained the major attention of the researchers because of having several advantages over the aforementioned methods 14 the anaerobic methods are energy efficient and produce less sludge however it is a sluggish process and becomes unstable due to the slight deviation in the operating conditions in addition the anaerobic methods are not suitable for the low strength wastewater such as domestic sewage the anaerobically treated effluent is devoid of do restricting its disposal to the surface water in addition the gaseous emissions such as methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 and the pungent smell produced during the anaerobic process hinder its environmental as well as social acceptability 1 7 on the other hand the aerobic methods being more robust than the former can be effectively implemented to overcome the concerns related to the anaerobic methods however high energy input and huge sludge production have been the perennial constraints for the commercialization of the aerobic wastewater treatment methods especially in the underdeveloped and developing countries where the capital investment and skilled manpower are not available in abundance 2 5 in the context of the developing and underdeveloped countries the implementation of the sustainable wastewater treatment technology is of paramount importance according to bradley et al 15 in order to achieve the sustainability the technology has to be environmentally benign economically feasible and socially acceptable fig 1 according to the american society of civil engineers asce the sustainable water resource systems are designed and maintained to fulfill the objectives of the society without compromising the ecological hydrological and environmental integrity 15 in short sustainable development promotes the preservation of the social economic and environmental vitalities while satisfying the current needs the conventional wwtps are reported to emit 3 of the global ghg emissions 16 17 daelman et al 18 investigated that 1 of the chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent has been converted to methane ch4 in the wwtps whereas kampschreur et al 19 have inspected that up to 14 6 of the total nitrogen load of the influent has been released as nitrous oxide n2o in the wwtps such emissions become even intense when the activate sludge process asp is used as the secondary treatment step in the wwtps 20 moreover the centralized treatment system necessitates the transportation of the wastewater and the produced sludge from the source of wastewater to the treatment site and from the wastewater treatment site to the sludge handling site respectively 21 in addition to the potential ghg emissions huge monetary requirement for high energy consumption and sludge handling make the centralized wastewater treatment systems unsustainable especially for the small communities in rural areas implementation of decentralized onsite sanitation systems can be a potential solution for the above problem 22 in fact it is an automatic choice especially where the central sanitation system has not reached in addition being easy to construct and operate the decentralized systems have become more sustainable than the centralized systems and are expected to serve up to 500 million population by the year 2030 23 in this regard the vermifiltration vf technology being a natural environmentally benevolent cost effective and decentralized system has gained the attention of the researchers especially for remediating the domestic sewage 1 5 11 the vermifilters are earthworm based biofilters facilitating the degradation of organics and eradication of nutrients through the combined action of the earthworms and microbes 5 11 fig 2 mostly the vf technology has gained the popularity as the primary or secondary treatment alternative for treating the domestic sewage fig 3 if the nutrient recovery from the domestic wastewater is intended the vermifilters can also be potentially employed as the tertiary treatment step 3 in order to evaluate the sustainability of vf technology for treating the domestic sewage the life cycle assessment lca of vf technology has been explored from the available data on the lca studies on the vf technology treating domestic sewage a comprehensive review on the inflow raw materials and energy and outflow treated effluent solid residue and ghg emissions of various forms of materials throughout all the stages of its lifecycle i e construction operation and dismantling has been portrayed in this review work this not only helped to understand the environmental sustainability of the vf technology in terms of ghg emissions and sludge production but also helped to understand the economic feasibility of the same in terms of materials and energy consumption and value added byproduct formation to have an in depth understanding of the actual environmental impacts caused by the vf technology while treating the domestic sewage the concept of the life cycle impact assessment lcia has also been reconnoitered 24 25 as already mentioned since the vf technology has been mostly employed as the secondary treatment step the results obtained from the lca and lcia studies on vf technology are compared with those of the asp the most frequently employed conventional secondary treatment step in the wwtps for assessing the sustainability of the vf technology apart from this the vf technology has also been compared with the other non conventional technologies such as constructed wetlands cws aerated lagoons als and waste stabilization ponds wsps regarding the materials and energy input and ghg emissions across all the stages of their life cycle to reinforce the acceptability of the vf technology as the sustainable domestic wastewater treatment alternative till date many review works on evaluating the potential of the vf technology as an alternative of the conventional wastewater treatment technologies have been published by the various prolific researchers across the globe 2 5 11 26 27 singh et al 5 have focused on the pollutant removal mechanisms factors affecting the treatment performance and the application of the vf technology in removing the key pollutants i e organics nutrients and solids from the wastewaters samal et al 11 have emphasized on the potential of the macrophyte assisted vermifilters in remediating the domestic as well as industrial wastewaters singh et al 2 have highlighted the reusability of the treated effluent from the vf of the wastewaters coming from both the domestic and industrial premises samal et al 26 have enlighten the types and characteristics of the earthworms their casting habits and ghg emissions during the vf process while briefing about the pollutant removal mechanisms and the application of the vf technology for treating various wastewaters singh et al 27 have particularly explored the nitrogen removal dynamics in the vermifilters while treating the domestic as well as the industrial wastewaters also from the available literature it has been observed that very few researchers have published their review works on the sustainability particularly on the environmental sustainability of vf technology for treating the wastewater 2 3 28 29 lourenco and nunes 29 have evaluated the sustainability of the vf technology in terms of material and energy input and ghg emissions throughout all the stages of its life cycle while treating the domestic sewage and compared the results with those of the cws small rate infiltration sri and asp on the other hand abello passteni 28 has focused on the lcia of the vf technology als and asp while treating the raw domestic sewage from the small communities in chile however to the best of our knowledge no one has ever made an approach to assess the economic sustainability of the vf technology by performing the cost analysis and focusing on its linkage to the circular bioeconomy during the treatment of domestic sewage moreover the assessment of the social acceptability of the vf technology during the course of treating the domestic sewage has also been overlooked by the researchers hence in this review work a genuine effort has been made to investigate the sustainability of the vf technology with respect to the three major bottom lines of the sustainability i e environmental sustainability economic affordability and social acceptability during the course of treating the domestic sewage 2 types operation and sustainability of vermifilters predominantly vermifilters are of three types vertical subsurface flow vermifilters vssf vfs horizontal subsurface flow vermifilters hssf vfs and hybrid vermifilters h vfs the design operation and sustainability of each of the aforementioned vermifilters are briefly discussed below 2 1 vssf vfs in vssf vf the bed materials are stacked in layers vertically and the gravel is provided at the bottommost layer as a supporting media the wastewater is allowed to flow vertically through the bed material from the top of the vermibed and treated effluent is collected at the bottom fig 4a the vssf vfs exhibits higher oxygenation capacity attributing to the better distribution of wastewater 30 which promotes enhanced biodegradation of the organics and nitrification process hence in addition to the burrowing activities of the earthworms the configuration of the vssf vfs intensifies the natural aeration inside the system which further cuts down the external energy requirement for mechanical aeration thereby making the process cost effective 5 since the wastewater flows vertically through the system the vermibed materials get effectively utilized in the vssf vfs 1 moreover the intensified aeration further aggravates the activity of the earthworms inside the vssf vfs as a result more casting is produced which can be sold as organic fertilizer cutting down the cost of the process 31 on the other hand the higher do level inside the system ensures the complete degradation of the organics present in the wastewater releasing carbon dioxide co2 as the only gaseous emission especially while treating the domestic wastewater with lower organic strength which in turn promotes the environmental sustainability through negotiating the greenhouse gas ghg such as methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions 2 26 lastly being a complete aerobic system vssf vf does not produce any pungent smell during the treatment of wastewater reinforcing the social acceptability 5 2 2 hssf vfs unlike the vssf vfs the bed materials are stacked in layers in horizontal direction and the gravel layer is provided just before the outlet in hssf vfs the wastewater is allowed to flow through the vermibed media horizontally and the treated effluent is collected at the outlet end placed opposite to the inlet zone fig 4b according to the reports the coexistence of the aerobic and anoxic anaerobic conditions has been observed inside the hssf vfs which allows higher denitrification along with the biodegradation of the organics and nitrification 30 unlike the conventional nitrification and denitrification system in hssf vfs the nitrification and denitrification take place simultaneously within a single unit lessening the footprint requirement moreover no external chemical such as methanol is required to be added as the external carbon source to trigger the growth of the denitrifiers in the hssf vfs reducing the cost of the process 1 32 similar to the vssf vfs the produced casting in the hssf vfs can be traded as the organic fertilizer moreover the hssf vfs negotiate the emission of the potential ghgs and the generation of the pungent odor thereby assuring the environmental sustainability and social acceptability respectively 5 26 2 3 h vfs h vf allows two stage filtration of the wastewater generally a h vf consists of a vssf vf followed by a hssf vf first the wastewater flows vertically through the vssf vf and the effluent coming out from the bottom of the vssf vf serves as the influent for the hssf vf which flows horizontally through the hssf vf and finally the effluent is collected on the other side of the hssf vf fig 4c as already discussed in vssf vfs the aerobic condition prevails whereas in hssf vfs the anaerobic condition becomes predominant 30 since the wastewater has to travel through both the reactors it experiences all the redox conditions during its passage through the h vfs 33 basically the h vfs impart all the advantages associated with the vssf vfs and hssf vfs moreover due to the improved redox conditions the h vfs ensure better removal of the organics and nutrients from the wastewater also the effective length of travel of the wastewater gets increased in the h vfs leading to the enhanced interaction time between the wastewater earthworms bed materials and microbes which in turn aggravates the treatment efficacy of the vf technology through satisfying the criteria for the environmental and economic sustainability 1 3 pollutant removal mechanisms in vf technology vf technology can substantially remove the organics solids both the suspended and dissolved solids nutrients mainly n and p and pathogens from the domestic wastewater the governing pollutant removal mechanisms in the vermifilter have been discussed in brief in the following subsections 3 1 organic and solid removal mechanism in vf the symbiotic action of the microbes and the earthworms captivates the purification of wastewater the earthworms incorporated into the vermibed not only breakdown the pollutants present in the wastewater but also devour the soil particles of the vermibed 1 31 34 apart from the earthworms and microbes a large portion of pollutants has been removed by the vermibed media through adsorption and screening or trapping 2 35 generally the vermibed consists of both the organic and inorganic materials the organic materials such as vermicompost serve as the food to the earthworms and microbes and thereby helping the earthworms to grow and reproduce which in turn improves the performance of the vermifilter 5 11 on the other hand the inorganic packing materials such as sand improve the hydraulic conductivity of the media facilitating efficient wastewater treatment through the achievement of desired hydraulic retention time hrt 36 during vf the vermibed acts as the sorption medium or support matrix enhancing the removal of nutrients in the vermifilter 37 39 the earthworms through their burrowing activities combination of ingestion grinding digestion and excretion convert the larger soil particles of the vermibed into finer fractions increasing the specific surface area of the vermibed media thereby escalating the sorption capacity of the support matrix in addition the earthworm s burrowing action also helps in improving the porosity of the vermibed media generally the coarse pollutants such as suspended organics and suspended solids present in the influent get trapped on the pores of the bed media followed by their subsequent devouring by the earthworms and eventually get released as the vermicasting with enlarged specific surface area this vermicasting gets mixed with the bed materials and improves the sorption potential of the mixture 2 35 unlike the suspended pollutants the dissolved pollutants in the influent percolate through the screening layer thereafter a fraction of the dissolved pollutants gets absorbed by the suitable layer of the vermibed media and the remaining fraction gets degraded by the combined action of the earthworms and microbes 5 fig 5 as already mentioned the earthworms perform a series of beneficial activities such as ingestion of larger particles grinding of ingested particles in the gizzard digestion of grinded particles in presence of gut microbes and finally excretion as vermicasting enriched in microbes and nutrients 1 generally the earthworms devour the large size particles into finer particles favoring the microbial degradation of the pollutants 5 moreover owing to the tunneling activity of the earthworms natural aeration gets intensified within the system triggering aerobic microbial degradation of the organics 40 41 the introduction of earthworms promotes the growth of diversified microbial communities improving organic oxidation potential of the vermifilter 42 the earthworms release a slimy liquid also known as mucus containing various enzymes and microbes which in turn facilitates the mineralization of the contaminants 43 mucus is also enriched in gluco proteins amino acids and glucosidic and proteic molecules thereby upholding the optimum carbon to nitrogen c n ratio for the microbial degradation 44 45 in addition the earthworms also possess ph neutralization potential by secreting calcium from their crop thereby enhancing the bioavailability of the organics and solids for further degradation 46 3 2 nutrient removal mechanism the domestic wastewater mainly contains ammonium n nh4 n and organic n apart from n domestic sewage also embraces significant amount of p the n removal pathways in the vermifilter is very intricate including ammonification or mineralization of the organic n nitrification and denitrification or adsorption by the bed materials or microbial assimilation 1 fig 6 the organic n present in the domestic wastewater or released from the tissues of the dead earthworms has been utilized by the heterotrophs such as bacillus proteus pseudomonas streptomyces etc for their growth and reproduction and subsequently the inorganic form of n i e nh4 n gets released into the vermifilter 37 38 basically the organics present in the domestic wastewater and the bed material and the nitrogenous substances excreted by the earthworms help in maintaining the adequate c n ratio inside the vermibed facilitating the growth of heterotrophs 47 the nh4 n present in the domestic wastewater or produced due to the ammonification of organic n can be removed in two ways in the vermifilter nitrification by the autotrophs and adsorption by the bed materials 35 in vermifilter the burrowing activity of the earthworms intensifies the air circulation inside the vermibed which in turn helps in nitrification of nh4 n nitrification is an aerobic process and is carried out by the autotrophs which grow when the availability of the organic carbon is less inside the vermifilter 1 generally the nitrification takes place within the top few centimeters of the vermibed since nh4 n carries positive surface charge and the bed materials are mostly negatively charged nh4 n gets adsorbed by the bed materials through electrostatic interactions fig 6 48 49 on the other hand since both the no3 n and bed materials are negatively charged the removal of no3 n through adsorption is trivial the hydrophobic interaction between the vermibed media and no3 n governs the little adsorption of no3 n onto the vermibed media 49 meanwhile if macrophytes are present in the system the no3 n will be up taken as nutrient by the macrophytes the most important n removal pathway in the vermifilter is denitrification 1 denitrification of the nitrified byproducts is carried out by the heterotrophs which become prevalent in the vermifilter when the organic carbon source is available in abundance inside the system 35 during denitrification the nitrified byproducts mostly nitrate n no3 n get directly converted into n2 gas by the heterotrophs and subsequently the produced n2 gas gets released to the atmosphere it has been reported that the anoxic anaerobic condition triggers the denitrification process 30 thus the denitrification mostly occurs at the bottom layers of the vermibed the earthworm excluded zone if sufficient organic carbon source is available for the growth of the heterotrophs 5 moreover the mucus released by the earthworms embraces various gut microbes and enzymes facilitating nitrification and denitrification processes 11 the removal of p in the vermifilter is governed by the adsorption process 5 fig 6 the enzyme assisted microbial mechanism of the vermifilter does not facilitate the removal of p thus the p removal potential of the vermifilters depends upon the adsorption capacity of the bedding material and the wastewater distribution time 50 apart from adsorption a fraction of p also gets removed through the fixation of p as the phosphate po4 3 of different metallic cations 51 however attributing to the burrowing activities of the earthworms the microbial and enzymatic activities inside the vermifilter get amplified which in turn facilitate the mineralization of the bound form of p as a result the effluent total p tp concentration often gets escalated than its influent concentration 52 3 3 pathogen removal mechanism apart from the organics nutrients and solids the vermifilters also have the potential to eliminate pathogens especially from the domestic sewage 53 basically the coelomic fluid also known as mucus secreted from the earthworm s body portrays antibacterial properties and slays the unfamiliar microbes present in the domestic wastewater mucus only supports the survival of the gut microbes it gets mixed with the bacterial cell and ceases their movement owing to its stickiness property 2 fig 7 it further leads to the killing of the pathogens owing to the scarcity of food in their vicinity nevertheless the earthworms also devour the pathogens and subsequently the pathogens get destroyed in the earthworm s gut 40 41 4 application and performance of vf technology for treating domestic sewage from the extensive literature it has been observed that the vf technology has become one of the major alternatives of the conventional wastewater treatment methods for eradicating organics nutrients solids and pathogens from the domestic wastewater 1 3 5 45 54 a comprehensive overview on the performance of the vf technology in remediating the domestic sewage is portrayed in table 1 4 1 organic removal the vermifilters are reported to exhibit higher removal of organics than that of the geofilters 2 31 the provision of sufficient hrt and optimum earthworm density further improves the performance of the vermifilter 74 the earthworm species also plays a pivotal role in the performance of the vermifilters for instance kumar et al 61 reported that vf ensured 71 89 and 88 33 removals of cod and biological oxygen demand bod5 respectively from the real domestic sewage using riverbed material and vermicompost as the vermibed material in presence of eisenia fetida earthworm species whereas the presence of eudrilus eugeniae yielded only up to 54 22 and 70 removals of cod and bod5 respectively under the same operating conditions indicating the superiority of eisenia fetida over eudrilus eugeniae even though both eisenia fetida and eudrilus eugeniae belong to the epigeic species the former earthworms have been reported to withstand the adverse operating conditions to the maximum extent they can even operate under the water logged condition compared to eudrilus eugeniae eisenia fetida gets acclimatized very quickly to the surroundings moreover these earthworms are the voracious eaters of the organics and produce huge quantity of vermicasting which in turn enhances the organic removal efficiency of the vf process 5 26 on the other hand under the same operating conditions kumar et al 60 obtained the cod and bod5 removals up to 87 89 and 96 respectively during the treatment of synthetic domestic sewage employing eisenia fetida earthworm species table 1 the difference in the organic removal in presence of the same earthworm species and similar conditions could be due to the higher complexity of the real domestic sewage as compared to the synthetic domestic sewage 11 as discussed before the synergistic action between the earthworms and microbes governs the higher removal of organics in the vermifilter the earthworms devour the coarse organics into finer particles thereby enhancing their bioavailability for the microbial degradation 5 the burrowing activity of earthworms helps in keeping the system aerobic triggering the growth of favorable microbes 75 the mucus also accommodates digestive enzymes captivating the degradation of the organics 76 xing et al 69 observed that the vermifilters treating the real domestic sewage in presence of eisenia fetida resulted in 81 86 abatement of cod whereas the removal of bod5 was up to 91 98 it signifies the higher inclination of the earthworms towards the biodegradable organics compared to the nonbiodegradable organics 53 similar observations were also postulated by arora et al 53 and sinha et al 31 the vf technology has also been employed to remediate the human feces table 1 furlong et al 72 reported that the application of the vf technology to remediate human feces ensured substantial cod removal up to 88 90 indicating high concentration of the biodegradable organic matters in human feces it can also be observed from table 1 that almost all the studies have been conducted employing eisenia fetida and eudrilus eugeniae earthworms both of them are epigeic earthworms generally for vf process the epigeic earthworms are employed by the researchers because of their ability of rapid acclimatization with the surroundings higher reproducibility early attainment of the matured phase withstanding the fluctuations in the operating condition to a great extent and displaying endurance and resistance to handling moreover due to the decompacting nature of the epigeic earthworms the bioavailability of the nutrients in the produced vermicasting gets increased for plant uptake 26 the other two types of earthworms i e endogenic and anecic are not as advantageous as epigeic earthworms thus the epigeic earthworms are mostly preferred by the researchers among all the epigeic earthworms eisenia fetida can operate under the water logged condition and can handle the fluctuations to the highest extent that is why eisenia fetida earthworms become popular among the researchers however in one study by sinha et al 31 perionyx excavatus earthworms were used while treating raw municipal sewage table 1 which also come under epigeic earthworms 4 2 nutrient removal nitrogen n is the most common nutrient present in the domestic wastewater predominantly n is available in the form of ammonium n nh4 n and organic n in domestic sewage 1 2 in vermifilters the removal of n from the domestic wastewater is attributed to a series of mechanisms such as mineralization or ammonification of organic n nitrification and denitrification or adsorption by the bed materials or microbial assimilation 1 2 5 35 nitrification carried out by the autotrophs is a very slow process because the autotrophs are slow growers 1 5 the nitrification of nh4 n is an aerobic process thus the burrowing activity of the earthworms has a positive impact on the nitrification potential of the vermifilter fig 6 to ensure substantial nitrification inside the vermifilter requisite hrt and do have to be maintained inside the vermibed this indicates that the nitrification mostly takes place within the top few centimeters of the vermibed 11 at greater bed depth with the reduction in do availability anoxic condition prevails promoting higher denitrification if sufficient organic carbon source is available 45 77 in addition the mucus secreted by the earthworms contains various enzymes and microbes assisting the mineralization of the organic n which in turn enhances its bioavailability 44 furthermore the vermicasting rich in microbes also facilitates the nitrification of nh4 n when the domestic sewage comes in contact with the vermicasting 53 apart from the microbes and earthworms the bed materials by acting as an adsorption media also helps in removing the nutrients from the domestic wastewater generally the vermibed materials having negative surface charge exhibit the better adsorption potential for the positive charged nh4 n as compared to the negatively charged no3 n 78 dey chowdhury and bhunia 1 have investigated the potential of a macrophyte assisted vermifilter mavf to eradicate n from real domestic sewage employing canna indica macrophytes they reported that the hlr had a negative impact on the nitrification of nh4 n with 74 4 and 98 2 conversion of nh4 n at hlrs 7 and 3 m3 m2 d respectively it signifies that at low hlr the domestic sewage got sufficient interaction time with the microbes bed materials and earthworms triggering the nitrification of nh4 n they also found that the removal of the total n tn was the maximum 87 when sufficient organic carbon was available justifying denitrification as the principal n removal pathway in the vermifilter similar trend of the n transformation dynamics in the vermifilters was also reported by xing et al 66 in addition liu et al 64 and li et al 71 have also reported high nitrification potential of the vf technology table 1 it is clearly evident from the data amalgamated in table 1 that many researchers have obtained higher effluent no3 n concentration than its influent concentration during the course of vf of domestic sewage 60 61 as mentioned before the nitrification of nh4 n requires high hrt thus after nitrification the wastewater might not get the sufficient time for denitrification as a consequence the no3 n concentration was increased in the effluent 1 35 the mucus secreted by the earthworms is also rich in organic nitrogenous compounds enhancing the concentration of the organic n in the domestic sewage which initially got nitrified followed by the denitrification of the nitrified compounds 5 35 thus during vf of domestic sewage due to the insufficiency of interaction time the produced no3 n might not get denitrified thereby accumulating in the effluent apart from n phosphorus p is another nutrient causing concerns for the competent authority generally the removal of total p tp is mainly governed by adsorption a physical process 51 p predominantly gets adsorbed by the bed materials wang et al 67 have reported up to 80 3 82 3 removal of tp using the mixture of padding soil and rice straw volumetric ratio 4 4 as vermibed material table 1 few researchers have found that the effluent tp concentration was higher than its influent concentration 60 61 the activities of the earthworms have been found to liberate p from its bound form pilling up the tp concentration in the effluent 79 4 3 solid removal the solids present in the domestic wastewater can be predominantly classified into two types total suspended solids tsss and total dissolved solids tdss 7 as depicted in fig 5 the large tsss present in the domestic sewage get trapped onto the pores of the bed media and devoured by the earthworms into finer particles with enhanced specific surface area which in turn facilitates the adsorption of solids onto the bed materials 80 on the other hand the tdss get bypassed through the screening layer and subsequently absorbed by the suitable layer of the bed materials 2 in addition the biodegradable fraction of both the tsss adsorbed onto the pores of the bed materials and tdss get putrefied by the combined action of the earthworms and microbes 2 5 11 for instance adugna et al 55 investigated the potential of the vermifilters in removing tsss while treating the concentrated greywater they achieved a hopping tss removal up to 99 4 using sawdust as the bed material similarly liu et al 63 obtained the tss removal up to 94 81 during vf of rural domestic sewage using ceramsite as bed material table 1 the type of vermibed media employed also affects the solid removal performance of the vermifilters for instance kumar et al 52 have compared the potential of four different vermibed materials with respect to the solid removal from the synthetic domestic wastewater table 1 they found that the application of the riverbed materials as vermibed ensured the maximum removal of solids both tsss 75 and tdss 53 this could be due to the better adsorptive properties and higher specific surface area of the riverbed materials as well as the better activity of the earthworms inside the riverbed materials as compared to the wood coal glass balls and mud balls hlr is found to have negative impact on the solid removal performance of the vermifilters for instance xing et al 66 have varied the hlr from 2 4 to 6 7 m3 m2 d to evaluate the impact of hlr on the tss removal performance of the vermifilter during the treatment of real domestic sewage table 1 it has been observed that the removal of tss was the least 57 when the hlr was 6 7 m3 m2 d whereas the tss removal was the highest 77 when the hlr was maintained at 2 4 m3 m2 d this could be attributed to the fact that high hlr created turbulence inside the vermibed causing washing of solids which ultimately cut down the solid removal efficiency of the vermifilters 81 4 4 pathogen removal in order to meet the stringent disposal norms and reusability criteria the destruction of the water borne pathogens from the domestic wastewater has become a prime concern 2 as portrayed in fig 7 the removal of pathogens takes places in various ways during vf the mucus released by the earthworms possesses antibacterial and sticky properties owing to the antibacterial properties the foreign microbes non indigenous microbes present in the domestic wastewater get destroyed 82 again the stickiness of the mucus restricts the movement of the non indigenous pathogens thereby captivating the killing of the pathogens due to unavailability of substrate in their vicinity 83 some pathogens are also removed by the adhesive properties of the bed materials during filtration of domestic sewage 60 fig 7 for instance kumar et al 52 investigated the potential of four different bed materials in removing the pathogens from synthetic domestic sewage table 1 they found that the vermifilter with vermicompost and riverbed materials as the vermibed media ensured the maximum removal of total coliform tc log r 2 6 fecal coliform fc log r 2 22 fecal streptococci fs log r 1 26 and e coli log r 1 81 table 1 this difference could be attributed to the difference in earthworm activities inside the bed materials and also the difference in the adhesive properties and size of the pore openings of different bed materials similarly arora et al 53 also ensured substantial removal of tc log r 3 91 fc log r 3 82 and e coli 2 51 during the vf of domestic sewage furlong et al 72 have employed vf technology for treating human feces and achieved the log r of the thermotolerant coliforms as 3 in light of the above discussion it can be stated that the vf has become a promising alternative of the conventional treatment methods when it comes to the remediation of the wastewater generated from the domestic premises 5 sustainability of vf technology as mentioned earlier a particular technology can be labelled as a sustainable technology if it satisfies the following three broader aspects i e the technology has to be environmentally sustainable economically viable and socially acceptable 84 various other factors coming under the aforementioned broader aspects are portrayed in fig 8 from fig 8 it is clearly evident that the carrying capacity of the receiving ecosystem of a technology also has a monumental impact on its sustainability meanwhile the surrounding components involve water soil and air quality preservation of aquatic and land based ecosystems conservation of the non renewable resources and nutrient recovery 85 fig 8 the factors like initial investment operational and maintenance cost management of the solid residues and the economic value of the byproducts must be taken into account for evaluating the economic sustainability of the wastewater treatment technology under consideration 15 84 5 1 environmental sustainability of vf technology the environmental sustainability of the vf technology during the remediation of domestic sewage has been evaluated in reference with the factors depicted in fig 8 especially the lca as well as the lcia of the vf technology reported in the literature has been explored and compared with those of the asp cws als and wsps to strengthen the environmental feasibility of the vf technology 5 1 1 overview of the lca studies on vf technology in order to carry out the lca studies on the vf technology the researchers have adopted gate to gate approach to establish the system boundary 29 generally the gate to gate approach is popular for unit processes here the life cycle inventory lci includes the details of all the inputs and outputs throughout all the stages of its life cycle including the assessment of raw materials influent domestic sewage energy consumption treated effluent solid residues and gaseous emissions across the construction operation and dismantling phases of the vf technology fig 9 according to the literature two standardized functional units namely one population equivalent pe 1 86 and one cubic meter of influent wastewater 87 are available for performing the lca of the various processes a system boundary considering the gate to gate approach for carrying out the lca of the vf technology has been represented in fig 9 mainly the environmental sustainability of the vf technology treating the domestic sewage has been evaluated with reference to the criteria portrayed in fig 8 through the exploration of the lca and lcia studies on the vf technology available in the literature 5 1 1 1 conservation of the fossil fuels abello passteni 28 has made an approach to investigate the consumption of natural non renewable resources especially the fossil fuels including coal and diesel during the treatment of domestic wastewater employing asp vf and als in chile he has considered 1 kg of bod5 removed as the functional unit it has been observed that the consumption of fossil fuels varied between 0 0001 and 0 03 kg kg of bod5 removed for als and the same for the asp was 0 0001 0 04 kg kg of bod5 removed whereas the vf technology did not consume any fossil fuel across all the stages of its life cycle as already discussed in vf technology unlike asp and als the burrowing activity of the earthworms keeps the system naturally aerobic eliminating the requirement of external energy for mechanical aeration if pumping of wastewater is not required i e the gravitational flow of wastewater is allowed through the vermifilter no external energy is required during the vf process cutting down the requirement of fossil fuels 31 since in this study the major part of the total energy consumed by different technologies including als and asp was supplied utilizing the non conventional and renewable sources like hydroelectricity solar energy and wind energy the requirement of the fossil fuels was comparatively less in both the aforementioned processes however in one of the wwtps where asp has been employed as the secondary treatment step up to 57 6 of the total energy was supplied using diesel as fuel another group of researches lourenco and nunes 29 have also performed the lca of two commonly used decentralized wastewater treatment alternatives such as cws and vf while treating the domestic sewage in southern europe and compared the results with those of the asp they have considered one pe as the functional unit it has been found that the total fossil fuel consumption during the construction phase was 0 638 kg pe for asp whereas zero consumption of fossil fuel was reported in construction phase when asp was replaced with vf technology the electricity consumption during the operational phase was up to 1 16 106 mj pe for asp whereas when asp was replaced with vf technology it was reduced to 4520 mj pe the same for the cws was 3940 mj pe here the electricity during the operational phase was generated from the fossil fuels especially diesel singh et al 88 inspected that the energy consumption for treating 1 mld municipal wastewater was 65 7 mj year for asp such a high energy consumption during the operational phase of the asp was mostly attributed to the electricity consumed by the mechanical aerators for external aeration they also found that the energy consumption for treating 1 mld municipal wastewater for the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasbr was 43 8 mj year this could be due to the maintenance of the wastewater flow in upward direction at a particular velocity 7 meanwhile the requisite energy has been supplied by burning the fossil fuels reflecting the depletion of the fossil fuels in light of the above discussion it can be stated that the vf technology negotiates the consumption of fossil fuels a non renewable source of energy thereby promoting the conservation of natural non renewable resources 5 1 1 2 ghg emissions emission of ghgs is another factor governing the environmental sustainability of the vf technology treating the domestic sewage mainly the emissions during the operational phase have been taken into consideration mostly the vermifilters have not been reported to release ghgs while remediating the domestic sewage this could be because the gaseous emission only co2 due to complete aerobic degradation of the organics during the vf of domestic sewage was so nominal that it could be neglected 5 11 as mentioned earlier the burrowing activity of the earthworms results in the abundance of do inside the vermibed 1 being a low strength wastewater complete aerobic degradation of the organics present in the domestic sewage takes place with the help of natural aeration reducing the production of methane ch4 in fact luth et al 76 have stated that the vermifilters act as the sink for ch4 aditionally owing to the low strength of the domestic sewage the generation of the co2 is also less at the same time attributing to the natural aeration the engagement of external aerators has also been eliminated cutting down the need for burning the fossil fuels for keeping the aerators running it further eliminates the emission of the ghgs which in turn lessens the environmental cost of the vf process 89 in addition owing to the abundance of do complete nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n takes place which subsequently gets denitrified to nitrogen gas n2 eliminating the emission of nitrous oxide n2o another potential ghg generally from the vf of the low strength wastewater such as domestic wastewater co2 is released as the major atmospheric emission according to ipcc 90 the global warming potential gwp of co2 ch4 and n2o are 1 25 and 298 respectively however the gwp of co2 is not considered as it is considered to be biogenic in origin 91 ch4 and n2o are considered to be the major threats to the air quality on the other hand singh et al 88 have investigated the emission of ghgs from various municipal wwtps across india they observed that the wwtps employing anaerobic deep lagoons wsps uasbr and asp with the capacities 321 279 2326 and 979 mld respectively have recorded the ghg emissions up to 118 700 31 858 1 317 375 and 71 696 t co2 eq year respectively highlighting the poor environmental sustainability of the wwtps these emissions included the emission during the treatment of municipal wastewater as well as the emission due to the burning of fossil fuels for generating electricity daelman et al 18 found that out of the total ch4 production in the wwtps 80 ch4 has been produced during asp similarly campos et al 20 have reported that up to 90 of the total n2o emissions from the wwtps has been released during asp on the other hand johansson et al 92 and mander et al 93 investigated the ghg emission potential of the cws and reported that the emission of ch4 was up to 1 8 mg m2 h for free water surface cws fws cws and 6 4 mg m2 h for horizontal subsurface flow cws hssf cws whereas the n2o emission was ranging between 0 031 mg m2 h for fws cws and 0 42 mg m2 h for hssf cws another group of researchers hernandez paniagua et al 94 have made an effort to quantify the amount of ghgs emitted from the wsps they mentioned that the wsps have resulted in the production of ch4 up to 25 mg m2 h unlike domestic sewage if the vermifilters are fed to the high strength wastewaters such as industrial wastewaters substantial amount of ghgs can also be released from the vf process for instance luth et al 76 have stated that the emission of co2 ch4 and n2o was up to 4 4 mg d 2 8 20 3 g d and 2 438 mg d respectively during the vf of pig slurry from the above discussion it is clearly evident that the vf technology promotes the environmental sustainability by protecting the air quality especially while treating the domestic sewage more detailed understanding on the environmental sustainability of the vf technology can be achieved during the lcia of the vf technology 5 1 1 3 generation of organic fertilizer as already mentioned during vf of wastewater the earthworms consume all the produced sludge and excrete in the form of vermicasting 5 11 hence as the solid residue the vermicastings are produced during the course of vf of domestic sewage fig 9 liu et al 64 have carried out the vf of the rural domestic sewage in china for a duration of 17 months they have found a minimal sludge production of 0 08 kg ss kg of cod removed the produced sludge was mostly vermicastings such negligible sludge production could be attributed to the activities of the earthworms inside the vermifilter 64 in fact singh et al 5 have mentioned that there was no sludge production during the vf of domestic wastewater except the vermicastings hence the vf technology can also be termed as the zero waste technology or green technology 32 89 the produced vermicasting is highly nutritive in nature containing 1 16 n 1 22 p and 1 34 potassium k 69 the microbes and enzymes present in the mucus enhance the bioavailability of the nutrients present in the vermicasting thereby making them liable for the plant uptake 31 on the other hand the production of sewage sludge was found to be proportional to the volume of wastewater treated by asp generally 70 100 g sewage sludge is generated while treating 1 m3 domestic sewage using asp 95 the conventional stps are reported to produce the excess sludge up to 0 32 0 08 kg tss kg cod removed 96 in other way it was 0 25 0 06 kg vss kg cod removed even though the sewage sludge produced from the wwtps is rich in nutrients 45 49 g n kg municipal sewage sludge 22 30 g p kg municipal sewage sludge and 1 2 1 6 g k kg municipal sewage sludge the presence of pathogens and heavy metals prohibits its land application as fertilizer 32 97 98 a prior treatment to the raw sewage sludge should be given before applying it as fertilizer or for the safe disposal of the sewage sludge in the midst of the environment landfilling of sewage sludge is reported to liberate the highest quantity of ghgs 296 9 kg co2 eq t sludge followed by monoincineration 232 kg co2 eq t sludge and carbonization 141 kg co2 eq t sludge even the composting of sewage sludge obtained from the conventional wwtps has been reported to make substantial release of the ghgs 99 100 in contrary since vf ensures high pathogen removal from the domestic sewage once the vf process is over the vermicasting layer can be scrapped from the top of the vermibed and directly applied to the agricultural field as fertilizer without any further treatment 52 53 the nutrients present in the vermicasting are readily available to the crops and plants triggering the nutrient recycling potential of the vf process from the domestic sewage hence it can be concluded that unlike the conventional wastewater treatment methods the vf technology helps to maintain the nutrient cycle in the environment without imposing any threat to the environment especially while treating the domestic sewage 5 1 2 overview of the lcia studies on vf technology in order to gather more detailed knowledge regarding the environmental sustainability of a particular technology the researchers have to rely on the lcia of that technology rather than its lca 29 however very few studies are available on the lcia of the vf technology while treating the domestic wastewater 28 29 in order to carry out the lcia of vf technology the following impact categories have been decided by lourenco and nunes 29 in accordance with corominas et al 101 and jeppsson and hellstrom 102 abiotic depletion ad kg sb eq acidification ac kg so2 eq eutrophication eut kg po4 3 eq global warming potential gwp kg co2 eq freshwater ecotoxicity fwt kg 1 4 db eq marine aquatic ecotoxicity maet kg 1 4 db eq human toxicity ht g 1 4 db eq ozone layer depletion old kg cfc 11 eq terrestrial ecotoxicity te kg 1 4 db eq and photochemical oxidation po kg c2h4 eq on the other hand abello passteni 28 has considered climate change cc or gwp kg co2 eq kg bod5 removed eut kg p eq kg bod5 removed fwt kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed and ht kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed as the environmental impact categories for determining the ecoefficiency of vf als and asp while treating domestic wastewater in chile among all the impact categories the ecoefficiency indicators have been evaluated for cc or gwp and eut for being frequently used in ecoefficiency works 28 basically the ecoefficiency indicators can be calculated using the following relationship eq 1 given in iso 14045 103 1 ecoefficiency indicator value functi o n environmental impact the higher the value of the ecoefficiency indicators the better will be the sustainability of the corresponding technology abello passteni 28 has taken the treated volume of wastewater m3 by each technology as the value function even though he has specified four different impact categories the ecoefficiency of the aforementioned technologies has been evaluated with respect to cc and eut he reported that the vf technology was the most eco efficient technology in terms of both cc and eut portraying the highest indicator values the cc indicator value for the vf technology was found to be 6 7 m3 kg co2 eq kg bod5 removed whereas the same for asp and als were 3 8 and 3 4 m3 kg co2 eq kg bod5 removed respectively indicating the als to be the least eco efficient technology similarly the eut indicator value for the vf technology was 10 984 1 m3 kg p eq kg bod5 removed followed by asp 10 518 5 m3 kg p eq kg bod5 removed and als 5876m3 kg p eq kg bod5 removed thus it can be stated that the als and vf had the maximum and the minimum environmental impact respectively the order of fwt kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed and ht kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed caused by the aforementioned technologies were vf asp als and vf asp als respectively signifying the vf and als as the best and the worst technologies respectively with respect to the environmental sustainability another group of researchers lourenco and nunes 29 have tried to determine the environmental sustainability of vf small rate infiltration sri cws and asp by exploring their lcia throughout the construction operation and dismantling phase while treating the domestic sewage coming from the small communities in southern europe they found that the gwps of cws and asp were 1930 and 264 kg co2 eq respectively whereas the gwps were reduced to 135 and 183 kg co2 eq when the above technologies were replaced with vf technology respectively the implementation of vf technology also lessened the ac and eut impacts as compared to sri cws and asp the application of asp has shown the ac impact value up to 6 36 kg so2 eq whereas it was substantially reduced to 1 07 kg so2 eq when asp was replaced with the vf technology similarly the implication of sri cws and asp has yielded the eut impact values up to 13 1 26 1 and 20 7 kg po4 3 eq respectively these values were significantly reduced to 8 96 8 97 and 7 51 when all the above mentioned technologies were substituted by vf technology respectively this could be due to the lower emission of the nutrients due to the implementation of the vf technology in addition the vermifilters were also observed to significantly negotiate the fwt ht old and po as compared to the cws sri and asp 29 in light of the above discussion it can be justified that the vf technology is the most environmentally benevolent alternative for treating the domestic sewage 5 1 3 preservation of water quality and aquatic ecosystem as we already know if the domestic sewage is directly discharged to the water bodies without any treatment it will deteriorate the water quality apart from the conventional water quality parameters e g cod bod nh4 n tn etc the domestic wastewater also embraces pathogens heavy metals and emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants etc in significant concentration 4 5 the presence of such pollutants in the water bodies will not only degrade the water quality but also result in the outbreak of various water borne diseases and destroy the aquatic ecosystem 2 3 31 as already discussed vf has the ability to remove pathogens from the domestic wastewater 42 52 not only this the earthworms also have the ability to uptake the heavy metals 31 and ecs 4 104 from the wastewater being an aerobic process the vermifiltered effluent contains significant do 5 over the last few years the vf technology has become a promising alternative for remediating the domestic sewage especially with respect to organic and nutrient removal 1 4 5 11 according to arora et al 53 and singh et al 2 the domestic wastewater after being subjected to vf meets the stringent discharge limits to the surface water in addition arora et al 53 and kumar et al 52 concluded that the effluent coming from the vf unit has met the who guidelines regarding the pathogen counts as a consequence of the abovementioned reasons the disposal of the treated effluent from the vf of domestic sewage does not captivate any difficulties in the survival of the aquatic lives hence it can be concluded that the vf technology helps preserving the water quality and maintaining the balance of the aquatic ecosystem 5 1 4 preservation of soil quality and land based ecosystem since the domestic wastewater contains heavy metals and ecs the sewage sludge produced as a byproduct of treating the domestic sewage in the wwtps also contains a fraction of the aforementioned pollutants 4 thus even though the sewage sludge produced from the asp is enriched in nutrients its direct application for the land improvement may result in the death of the soil borne microbes thereby hampering the land based ecosystems 97 98 hence the raw sewage sludge should be stabilized or treated before its application to the soil however the sludge treatment imposes negative impact to the environment due to the emission of the ghgs 99 100 for instance daelman et al 18 have found that up to 72 of the total ch4 production in the wwtps came from the sludge treatment unit whereas up to 10 of the total n2o production in the wwtps has been contributed by the sludge treatment unit in contrary in vf the earthworms act as the sludge digester by softening the ingested sludge using the grume excreted in the mouth of the earthworms in addition the sludge is further neutralized by the calcium ca inside the esophagus then in the earthworm s intestine the neutralized sludge has been decomposed by the enzymes finally this stabilized sludge is excreted at the top of the vermibed as vermicasting by the earthworms 105 the vermicasting itself or after being converted to vermicompost acts as a nutritive plant food and improves the soil fertility on its land application 69 the nutrients present in the vermicasting are readily available to the crops strengthening its acceptability as bio fertilizer in addition the microbes and enzymes released with the vermicasting are soil friendly in nature thereby helping in improving the soil quality in fact unlike the chemical fertilizers the land application of the vermicasting or vermicompost does not impose any threats to the soil borne organisms 5 being a chemical free organic manure vermicompost on its land application does not create any chemical toxicity on the soil based organisms 89 hence it can be concluded that the vermicasting as well as the vermicompost can be extensively employed as the organic manure in agriculture and horticulture for improving the soil fertility through the preservation of land based ecosystem 5 1 5 preservation of air quality from the lca and lcia of the vf technology demonstrated earlier it is clearly evident that the vf technology can potentially cut down the risk of ghg emissions and thereby minimizing the gwp to a great extent 28 29 as a concluding remark it can be stated that unlike the conventional such as asp and other non conventional wastewater treatment methods such as cws als and wsps the vf technology possesses zero to trivial deterioration of air quality during the course of remediating the domestic sewage thereby promoting the preservation of air quality 5 1 6 reusability of treated effluent the reusability of any treated effluent depends on its contamination level the concentration levels of do organics bod and cod pathogens nh4 n and no3 n in the effluent have been considered as the major indicators governing the reusability potential of the treated effluent 2 the effluent obtained from the vf of domestic sewage is almost crystal clear odor free detoxified rich in do and has neutral ph 5 thus the effluent can be beneficially used for various non potable purposes such as floor washing toilet flushing making cooling towers in the industries etc 31 in addition the effluent is also rich in nutrients making it suitable to be used for the irrigation purposes 89 106 kumar et al 60 have reported that the vermifiltered effluent can be potentially used for the irrigation and agricultural practices similar conclusion has also been made by manyuchi et al 74 table 2 represents the surface water discharge standards of various pollutants for the municipal wwtps the standards for the irrigation water quality and the reusability potential of the vermifiltered effluent the data obtained from the various literature compiled in table 2 suggests that the domestic sewage after being subjected to vf satisfies the surface water discharge criteria and standards for its application as irrigation water liu et al 63 have employed ceramsite vermifilter for treating domestic wastewater they found that the treated effluent portrayed the cod 51 mg l bod 10 6 mg l and tss 4 1 mg l concentration well below the permissible values furnished in table 2 the effluent had neutral ph and was devoid of pathogens strengthening its acceptability as irrigation water similarly kumar et al 60 also observed the effluent cod and no3 n concentrations were 24 30 and 45 mg l respectively favoring its agricultural application again kumar et al 52 and arora et al 53 concluded that the pathogen concentration 480 and 457 mpn 100 ml respectively in the vermifiltered effluent was below the permissible range mentioned by who table 2 from the above discussion it can be concluded that the vermifiltered domestic sewage displays the potential to be reused in gardening toilet flushing floor washing horticulture and agricultural practices and fruits and vegetable farms 5 2 economic affordability the global acceptability of any technology depends on its economic feasibility in order to evaluate the sustainability of vf technology its economic affordability has to be examined based upon the data available on capital cost operation and maintenance cost treatment efficiency and residual management of the vf technology while treating the domestic sewage fig 8 the concept of circular bioeconomy has also been explored to reinforce the economic viability of the vf technology 5 2 1 capital cost capital cost of a technology includes the costs of land acquisition raw materials energy consumed during its construction phase transportation of raw materials to the treatment site and installation of various equipment from the life cycle inventory lci proposed by lourenco and nunes 29 it has been observed that the land area required for sri cws and asp were 2000 594 and 95 m2 respectively for treating the domestic sewage coming from the small communities with population 120 120 and 500 respectively when the aforementioned processes were replaced with vf technology the land area requirements were astonishingly reduced to 12 5 12 5 and 50 m2 respectively sinha et al 31 inspected that the provision of 1 2 h hrt was sufficient to achieve substantial removal of organics and solids from the raw municipal sewage using the vf process table 1 cutting down the requirement of large footprint on the other hand the hrt to be maintained for wsps especially for facultative ponds varies between 5 and 30 days involving a larger footprint 7 according to taylor et al 108 the construction costs of the vertical subsurface flow cws vssf cws and fws cws were 0 20 user m2 i e 16 80 rupees user m2 and 0 29 user m2 i e 24 40 rupees user m2 respectively the construction cost of the wsps was very high as compared to the cws and vf the higher surface area requirement 2 7 m2 triggers construction cost of the wsps generally up to 60 of the total investment is accounted for the cost of land mara 109 reported that the construction cost of wsps varied from 105 user i e approximately 8826 30 rupees user in france to 343 user approximately 28 832 60 rupees user in germany in contrary the land area requirement for vf has been reported to be 0 25 0 06 0 21 and 0 5 0 6 m2 user in france 110 china 111 and india 112 respectively which reduced the cost of land acquisition leading to the reduction in the capital cost of the vf process coming to the raw material requirement the bed materials used in the vf process such as peat and wood flour 113 sawdust and vermicompost 62 woodchips gravel and quartz sand 55 77 riverbed materials mud balls and glass balls 60 sand and vermicompost 1 ceramsite and coal 114 etc are locally available at very low cost and mostly obtained as the waste from the other activities since the packing materials are available in abundance the acquisition of raw materials involves zero to minimal cost 29 apart from the bed materials the vermifilters have to be incorporated with the earthworms fig 9 sinha et al 31 reported that the cost of 500 earthworms was approximately 20 a approximately 1126 40 rupees the cost of earthworms is considered as the one time investment because once the vf process is over the earthworms can be taken out from the exhausted vermibed and employed in new vermifilters or sold to various farms as feedstock thereby promoting the circular bioeconomy which in turn cuts down the cost of the vf technology 89 unlike the conventional methods owing to the decentralized treatment facilities and less area requirement the vf technology can also be implemented in the vicinity of the domestic wastewater source in fact it can be applied for individual households as well as for the small communities thereby reducing the cost of transportation of the wastewater from source to the treatment site 5 lourenco and nunes 29 found that the raw materials to be used in asp has been travelled for 26 km pe involving and additional cost of 104 pe approximately 8742 24 rupees such expenses are not associated with the vf process apart from this the vf technology does not necessitate the installation of the heavy duty instruments which makes the vf technology a cost effective alternative singh et al 2008 according to usepa the cost of construction of the centralized stps in the rural area was up to 2 321 840 3 750 530 approximately 176 76 285 56 million rupees unlike the conventional treatment methods vermifilters are easy to construct and do not involve any external energy consumption except during the earthwork excavators may be used throughout the construction phase 29 since they are easy to build skilled manpower is not required to construct the vermifilters cutting down the capital cost of the vf technology generally in case of the conventional treatment plants the installation of various heavy duty equipment includes high energy consumption and to construct the wwtps skilled manpower is required triggering the capital cost of the wwtps 11 sharma et al 84 have compared the capital costs of the various onsite domestic wastewater treatment systems they have found that the capital costs of the septic tank with percolation area membrane bioreactor mbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr sequential batch reactor sbr and cws were 1132 1800 2000 1500 620 900 and 1800 user respectively in indian currency the values are 95 156 151 308 168 120 126 090 52 117 20 75 654 and 151 308 rupees user respectively whereas sinha et al 112 have inspected that the capital cost of vf was only 100 150 user i e 8406 12 609 rupees user indicating the cost effectiveness of the vf technology 5 2 2 operational and maintenance cost the operational and maintenance cost of any technology involve the costs regarding the consumed energy during operational phase bed material renewal especially for vf replacing or repairing the equipment or parts engagement of the skilled manpower sludge management and chemical requirements in addition the longevity of the process also affects the cost of the process as previously mentioned lourenco and nunes 29 have performed a lca study on the vf technology and compared its sustainability with conventional asp during the treatment of domestic sewage they reported that during operational phase including electricity consumption for lights pumping the domestic sewage recirculating the effluent and mechanical aeration the total energy consumed in asp was 1 16 106 mj pe whereas in case of vf the consumption of energy was only during the pumping of wastewater in the operational phase the natural aeration due to the earthworm s burrowing activity eliminated the requirement of external aerators making the vf technology energy efficient 1 11 thus when asp was replaced by the vf technology the electricity consumption was drastically reduced to 4520 mj pe lessening the operational cost of the vf process similarly abello passteni 28 also compared the sustainability of vf technology with that of the als and asp he has reported that the requisite electric powers for als and asp were up to 5 5 and 3 0 kwh kg bod5 removed whereas for vf it was only up to 1 7 kwh kg bod5 removed since the operation of vf is very simple and it does not require any heavy duty instrument it does not demand any skilled manpower in contrary the conventional wwtps employing asp as the secondary treatment step require skilled manpower increasing the operational cost of the process thus attributing to the same reason the vf technology does not bear the expenses related to the repairing and replacement of any instrument or its parts negotiating the maintenance cost of the vf process 5 the production of sewage sludge is a compulsory consequence of treating the wastewater the conventional wwtps especially employing asp as the biological treatment facility have been reported to produce humongous quantity of sludge which needs further treatment before its land application or disposal 5 the provision of the sludge treatment facilities acquires a major portion of the total cost of treating the wastewater for example wei et al 115 have carried out a brief cost analysis of windrow composting of activated sludge obtained from the small and mid scale urban wwtps in china they observed that the total cost of windrow composting of the activated sludge was up to 349 000 approximately 26 61 million rupees similarly ghazy et al 116 have reported that the cost of the windrow composting facility in egypt handling 1 65 t sewage sludge day ranged between 74 000 5 64 million rupees and 79 104 60 24 million rupees per ton of the dry sewage sludge per day on the other hand the cost of construction of the engineered landfill was reported to be 65 4956 25 rupees per ton of sewage sludge in australia in contrary the produced sludge also known as vermicasting has already been stabilized inside the earthworm s body and can be directly used as fertilizer without any further treatment 31 the vermicasting can be easily scrapped from the top of the vermibed and can be replaced with the fresh bed materials 35 being a self driven self improved and self powered zero waste technology the vf process possesses high longevity the vf process has been reported to last up to 3 4 months or even 7 8 months without any difficulties especially while treating the low strength domestic sewage 5 owing to this everlasting nature the cost of the vf technology gets reduced apart from all the above mentioned factors the external chemical requirements also govern the operational cost of a technology abello passteni 28 investigated the external chemical requirements during the treatment of domestic wastewater in chile using als asp and vf he observed that to remove 1 kg bod5 als necessitated 0 9 kg sodium hypochlorite 0 1 kg chlorine 1 1 kg ferric chloride and 0 02 kg polymer whereas the same for the asp were 0 2 0 04 0 1 and 0 01 kg kg bod5 removed respectively on the other hand the vf necessitated only 0 1 kg sodium hypochlorite kg bod5 removed for disinfecting the effluent cutting down the cost of the process on the other hand in conventional nitrification and denitrification just before the denitrification unit the organic carbon sources such as methanol has been added externally to facilitate the growth of heterotrophs enhancing the cost of the process 7 in contrary during vf the nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously inside the vermifilter without any external addition of the chemicals making the vf technology economically affordable 5 machado et al 117 have reported that the operational cost of the cws varied between 0 17 and 0 28 m2 year 14 4 23 7 rupees m2 year for fws cws to 0 21 0 34 m2 year 17 8 28 8 rupees m2 year for vssf cws on the other hand mara 109 observed that the operational cost of wsps was up to 4 user year 338 40 rupees user year in france again sharma et al 84 have made an effort to compare the economic feasibility of various onsite domestic sewage treatment facilities they reported that the operational costs of the septic tank with percolation area mbr mbbr sbr and cws were 14 50 70 20 30 4 7 and 175 user year respectively in indian currency these values are 1184 40 4230 5922 1692 2538 338 40 592 20 and 14 805 rupees user year respectively in contrary the operational cost of the vf technology was reported to be only 0 05 m3 year i e 4 23 rupees m3 year subjected to further decrease with the increase in the number of users 112 118 5 2 3 treatment efficiency the treatment efficacy of a particular wastewater treatment technology also determines its economic feasibility in other words it needs to be worthy investing on a particular technology in terms of its treatment efficiency i e the performance of a specific wastewater treatment technology needs to be considered before investing the money on it the treatment efficiency of a wastewater treatment technology depends on the type of wastewater it is supposed to treat 7 as already discussed and portrayed in table 1 it is clearly evident that the vf technology has the potential to substantially remove various pollutants including organics nutrients and pathogens from the domestic wastewater arora et al 53 and kumar et al 52 have concluded that the effluent coming out from the vf of domestic sewage satisfied the stringent surface water discharge standards in terms of pathogens and could be efficiently reutilized for various non potable purposes hence it can be rightly stated that the vf technology has shown enough promise to be potentially implemented for remediating the domestic sewage 5 2 4 production of value added byproducts and linkage to circular bioeconomy apart from the trivial ghg emission the following byproducts are obtained during the vf of domestic sewage treated effluent as the liquid output and the vermicastings as the solid residue in addition once the vf process is over the earthworms can also be taken out from the vermibed 3 chowdhury et al 32 have mentioned that the doubling time of the earthworms is approximately two months as a result the number of earthworms obtained after the process is over will be more than the number of earthworms incorporated at the beginning of the vf process owing to the nutritional value the vermicasting itself or after being converted to the vermicompost can be potentially employed as the organic manure to improve the fertility of the soil 1 32 the vermicompost is reported to have the ability to replace the conventional chemical fertilizers in the global market 89 moreover a huge monetary investment is required to develop the infrastructure to produce the chemical fertilizers which in turn increases the cost of the food production 32 in addition the crops produced by utilizing the chemical fertilizers also get contaminated by the toxic chemicals which subsequently affects the human beings adversely after the consumption of the food on the other hand the cost of producing the vermicasting and vermicompost is trivial due to the abundant availability of the raw materials including domestic wastewater according to the report of the status of sewage treatment plants 2021 published by cpcb the generation of domestic sewage from the class i cities and class ii towns was approximately 29 129 mld as per 2001 census 8 thus the application of the vermicompost as organic manure helps in lessening the cost of food production according to sinha et al 89 a significant drop in the cost of food production up to 60 70 has been noticed by replacing the chemical fertilizers with the vermicompost the produced food will be safe and chemical free sinha et al 89 inspected that the risk of occurrence of any disease on consuming the foods has been reduced by 75 due to the application of vermicompost as organic manure sinha et al 119 have found that the application of vermicompost helps in reducing the harvesting time of the crops this has helped the farmers to gain more profit by cultivating more crops in a single year using the same plot in addition the vermicompost is reported to have the capability to hold the soil moisture for longer duration cutting down the water demand by 30 40 120 in fact vermicompost also helps in obtaining better growth and higher yield of the crops 106 webster 121 found that the application of vermicompost enhanced the grapes production by 23 than that using the chemical fertilizers in light of the above discussion it is clearly evident that the vermicastings and vermicompost can be a potential replacement of the chemical fertilizers across the globe devkota et al 122 found that the production cost of vermicompost was 15 68 rupees kg whereas it has been sold to the market at 25 rupees kg as the biofertilizer obtaining a net profit of 9 32 rupees kg of vermicompost which in turn lessened the cost of vf process similarly the effluent obtained from the vf of domestic sewage embraces nutrients in high concentrations thereby satisfying the criteria to be utilized in irrigation and agricultural practices 74 hence it also adds positive economic value to the vf process the presence of earthworms adds 100 1000 times more value than the conventional processes 123 the obtained earthworms can be again reutilized in other vermifilters the earthworms can also be sold to the farmers or to the various farms such as poultry dairy and fishery farms as feedstocks since the earthworms are rich in protein content 65 of the total wight of the earthworms 89 in australia the cost of 500 earthworms is approximately 20 a 1126 40 rupees 31 whereas devkota et al 122 have found that the cost of production of one earthworm was only 0 40 rupees in recent few years vermiculture has become one of the fastest growing industries hati 124 found that the villagers in rural areas were gaining a yearly profit of 5 6 lakh rupees by selling the earthworms and vermicompost hence the earthworms also indirectly help in reducing the cost of vf process few examples of the commercial business models established proposed worldwide regarding the production and trading of the earthworms and vermicompost have been portrayed in table 3 in reference to the above discussion it can be concluded that the vf technology helps in converting the wastewater coming from the households communities agricultural fields and various farms into highly nutritive vermicastings the vermicastings after being converted to vermicompost can be utilized in the agricultural fields and subsequently the wastewater coming from the agricultural field through municipal sewer systems can be subjected to the vf process thereby completing a cycle fig 10 moreover the treated effluent can be employed for the agricultural and horticultural purposes thereby imparting a positive economic value the earthworms employed in the vf can also be taken out once the process is over and sold to various farms as feedstock in fact the same earthworms can also be incorporated into a new vermifilter thereby completing a circle of economy hence the vf technology converts the domestic wastewater with negative economic worth into highly nutritive effluent vermicastings and vermicompost having positive economic values using the earthworms i e biological agent thereby reinforcing the concept of circular bioeconomy fig 10 5 3 social acceptability in addition to the environmental sustainability and economic affordability the vf technology needs to be socially acceptable for its consideration as the sustainable wastewater remediation technology the social acceptability of a particular wastewater treatment technology depends on the following factors protection of public health pubic involvement and community development i e the growth of local socio economy and aesthetics 15 84 fig 8 5 3 1 protection of public health since the vf technology has the potential to substantially eradicate various pollutants including organics nutrients and pathogens from the domestic sewage the outbreak of the water borne diseases has been drastically reduced reducing the risk of human toxicity 53 82 in fact kumar et al 52 and arora et al 53 have reported that the vf process can successfully eliminate the fcs from the domestic sewage and the treated effluent has satisfied the surface water discharge standards regarding the pathogen count in addition kumar et al 60 have postulated that the no3 n concentration in the effluent obtained from the vf of domestic sewage was 45 mg l thus the discharge of the vermifiltered effluent to the surface water bodies would not cause the blue baby syndrome 2 in addition as already discussed being an organic fertilizer the application of vermicastings and vermicompost results in the production of safe and chemical free food cutting down the risk of hazardous impact on the human beings due to the consumption of foods sinha et al 89 have reported a drastic fall up to 75 in the risk of occurrence of such diseases when the chemical fertilizers were replaced with the vermicompost generally the effluent obtained from the domestic wastewater has been advised to utilize for non potable purposes 31 however in rural areas the people may use the surface water which may accommodate the discharge from the vermifilter for drinking purpose moreover the human beings share the same food chain with the fishes 3 since the vf technology is capable of reducing the concentration levels of the contaminants below the permissible limits it can be stated the implication of vf technology cuts down the risk of human toxicity to a great extent thereby promoting the protection of public health 5 3 2 growth of local socio economy being an environmentally sound and decentralized wastewater remediation technology vf can be effectively employed to remediate the domestic sewage generated from the individual households or small communities 5 owing to the ease of construction and operation of vf the common people of the communities can take the decisions and actions by themselves reflecting local values through a public process in which the common people have the sense of ownership over the decision making i e the common people can decide how to construct and use the system for their economic growth in other words vf ensures the public involvement which is not possible in case of the conventional wastewater treatment methods 15 as already discussed the vf of domestic sewage results in the production of various value added byproducts such as vermicastings vermicompost treated effluent and earthworms fig 10 the vermicompost can be sold to the market as fertilizer devkota et al 122 reported that the vermicompost has been sold to the market at a rate of 25 rupees kg with a net profit of 9 32 rupees kg in addition as already mentioned the earthworms can also be sold to various farms as feedstock sinha et al 31 observed that the price of 500 earthworms was approximately 20 a approximately 1126 40 rupees hence vf process also helps in boosting up the economy which makes the local people in rural areas attracted towards the vf process since it is a decentralized method all the members of the community can equally take the benefits of the vf facility moreover the treated effluent can be used for various non potable purposes by the beneficiaries it also promotes social resiliency and stability through the wise use of the resources thus due to the implementation of the vf technology for treating the domestic sewage all the members of the community will be able to prosper to their highest potential through appropriate natural resource based development in other words the vf technology as a whole helps in the community development 15 hence through the public involvement and community development the vf technology ensures the growth of local socio economy 5 3 3 aesthetics another parameter that plays a pivotal role in determining the social acceptability of a wastewater treatment technology is the maintenance of the aesthetic assets 15 84 as we already know the burrowing activity of the earthworms makes the vf process naturally aerobic being an aerobic method vf process does not produce any pungent smell basically by tunneling action the earthworms inhibit the action of the anaerobic microorganisms releasing mercaptans and hydrogen sulphide 31 hence the vf technology does not cause any nuisance to the surrounding people thereby maintaining the social aesthetics being a decentralized method vf technology can also be employed in small scale communities or individual households and it does not occupy large space in addition unlike the conventional aerobic wastewater treatment methods vf process does not produce any sludge promoting the conservation of social aesthetic values the effluent coming out from the vf of domestic sewage is crystal clear and rich in do 1 31 thus its disposal to the surface water bodies does not cause any color change of the water apart from this the disposal of the vermifiltered effluent does not result in the formation of algal bloom inside the surface water bodies 2 60 furthermore as discussed earlier vf helps in maintaining the balance of the aquatic as well as the soil based ecosystems 2 53 thereby strengthening the concept of preserving the aesthetic assets in light of the above discussions it can be concluded that the vf technology has satisfied almost all the criteria to be regarded as the sustainable treatment alternative for treating the domestic sewage especially in rural and urban communities of both the developing and developed countries the provision of the centralized wwtps may not be fruitful in near future as the sustainable wastewater treatment facility owing to the accrescent need for the clean water hence the need of this hour is to treat particularly the domestic sewage coming from the single households and small communities in decentralized manner employing the vf technology thereby ensuring the reduction of the burden of the organic loads on the conventional wwtps in view of the analyses made throughout the review work the advantages of implementing the vf technology over the conventional wastewater treatment methods especially for treating the domestic sewage have been schematically portrayed in fig 11 6 future perspectives even though the vf technology has been extensively employed in remediating the domestic sewage the researchers have faced few challenges especially during the field scale implementation of the vf technology which need further attention the earthworms cannot sustain higher hlrs and are unable to survive in water logged condition for longer duration which restrict the scaling up of the vf technology this issue needs special attention of the researchers the earthworms are very sensitive to the seasonal variations during summer the earthworm s skin gets dried up restricting the movement of the earthworms which in turn ceases the activities of the earthworms in monsoon the earthworms may get injured by the direct impact of the rain drops reducing the efficacy of the vf technology similarly in winter the activity of the earthworms gets drastically reduced this is a serious issue and needs to be encountered for the successful implementation of the vf technology in field scale applications to ensure substantial removal of the nutrients from the wastewater sufficient contact time has to be provided which engages large footprint negotiating the scaling up of the vf technology especially where the space is limited this has to addressed to further reinforce the sustainability of the vf technology over the last few years an awareness has been observed among the researchers to adopt various strategies and techniques to further improve the performance of the vf technology various researchers have provided a thermal insulation layer elasticity plastic filler layer at the vermibed surface to protect the earthworms from the external freezing 113 125 some researchers have incorporated the macrophytes to protect the earthworms from the direct impact of the rain and extreme heat of the sun 1 33 in addition the macrophytes impart some distinct advantages including rootzone aeration accommodation of the microbes at the rhizosphere enhancement of the porosity of the vermibed media and nutrient uptake from the wastewater further improving the treatment efficacy of the vermifilters 11 the issue regarding the operation of the vermifilters at higher hlrs can be overcome to some extent by adopting the step feeding of the influent at multiple points 1 126 in step feeding the flowrate of the influent gets divided among different influent ports thus the hlrs from each port becomes substantially less as compared to the single point wastewater feeding approach in addition in step feeding mode the uniform distribution of the wastewater over the entire surface of the vermibed reduces the risk of ponding recently to address the concern related to the area requirement of the vf process the researchers have implemented baffled vermifilters 37 38 and hybrid vermifilters 1 33 in baffled vermifilters the provision of baffles increases the effective length of travel of wastewater inside the vermifilter by ensuring the curvilinear movement of the wastewater thereby facilitating sufficient contact time for substantial nutrient removal from the wastewater by engaging smaller area on the other hand in hybrid vermifilters the wastewater has to pass through a vssf vermifilter followed by a hssf vermifilter in vssf vermifilter the aerobic condition prevails whereas in hssf vermifilter anaerobic condition becomes predominant 30 48 thus the provision of the hybrid vermifilter improves the redox condition of the system triggering the organic and nutrient removal efficiency of the vf technology within a minimal footprint however the application of all the aforementioned modifications has been mostly limited to the lab scale hence further research is of utmost importance to examine the feasibility of the aforementioned advanced vermifilters in field scale applications 7 conclusion in the present review the mechanisms taking place in vf and the contribution of the earthworms in remediating the domestic sewage are comprehensively elaborated on analyzing the performance of the vf technology based on the data compiled in this review work it can be concluded that the vf technology has displayed its worth in countering the pollutants present in the domestic sewage in fact the disposal of the vermifiltered effluent to the surface water bodies is absolutely safe the vf technology is found to be more advantageous than several pioneer wastewater treatment technologies such as asp and other non conventional wastewater treatment technologies such as cws als and wsps especially regarding the treatment of domestic sewage the detailed analyses on the lca and lcia of the vf technology portrays that the vf technology can potentially reduce the environmental nuisance by negotiating the ghg emissions and sludge production justifying the vf technology as a zero waste technology or green technology taking into consideration the strict environment protection policies worldwide the vf technology can be regarded as an eco innovation in the field of wastewater treatment furthermore the energy efficiency and the production of the value added byproducts improve the economy of vf process in addition its linkage to circular bioeconomy makes it an economically viable option the vf technology also satisfies the social acceptability criteria by promoting public involvement community development and preserving the social aesthetic aspects hence as a concluding remark it can be stated that the full scale implementation of the vf technology would help the society to achieve the three bottom lines of sustainability environmental sustainability economic affordability and social acceptability declaration

12764,with population surge and vigorous industrialization scarcity of freshwater is intensifying day by day reutilization of treated wastewater has been regarded as the most promising effort to counteract this global issue to meet the current need of sustainable development researchers are emphasizing on practicing the green technologies to purify wastewater in such regard vermifiltration vf being a natural and eco friendly technology can be a wise selection for treating the domestic sewage the present review includes a brief discussion on the performance of vf in remediating the domestic sewage in addition the life cycle assessment lca and life cycle impact assessment lcia of the vf technology have been explored and the results are compared with those of the conventional and non conventional wastewater remediation technologies it is found that vf is a standalone technology delivering enormous benefits including negotiation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions decentralized treatment facility energy efficiency value added byproduct generation contribution to circular bioeconomy and preservation of local aesthetics the main objective of this review work is to bring all the aspects related to vf of domestic sewage to the attention of the prolific researchers for establishing vf technology as a sustainable domestic sewage treatment alternative in near future satisfying the zero discharge concept graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords vermifilter lca circular bioeconomy sustainable development green technology data availability all data models and code generated or used during the study appear in the submitted article 1 introduction the unrestrained population growth urbanization and intense industrial activities have brought about the consumption of enormous quantity of freshwater and discharge of huge amount of wastewater containing hazardous contaminants such as organics nutrients pathogens etc 1 2 according to the un world water development report 2020 a six fold increase in the water utilization over the past century has been observed with an increasing rate of almost 1 per year 3 the presence of the abovementioned pollutants in the aquatic environment exhibits the concerns like eutrophication and depletion of dissolved oxygen do thereby making the environment adverse for the aquatic lives to thrive in extreme conditions the human beings may also get affected as we share the food chain with the fishes 2 4 the situation becomes even worse when the consumers are compelled to use the contaminated water or buy freshwater at high cost hence to overcome the scarcity of clean water the treatment and reuse of wastewater have become the compulsory choice for the competent authorities 2 5 it has been reported that the domestic wastewater coming from various towns and cities has been the biggest source of water pollution in india 6 generally 75 80 of the freshwater supplied to the communities becomes wastewater 7 as per the reports of the status of sewage treatment plants 2021 published by cpcb in india approximately 29 129 mld swage has been produced by all the class i cities and class ii towns together estimated as per the population in 2001 census which is expected to be 33 212 mld at present considering 30 growth in urban population per decade on the other hand the existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps facilitate the treatment capacity up to 7933 mld which is just 23 88 of the current domestic sewage generation meanwhile the actual capacity utilization factor of the existing sewage treatment plants stps is 0 722 practically only 13 5 of the generated domestic sewage avails the centralized treatment facility and the remaining gets directly discharged into the waterbodies deteriorating the water quality 8 moreover the domestic sewage is enriched with nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p hence in order to meet the stringent surface water discharge norms to satisfy the accrescent need for the clean water and from the perspective of nutrient recovery the treatment of domestic sewage is of utmost importance 6 9 the conventional wwtps employed to overcome the water crisis necessitate large material and energy input furthermore the greenhouse gas ghg emissions from the wwtps can potentially damage the environment 10 in addition as a byproduct of wastewater treatment enormous quantity of sludge is produced in wwtps imposing additional monetary requirements which in turn makes the wwtps unsustainable 11 the physical and chemical wastewater treatment methods are found to be costly as well as incompetent in removing the targeted pollutants from the wastewater cutting down their acceptability as the sustainable wastewater remediation methods 12 13 as a solution to the aforesaid problems the biological wastewater treatment methods have gained the major attention of the researchers because of having several advantages over the aforementioned methods 14 the anaerobic methods are energy efficient and produce less sludge however it is a sluggish process and becomes unstable due to the slight deviation in the operating conditions in addition the anaerobic methods are not suitable for the low strength wastewater such as domestic sewage the anaerobically treated effluent is devoid of do restricting its disposal to the surface water in addition the gaseous emissions such as methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 and the pungent smell produced during the anaerobic process hinder its environmental as well as social acceptability 1 7 on the other hand the aerobic methods being more robust than the former can be effectively implemented to overcome the concerns related to the anaerobic methods however high energy input and huge sludge production have been the perennial constraints for the commercialization of the aerobic wastewater treatment methods especially in the underdeveloped and developing countries where the capital investment and skilled manpower are not available in abundance 2 5 in the context of the developing and underdeveloped countries the implementation of the sustainable wastewater treatment technology is of paramount importance according to bradley et al 15 in order to achieve the sustainability the technology has to be environmentally benign economically feasible and socially acceptable fig 1 according to the american society of civil engineers asce the sustainable water resource systems are designed and maintained to fulfill the objectives of the society without compromising the ecological hydrological and environmental integrity 15 in short sustainable development promotes the preservation of the social economic and environmental vitalities while satisfying the current needs the conventional wwtps are reported to emit 3 of the global ghg emissions 16 17 daelman et al 18 investigated that 1 of the chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent has been converted to methane ch4 in the wwtps whereas kampschreur et al 19 have inspected that up to 14 6 of the total nitrogen load of the influent has been released as nitrous oxide n2o in the wwtps such emissions become even intense when the activate sludge process asp is used as the secondary treatment step in the wwtps 20 moreover the centralized treatment system necessitates the transportation of the wastewater and the produced sludge from the source of wastewater to the treatment site and from the wastewater treatment site to the sludge handling site respectively 21 in addition to the potential ghg emissions huge monetary requirement for high energy consumption and sludge handling make the centralized wastewater treatment systems unsustainable especially for the small communities in rural areas implementation of decentralized onsite sanitation systems can be a potential solution for the above problem 22 in fact it is an automatic choice especially where the central sanitation system has not reached in addition being easy to construct and operate the decentralized systems have become more sustainable than the centralized systems and are expected to serve up to 500 million population by the year 2030 23 in this regard the vermifiltration vf technology being a natural environmentally benevolent cost effective and decentralized system has gained the attention of the researchers especially for remediating the domestic sewage 1 5 11 the vermifilters are earthworm based biofilters facilitating the degradation of organics and eradication of nutrients through the combined action of the earthworms and microbes 5 11 fig 2 mostly the vf technology has gained the popularity as the primary or secondary treatment alternative for treating the domestic sewage fig 3 if the nutrient recovery from the domestic wastewater is intended the vermifilters can also be potentially employed as the tertiary treatment step 3 in order to evaluate the sustainability of vf technology for treating the domestic sewage the life cycle assessment lca of vf technology has been explored from the available data on the lca studies on the vf technology treating domestic sewage a comprehensive review on the inflow raw materials and energy and outflow treated effluent solid residue and ghg emissions of various forms of materials throughout all the stages of its lifecycle i e construction operation and dismantling has been portrayed in this review work this not only helped to understand the environmental sustainability of the vf technology in terms of ghg emissions and sludge production but also helped to understand the economic feasibility of the same in terms of materials and energy consumption and value added byproduct formation to have an in depth understanding of the actual environmental impacts caused by the vf technology while treating the domestic sewage the concept of the life cycle impact assessment lcia has also been reconnoitered 24 25 as already mentioned since the vf technology has been mostly employed as the secondary treatment step the results obtained from the lca and lcia studies on vf technology are compared with those of the asp the most frequently employed conventional secondary treatment step in the wwtps for assessing the sustainability of the vf technology apart from this the vf technology has also been compared with the other non conventional technologies such as constructed wetlands cws aerated lagoons als and waste stabilization ponds wsps regarding the materials and energy input and ghg emissions across all the stages of their life cycle to reinforce the acceptability of the vf technology as the sustainable domestic wastewater treatment alternative till date many review works on evaluating the potential of the vf technology as an alternative of the conventional wastewater treatment technologies have been published by the various prolific researchers across the globe 2 5 11 26 27 singh et al 5 have focused on the pollutant removal mechanisms factors affecting the treatment performance and the application of the vf technology in removing the key pollutants i e organics nutrients and solids from the wastewaters samal et al 11 have emphasized on the potential of the macrophyte assisted vermifilters in remediating the domestic as well as industrial wastewaters singh et al 2 have highlighted the reusability of the treated effluent from the vf of the wastewaters coming from both the domestic and industrial premises samal et al 26 have enlighten the types and characteristics of the earthworms their casting habits and ghg emissions during the vf process while briefing about the pollutant removal mechanisms and the application of the vf technology for treating various wastewaters singh et al 27 have particularly explored the nitrogen removal dynamics in the vermifilters while treating the domestic as well as the industrial wastewaters also from the available literature it has been observed that very few researchers have published their review works on the sustainability particularly on the environmental sustainability of vf technology for treating the wastewater 2 3 28 29 lourenco and nunes 29 have evaluated the sustainability of the vf technology in terms of material and energy input and ghg emissions throughout all the stages of its life cycle while treating the domestic sewage and compared the results with those of the cws small rate infiltration sri and asp on the other hand abello passteni 28 has focused on the lcia of the vf technology als and asp while treating the raw domestic sewage from the small communities in chile however to the best of our knowledge no one has ever made an approach to assess the economic sustainability of the vf technology by performing the cost analysis and focusing on its linkage to the circular bioeconomy during the treatment of domestic sewage moreover the assessment of the social acceptability of the vf technology during the course of treating the domestic sewage has also been overlooked by the researchers hence in this review work a genuine effort has been made to investigate the sustainability of the vf technology with respect to the three major bottom lines of the sustainability i e environmental sustainability economic affordability and social acceptability during the course of treating the domestic sewage 2 types operation and sustainability of vermifilters predominantly vermifilters are of three types vertical subsurface flow vermifilters vssf vfs horizontal subsurface flow vermifilters hssf vfs and hybrid vermifilters h vfs the design operation and sustainability of each of the aforementioned vermifilters are briefly discussed below 2 1 vssf vfs in vssf vf the bed materials are stacked in layers vertically and the gravel is provided at the bottommost layer as a supporting media the wastewater is allowed to flow vertically through the bed material from the top of the vermibed and treated effluent is collected at the bottom fig 4a the vssf vfs exhibits higher oxygenation capacity attributing to the better distribution of wastewater 30 which promotes enhanced biodegradation of the organics and nitrification process hence in addition to the burrowing activities of the earthworms the configuration of the vssf vfs intensifies the natural aeration inside the system which further cuts down the external energy requirement for mechanical aeration thereby making the process cost effective 5 since the wastewater flows vertically through the system the vermibed materials get effectively utilized in the vssf vfs 1 moreover the intensified aeration further aggravates the activity of the earthworms inside the vssf vfs as a result more casting is produced which can be sold as organic fertilizer cutting down the cost of the process 31 on the other hand the higher do level inside the system ensures the complete degradation of the organics present in the wastewater releasing carbon dioxide co2 as the only gaseous emission especially while treating the domestic wastewater with lower organic strength which in turn promotes the environmental sustainability through negotiating the greenhouse gas ghg such as methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions 2 26 lastly being a complete aerobic system vssf vf does not produce any pungent smell during the treatment of wastewater reinforcing the social acceptability 5 2 2 hssf vfs unlike the vssf vfs the bed materials are stacked in layers in horizontal direction and the gravel layer is provided just before the outlet in hssf vfs the wastewater is allowed to flow through the vermibed media horizontally and the treated effluent is collected at the outlet end placed opposite to the inlet zone fig 4b according to the reports the coexistence of the aerobic and anoxic anaerobic conditions has been observed inside the hssf vfs which allows higher denitrification along with the biodegradation of the organics and nitrification 30 unlike the conventional nitrification and denitrification system in hssf vfs the nitrification and denitrification take place simultaneously within a single unit lessening the footprint requirement moreover no external chemical such as methanol is required to be added as the external carbon source to trigger the growth of the denitrifiers in the hssf vfs reducing the cost of the process 1 32 similar to the vssf vfs the produced casting in the hssf vfs can be traded as the organic fertilizer moreover the hssf vfs negotiate the emission of the potential ghgs and the generation of the pungent odor thereby assuring the environmental sustainability and social acceptability respectively 5 26 2 3 h vfs h vf allows two stage filtration of the wastewater generally a h vf consists of a vssf vf followed by a hssf vf first the wastewater flows vertically through the vssf vf and the effluent coming out from the bottom of the vssf vf serves as the influent for the hssf vf which flows horizontally through the hssf vf and finally the effluent is collected on the other side of the hssf vf fig 4c as already discussed in vssf vfs the aerobic condition prevails whereas in hssf vfs the anaerobic condition becomes predominant 30 since the wastewater has to travel through both the reactors it experiences all the redox conditions during its passage through the h vfs 33 basically the h vfs impart all the advantages associated with the vssf vfs and hssf vfs moreover due to the improved redox conditions the h vfs ensure better removal of the organics and nutrients from the wastewater also the effective length of travel of the wastewater gets increased in the h vfs leading to the enhanced interaction time between the wastewater earthworms bed materials and microbes which in turn aggravates the treatment efficacy of the vf technology through satisfying the criteria for the environmental and economic sustainability 1 3 pollutant removal mechanisms in vf technology vf technology can substantially remove the organics solids both the suspended and dissolved solids nutrients mainly n and p and pathogens from the domestic wastewater the governing pollutant removal mechanisms in the vermifilter have been discussed in brief in the following subsections 3 1 organic and solid removal mechanism in vf the symbiotic action of the microbes and the earthworms captivates the purification of wastewater the earthworms incorporated into the vermibed not only breakdown the pollutants present in the wastewater but also devour the soil particles of the vermibed 1 31 34 apart from the earthworms and microbes a large portion of pollutants has been removed by the vermibed media through adsorption and screening or trapping 2 35 generally the vermibed consists of both the organic and inorganic materials the organic materials such as vermicompost serve as the food to the earthworms and microbes and thereby helping the earthworms to grow and reproduce which in turn improves the performance of the vermifilter 5 11 on the other hand the inorganic packing materials such as sand improve the hydraulic conductivity of the media facilitating efficient wastewater treatment through the achievement of desired hydraulic retention time hrt 36 during vf the vermibed acts as the sorption medium or support matrix enhancing the removal of nutrients in the vermifilter 37 39 the earthworms through their burrowing activities combination of ingestion grinding digestion and excretion convert the larger soil particles of the vermibed into finer fractions increasing the specific surface area of the vermibed media thereby escalating the sorption capacity of the support matrix in addition the earthworm s burrowing action also helps in improving the porosity of the vermibed media generally the coarse pollutants such as suspended organics and suspended solids present in the influent get trapped on the pores of the bed media followed by their subsequent devouring by the earthworms and eventually get released as the vermicasting with enlarged specific surface area this vermicasting gets mixed with the bed materials and improves the sorption potential of the mixture 2 35 unlike the suspended pollutants the dissolved pollutants in the influent percolate through the screening layer thereafter a fraction of the dissolved pollutants gets absorbed by the suitable layer of the vermibed media and the remaining fraction gets degraded by the combined action of the earthworms and microbes 5 fig 5 as already mentioned the earthworms perform a series of beneficial activities such as ingestion of larger particles grinding of ingested particles in the gizzard digestion of grinded particles in presence of gut microbes and finally excretion as vermicasting enriched in microbes and nutrients 1 generally the earthworms devour the large size particles into finer particles favoring the microbial degradation of the pollutants 5 moreover owing to the tunneling activity of the earthworms natural aeration gets intensified within the system triggering aerobic microbial degradation of the organics 40 41 the introduction of earthworms promotes the growth of diversified microbial communities improving organic oxidation potential of the vermifilter 42 the earthworms release a slimy liquid also known as mucus containing various enzymes and microbes which in turn facilitates the mineralization of the contaminants 43 mucus is also enriched in gluco proteins amino acids and glucosidic and proteic molecules thereby upholding the optimum carbon to nitrogen c n ratio for the microbial degradation 44 45 in addition the earthworms also possess ph neutralization potential by secreting calcium from their crop thereby enhancing the bioavailability of the organics and solids for further degradation 46 3 2 nutrient removal mechanism the domestic wastewater mainly contains ammonium n nh4 n and organic n apart from n domestic sewage also embraces significant amount of p the n removal pathways in the vermifilter is very intricate including ammonification or mineralization of the organic n nitrification and denitrification or adsorption by the bed materials or microbial assimilation 1 fig 6 the organic n present in the domestic wastewater or released from the tissues of the dead earthworms has been utilized by the heterotrophs such as bacillus proteus pseudomonas streptomyces etc for their growth and reproduction and subsequently the inorganic form of n i e nh4 n gets released into the vermifilter 37 38 basically the organics present in the domestic wastewater and the bed material and the nitrogenous substances excreted by the earthworms help in maintaining the adequate c n ratio inside the vermibed facilitating the growth of heterotrophs 47 the nh4 n present in the domestic wastewater or produced due to the ammonification of organic n can be removed in two ways in the vermifilter nitrification by the autotrophs and adsorption by the bed materials 35 in vermifilter the burrowing activity of the earthworms intensifies the air circulation inside the vermibed which in turn helps in nitrification of nh4 n nitrification is an aerobic process and is carried out by the autotrophs which grow when the availability of the organic carbon is less inside the vermifilter 1 generally the nitrification takes place within the top few centimeters of the vermibed since nh4 n carries positive surface charge and the bed materials are mostly negatively charged nh4 n gets adsorbed by the bed materials through electrostatic interactions fig 6 48 49 on the other hand since both the no3 n and bed materials are negatively charged the removal of no3 n through adsorption is trivial the hydrophobic interaction between the vermibed media and no3 n governs the little adsorption of no3 n onto the vermibed media 49 meanwhile if macrophytes are present in the system the no3 n will be up taken as nutrient by the macrophytes the most important n removal pathway in the vermifilter is denitrification 1 denitrification of the nitrified byproducts is carried out by the heterotrophs which become prevalent in the vermifilter when the organic carbon source is available in abundance inside the system 35 during denitrification the nitrified byproducts mostly nitrate n no3 n get directly converted into n2 gas by the heterotrophs and subsequently the produced n2 gas gets released to the atmosphere it has been reported that the anoxic anaerobic condition triggers the denitrification process 30 thus the denitrification mostly occurs at the bottom layers of the vermibed the earthworm excluded zone if sufficient organic carbon source is available for the growth of the heterotrophs 5 moreover the mucus released by the earthworms embraces various gut microbes and enzymes facilitating nitrification and denitrification processes 11 the removal of p in the vermifilter is governed by the adsorption process 5 fig 6 the enzyme assisted microbial mechanism of the vermifilter does not facilitate the removal of p thus the p removal potential of the vermifilters depends upon the adsorption capacity of the bedding material and the wastewater distribution time 50 apart from adsorption a fraction of p also gets removed through the fixation of p as the phosphate po4 3 of different metallic cations 51 however attributing to the burrowing activities of the earthworms the microbial and enzymatic activities inside the vermifilter get amplified which in turn facilitate the mineralization of the bound form of p as a result the effluent total p tp concentration often gets escalated than its influent concentration 52 3 3 pathogen removal mechanism apart from the organics nutrients and solids the vermifilters also have the potential to eliminate pathogens especially from the domestic sewage 53 basically the coelomic fluid also known as mucus secreted from the earthworm s body portrays antibacterial properties and slays the unfamiliar microbes present in the domestic wastewater mucus only supports the survival of the gut microbes it gets mixed with the bacterial cell and ceases their movement owing to its stickiness property 2 fig 7 it further leads to the killing of the pathogens owing to the scarcity of food in their vicinity nevertheless the earthworms also devour the pathogens and subsequently the pathogens get destroyed in the earthworm s gut 40 41 4 application and performance of vf technology for treating domestic sewage from the extensive literature it has been observed that the vf technology has become one of the major alternatives of the conventional wastewater treatment methods for eradicating organics nutrients solids and pathogens from the domestic wastewater 1 3 5 45 54 a comprehensive overview on the performance of the vf technology in remediating the domestic sewage is portrayed in table 1 4 1 organic removal the vermifilters are reported to exhibit higher removal of organics than that of the geofilters 2 31 the provision of sufficient hrt and optimum earthworm density further improves the performance of the vermifilter 74 the earthworm species also plays a pivotal role in the performance of the vermifilters for instance kumar et al 61 reported that vf ensured 71 89 and 88 33 removals of cod and biological oxygen demand bod5 respectively from the real domestic sewage using riverbed material and vermicompost as the vermibed material in presence of eisenia fetida earthworm species whereas the presence of eudrilus eugeniae yielded only up to 54 22 and 70 removals of cod and bod5 respectively under the same operating conditions indicating the superiority of eisenia fetida over eudrilus eugeniae even though both eisenia fetida and eudrilus eugeniae belong to the epigeic species the former earthworms have been reported to withstand the adverse operating conditions to the maximum extent they can even operate under the water logged condition compared to eudrilus eugeniae eisenia fetida gets acclimatized very quickly to the surroundings moreover these earthworms are the voracious eaters of the organics and produce huge quantity of vermicasting which in turn enhances the organic removal efficiency of the vf process 5 26 on the other hand under the same operating conditions kumar et al 60 obtained the cod and bod5 removals up to 87 89 and 96 respectively during the treatment of synthetic domestic sewage employing eisenia fetida earthworm species table 1 the difference in the organic removal in presence of the same earthworm species and similar conditions could be due to the higher complexity of the real domestic sewage as compared to the synthetic domestic sewage 11 as discussed before the synergistic action between the earthworms and microbes governs the higher removal of organics in the vermifilter the earthworms devour the coarse organics into finer particles thereby enhancing their bioavailability for the microbial degradation 5 the burrowing activity of earthworms helps in keeping the system aerobic triggering the growth of favorable microbes 75 the mucus also accommodates digestive enzymes captivating the degradation of the organics 76 xing et al 69 observed that the vermifilters treating the real domestic sewage in presence of eisenia fetida resulted in 81 86 abatement of cod whereas the removal of bod5 was up to 91 98 it signifies the higher inclination of the earthworms towards the biodegradable organics compared to the nonbiodegradable organics 53 similar observations were also postulated by arora et al 53 and sinha et al 31 the vf technology has also been employed to remediate the human feces table 1 furlong et al 72 reported that the application of the vf technology to remediate human feces ensured substantial cod removal up to 88 90 indicating high concentration of the biodegradable organic matters in human feces it can also be observed from table 1 that almost all the studies have been conducted employing eisenia fetida and eudrilus eugeniae earthworms both of them are epigeic earthworms generally for vf process the epigeic earthworms are employed by the researchers because of their ability of rapid acclimatization with the surroundings higher reproducibility early attainment of the matured phase withstanding the fluctuations in the operating condition to a great extent and displaying endurance and resistance to handling moreover due to the decompacting nature of the epigeic earthworms the bioavailability of the nutrients in the produced vermicasting gets increased for plant uptake 26 the other two types of earthworms i e endogenic and anecic are not as advantageous as epigeic earthworms thus the epigeic earthworms are mostly preferred by the researchers among all the epigeic earthworms eisenia fetida can operate under the water logged condition and can handle the fluctuations to the highest extent that is why eisenia fetida earthworms become popular among the researchers however in one study by sinha et al 31 perionyx excavatus earthworms were used while treating raw municipal sewage table 1 which also come under epigeic earthworms 4 2 nutrient removal nitrogen n is the most common nutrient present in the domestic wastewater predominantly n is available in the form of ammonium n nh4 n and organic n in domestic sewage 1 2 in vermifilters the removal of n from the domestic wastewater is attributed to a series of mechanisms such as mineralization or ammonification of organic n nitrification and denitrification or adsorption by the bed materials or microbial assimilation 1 2 5 35 nitrification carried out by the autotrophs is a very slow process because the autotrophs are slow growers 1 5 the nitrification of nh4 n is an aerobic process thus the burrowing activity of the earthworms has a positive impact on the nitrification potential of the vermifilter fig 6 to ensure substantial nitrification inside the vermifilter requisite hrt and do have to be maintained inside the vermibed this indicates that the nitrification mostly takes place within the top few centimeters of the vermibed 11 at greater bed depth with the reduction in do availability anoxic condition prevails promoting higher denitrification if sufficient organic carbon source is available 45 77 in addition the mucus secreted by the earthworms contains various enzymes and microbes assisting the mineralization of the organic n which in turn enhances its bioavailability 44 furthermore the vermicasting rich in microbes also facilitates the nitrification of nh4 n when the domestic sewage comes in contact with the vermicasting 53 apart from the microbes and earthworms the bed materials by acting as an adsorption media also helps in removing the nutrients from the domestic wastewater generally the vermibed materials having negative surface charge exhibit the better adsorption potential for the positive charged nh4 n as compared to the negatively charged no3 n 78 dey chowdhury and bhunia 1 have investigated the potential of a macrophyte assisted vermifilter mavf to eradicate n from real domestic sewage employing canna indica macrophytes they reported that the hlr had a negative impact on the nitrification of nh4 n with 74 4 and 98 2 conversion of nh4 n at hlrs 7 and 3 m3 m2 d respectively it signifies that at low hlr the domestic sewage got sufficient interaction time with the microbes bed materials and earthworms triggering the nitrification of nh4 n they also found that the removal of the total n tn was the maximum 87 when sufficient organic carbon was available justifying denitrification as the principal n removal pathway in the vermifilter similar trend of the n transformation dynamics in the vermifilters was also reported by xing et al 66 in addition liu et al 64 and li et al 71 have also reported high nitrification potential of the vf technology table 1 it is clearly evident from the data amalgamated in table 1 that many researchers have obtained higher effluent no3 n concentration than its influent concentration during the course of vf of domestic sewage 60 61 as mentioned before the nitrification of nh4 n requires high hrt thus after nitrification the wastewater might not get the sufficient time for denitrification as a consequence the no3 n concentration was increased in the effluent 1 35 the mucus secreted by the earthworms is also rich in organic nitrogenous compounds enhancing the concentration of the organic n in the domestic sewage which initially got nitrified followed by the denitrification of the nitrified compounds 5 35 thus during vf of domestic sewage due to the insufficiency of interaction time the produced no3 n might not get denitrified thereby accumulating in the effluent apart from n phosphorus p is another nutrient causing concerns for the competent authority generally the removal of total p tp is mainly governed by adsorption a physical process 51 p predominantly gets adsorbed by the bed materials wang et al 67 have reported up to 80 3 82 3 removal of tp using the mixture of padding soil and rice straw volumetric ratio 4 4 as vermibed material table 1 few researchers have found that the effluent tp concentration was higher than its influent concentration 60 61 the activities of the earthworms have been found to liberate p from its bound form pilling up the tp concentration in the effluent 79 4 3 solid removal the solids present in the domestic wastewater can be predominantly classified into two types total suspended solids tsss and total dissolved solids tdss 7 as depicted in fig 5 the large tsss present in the domestic sewage get trapped onto the pores of the bed media and devoured by the earthworms into finer particles with enhanced specific surface area which in turn facilitates the adsorption of solids onto the bed materials 80 on the other hand the tdss get bypassed through the screening layer and subsequently absorbed by the suitable layer of the bed materials 2 in addition the biodegradable fraction of both the tsss adsorbed onto the pores of the bed materials and tdss get putrefied by the combined action of the earthworms and microbes 2 5 11 for instance adugna et al 55 investigated the potential of the vermifilters in removing tsss while treating the concentrated greywater they achieved a hopping tss removal up to 99 4 using sawdust as the bed material similarly liu et al 63 obtained the tss removal up to 94 81 during vf of rural domestic sewage using ceramsite as bed material table 1 the type of vermibed media employed also affects the solid removal performance of the vermifilters for instance kumar et al 52 have compared the potential of four different vermibed materials with respect to the solid removal from the synthetic domestic wastewater table 1 they found that the application of the riverbed materials as vermibed ensured the maximum removal of solids both tsss 75 and tdss 53 this could be due to the better adsorptive properties and higher specific surface area of the riverbed materials as well as the better activity of the earthworms inside the riverbed materials as compared to the wood coal glass balls and mud balls hlr is found to have negative impact on the solid removal performance of the vermifilters for instance xing et al 66 have varied the hlr from 2 4 to 6 7 m3 m2 d to evaluate the impact of hlr on the tss removal performance of the vermifilter during the treatment of real domestic sewage table 1 it has been observed that the removal of tss was the least 57 when the hlr was 6 7 m3 m2 d whereas the tss removal was the highest 77 when the hlr was maintained at 2 4 m3 m2 d this could be attributed to the fact that high hlr created turbulence inside the vermibed causing washing of solids which ultimately cut down the solid removal efficiency of the vermifilters 81 4 4 pathogen removal in order to meet the stringent disposal norms and reusability criteria the destruction of the water borne pathogens from the domestic wastewater has become a prime concern 2 as portrayed in fig 7 the removal of pathogens takes places in various ways during vf the mucus released by the earthworms possesses antibacterial and sticky properties owing to the antibacterial properties the foreign microbes non indigenous microbes present in the domestic wastewater get destroyed 82 again the stickiness of the mucus restricts the movement of the non indigenous pathogens thereby captivating the killing of the pathogens due to unavailability of substrate in their vicinity 83 some pathogens are also removed by the adhesive properties of the bed materials during filtration of domestic sewage 60 fig 7 for instance kumar et al 52 investigated the potential of four different bed materials in removing the pathogens from synthetic domestic sewage table 1 they found that the vermifilter with vermicompost and riverbed materials as the vermibed media ensured the maximum removal of total coliform tc log r 2 6 fecal coliform fc log r 2 22 fecal streptococci fs log r 1 26 and e coli log r 1 81 table 1 this difference could be attributed to the difference in earthworm activities inside the bed materials and also the difference in the adhesive properties and size of the pore openings of different bed materials similarly arora et al 53 also ensured substantial removal of tc log r 3 91 fc log r 3 82 and e coli 2 51 during the vf of domestic sewage furlong et al 72 have employed vf technology for treating human feces and achieved the log r of the thermotolerant coliforms as 3 in light of the above discussion it can be stated that the vf has become a promising alternative of the conventional treatment methods when it comes to the remediation of the wastewater generated from the domestic premises 5 sustainability of vf technology as mentioned earlier a particular technology can be labelled as a sustainable technology if it satisfies the following three broader aspects i e the technology has to be environmentally sustainable economically viable and socially acceptable 84 various other factors coming under the aforementioned broader aspects are portrayed in fig 8 from fig 8 it is clearly evident that the carrying capacity of the receiving ecosystem of a technology also has a monumental impact on its sustainability meanwhile the surrounding components involve water soil and air quality preservation of aquatic and land based ecosystems conservation of the non renewable resources and nutrient recovery 85 fig 8 the factors like initial investment operational and maintenance cost management of the solid residues and the economic value of the byproducts must be taken into account for evaluating the economic sustainability of the wastewater treatment technology under consideration 15 84 5 1 environmental sustainability of vf technology the environmental sustainability of the vf technology during the remediation of domestic sewage has been evaluated in reference with the factors depicted in fig 8 especially the lca as well as the lcia of the vf technology reported in the literature has been explored and compared with those of the asp cws als and wsps to strengthen the environmental feasibility of the vf technology 5 1 1 overview of the lca studies on vf technology in order to carry out the lca studies on the vf technology the researchers have adopted gate to gate approach to establish the system boundary 29 generally the gate to gate approach is popular for unit processes here the life cycle inventory lci includes the details of all the inputs and outputs throughout all the stages of its life cycle including the assessment of raw materials influent domestic sewage energy consumption treated effluent solid residues and gaseous emissions across the construction operation and dismantling phases of the vf technology fig 9 according to the literature two standardized functional units namely one population equivalent pe 1 86 and one cubic meter of influent wastewater 87 are available for performing the lca of the various processes a system boundary considering the gate to gate approach for carrying out the lca of the vf technology has been represented in fig 9 mainly the environmental sustainability of the vf technology treating the domestic sewage has been evaluated with reference to the criteria portrayed in fig 8 through the exploration of the lca and lcia studies on the vf technology available in the literature 5 1 1 1 conservation of the fossil fuels abello passteni 28 has made an approach to investigate the consumption of natural non renewable resources especially the fossil fuels including coal and diesel during the treatment of domestic wastewater employing asp vf and als in chile he has considered 1 kg of bod5 removed as the functional unit it has been observed that the consumption of fossil fuels varied between 0 0001 and 0 03 kg kg of bod5 removed for als and the same for the asp was 0 0001 0 04 kg kg of bod5 removed whereas the vf technology did not consume any fossil fuel across all the stages of its life cycle as already discussed in vf technology unlike asp and als the burrowing activity of the earthworms keeps the system naturally aerobic eliminating the requirement of external energy for mechanical aeration if pumping of wastewater is not required i e the gravitational flow of wastewater is allowed through the vermifilter no external energy is required during the vf process cutting down the requirement of fossil fuels 31 since in this study the major part of the total energy consumed by different technologies including als and asp was supplied utilizing the non conventional and renewable sources like hydroelectricity solar energy and wind energy the requirement of the fossil fuels was comparatively less in both the aforementioned processes however in one of the wwtps where asp has been employed as the secondary treatment step up to 57 6 of the total energy was supplied using diesel as fuel another group of researches lourenco and nunes 29 have also performed the lca of two commonly used decentralized wastewater treatment alternatives such as cws and vf while treating the domestic sewage in southern europe and compared the results with those of the asp they have considered one pe as the functional unit it has been found that the total fossil fuel consumption during the construction phase was 0 638 kg pe for asp whereas zero consumption of fossil fuel was reported in construction phase when asp was replaced with vf technology the electricity consumption during the operational phase was up to 1 16 106 mj pe for asp whereas when asp was replaced with vf technology it was reduced to 4520 mj pe the same for the cws was 3940 mj pe here the electricity during the operational phase was generated from the fossil fuels especially diesel singh et al 88 inspected that the energy consumption for treating 1 mld municipal wastewater was 65 7 mj year for asp such a high energy consumption during the operational phase of the asp was mostly attributed to the electricity consumed by the mechanical aerators for external aeration they also found that the energy consumption for treating 1 mld municipal wastewater for the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasbr was 43 8 mj year this could be due to the maintenance of the wastewater flow in upward direction at a particular velocity 7 meanwhile the requisite energy has been supplied by burning the fossil fuels reflecting the depletion of the fossil fuels in light of the above discussion it can be stated that the vf technology negotiates the consumption of fossil fuels a non renewable source of energy thereby promoting the conservation of natural non renewable resources 5 1 1 2 ghg emissions emission of ghgs is another factor governing the environmental sustainability of the vf technology treating the domestic sewage mainly the emissions during the operational phase have been taken into consideration mostly the vermifilters have not been reported to release ghgs while remediating the domestic sewage this could be because the gaseous emission only co2 due to complete aerobic degradation of the organics during the vf of domestic sewage was so nominal that it could be neglected 5 11 as mentioned earlier the burrowing activity of the earthworms results in the abundance of do inside the vermibed 1 being a low strength wastewater complete aerobic degradation of the organics present in the domestic sewage takes place with the help of natural aeration reducing the production of methane ch4 in fact luth et al 76 have stated that the vermifilters act as the sink for ch4 aditionally owing to the low strength of the domestic sewage the generation of the co2 is also less at the same time attributing to the natural aeration the engagement of external aerators has also been eliminated cutting down the need for burning the fossil fuels for keeping the aerators running it further eliminates the emission of the ghgs which in turn lessens the environmental cost of the vf process 89 in addition owing to the abundance of do complete nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n takes place which subsequently gets denitrified to nitrogen gas n2 eliminating the emission of nitrous oxide n2o another potential ghg generally from the vf of the low strength wastewater such as domestic wastewater co2 is released as the major atmospheric emission according to ipcc 90 the global warming potential gwp of co2 ch4 and n2o are 1 25 and 298 respectively however the gwp of co2 is not considered as it is considered to be biogenic in origin 91 ch4 and n2o are considered to be the major threats to the air quality on the other hand singh et al 88 have investigated the emission of ghgs from various municipal wwtps across india they observed that the wwtps employing anaerobic deep lagoons wsps uasbr and asp with the capacities 321 279 2326 and 979 mld respectively have recorded the ghg emissions up to 118 700 31 858 1 317 375 and 71 696 t co2 eq year respectively highlighting the poor environmental sustainability of the wwtps these emissions included the emission during the treatment of municipal wastewater as well as the emission due to the burning of fossil fuels for generating electricity daelman et al 18 found that out of the total ch4 production in the wwtps 80 ch4 has been produced during asp similarly campos et al 20 have reported that up to 90 of the total n2o emissions from the wwtps has been released during asp on the other hand johansson et al 92 and mander et al 93 investigated the ghg emission potential of the cws and reported that the emission of ch4 was up to 1 8 mg m2 h for free water surface cws fws cws and 6 4 mg m2 h for horizontal subsurface flow cws hssf cws whereas the n2o emission was ranging between 0 031 mg m2 h for fws cws and 0 42 mg m2 h for hssf cws another group of researchers hernandez paniagua et al 94 have made an effort to quantify the amount of ghgs emitted from the wsps they mentioned that the wsps have resulted in the production of ch4 up to 25 mg m2 h unlike domestic sewage if the vermifilters are fed to the high strength wastewaters such as industrial wastewaters substantial amount of ghgs can also be released from the vf process for instance luth et al 76 have stated that the emission of co2 ch4 and n2o was up to 4 4 mg d 2 8 20 3 g d and 2 438 mg d respectively during the vf of pig slurry from the above discussion it is clearly evident that the vf technology promotes the environmental sustainability by protecting the air quality especially while treating the domestic sewage more detailed understanding on the environmental sustainability of the vf technology can be achieved during the lcia of the vf technology 5 1 1 3 generation of organic fertilizer as already mentioned during vf of wastewater the earthworms consume all the produced sludge and excrete in the form of vermicasting 5 11 hence as the solid residue the vermicastings are produced during the course of vf of domestic sewage fig 9 liu et al 64 have carried out the vf of the rural domestic sewage in china for a duration of 17 months they have found a minimal sludge production of 0 08 kg ss kg of cod removed the produced sludge was mostly vermicastings such negligible sludge production could be attributed to the activities of the earthworms inside the vermifilter 64 in fact singh et al 5 have mentioned that there was no sludge production during the vf of domestic wastewater except the vermicastings hence the vf technology can also be termed as the zero waste technology or green technology 32 89 the produced vermicasting is highly nutritive in nature containing 1 16 n 1 22 p and 1 34 potassium k 69 the microbes and enzymes present in the mucus enhance the bioavailability of the nutrients present in the vermicasting thereby making them liable for the plant uptake 31 on the other hand the production of sewage sludge was found to be proportional to the volume of wastewater treated by asp generally 70 100 g sewage sludge is generated while treating 1 m3 domestic sewage using asp 95 the conventional stps are reported to produce the excess sludge up to 0 32 0 08 kg tss kg cod removed 96 in other way it was 0 25 0 06 kg vss kg cod removed even though the sewage sludge produced from the wwtps is rich in nutrients 45 49 g n kg municipal sewage sludge 22 30 g p kg municipal sewage sludge and 1 2 1 6 g k kg municipal sewage sludge the presence of pathogens and heavy metals prohibits its land application as fertilizer 32 97 98 a prior treatment to the raw sewage sludge should be given before applying it as fertilizer or for the safe disposal of the sewage sludge in the midst of the environment landfilling of sewage sludge is reported to liberate the highest quantity of ghgs 296 9 kg co2 eq t sludge followed by monoincineration 232 kg co2 eq t sludge and carbonization 141 kg co2 eq t sludge even the composting of sewage sludge obtained from the conventional wwtps has been reported to make substantial release of the ghgs 99 100 in contrary since vf ensures high pathogen removal from the domestic sewage once the vf process is over the vermicasting layer can be scrapped from the top of the vermibed and directly applied to the agricultural field as fertilizer without any further treatment 52 53 the nutrients present in the vermicasting are readily available to the crops and plants triggering the nutrient recycling potential of the vf process from the domestic sewage hence it can be concluded that unlike the conventional wastewater treatment methods the vf technology helps to maintain the nutrient cycle in the environment without imposing any threat to the environment especially while treating the domestic sewage 5 1 2 overview of the lcia studies on vf technology in order to gather more detailed knowledge regarding the environmental sustainability of a particular technology the researchers have to rely on the lcia of that technology rather than its lca 29 however very few studies are available on the lcia of the vf technology while treating the domestic wastewater 28 29 in order to carry out the lcia of vf technology the following impact categories have been decided by lourenco and nunes 29 in accordance with corominas et al 101 and jeppsson and hellstrom 102 abiotic depletion ad kg sb eq acidification ac kg so2 eq eutrophication eut kg po4 3 eq global warming potential gwp kg co2 eq freshwater ecotoxicity fwt kg 1 4 db eq marine aquatic ecotoxicity maet kg 1 4 db eq human toxicity ht g 1 4 db eq ozone layer depletion old kg cfc 11 eq terrestrial ecotoxicity te kg 1 4 db eq and photochemical oxidation po kg c2h4 eq on the other hand abello passteni 28 has considered climate change cc or gwp kg co2 eq kg bod5 removed eut kg p eq kg bod5 removed fwt kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed and ht kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed as the environmental impact categories for determining the ecoefficiency of vf als and asp while treating domestic wastewater in chile among all the impact categories the ecoefficiency indicators have been evaluated for cc or gwp and eut for being frequently used in ecoefficiency works 28 basically the ecoefficiency indicators can be calculated using the following relationship eq 1 given in iso 14045 103 1 ecoefficiency indicator value functi o n environmental impact the higher the value of the ecoefficiency indicators the better will be the sustainability of the corresponding technology abello passteni 28 has taken the treated volume of wastewater m3 by each technology as the value function even though he has specified four different impact categories the ecoefficiency of the aforementioned technologies has been evaluated with respect to cc and eut he reported that the vf technology was the most eco efficient technology in terms of both cc and eut portraying the highest indicator values the cc indicator value for the vf technology was found to be 6 7 m3 kg co2 eq kg bod5 removed whereas the same for asp and als were 3 8 and 3 4 m3 kg co2 eq kg bod5 removed respectively indicating the als to be the least eco efficient technology similarly the eut indicator value for the vf technology was 10 984 1 m3 kg p eq kg bod5 removed followed by asp 10 518 5 m3 kg p eq kg bod5 removed and als 5876m3 kg p eq kg bod5 removed thus it can be stated that the als and vf had the maximum and the minimum environmental impact respectively the order of fwt kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed and ht kg 1 4 db eq kg bod5 removed caused by the aforementioned technologies were vf asp als and vf asp als respectively signifying the vf and als as the best and the worst technologies respectively with respect to the environmental sustainability another group of researchers lourenco and nunes 29 have tried to determine the environmental sustainability of vf small rate infiltration sri cws and asp by exploring their lcia throughout the construction operation and dismantling phase while treating the domestic sewage coming from the small communities in southern europe they found that the gwps of cws and asp were 1930 and 264 kg co2 eq respectively whereas the gwps were reduced to 135 and 183 kg co2 eq when the above technologies were replaced with vf technology respectively the implementation of vf technology also lessened the ac and eut impacts as compared to sri cws and asp the application of asp has shown the ac impact value up to 6 36 kg so2 eq whereas it was substantially reduced to 1 07 kg so2 eq when asp was replaced with the vf technology similarly the implication of sri cws and asp has yielded the eut impact values up to 13 1 26 1 and 20 7 kg po4 3 eq respectively these values were significantly reduced to 8 96 8 97 and 7 51 when all the above mentioned technologies were substituted by vf technology respectively this could be due to the lower emission of the nutrients due to the implementation of the vf technology in addition the vermifilters were also observed to significantly negotiate the fwt ht old and po as compared to the cws sri and asp 29 in light of the above discussion it can be justified that the vf technology is the most environmentally benevolent alternative for treating the domestic sewage 5 1 3 preservation of water quality and aquatic ecosystem as we already know if the domestic sewage is directly discharged to the water bodies without any treatment it will deteriorate the water quality apart from the conventional water quality parameters e g cod bod nh4 n tn etc the domestic wastewater also embraces pathogens heavy metals and emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants etc in significant concentration 4 5 the presence of such pollutants in the water bodies will not only degrade the water quality but also result in the outbreak of various water borne diseases and destroy the aquatic ecosystem 2 3 31 as already discussed vf has the ability to remove pathogens from the domestic wastewater 42 52 not only this the earthworms also have the ability to uptake the heavy metals 31 and ecs 4 104 from the wastewater being an aerobic process the vermifiltered effluent contains significant do 5 over the last few years the vf technology has become a promising alternative for remediating the domestic sewage especially with respect to organic and nutrient removal 1 4 5 11 according to arora et al 53 and singh et al 2 the domestic wastewater after being subjected to vf meets the stringent discharge limits to the surface water in addition arora et al 53 and kumar et al 52 concluded that the effluent coming from the vf unit has met the who guidelines regarding the pathogen counts as a consequence of the abovementioned reasons the disposal of the treated effluent from the vf of domestic sewage does not captivate any difficulties in the survival of the aquatic lives hence it can be concluded that the vf technology helps preserving the water quality and maintaining the balance of the aquatic ecosystem 5 1 4 preservation of soil quality and land based ecosystem since the domestic wastewater contains heavy metals and ecs the sewage sludge produced as a byproduct of treating the domestic sewage in the wwtps also contains a fraction of the aforementioned pollutants 4 thus even though the sewage sludge produced from the asp is enriched in nutrients its direct application for the land improvement may result in the death of the soil borne microbes thereby hampering the land based ecosystems 97 98 hence the raw sewage sludge should be stabilized or treated before its application to the soil however the sludge treatment imposes negative impact to the environment due to the emission of the ghgs 99 100 for instance daelman et al 18 have found that up to 72 of the total ch4 production in the wwtps came from the sludge treatment unit whereas up to 10 of the total n2o production in the wwtps has been contributed by the sludge treatment unit in contrary in vf the earthworms act as the sludge digester by softening the ingested sludge using the grume excreted in the mouth of the earthworms in addition the sludge is further neutralized by the calcium ca inside the esophagus then in the earthworm s intestine the neutralized sludge has been decomposed by the enzymes finally this stabilized sludge is excreted at the top of the vermibed as vermicasting by the earthworms 105 the vermicasting itself or after being converted to vermicompost acts as a nutritive plant food and improves the soil fertility on its land application 69 the nutrients present in the vermicasting are readily available to the crops strengthening its acceptability as bio fertilizer in addition the microbes and enzymes released with the vermicasting are soil friendly in nature thereby helping in improving the soil quality in fact unlike the chemical fertilizers the land application of the vermicasting or vermicompost does not impose any threats to the soil borne organisms 5 being a chemical free organic manure vermicompost on its land application does not create any chemical toxicity on the soil based organisms 89 hence it can be concluded that the vermicasting as well as the vermicompost can be extensively employed as the organic manure in agriculture and horticulture for improving the soil fertility through the preservation of land based ecosystem 5 1 5 preservation of air quality from the lca and lcia of the vf technology demonstrated earlier it is clearly evident that the vf technology can potentially cut down the risk of ghg emissions and thereby minimizing the gwp to a great extent 28 29 as a concluding remark it can be stated that unlike the conventional such as asp and other non conventional wastewater treatment methods such as cws als and wsps the vf technology possesses zero to trivial deterioration of air quality during the course of remediating the domestic sewage thereby promoting the preservation of air quality 5 1 6 reusability of treated effluent the reusability of any treated effluent depends on its contamination level the concentration levels of do organics bod and cod pathogens nh4 n and no3 n in the effluent have been considered as the major indicators governing the reusability potential of the treated effluent 2 the effluent obtained from the vf of domestic sewage is almost crystal clear odor free detoxified rich in do and has neutral ph 5 thus the effluent can be beneficially used for various non potable purposes such as floor washing toilet flushing making cooling towers in the industries etc 31 in addition the effluent is also rich in nutrients making it suitable to be used for the irrigation purposes 89 106 kumar et al 60 have reported that the vermifiltered effluent can be potentially used for the irrigation and agricultural practices similar conclusion has also been made by manyuchi et al 74 table 2 represents the surface water discharge standards of various pollutants for the municipal wwtps the standards for the irrigation water quality and the reusability potential of the vermifiltered effluent the data obtained from the various literature compiled in table 2 suggests that the domestic sewage after being subjected to vf satisfies the surface water discharge criteria and standards for its application as irrigation water liu et al 63 have employed ceramsite vermifilter for treating domestic wastewater they found that the treated effluent portrayed the cod 51 mg l bod 10 6 mg l and tss 4 1 mg l concentration well below the permissible values furnished in table 2 the effluent had neutral ph and was devoid of pathogens strengthening its acceptability as irrigation water similarly kumar et al 60 also observed the effluent cod and no3 n concentrations were 24 30 and 45 mg l respectively favoring its agricultural application again kumar et al 52 and arora et al 53 concluded that the pathogen concentration 480 and 457 mpn 100 ml respectively in the vermifiltered effluent was below the permissible range mentioned by who table 2 from the above discussion it can be concluded that the vermifiltered domestic sewage displays the potential to be reused in gardening toilet flushing floor washing horticulture and agricultural practices and fruits and vegetable farms 5 2 economic affordability the global acceptability of any technology depends on its economic feasibility in order to evaluate the sustainability of vf technology its economic affordability has to be examined based upon the data available on capital cost operation and maintenance cost treatment efficiency and residual management of the vf technology while treating the domestic sewage fig 8 the concept of circular bioeconomy has also been explored to reinforce the economic viability of the vf technology 5 2 1 capital cost capital cost of a technology includes the costs of land acquisition raw materials energy consumed during its construction phase transportation of raw materials to the treatment site and installation of various equipment from the life cycle inventory lci proposed by lourenco and nunes 29 it has been observed that the land area required for sri cws and asp were 2000 594 and 95 m2 respectively for treating the domestic sewage coming from the small communities with population 120 120 and 500 respectively when the aforementioned processes were replaced with vf technology the land area requirements were astonishingly reduced to 12 5 12 5 and 50 m2 respectively sinha et al 31 inspected that the provision of 1 2 h hrt was sufficient to achieve substantial removal of organics and solids from the raw municipal sewage using the vf process table 1 cutting down the requirement of large footprint on the other hand the hrt to be maintained for wsps especially for facultative ponds varies between 5 and 30 days involving a larger footprint 7 according to taylor et al 108 the construction costs of the vertical subsurface flow cws vssf cws and fws cws were 0 20 user m2 i e 16 80 rupees user m2 and 0 29 user m2 i e 24 40 rupees user m2 respectively the construction cost of the wsps was very high as compared to the cws and vf the higher surface area requirement 2 7 m2 triggers construction cost of the wsps generally up to 60 of the total investment is accounted for the cost of land mara 109 reported that the construction cost of wsps varied from 105 user i e approximately 8826 30 rupees user in france to 343 user approximately 28 832 60 rupees user in germany in contrary the land area requirement for vf has been reported to be 0 25 0 06 0 21 and 0 5 0 6 m2 user in france 110 china 111 and india 112 respectively which reduced the cost of land acquisition leading to the reduction in the capital cost of the vf process coming to the raw material requirement the bed materials used in the vf process such as peat and wood flour 113 sawdust and vermicompost 62 woodchips gravel and quartz sand 55 77 riverbed materials mud balls and glass balls 60 sand and vermicompost 1 ceramsite and coal 114 etc are locally available at very low cost and mostly obtained as the waste from the other activities since the packing materials are available in abundance the acquisition of raw materials involves zero to minimal cost 29 apart from the bed materials the vermifilters have to be incorporated with the earthworms fig 9 sinha et al 31 reported that the cost of 500 earthworms was approximately 20 a approximately 1126 40 rupees the cost of earthworms is considered as the one time investment because once the vf process is over the earthworms can be taken out from the exhausted vermibed and employed in new vermifilters or sold to various farms as feedstock thereby promoting the circular bioeconomy which in turn cuts down the cost of the vf technology 89 unlike the conventional methods owing to the decentralized treatment facilities and less area requirement the vf technology can also be implemented in the vicinity of the domestic wastewater source in fact it can be applied for individual households as well as for the small communities thereby reducing the cost of transportation of the wastewater from source to the treatment site 5 lourenco and nunes 29 found that the raw materials to be used in asp has been travelled for 26 km pe involving and additional cost of 104 pe approximately 8742 24 rupees such expenses are not associated with the vf process apart from this the vf technology does not necessitate the installation of the heavy duty instruments which makes the vf technology a cost effective alternative singh et al 2008 according to usepa the cost of construction of the centralized stps in the rural area was up to 2 321 840 3 750 530 approximately 176 76 285 56 million rupees unlike the conventional treatment methods vermifilters are easy to construct and do not involve any external energy consumption except during the earthwork excavators may be used throughout the construction phase 29 since they are easy to build skilled manpower is not required to construct the vermifilters cutting down the capital cost of the vf technology generally in case of the conventional treatment plants the installation of various heavy duty equipment includes high energy consumption and to construct the wwtps skilled manpower is required triggering the capital cost of the wwtps 11 sharma et al 84 have compared the capital costs of the various onsite domestic wastewater treatment systems they have found that the capital costs of the septic tank with percolation area membrane bioreactor mbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr sequential batch reactor sbr and cws were 1132 1800 2000 1500 620 900 and 1800 user respectively in indian currency the values are 95 156 151 308 168 120 126 090 52 117 20 75 654 and 151 308 rupees user respectively whereas sinha et al 112 have inspected that the capital cost of vf was only 100 150 user i e 8406 12 609 rupees user indicating the cost effectiveness of the vf technology 5 2 2 operational and maintenance cost the operational and maintenance cost of any technology involve the costs regarding the consumed energy during operational phase bed material renewal especially for vf replacing or repairing the equipment or parts engagement of the skilled manpower sludge management and chemical requirements in addition the longevity of the process also affects the cost of the process as previously mentioned lourenco and nunes 29 have performed a lca study on the vf technology and compared its sustainability with conventional asp during the treatment of domestic sewage they reported that during operational phase including electricity consumption for lights pumping the domestic sewage recirculating the effluent and mechanical aeration the total energy consumed in asp was 1 16 106 mj pe whereas in case of vf the consumption of energy was only during the pumping of wastewater in the operational phase the natural aeration due to the earthworm s burrowing activity eliminated the requirement of external aerators making the vf technology energy efficient 1 11 thus when asp was replaced by the vf technology the electricity consumption was drastically reduced to 4520 mj pe lessening the operational cost of the vf process similarly abello passteni 28 also compared the sustainability of vf technology with that of the als and asp he has reported that the requisite electric powers for als and asp were up to 5 5 and 3 0 kwh kg bod5 removed whereas for vf it was only up to 1 7 kwh kg bod5 removed since the operation of vf is very simple and it does not require any heavy duty instrument it does not demand any skilled manpower in contrary the conventional wwtps employing asp as the secondary treatment step require skilled manpower increasing the operational cost of the process thus attributing to the same reason the vf technology does not bear the expenses related to the repairing and replacement of any instrument or its parts negotiating the maintenance cost of the vf process 5 the production of sewage sludge is a compulsory consequence of treating the wastewater the conventional wwtps especially employing asp as the biological treatment facility have been reported to produce humongous quantity of sludge which needs further treatment before its land application or disposal 5 the provision of the sludge treatment facilities acquires a major portion of the total cost of treating the wastewater for example wei et al 115 have carried out a brief cost analysis of windrow composting of activated sludge obtained from the small and mid scale urban wwtps in china they observed that the total cost of windrow composting of the activated sludge was up to 349 000 approximately 26 61 million rupees similarly ghazy et al 116 have reported that the cost of the windrow composting facility in egypt handling 1 65 t sewage sludge day ranged between 74 000 5 64 million rupees and 79 104 60 24 million rupees per ton of the dry sewage sludge per day on the other hand the cost of construction of the engineered landfill was reported to be 65 4956 25 rupees per ton of sewage sludge in australia in contrary the produced sludge also known as vermicasting has already been stabilized inside the earthworm s body and can be directly used as fertilizer without any further treatment 31 the vermicasting can be easily scrapped from the top of the vermibed and can be replaced with the fresh bed materials 35 being a self driven self improved and self powered zero waste technology the vf process possesses high longevity the vf process has been reported to last up to 3 4 months or even 7 8 months without any difficulties especially while treating the low strength domestic sewage 5 owing to this everlasting nature the cost of the vf technology gets reduced apart from all the above mentioned factors the external chemical requirements also govern the operational cost of a technology abello passteni 28 investigated the external chemical requirements during the treatment of domestic wastewater in chile using als asp and vf he observed that to remove 1 kg bod5 als necessitated 0 9 kg sodium hypochlorite 0 1 kg chlorine 1 1 kg ferric chloride and 0 02 kg polymer whereas the same for the asp were 0 2 0 04 0 1 and 0 01 kg kg bod5 removed respectively on the other hand the vf necessitated only 0 1 kg sodium hypochlorite kg bod5 removed for disinfecting the effluent cutting down the cost of the process on the other hand in conventional nitrification and denitrification just before the denitrification unit the organic carbon sources such as methanol has been added externally to facilitate the growth of heterotrophs enhancing the cost of the process 7 in contrary during vf the nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously inside the vermifilter without any external addition of the chemicals making the vf technology economically affordable 5 machado et al 117 have reported that the operational cost of the cws varied between 0 17 and 0 28 m2 year 14 4 23 7 rupees m2 year for fws cws to 0 21 0 34 m2 year 17 8 28 8 rupees m2 year for vssf cws on the other hand mara 109 observed that the operational cost of wsps was up to 4 user year 338 40 rupees user year in france again sharma et al 84 have made an effort to compare the economic feasibility of various onsite domestic sewage treatment facilities they reported that the operational costs of the septic tank with percolation area mbr mbbr sbr and cws were 14 50 70 20 30 4 7 and 175 user year respectively in indian currency these values are 1184 40 4230 5922 1692 2538 338 40 592 20 and 14 805 rupees user year respectively in contrary the operational cost of the vf technology was reported to be only 0 05 m3 year i e 4 23 rupees m3 year subjected to further decrease with the increase in the number of users 112 118 5 2 3 treatment efficiency the treatment efficacy of a particular wastewater treatment technology also determines its economic feasibility in other words it needs to be worthy investing on a particular technology in terms of its treatment efficiency i e the performance of a specific wastewater treatment technology needs to be considered before investing the money on it the treatment efficiency of a wastewater treatment technology depends on the type of wastewater it is supposed to treat 7 as already discussed and portrayed in table 1 it is clearly evident that the vf technology has the potential to substantially remove various pollutants including organics nutrients and pathogens from the domestic wastewater arora et al 53 and kumar et al 52 have concluded that the effluent coming out from the vf of domestic sewage satisfied the stringent surface water discharge standards in terms of pathogens and could be efficiently reutilized for various non potable purposes hence it can be rightly stated that the vf technology has shown enough promise to be potentially implemented for remediating the domestic sewage 5 2 4 production of value added byproducts and linkage to circular bioeconomy apart from the trivial ghg emission the following byproducts are obtained during the vf of domestic sewage treated effluent as the liquid output and the vermicastings as the solid residue in addition once the vf process is over the earthworms can also be taken out from the vermibed 3 chowdhury et al 32 have mentioned that the doubling time of the earthworms is approximately two months as a result the number of earthworms obtained after the process is over will be more than the number of earthworms incorporated at the beginning of the vf process owing to the nutritional value the vermicasting itself or after being converted to the vermicompost can be potentially employed as the organic manure to improve the fertility of the soil 1 32 the vermicompost is reported to have the ability to replace the conventional chemical fertilizers in the global market 89 moreover a huge monetary investment is required to develop the infrastructure to produce the chemical fertilizers which in turn increases the cost of the food production 32 in addition the crops produced by utilizing the chemical fertilizers also get contaminated by the toxic chemicals which subsequently affects the human beings adversely after the consumption of the food on the other hand the cost of producing the vermicasting and vermicompost is trivial due to the abundant availability of the raw materials including domestic wastewater according to the report of the status of sewage treatment plants 2021 published by cpcb the generation of domestic sewage from the class i cities and class ii towns was approximately 29 129 mld as per 2001 census 8 thus the application of the vermicompost as organic manure helps in lessening the cost of food production according to sinha et al 89 a significant drop in the cost of food production up to 60 70 has been noticed by replacing the chemical fertilizers with the vermicompost the produced food will be safe and chemical free sinha et al 89 inspected that the risk of occurrence of any disease on consuming the foods has been reduced by 75 due to the application of vermicompost as organic manure sinha et al 119 have found that the application of vermicompost helps in reducing the harvesting time of the crops this has helped the farmers to gain more profit by cultivating more crops in a single year using the same plot in addition the vermicompost is reported to have the capability to hold the soil moisture for longer duration cutting down the water demand by 30 40 120 in fact vermicompost also helps in obtaining better growth and higher yield of the crops 106 webster 121 found that the application of vermicompost enhanced the grapes production by 23 than that using the chemical fertilizers in light of the above discussion it is clearly evident that the vermicastings and vermicompost can be a potential replacement of the chemical fertilizers across the globe devkota et al 122 found that the production cost of vermicompost was 15 68 rupees kg whereas it has been sold to the market at 25 rupees kg as the biofertilizer obtaining a net profit of 9 32 rupees kg of vermicompost which in turn lessened the cost of vf process similarly the effluent obtained from the vf of domestic sewage embraces nutrients in high concentrations thereby satisfying the criteria to be utilized in irrigation and agricultural practices 74 hence it also adds positive economic value to the vf process the presence of earthworms adds 100 1000 times more value than the conventional processes 123 the obtained earthworms can be again reutilized in other vermifilters the earthworms can also be sold to the farmers or to the various farms such as poultry dairy and fishery farms as feedstocks since the earthworms are rich in protein content 65 of the total wight of the earthworms 89 in australia the cost of 500 earthworms is approximately 20 a 1126 40 rupees 31 whereas devkota et al 122 have found that the cost of production of one earthworm was only 0 40 rupees in recent few years vermiculture has become one of the fastest growing industries hati 124 found that the villagers in rural areas were gaining a yearly profit of 5 6 lakh rupees by selling the earthworms and vermicompost hence the earthworms also indirectly help in reducing the cost of vf process few examples of the commercial business models established proposed worldwide regarding the production and trading of the earthworms and vermicompost have been portrayed in table 3 in reference to the above discussion it can be concluded that the vf technology helps in converting the wastewater coming from the households communities agricultural fields and various farms into highly nutritive vermicastings the vermicastings after being converted to vermicompost can be utilized in the agricultural fields and subsequently the wastewater coming from the agricultural field through municipal sewer systems can be subjected to the vf process thereby completing a cycle fig 10 moreover the treated effluent can be employed for the agricultural and horticultural purposes thereby imparting a positive economic value the earthworms employed in the vf can also be taken out once the process is over and sold to various farms as feedstock in fact the same earthworms can also be incorporated into a new vermifilter thereby completing a circle of economy hence the vf technology converts the domestic wastewater with negative economic worth into highly nutritive effluent vermicastings and vermicompost having positive economic values using the earthworms i e biological agent thereby reinforcing the concept of circular bioeconomy fig 10 5 3 social acceptability in addition to the environmental sustainability and economic affordability the vf technology needs to be socially acceptable for its consideration as the sustainable wastewater remediation technology the social acceptability of a particular wastewater treatment technology depends on the following factors protection of public health pubic involvement and community development i e the growth of local socio economy and aesthetics 15 84 fig 8 5 3 1 protection of public health since the vf technology has the potential to substantially eradicate various pollutants including organics nutrients and pathogens from the domestic sewage the outbreak of the water borne diseases has been drastically reduced reducing the risk of human toxicity 53 82 in fact kumar et al 52 and arora et al 53 have reported that the vf process can successfully eliminate the fcs from the domestic sewage and the treated effluent has satisfied the surface water discharge standards regarding the pathogen count in addition kumar et al 60 have postulated that the no3 n concentration in the effluent obtained from the vf of domestic sewage was 45 mg l thus the discharge of the vermifiltered effluent to the surface water bodies would not cause the blue baby syndrome 2 in addition as already discussed being an organic fertilizer the application of vermicastings and vermicompost results in the production of safe and chemical free food cutting down the risk of hazardous impact on the human beings due to the consumption of foods sinha et al 89 have reported a drastic fall up to 75 in the risk of occurrence of such diseases when the chemical fertilizers were replaced with the vermicompost generally the effluent obtained from the domestic wastewater has been advised to utilize for non potable purposes 31 however in rural areas the people may use the surface water which may accommodate the discharge from the vermifilter for drinking purpose moreover the human beings share the same food chain with the fishes 3 since the vf technology is capable of reducing the concentration levels of the contaminants below the permissible limits it can be stated the implication of vf technology cuts down the risk of human toxicity to a great extent thereby promoting the protection of public health 5 3 2 growth of local socio economy being an environmentally sound and decentralized wastewater remediation technology vf can be effectively employed to remediate the domestic sewage generated from the individual households or small communities 5 owing to the ease of construction and operation of vf the common people of the communities can take the decisions and actions by themselves reflecting local values through a public process in which the common people have the sense of ownership over the decision making i e the common people can decide how to construct and use the system for their economic growth in other words vf ensures the public involvement which is not possible in case of the conventional wastewater treatment methods 15 as already discussed the vf of domestic sewage results in the production of various value added byproducts such as vermicastings vermicompost treated effluent and earthworms fig 10 the vermicompost can be sold to the market as fertilizer devkota et al 122 reported that the vermicompost has been sold to the market at a rate of 25 rupees kg with a net profit of 9 32 rupees kg in addition as already mentioned the earthworms can also be sold to various farms as feedstock sinha et al 31 observed that the price of 500 earthworms was approximately 20 a approximately 1126 40 rupees hence vf process also helps in boosting up the economy which makes the local people in rural areas attracted towards the vf process since it is a decentralized method all the members of the community can equally take the benefits of the vf facility moreover the treated effluent can be used for various non potable purposes by the beneficiaries it also promotes social resiliency and stability through the wise use of the resources thus due to the implementation of the vf technology for treating the domestic sewage all the members of the community will be able to prosper to their highest potential through appropriate natural resource based development in other words the vf technology as a whole helps in the community development 15 hence through the public involvement and community development the vf technology ensures the growth of local socio economy 5 3 3 aesthetics another parameter that plays a pivotal role in determining the social acceptability of a wastewater treatment technology is the maintenance of the aesthetic assets 15 84 as we already know the burrowing activity of the earthworms makes the vf process naturally aerobic being an aerobic method vf process does not produce any pungent smell basically by tunneling action the earthworms inhibit the action of the anaerobic microorganisms releasing mercaptans and hydrogen sulphide 31 hence the vf technology does not cause any nuisance to the surrounding people thereby maintaining the social aesthetics being a decentralized method vf technology can also be employed in small scale communities or individual households and it does not occupy large space in addition unlike the conventional aerobic wastewater treatment methods vf process does not produce any sludge promoting the conservation of social aesthetic values the effluent coming out from the vf of domestic sewage is crystal clear and rich in do 1 31 thus its disposal to the surface water bodies does not cause any color change of the water apart from this the disposal of the vermifiltered effluent does not result in the formation of algal bloom inside the surface water bodies 2 60 furthermore as discussed earlier vf helps in maintaining the balance of the aquatic as well as the soil based ecosystems 2 53 thereby strengthening the concept of preserving the aesthetic assets in light of the above discussions it can be concluded that the vf technology has satisfied almost all the criteria to be regarded as the sustainable treatment alternative for treating the domestic sewage especially in rural and urban communities of both the developing and developed countries the provision of the centralized wwtps may not be fruitful in near future as the sustainable wastewater treatment facility owing to the accrescent need for the clean water hence the need of this hour is to treat particularly the domestic sewage coming from the single households and small communities in decentralized manner employing the vf technology thereby ensuring the reduction of the burden of the organic loads on the conventional wwtps in view of the analyses made throughout the review work the advantages of implementing the vf technology over the conventional wastewater treatment methods especially for treating the domestic sewage have been schematically portrayed in fig 11 6 future perspectives even though the vf technology has been extensively employed in remediating the domestic sewage the researchers have faced few challenges especially during the field scale implementation of the vf technology which need further attention the earthworms cannot sustain higher hlrs and are unable to survive in water logged condition for longer duration which restrict the scaling up of the vf technology this issue needs special attention of the researchers the earthworms are very sensitive to the seasonal variations during summer the earthworm s skin gets dried up restricting the movement of the earthworms which in turn ceases the activities of the earthworms in monsoon the earthworms may get injured by the direct impact of the rain drops reducing the efficacy of the vf technology similarly in winter the activity of the earthworms gets drastically reduced this is a serious issue and needs to be encountered for the successful implementation of the vf technology in field scale applications to ensure substantial removal of the nutrients from the wastewater sufficient contact time has to be provided which engages large footprint negotiating the scaling up of the vf technology especially where the space is limited this has to addressed to further reinforce the sustainability of the vf technology over the last few years an awareness has been observed among the researchers to adopt various strategies and techniques to further improve the performance of the vf technology various researchers have provided a thermal insulation layer elasticity plastic filler layer at the vermibed surface to protect the earthworms from the external freezing 113 125 some researchers have incorporated the macrophytes to protect the earthworms from the direct impact of the rain and extreme heat of the sun 1 33 in addition the macrophytes impart some distinct advantages including rootzone aeration accommodation of the microbes at the rhizosphere enhancement of the porosity of the vermibed media and nutrient uptake from the wastewater further improving the treatment efficacy of the vermifilters 11 the issue regarding the operation of the vermifilters at higher hlrs can be overcome to some extent by adopting the step feeding of the influent at multiple points 1 126 in step feeding the flowrate of the influent gets divided among different influent ports thus the hlrs from each port becomes substantially less as compared to the single point wastewater feeding approach in addition in step feeding mode the uniform distribution of the wastewater over the entire surface of the vermibed reduces the risk of ponding recently to address the concern related to the area requirement of the vf process the researchers have implemented baffled vermifilters 37 38 and hybrid vermifilters 1 33 in baffled vermifilters the provision of baffles increases the effective length of travel of wastewater inside the vermifilter by ensuring the curvilinear movement of the wastewater thereby facilitating sufficient contact time for substantial nutrient removal from the wastewater by engaging smaller area on the other hand in hybrid vermifilters the wastewater has to pass through a vssf vermifilter followed by a hssf vermifilter in vssf vermifilter the aerobic condition prevails whereas in hssf vermifilter anaerobic condition becomes predominant 30 48 thus the provision of the hybrid vermifilter improves the redox condition of the system triggering the organic and nutrient removal efficiency of the vf technology within a minimal footprint however the application of all the aforementioned modifications has been mostly limited to the lab scale hence further research is of utmost importance to examine the feasibility of the aforementioned advanced vermifilters in field scale applications 7 conclusion in the present review the mechanisms taking place in vf and the contribution of the earthworms in remediating the domestic sewage are comprehensively elaborated on analyzing the performance of the vf technology based on the data compiled in this review work it can be concluded that the vf technology has displayed its worth in countering the pollutants present in the domestic sewage in fact the disposal of the vermifiltered effluent to the surface water bodies is absolutely safe the vf technology is found to be more advantageous than several pioneer wastewater treatment technologies such as asp and other non conventional wastewater treatment technologies such as cws als and wsps especially regarding the treatment of domestic sewage the detailed analyses on the lca and lcia of the vf technology portrays that the vf technology can potentially reduce the environmental nuisance by negotiating the ghg emissions and sludge production justifying the vf technology as a zero waste technology or green technology taking into consideration the strict environment protection policies worldwide the vf technology can be regarded as an eco innovation in the field of wastewater treatment furthermore the energy efficiency and the production of the value added byproducts improve the economy of vf process in addition its linkage to circular bioeconomy makes it an economically viable option the vf technology also satisfies the social acceptability criteria by promoting public involvement community development and preserving the social aesthetic aspects hence as a concluding remark it can be stated that the full scale implementation of the vf technology would help the society to achieve the three bottom lines of sustainability environmental sustainability economic affordability and social acceptability declaration
