25335,the cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera is among the most damaging agricultural insect pests in the world the life cycle of h armigera is temperature dependent and as such modeling its population dynamics for integrated pest management ipm purposes requires accurate temperature information throughout the area of interest which is not always available we present for the first time a continuous age structured insect population model driven by satellite derived land surface temperature lst to derive population dynamics of h armigera we use lst data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis conducting model simulations and validating the model with h armigera larvae counts from in field scout reports in nine sweet corn zea mays convar and four tomato solanum lycopersicum crop fields in northern israel we compared our results with a similar model that uses air temperature derived from the nearest weather station as an input to accurately predict population dynamics we used different model initiation scenarios considering pesticide application and migration patterns between neighboring corn and tomato fields which were identified as sink and source of the adult population results show that our lst driven model outperformed the model driven by ambient air temperature model simulations generally followed the larval population development observed in the field when the model was initiated the day before the first larvae were detected providing realistic population dynamics simulations with different adult population migration rates showed the importance of including between field migration in the lst driven model in conclusion this study provides a basis for future development of real time ipm support systems particularly when combining a temperature driven age structured insect population model with real time satellite derived information keywords helicoverpa armigera heliothis insect population model ipm modis 1 introduction the cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera hubner lepidoptera noctuida known also as heliothis is a polyphagous insect i e an insect that feeds and develops on many different kinds of foods endemic in cotton corn tomato hot pepper and tobacco crops liu et al 2004 it is a cosmopolitan pest present in china gao et al 2010 liu et al 2004 wu et al 1993 2008 pakistan hameed et al 2015 australia fitt et al 1995 maelzer and zalucki 1999 central africa brévault et al 2008 and also in israel cohen et al 2015 modeling population dynamics of this pest is therefore critical in pest management programs worldwide the developmental rate size survival and migration patterns and rate of the h armigera is thought to be a function of the host in which its larvae develops liu et al 2004 in addition studies characterizing the developmental survival and egg laying rates of h armigera also indicate that this pest can develop at different temperatures and relative humidity levels liu et al 2004 mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 song et al 2007 wu et al 1993 1980 depending on environmental temperature studies have reported up to three generations per year of h armigera hameed et al 2015 gao et al 2010 rochester et al 2002 in addition the population of h armigera is also known to be affected by migration brévault et al 2008 gao et al 2010 and the type of larval host maelzer and zalucki 1999 all these factors make the modeling of h armigera population dynamics a rather complex task previous modeling of the h armigera population includes statistical and multi variant analysis models hameed et al 2015 developmental rate models fitt et al 1995 and discrete temperature driven age structured matrix models feng et al 2010 in all these approaches migration is considered to be a function of wind speed fitt et al 1995 and or a function of the probability of a preferred direction of flight feng et al 2010 from all these modeling approaches though only the temperature driven age structured approach may be used to predict an h armigera population at different sites without the need for local adjustments this is because this modeling approach is mostly dependent on temperature conditions which is the main input in this kind of models the temperature driven age structured modeling approach is also believed to be more accurate than the statistical modeling approaches since the h armigera life cycle is temperature dependent damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 time and age in this deterministic population model are expressed in physiological time or degree days dd therefore the use of accurate temperature data as an input in the model is crucial to track insect behavior and population dynamics especially when considering the effect of global warming on insect populations gutierrez et al 2009 logan et al 2003 currently the temperature used in the models is acquired from meteorological weather stations which are often spread within the study area or near the crop fields ahumada et al 2004 feng et al 2010 however temperature varies greatly in space due to diverse topo climate features lensky and dayan 2011 hence using interpolated air temperatures from weather stations in age structured models may result in inaccurate predictions of population dynamics particularly where the distribution of these stations is not dense enough and or unrepresentative of the total area replacing ambient air temperatures from meteorological stations with land surface temperatures from satellites is a recently developed trend in ecological agricultural studies recent studies have suggested that surface skin temperature is more tightly related to plant function and insect activity than air temperature because it directly reflects leaf temperature roberts et al 2015 still et al 2014 mean annual temperature based on land surface temperature was found to be highly correlated with important traits of the status of the vegetation helman et al 2015 2017 and hence the possibility for plants to become hosts for pest attacks blum et al 2013 showed that using moderate resolution imagining spectroradiometer modis thermal imagery to estimate olive grove canopy temperature is more accurate than just interpolating air temperature from meteorological stations using olive grove canopy temperatures from modis blum et al 2015 successfully tracked the population dynamics of olive fly bactrocera oleae through a continuous temperature driven age structured population model however a deterministic population model with surface skin temperature derived from satellites as an input has never been used for the h armigera pest which has been shown to have distinct behavior and migration patterns in different environments brévault et al 2008 gao et al 2010 in addition and as far as we are aware blum et al 2015 were the first to use satellite derived temperatures as an input in the modeling of insect pest population dynamics here we use a temperature driven age structured continuous population model to predict h armigera population dynamics in several neighboring sweet corn zea mays convar and tomato solanum lycopersicum fields at the bet she an valley northern israel validation of the model was conducted using in situ data collected in the area as part of a wide intercrop integrated pest management program in israel named hamabia hameiri 1999 as in blum et al 2015 we used temperature data derived from modis as an input in the model in addition to the model used in blum et al 2015 for the olive fly application of pesticides and adult migration were considered and tested in the population model of the h armigera the main aims of this research were 1 to adjust an age structured population model to accurately predict h armigera dynamics using satellite derived lst data as an input 2 to test different initial conditions and their effect on modeled population dynamics and 3 to examine the effect of adult migration on the simulated population dynamics 2 model description 2 1 physiological time and the differential equation describing dynamics of the age mass structured populations a continuous temperature driven age structured insect population model is used to determine population dynamics of h armigera in corn and tomato fields in this model the per capita age structured dynamics of growth development reproduction and behavior are driven by environmental temperatures blum et al 2015 thus a temperature dependent ordinary differential equation can be written to describe the population dynamics for h armigera in its five life stages i e egg larva pupa non reproductive adult and sexually mature adult 1 d n i j t d t k d e l j n i 1 j t n i j t μ i t n i j t each life

egg larva pupa non reproductive adult and sexually mature adult respectively t is the actual time and delj is the reference developmental time of the jth life stage both expressed as physiological time in degree days dd eq 2 μi t is the attrition rate due to mortality by heat and or pesticide application see section 2 3 n0 j in eq 1 refers to the initial population density of the jth life stage i e the background population see section 2 5 or to the population density flow from the last cohort of the previous life stage i e n40 j 1 see fig 1 or in the case when j 1 i e egg stage to the flux due to oviposition see section 2 2 and fig 1 fig 1 shows a schematic representation of the differential equation eq 1 used to describe the age mass structured population dynamics of h armigera the physiological time i e dd is calculated as 2 dd 0 5 tmax tmin tc where t max and t min are the diurnal maximum and minimum ambient or in our case satellite derived surface temperatures in c and tc is a critical temperature for development of each life stage blum et al 2015 gutierrez et al 2009 for the h armigera we used here a tc of 10 7 c for all life stages which is a critical temperature adjusted for the modis derived input data following feng et al 2010 since both independent variables time and age are in dd the equation for each life stage can be presented as a set of k ordinary differential equations i e for each cohort 3 d r i t d t k d e l r i 1 t 1 μ i t d e l k r i t where r is the output flux from the i th cohort defined as 4 r i t k n i t d e l the reference developmental time del i e the mean dd needed to move from one life stage to another is assumed to be constant for each life stage feng et al 2010 40 5 dd for eggs 229 5 dd for larvae 180 dd for pupae and 42 45 and 145 05 dd for non reproductive and sexually mature adults respectively 2 2 oviposition oviposition may occur only when the first cohort of the sexually mature adult population is recorded in such a case a new egg population is added as a function of the average temperature and the number of sexually mature females the suitable temperatures for egg laying were set at the range of 10 36 5 c wu et al 1993 and we assumed that there is no other fecundity limitation mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 we also assumed that the sexually mature adult population is equally divided into males and females thus the proposed formulation of mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 to derive the egg count per female per day was used 5 eggs female 1 day 1 205 71 19 39 t 0 38 t2 where t is the daily average lst temperature in c 2 3 attrition the attrition μ of h armigera i e the mortality rate is mostly caused by heat i e temperature μ t and or pesticides μ p thus these two factors were considered in the model as follows for μ t two different equations were applied eqs 6 and 7 for the h armigera at the immature stages i e 1 egg 2 larva and 3 pupa 6 μt 1 96 0 12 t 0 002 t 2 del following the survival equation proposed by wu et al 1993 where t is the daily average temperature in c for the adult stages i e stages 4 non reproductive and 5 sexually mature adults a constant value was used as proposed by sun et al 2006 7 μt 0 073 del for μ p it was assumed a conservative mortality rate of 80 rivka raviv hamabia personal communication for only five days daly 2012 thus the adult population was reduced in each cohort by 80 in each of the following five days since the day of the pesticide application simulations of the pesticide applications matched the dates reported by the pest scouts see following section 3 1 pesticide applications were conducted in field by the farmers based on the threshold level for larvae populations established by the farmers own experience 2 4 insect population migration migration between neighboring fields was simulated from tomato source to corn sink fields with a relatively conservative rate of 20 of the adult population i e stages 4 and 5 migration was simulated for each day since the first model run adding 20 of the adult population from each cohort to the adult population of the nearest corn field in its respective cohort within an optimal migration distance to estimate the optimal and maximum migration distance of the h armigera population between neighboring fields we used the approach proposed by carrière et al 2006 2012 in this approach the correlation between the population density of the pest in a focal field sink and that in an adjacent neighbor field source is examined at different distances here following this approach and based on in situ observations we assumed that the tomato field acts as a source of the h armigera to the nearby corn fields hetzroni et al 2010 we then examined the correlation between the population density at each of the tomato fields and at surrounding corn fields at a range of distances between 500 m and 2000 m every 250 m based on in situ data acquired during four seasons 2010 2013 a positive statistically significant correlation r 0 5 p 0 05 was found between the source tomato and the sink fields corn up to a distance of 1000 m cohen et al 2015 thus we assumed in the model that the adult population of h armigera can migrate from tomato to corn fields up to that distance i e 1000 m and not farther the migrated adult population was evenly added to all corn sink fields within a distance of 1000 m from the tomato source field finally equations were solved accounting for oviposition eq 5 migration and mortality eqs 6 and 7 per field per day we used euler integration method for the numerical solution of the differential equations i e eqs 1 and 3 with an adaptive stepsize of 24 steps per day this adaptive stepsize was shown to provide a stable numerical solution computation processes were conducted using the interactive data language idl itt visual information solution inc software table 1 summarizes all numerical values units and definitions of the parameters used in the model eqs 1 7 2 5 initial simulation conditions because h armigera populations in agricultural fields which are usually managed with irrigation and pesticide applications do not reach an equilibrium state proper initiation conditions are required to accurately model its population dynamics moreover there is no current knowledge on what specifically constrains egg laying of h armigera in corn and tomato crops therefore the model has to be initiated with arbitrary conditions and at an arbitrary date three simulation scenarios hereafter a c that differ in their length and initial conditions i e distinct initial populations were tested in terms of model accuracy the pearson s r of the correlation and the root mean square error rmse between simulated and observed larvae population dynamics were used to test and compare the performance of the models with the different simulation scenarios all simulations ended at the same time i e at the date in which the supervision inspection period ended a model initiates at the date of the beginning of the supervision inspection b model initiates at the day prior to the detection of the first larvae in the field c model initiates when the host crop becomes susceptible for egg laying in control fields for the estimation of this date see following explanation the initial conditions for the first two scenarios a b followed mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 and were as follows background larvae population of 3000 larvae ha for tomato and 500 larvae ha for corn fields 6000 egg ha for tomato and 1000 eggs ha for the corn fields no pupae population and a 0 04 fraction of the larvae population 4 as reproductive adult population in both crop field types in c the expected date when the host crop becomes susceptible for egg laying was estimated this date was derived following a procedure composed of two stages 1 the date of the first larvae reported by the pest scouts for each field was used to calculate the day of the year doy in which the egg deposition occurred this was achieved by deducing the required dd for an egg to become a larva i e using the reference developmental time of 40 5 dd feng et al 2010 from the date when the first to larva were reported in stage 2 the accumulated dd from the seeding date to the doy of deposition was calculated the resulting dd from seeding to deposition i e the date in which the host crop became susceptible for egg laying were 561 dd and 461 dd for the corn and tomato crop fields respectively in these dates the model was initiated with a background adult population that was estimated using two control fields fields c and i fig 2 and table 2 fields c and i were not surrounded by tomato fields within a radius of 1000 m therefore it was assumed that no migration took place in those fields and that the larvae population found in those fields could be used to calculate the background reproductive adult population for the initiation of the model in the other seven corn fields fig 2 the number of adult individuals that were needed to create such number of larva individuals used as the initial number of adult individuals in the model in the other corn fields was 200 a background population of 500 reproductive adult individuals was used to initiate the model in the tomato crop fields based on trial and error 3 field and satellite data 3 1 validation data hamabia project at bet she an valley the model was used to simulate h armigera population dynamics in nine sweet corn zea mays convar and four tomato solanum lycopersicum crop fields fields a c d e g h i j m and fields b f k and l respectively table 2 located in the bet she an valley northern israel 32 44 n 35 44 e fig 2 in this area a wide intercrop integrated pest management ipm program is currently practiced by the hamabia project the program is implemented by a pesticide utilization windows policy which takes into account the pest control needs of all the fields in this area and pre programs the annual use of pesticides accordingly hameiri 1999 farmers pest scouts and extension workers meet weekly reviewing pest scouting findings in light of the annual policy and issuing weekly pest control recommendations hetzroni et al 2010 where one major polyphagous pest in this program is h armigera the larvae damage the tomato crops during the period of ripening up to the time of color change torres vila et al 2003 the protocol required scouts to sample a few runs of 1 m each and report their findings in terms of egg and larvae count per meter corn becomes susceptible to h armigera at the initiation of the tassel primordia fefelova and frolov 2008 dömötör et al 2009 following the protocol scouts had to sample a group of plants but not all of the plants the total count of tassels or ears in the group was noted and each tassel ear was inspected for infestation with h armigera the total count of infested parts tassels ears was finally recorded by the scouts because of uncertainties related to this kind of field observations validation was conducted by comparing normalized modeled vs in situ larvae populations i e by dividing the number of larvae individuals by the maximum recorded larvae population size instead of comparing total number of larvae individuals in addition validation of the model was conducted with pest scout records from 2010 and from only five out of the nine corn fields a e g h and m and three out of the four tomato fields b k and l which were the fields with the most reliable available data the remaining five fields were taken into consideration in the model simulations because migration between neighboring fields may have affected the h armigera populations in the other fields location of the bet she an valley and crop fields are shown in fig 2 seeding harvesting and pesticide application dates in 2010 for the studied fields are presented in table 2 3 2 satellite data the terra modis land surface temperature lst product mod11a2 1 km eight day mean for 2002 2014 was downloaded for the sample fields fig 2 the eight day day and night lst time series were splined to produce daily mean values for 2010 lst2010 in addition the long term 13 years mean lst i e the climatological temperature lstclim was calculated using a temporal fourier analysis scharlemann et al 2008 over the 2002 2014 lst time series for model runs with average temperature conditions for each julian day the standard deviation stdclim of the long term average daily value was calculated to obtain the model uncertainty model uncertainty shaded areas in figs 4 and 5 was than calculated as the modeled population with temperature input of lstclim stdclim blum et al 2015 as already mentioned in the introduction surface temperature was found to be more closely related to leaf temperature than ambient air temperature still et al 2014 it was assumed here that the lst would directly represent the canopy temperature of the tomato and the corn crop fields during the period of the study lst2010 and lstclim were then used to calculate the dd of the different stages the attrition due to warming and the egg laying count as described in previous sections eqs 1 7 for 2010 and for long term average temperature conditions 4 results 4 1 simulating population dynamics fig 3 presents modeled populations of one generation of h armigera in three selective corn and tomato fields corn fields a h and m and tomato fields b k and l with neither migration nor pesticide application considered in this simulation and under long term average temperature conditions using lstclim in the model shown are the normalized populations of the five life stages i e the actual population of each stage divided by its maximum population size note that the initial adult population background is hardly seen in fig 3 because of its relatively small size compared to the maximum recorded adult population size the model was initialized at the time when the host first became susceptible to egg laying scenario c with only reproductive adults i e no initial eggs larvae or pupae were added to the simulations the progressive development of this pest through the different stages could be seen in these fields with a single fields a and h and sometimes double fields m b k and l peak in larvae population mostly during the spring march may note that the earlier development of the h armigera population in corn field m fig 3 was due to early seeding i e almost a month before the other corn fields table 2 4 2 testing different model initialization scenarios when including pesticide application and migration from tomato to corn in the model most of the simulations showed generally good agreement with the in situ larva population with scores pearson s r mostly above 0 5 and a relative rmse between 0 10 and 0 48 table 3 and figs 4 and 5 lower pearson s scores and relatively large rmse were probably related to cumulative errors carried from the calculation of the starting date of the simulation which were mainly derived from non empirical sources in general simulations showed two peaks of larval population very close in time figs 4 and 5 the first peak was displayed in late spring late april to early may in most of the simulations except in the corn field m that showed a particularly earlier development in larval population compared to the other fields due to the early seeding date table 2 the second peak occurred more towards the early summer early to mid june in tomato fields and a bit earlier mid may in the case of the corn fields while field m showed no second peak in all simulations the first peak tended to drop more sharply than the second in the case of the tomato fields which was likely due to the simulated pesticide treatment at that time since the pesticide was designed to kill only the larval population in the model i e without affecting egg or adult populations a second peak of larval population was expected as the undamaged eggs started to develop towards the following larval stage initiating the model with the different initialization scenarios a c caused differences mainly in the period in which the modeled larval population was developed with scenario b i e model runs initiated at the date prior to the first larvae detection showing more realistic larval population dynamics than the other two scenarios i e model with higher scores p 0 05 table 3 the average pearson s r scores for all fields were 0 76 0 16 0 85 0 13 and 0 59 0 31 with an average relative rmse of 0 26 0 21 and 0 33 for scenarios a b and c respectively table 3 the average scores for model runs at the tomato fields were 0 62 0 03 0 94 0 03 and 0 60 0 12 with an rmse of 0 22 0 25 and 0 33 using initiation scenarios a b and c respectively while for the corn fields these scores were 0 82 0 17 0 79 0 14 and 0 58 0 40 with an rmse of 0 31 0 14 and 0 32 for scenarios a b and c respectively using meteorological temperatures i e 2 m air temperature from the nearest weather station of the israel meteorological service located c 9 km from the study area fig 6 resulted in different patterns of population dynamics figs s1 s2 and much lower pearson s scores with a higher rmse for almost all fields table s1 the advantage of using continuous satellite derived lst data in the age structured model was further demonstrated through the great spatial temperature variability within a small area fig 6 this spatial variability was also highly dependent on the time period during the seasonal year fig s3 4 3 the effect of insect population migration rate an additional simulation included changing the migration rate of the h armigera between tomato source and corn sink fields from 20 figs 4 and 5 to a higher adult population migration rate 40 60 and 80 we present these results as normalized fig 7 and absolute fig 8 changes in larvae population to show both changes in population dynamics and size simulations did not include field m which was not affected by migration due to its early growing and harvest dates i e before a significant development of the adult population took place in neighboring tomato fields see table 2 simulations with no migration between fields are also shown in these figures i e a 0 migration rate in the model all simulations were conducted following scenario b which was shown to be the most realistic scenario see previous section 4 2 figs 7 and 8 clearly show the importance of including adult population migration in the model to predict larvae population dynamics and size in fig 7 the model with no migration i e 0 shows a consistently earlier peak in larvae population at the corn fields maybe with the exception of field e compared to the model that considered between fields migration this was likely because there was no increase in adult population added from tomato fields in the models using the migration factor which promoted a faster change between development stages resulting in smaller size earlier development of the larval population figs 7 and 8 an opposite scheme was observed in tomato fields where a larger adult population size in the case of no migration produced a larger population size of larvae fig 8 at a later date fig 7 changing the migration rate in the model from 20 to 80 did not affect much of the larval population dynamics fig 7 the only exception was the tomato field k that showed an earlier peak in larvae population for higher migration rates nevertheless and as expected population size was significantly affected when the migration rate was altered in the model fig 8 the larvae population size in the tomato fields source was reduced when the migration rate was increased in the model while in the corn fields sink it significantly increased with higher immigration rates interestingly the population size did not change much during the peak season when the migration rate was changed from 40 to 80 particularly in the corn fields 5 discussion the main aim of this study was to adjust a temperature driven age structured insect population model with lst data as an input to predict the population dynamics of h armigera with potential use in integrated pest management ipm programs our results show that when using appropriate initial condition this model can predict larvae h armigera population with fair accuracy particularly when using real time data to initiate the model once the pest is first detected in the field this demonstrates the great potential of using temperature driven age structured population models with satellite lst for real time ipm programs previous modeling of h armigera included migration and landscape heterogeneity fitt et al 1995 investigated movement of adult moths which was a key component in their heaps helicoverpa armigera and punctigera simulation model dillon and fitt 1997 concluding that validation of mobility is difficult and includes many unknown parameters that are complex to assess ekbom 2000 their model which was mainly developed for the cotton growing areas of australia also simulated the effects of pesticides i e type and target stage of the insect fitt et al 1995 of interest is the use of the heaps model to simulate pesticide resistance and pesticide management hoque et al 2001 fitt et al 1995 s model however was based on empirical data and was formulated using a normal distribution approach i e having a merely statistical basis in contrast to our study which used a deterministic data driven modeling approach a temperature driven age structured population model provides a broader scope for application in many areas of the world our model also enables the inclusion of various variables that may affect the observed population behavior allowing us to explore and experiment on the actual effect of these variables on the modeling and prediction abilities a more recent modeling of h armigera was conducted by feng et al 2010 in china in their complex model feng et al 2010 incorporated long range and directional migration host susceptibility and planting sequence pesticide effects upon all stages of development and resistance to pesticide as a factor related to the frequency of applications this complex model resulted in simulations that were well correlated with long term adult trapping data however the model is not suitable for forecasting population dynamics at the field level because it provides estimates of h armigera population at a rather too coarse spatial resolution each grid point representing an area of 2 by 2 feng et al 2010 moreover their use of an ambient temperature information from weather stations in the model limits its use because of the spatial discontinuity of the temperature data and the large effect it has on predicted populations as demonstrated in this study table 2 and table s1 and figs 4 5 and s1 s3 based on the results of our study and previous simulations blum et al 2015 we believe that the use of lst from satellites could highly benefit this type of sophisticated and complex modeling providing more accurate results and improved forecasting abilities both at short and long range spatial and temporal scales as shown here from the comparison of the model with lst vs that with the ambient temperature used as an input in contrast to previous modeling of h armigera our simulations were focused on a relatively small area and short period of time and investigated the effects of pesticide applications our study was mainly concentrated on the larval stage in contrast to adult population dynamics e g feng et al 2010 since the larvae population is the main cause of damage in agricultural crop fields only the larval population is currently monitored in ipm decisions adult monitoring was not applied in the investigated area the simulation of pesticide application reduced larval populations as expected in a realistic scheme i e in accordance with in situ observations however our model often forecasted a less realistic and more dramatic increase in larval populations compared to observations shortly after the pesticide application for example see figs 4 and 5 this most likely means that a conservative larvae mortality rate of 80 used in our model following pesticide application may be unrealistically low and that mortality of eggs and maybe of the adult population following pesticide application should also be considered in the model our modeling assumed a simple adult migration from tomato to corn fields based on previously observed movement preferences of h armigera in this region cohen et al 2015 migration was simulated to take place at each date without a fixed initial migration date which enabled a more elastic simulation of the model however it did not directly consider larvae movement due to feeding preferences for example cohen et al 2015 observed that the larva of h armigera prefers feeding on green immature tomatoes but not on red mature tomatoes this means that the h armigera adult population might move from fields with developed and mature crops to fields with yet undeveloped crops prior to the egg laying stage because the model was run independently of the plant development stage these preferences were not taken directly into consideration instead migration was applied at each day with a fixed ratio of the adult population moving from tomato to corn fields however and this may explain the better performance of the model with scenario b by initiating the model at the time of the first appearance of larvae in the crops i e as reported by the scouts we actually considered indirectly plant development stage and larva feeding preferences as it is assumed that the larva appearance is synchronized with green tomato and or corn tassel development stages although the simulations of the adult population migration were mainly shown to affect the larvae population size rather than its dynamics it realistically captured the timing of the peak in larvae population when compared to in situ observations h armigera was previously reported to be capable of migrating large distances of up to several tens to hundreds of kilometers per day feng et al 2010 however in this study migration was simulated only up to 1 km following previous observations in this area cohen et al 2015 migration from distant sources was probably less frequent in our case since this region has a limited agricultural production area different migration rates were shown here to affect the larvae population following pesticide applications fig 7 pesticide applications were modeled to kill only the larvae population but not the adult population or eggs this could have some unconsidered effects on the larvae population dynamics it might explain some of the discrepancies between modeled and observed larvae population dynamics at the end of the crop growing period fig 6 in conclusion we have presented here a continuous temperature driven age structured insect population model driven by satellite derived lst data the model captured well the insect population dynamics as well as the effect of pesticide application and adult population migration between neighboring fields moreover our model driven by satellite derived lst data outperformed the model that used ambient temperature from the nearest weather station this implies that the use of our proposed lst driven model should not be restricted to cases when weather information i e temperature is scarce or unavailable but rather as an alternative to the conventional use with ambient temperature as a driver even when such information is available finally our results were consistent with field observations showing the great potential of these kinds of models driven by real time satellite data in the use of ipm applications acknowledgments part of this research was supported by grant no 458 0534 11 from the chief scientist of the

25335,the cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera is among the most damaging agricultural insect pests in the world the life cycle of h armigera is temperature dependent and as such modeling its population dynamics for integrated pest management ipm purposes requires accurate temperature information throughout the area of interest which is not always available we present for the first time a continuous age structured insect population model driven by satellite derived land surface temperature lst to derive population dynamics of h armigera we use lst data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis conducting model simulations and validating the model with h armigera larvae counts from in field scout reports in nine sweet corn zea mays convar and four tomato solanum lycopersicum crop fields in northern israel we compared our results with a similar model that uses air temperature derived from the nearest weather station as an input to accurately predict population dynamics we used different model initiation scenarios considering pesticide application and migration patterns between neighboring corn and tomato fields which were identified as sink and source of the adult population results show that our lst driven model outperformed the model driven by ambient air temperature model simulations generally followed the larval population development observed in the field when the model was initiated the day before the first larvae were detected providing realistic population dynamics simulations with different adult population migration rates showed the importance of including between field migration in the lst driven model in conclusion this study provides a basis for future development of real time ipm support systems particularly when combining a temperature driven age structured insect population model with real time satellite derived information keywords helicoverpa armigera heliothis insect population model ipm modis 1 introduction the cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera hubner lepidoptera noctuida known also as heliothis is a polyphagous insect i e an insect that feeds and develops on many different kinds of foods endemic in cotton corn tomato hot pepper and tobacco crops liu et al 2004 it is a cosmopolitan pest present in china gao et al 2010 liu et al 2004 wu et al 1993 2008 pakistan hameed et al 2015 australia fitt et al 1995 maelzer and zalucki 1999 central africa brévault et al 2008 and also in israel cohen et al 2015 modeling population dynamics of this pest is therefore critical in pest management programs worldwide the developmental rate size survival and migration patterns and rate of the h armigera is thought to be a function of the host in which its larvae develops liu et al 2004 in addition studies characterizing the developmental survival and egg laying rates of h armigera also indicate that this pest can develop at different temperatures and relative humidity levels liu et al 2004 mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 song et al 2007 wu et al 1993 1980 depending on environmental temperature studies have reported up to three generations per year of h armigera hameed et al 2015 gao et al 2010 rochester et al 2002 in addition the population of h armigera is also known to be affected by migration brévault et al 2008 gao et al 2010 and the type of larval host maelzer and zalucki 1999 all these factors make the modeling of h armigera population dynamics a rather complex task previous modeling of the h armigera population includes statistical and multi variant analysis models hameed et al 2015 developmental rate models fitt et al 1995 and discrete temperature driven age structured matrix models feng et al 2010 in all these approaches migration is considered to be a function of wind speed fitt et al 1995 and or a function of the probability of a preferred direction of flight feng et al 2010 from all these modeling approaches though only the temperature driven age structured approach may be used to predict an h armigera population at different sites without the need for local adjustments this is because this modeling approach is mostly dependent on temperature conditions which is the main input in this kind of models the temperature driven age structured modeling approach is also believed to be more accurate than the statistical modeling approaches since the h armigera life cycle is temperature dependent damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 time and age in this deterministic population model are expressed in physiological time or degree days dd therefore the use of accurate temperature data as an input in the model is crucial to track insect behavior and population dynamics especially when considering the effect of global warming on insect populations gutierrez et al 2009 logan et al 2003 currently the temperature used in the models is acquired from meteorological weather stations which are often spread within the study area or near the crop fields ahumada et al 2004 feng et al 2010 however temperature varies greatly in space due to diverse topo climate features lensky and dayan 2011 hence using interpolated air temperatures from weather stations in age structured models may result in inaccurate predictions of population dynamics particularly where the distribution of these stations is not dense enough and or unrepresentative of the total area replacing ambient air temperatures from meteorological stations with land surface temperatures from satellites is a recently developed trend in ecological agricultural studies recent studies have suggested that surface skin temperature is more tightly related to plant function and insect activity than air temperature because it directly reflects leaf temperature roberts et al 2015 still et al 2014 mean annual temperature based on land surface temperature was found to be highly correlated with important traits of the status of the vegetation helman et al 2015 2017 and hence the possibility for plants to become hosts for pest attacks blum et al 2013 showed that using moderate resolution imagining spectroradiometer modis thermal imagery to estimate olive grove canopy temperature is more accurate than just interpolating air temperature from meteorological stations using olive grove canopy temperatures from modis blum et al 2015 successfully tracked the population dynamics of olive fly bactrocera oleae through a continuous temperature driven age structured population model however a deterministic population model with surface skin temperature derived from satellites as an input has never been used for the h armigera pest which has been shown to have distinct behavior and migration patterns in different environments brévault et al 2008 gao et al 2010 in addition and as far as we are aware blum et al 2015 were the first to use satellite derived temperatures as an input in the modeling of insect pest population dynamics here we use a temperature driven age structured continuous population model to predict h armigera population dynamics in several neighboring sweet corn zea mays convar and tomato solanum lycopersicum fields at the bet she an valley northern israel validation of the model was conducted using in situ data collected in the area as part of a wide intercrop integrated pest management program in israel named hamabia hameiri 1999 as in blum et al 2015 we used temperature data derived from modis as an input in the model in addition to the model used in blum et al 2015 for the olive fly application of pesticides and adult migration were considered and tested in the population model of the h armigera the main aims of this research were 1 to adjust an age structured population model to accurately predict h armigera dynamics using satellite derived lst data as an input 2 to test different initial conditions and their effect on modeled population dynamics and 3 to examine the effect of adult migration on the simulated population dynamics 2 model description 2 1 physiological time and the differential equation describing dynamics of the age mass structured populations a continuous temperature driven age structured insect population model is used to determine population dynamics of h armigera in corn and tomato fields in this model the per capita age structured dynamics of growth development reproduction and behavior are driven by environmental temperatures blum et al 2015 thus a temperature dependent ordinary differential equation can be written to describe the population dynamics for h armigera in its five life stages i e egg larva pupa non reproductive adult and sexually mature adult 1 d n i j t d t k d e l j n i 1 j t n i j t μ i t n i j t each life

due to oviposition see section 2 2 and fig 1 fig 1 shows a schematic representation of the differential equation eq 1 used to describe the age mass structured population dynamics of h armigera the physiological time i e dd is calculated as 2 dd 0 5 tmax tmin tc where t max and t min are the diurnal maximum and minimum ambient or in our case satellite derived surface temperatures in c and tc is a critical temperature for development of each life stage blum et al 2015 gutierrez et al 2009 for the h armigera we used here a tc of 10 7 c for all life stages which is a critical temperature adjusted for the modis derived input data following feng et al 2010 since both independent variables time and age are in dd the equation for each life stage can be presented as a set of k ordinary differential equations i e for each cohort 3 d r i t d t k d e l r i 1 t 1 μ i t d e l k r i t where r is the output flux from the i th cohort defined as 4 r i t k n i t d e l the reference

and 42 45 and 145 05 dd for non reproductive and sexually mature adults respectively 2 2 oviposition oviposition may occur only when the first cohort of the sexually mature adult population is recorded in such a case a new egg population is added as a function of the average temperature and the number of sexually mature females the suitable temperatures for egg laying were set at the range of 10 36 5 c wu et al 1993 and we assumed that there is no other fecundity limitation mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 we also assumed that the sexually mature adult population is equally divided into males and females thus the proposed formulation of mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 to derive the egg count per female per day was used 5 eggs female 1 day 1 205 71 19 39 t 0 38 t2 where t is the daily average lst temperature in c 2 3 attrition the attrition μ of h armigera i e the mortality rate is mostly caused by heat i e temperature μ t and or pesticides μ p thus these two factors were considered in the model as follows for μ t two different equations were applied eqs 6 and 7 for the h armigera at the immature stages i e 1 egg 2 larva and 3 pupa 6 μt 1 96 0 12 t 0 002 t 2 del following the survival equation proposed by wu et al 1993 where t is the daily average temperature in c for the adult stages i e stages 4 non reproductive and 5 sexually mature adults a constant value was used as proposed by sun et al 2006 7 μt 0 073 del for μ p it was assumed a conservative mortality rate of 80 rivka raviv hamabia personal communication for only five days daly 2012 thus the adult population was reduced in each cohort by 80 in each of the following five days since the day of the pesticide application simulations of the pesticide applications matched the dates reported by the pest scouts see following section 3 1 pesticide applications were conducted in field by the farmers based on the threshold level for larvae populations established by the farmers own experience 2 4 insect population migration migration between neighboring fields was simulated from tomato source to corn sink fields with a relatively conservative rate of 20 of the adult population i e stages 4 and 5 migration was simulated for each day since the first model run adding 20 of the adult population from each cohort to the adult population of the nearest corn field in its respective cohort within an optimal migration distance to estimate the optimal and maximum migration distance of the h armigera population between neighboring fields we used the approach proposed by carrière et al 2006 2012 in this approach the correlation between the population density of the pest in a focal field sink and that in an adjacent neighbor field source is examined at different distances here following this approach and based on in situ observations we assumed that the tomato field acts as a source of the h armigera to the nearby corn fields hetzroni et al 2010 we then examined the correlation between the population density at each of the tomato fields and at surrounding corn fields at a range of distances between 500 m and 2000 m every 250 m based on in situ data acquired during four seasons 2010 2013 a positive statistically significant correlation r 0 5 p 0 05 was found between the source tomato and the sink fields corn up to a distance of 1000 m cohen et al 2015 thus we assumed in the model that the adult population of h armigera can migrate from tomato to corn fields up to that distance i e 1000 m and not farther the migrated adult population was evenly added to all corn sink fields within a distance of 1000 m from the tomato source field finally equations were solved accounting for oviposition eq 5 migration and mortality eqs 6 and 7 per field per day we used euler integration method for the numerical solution of the differential equations i e eqs 1 and 3 with an adaptive stepsize of 24 steps per day this adaptive stepsize was shown to provide a stable numerical solution computation processes were conducted using the interactive data language idl itt visual information solution inc software table 1 summarizes all numerical values units and definitions of the parameters used in the model eqs 1 7 2 5 initial simulation conditions because h armigera populations in agricultural fields which are usually managed with irrigation and pesticide applications do not reach an equilibrium state proper initiation conditions are required to accurately model its population dynamics moreover there is no current knowledge on what specifically constrains egg laying of h armigera in corn and tomato crops therefore the model has to be initiated with arbitrary conditions and at an arbitrary date three simulation scenarios hereafter a c that differ in their length and initial conditions i e distinct initial populations were tested in terms of model accuracy the pearson s r of the correlation and the root mean square error rmse between simulated and observed larvae population dynamics were used to test and compare the performance of the models with the different simulation scenarios all simulations ended at the same time i e at the date in which the supervision inspection period ended a model initiates at the date of the beginning of the supervision inspection b model initiates at the day prior to the detection of the first larvae in the field c model initiates when the host crop becomes susceptible for egg laying in control fields for the estimation of this date see following explanation the initial conditions for the first two scenarios a b followed mironidis and savopoulou soultani 2008 and were as follows background larvae population of 3000 larvae ha for tomato and 500 larvae ha for corn fields 6000 egg ha for tomato and 1000 eggs ha for the corn fields no pupae population and a 0 04 fraction of the larvae population 4 as reproductive adult population in both crop field types in c the expected date when the host crop becomes susceptible for egg laying was estimated this date was derived following a procedure composed of two stages 1 the date of the first larvae reported by the pest scouts for each field was used to calculate the day of the year doy in which the egg deposition occurred this was achieved by deducing the required dd for an egg to become a larva i e using the reference developmental time of 40 5 dd feng et al 2010 from the date when the first to larva were reported in stage 2 the accumulated dd from the seeding date to the doy of deposition was calculated the resulting dd from seeding to deposition i e the date in which the host crop became susceptible for egg laying were 561 dd and 461 dd for the corn and tomato crop fields respectively in these dates the model was initiated with a background adult population that was estimated using two control fields fields c and i fig 2 and table 2 fields c and i were not surrounded by tomato fields within a radius of 1000 m therefore it was assumed that no migration took place in those fields and that the larvae population found in those fields could be used to calculate the background reproductive adult population for the initiation of the model in the other seven corn fields fig 2 the number of adult individuals that were needed to create such number of larva individuals used as the initial number of adult individuals in the model in the other corn fields was 200 a background population of 500 reproductive adult individuals was used to initiate the model in the tomato crop fields based on trial and error 3 field and satellite data 3 1 validation data hamabia project at bet she an valley the model was used to simulate h armigera population dynamics in nine sweet corn zea mays convar and four tomato solanum lycopersicum crop fields fields a c d e g h i j m and fields b f k and l respectively table 2 located in the bet she an valley northern israel 32 44 n 35 44 e fig 2 in this area a wide intercrop integrated pest management ipm program is currently practiced by the hamabia project the program is implemented by a pesticide utilization windows policy which takes into account the pest control needs of all the fields in this area and pre programs the annual use of pesticides accordingly hameiri 1999 farmers pest scouts and extension workers meet weekly reviewing pest scouting findings in light of the annual policy and issuing weekly pest control recommendations hetzroni et al 2010 where one major polyphagous pest in this program is h armigera the larvae damage the tomato crops during the period of ripening up to the time of color change torres vila et al 2003 the protocol required scouts to sample a few runs of 1 m each and report their findings in terms of egg and larvae count per meter corn becomes susceptible to h armigera at the initiation of the tassel primordia fefelova and frolov 2008 dömötör et al 2009 following the protocol scouts had to sample a group of plants but not all of the plants the total count of tassels or ears in the group was noted and each tassel ear was inspected for infestation with h armigera the total count of infested parts tassels ears was finally recorded by the scouts because of uncertainties related to this kind of field observations validation was conducted by comparing normalized modeled vs in situ larvae populations i e by dividing the number of larvae individuals by the maximum recorded larvae population size instead of comparing total number of larvae individuals in addition validation of the model was conducted with pest scout records from 2010 and from only five out of the nine corn fields a e g h and m and three out of the four tomato fields b k and l which were the fields with the most reliable available data the remaining five fields were taken into consideration in the model simulations because migration between neighboring fields may have affected the h armigera populations in the other fields location of the bet she an valley and crop fields are shown in fig 2 seeding harvesting and pesticide application dates in 2010 for the studied fields are presented in table 2 3 2 satellite data the terra modis land surface temperature lst product mod11a2 1 km eight day mean for 2002 2014 was downloaded for the sample fields fig 2 the eight day day and night lst time series were splined to produce daily mean values for 2010 lst2010 in addition the long term 13 years mean lst i e the climatological temperature lstclim was calculated using a temporal fourier analysis scharlemann et al 2008 over the 2002 2014 lst time series for model runs with average temperature conditions for each julian day the standard deviation stdclim of the long term average daily value was calculated to obtain the model uncertainty model uncertainty shaded areas in figs 4 and 5 was than calculated as the modeled population with temperature input of lstclim stdclim blum et al 2015 as already mentioned in the introduction surface temperature was found to be more closely related to leaf temperature than ambient air temperature still et al 2014 it was assumed here that the lst would directly represent the canopy temperature of the tomato and the corn crop fields during the period of the study lst2010 and lstclim were then used to calculate the dd of the different stages the attrition due to warming and the egg laying count as described in previous sections eqs 1 7 for 2010 and for long term average temperature conditions 4 results 4 1 simulating population dynamics fig 3 presents modeled populations of one generation of h armigera in three selective corn and tomato fields corn fields a h and m and tomato fields b k and l with neither migration nor pesticide application considered in this simulation and under long term average temperature conditions using lstclim in the model shown are the normalized populations of the five life stages i e the actual population of each stage divided by its maximum population size note that the initial adult population background is hardly seen in fig 3 because of its relatively small size compared to the maximum recorded adult population size the model was initialized at the time when the host first became susceptible to egg laying scenario c with only reproductive adults i e no initial eggs larvae or pupae were added to the simulations the progressive development of this pest through the different stages could be seen in these fields with a single fields a and h and sometimes double fields m b k and l peak in larvae population mostly during the spring march may note that the earlier development of the h armigera population in corn field m fig 3 was due to early seeding i e almost a month before the other corn fields table 2 4 2 testing different model initialization scenarios when including pesticide application and migration from tomato to corn in the model most of the simulations showed generally good agreement with the in situ larva population with scores pearson s r mostly above 0 5 and a relative rmse between 0 10 and 0 48 table 3 and figs 4 and 5 lower pearson s scores and relatively large rmse were probably related to cumulative errors carried from the calculation of the starting date of the simulation which were mainly derived from non empirical sources in general simulations showed two peaks of larval population very close in time figs 4 and 5 the first peak was displayed in late spring late april to early may in most of the simulations except in the corn field m that showed a particularly earlier development in larval population compared to the other fields due to the early seeding date table 2 the second peak occurred more towards the early summer early to mid june in tomato fields and a bit earlier mid may in the case of the corn fields while field m showed no second peak in all simulations the first peak tended to drop more sharply than the second in the case of the tomato fields which was likely due to the simulated pesticide treatment at that time since the pesticide was designed to kill only the larval population in the model i e without affecting egg or adult populations a second peak of larval population was expected as the undamaged eggs started to develop towards the following larval stage initiating the model with the different initialization scenarios a c caused differences mainly in the period in which the modeled larval population was developed with scenario b i e model runs initiated at the date prior to the first larvae detection showing more realistic larval population dynamics than the other two scenarios i e model with higher scores p 0 05 table 3 the average pearson s r scores for all fields were 0 76 0 16 0 85 0 13 and 0 59 0 31 with an average relative rmse of 0 26 0 21 and 0 33 for scenarios a b and c respectively table 3 the average scores for model runs at the tomato fields were 0 62 0 03 0 94 0 03 and 0 60 0 12 with an rmse of 0 22 0 25 and 0 33 using initiation scenarios a b and c respectively while for the corn fields these scores were 0 82 0 17 0 79 0 14 and 0 58 0 40 with an rmse of 0 31 0 14 and 0 32 for scenarios a b and c respectively using meteorological temperatures i e 2 m air temperature from the nearest weather station of the israel meteorological service located c 9 km from the study area fig 6 resulted in different patterns of population dynamics figs s1 s2 and much lower pearson s scores with a higher rmse for almost all fields table s1 the advantage of using continuous satellite derived lst data in the age structured model was further demonstrated through the great spatial temperature variability within a small area fig 6 this spatial variability was also highly dependent on the time period during the seasonal year fig s3 4 3 the effect of insect population migration rate an additional simulation included changing the migration rate of the h armigera between tomato source and corn sink fields from 20 figs 4 and 5 to a higher adult population migration rate 40 60 and 80 we present these results as normalized fig 7 and absolute fig 8 changes in larvae population to show both changes in population dynamics and size simulations did not include field m which was not affected by migration due to its early growing and harvest dates i e before a significant development of the adult population took place in neighboring tomato fields see table 2 simulations with no migration between fields are also shown in these figures i e a 0 migration rate in the model all simulations were conducted following scenario b which was shown to be the most realistic scenario see previous section 4 2 figs 7 and 8 clearly show the importance of including adult population migration in the model to predict larvae population dynamics and size in fig 7 the model with no migration i e 0 shows a consistently earlier peak in larvae population at the corn fields maybe with the exception of field e compared to the model that considered between fields migration this was likely because there was no increase in adult population added from tomato fields in the models using the migration factor which promoted a faster change between development stages resulting in smaller size earlier development of the larval population figs 7 and 8 an opposite scheme was observed in tomato fields where a larger adult population size in the case of no migration produced a larger population size of larvae fig 8 at a later date fig 7 changing the migration rate in the model from 20 to 80 did not affect much of the larval population dynamics fig 7 the only exception was the tomato field k that showed an earlier peak in larvae population for higher migration rates nevertheless and as expected population size was significantly affected when the migration rate was altered in the model fig 8 the larvae population size in the tomato fields source was reduced when the migration rate was increased in the model while in the corn fields sink it significantly increased with higher immigration rates interestingly the population size did not change much during the peak season when the migration rate was changed from 40 to 80 particularly in the corn fields 5 discussion the main aim of this study was to adjust a temperature driven age structured insect population model with lst data as an input to predict the population dynamics of h armigera with potential use in integrated pest management ipm programs our results show that when using appropriate initial condition this model can predict larvae h armigera population with fair accuracy particularly when using real time data to initiate the model once the pest is first detected in the field this demonstrates the great potential of using temperature driven age structured population models with satellite lst for real time ipm programs previous modeling of h armigera included migration and landscape heterogeneity fitt et al 1995 investigated movement of adult moths which was a key component in their heaps helicoverpa armigera and punctigera simulation model dillon and fitt 1997 concluding that validation of mobility is difficult and includes many unknown parameters that are complex to assess ekbom 2000 their model which was mainly developed for the cotton growing areas of australia also simulated the effects of pesticides i e type and target stage of the insect fitt et al 1995 of interest is the use of the heaps model to simulate pesticide resistance and pesticide management hoque et al 2001 fitt et al 1995 s model however was based on empirical data and was formulated using a normal distribution approach i e having a merely statistical basis in contrast to our study which used a deterministic data driven modeling approach a temperature driven age structured population model provides a broader scope for application in many areas of the world our model also enables the inclusion of various variables that may affect the observed population behavior allowing us to explore and experiment on the actual effect of these variables on the modeling and prediction abilities a more recent modeling of h armigera was conducted by feng et al 2010 in china in their complex model feng et al 2010 incorporated long range and directional migration host susceptibility and planting sequence pesticide effects upon all stages of development and resistance to pesticide as a factor related to the frequency of applications this complex model resulted in simulations that were well correlated with long term adult trapping data however the model is not suitable for forecasting population dynamics at the field level because it provides estimates of h armigera population at a rather too coarse spatial resolution each grid point representing an area of 2 by 2 feng et al 2010 moreover their use of an ambient temperature information from weather stations in the model limits its use because of the spatial discontinuity of the temperature data and the large effect it has on predicted populations as demonstrated in this study table 2 and table s1 and figs 4 5 and s1 s3 based on the results of our study and previous simulations blum et al 2015 we believe that the use of lst from satellites could highly benefit this type of sophisticated and complex modeling providing more accurate results and improved forecasting abilities both at short and long range spatial and temporal scales as shown here from the comparison of the model with lst vs that with the ambient temperature used as an input in contrast to previous modeling of h armigera our simulations were focused on a relatively small area and short period of time and investigated the effects of pesticide applications our study was mainly concentrated on the larval stage in contrast to adult population dynamics e g feng et al 2010 since the larvae population is the main cause of damage in agricultural crop fields only the larval population is currently monitored in ipm decisions adult monitoring was not applied in the investigated area the simulation of pesticide application reduced larval populations as expected in a realistic scheme i e in accordance with in situ observations however our model often forecasted a less realistic and more dramatic increase in larval populations compared to observations shortly after the pesticide application for example see figs 4 and 5 this most likely means that a conservative larvae mortality rate of 80 used in our model following pesticide application may be unrealistically low and that mortality of eggs and maybe of the adult population following pesticide application should also be considered in the model our modeling assumed a simple adult migration from tomato to corn fields based on previously observed movement preferences of h armigera in this region cohen et al 2015 migration was simulated to take place at each date without a fixed initial migration date which enabled a more elastic simulation of the model however it did not directly consider larvae movement due to feeding preferences for example cohen et al 2015 observed that the larva of h armigera prefers feeding on green immature tomatoes but not on red mature tomatoes this means that the h armigera adult population might move from fields with developed and mature crops to fields with yet undeveloped crops prior to the egg laying stage because the model was run independently of the plant development stage these preferences were not taken directly into consideration instead migration was applied at each day with a fixed ratio of the adult population moving from tomato to corn fields however and this may explain the better performance of the model with scenario b by initiating the model at the time of the first appearance of larvae in the crops i e as reported by the scouts we actually considered indirectly plant development stage and larva feeding preferences as it is assumed that the larva appearance is synchronized with green tomato and or corn tassel development stages although the simulations of the adult population migration were mainly shown to affect the larvae population size rather than its dynamics it realistically captured the timing of the peak in larvae population when compared to in situ observations h armigera was previously reported to be capable of migrating large distances of up to several tens to hundreds of kilometers per day feng et al 2010 however in this study migration was simulated only up to 1 km following previous observations in this area cohen et al 2015 migration from distant sources was probably less frequent in our case since this region has a limited agricultural production area different migration rates were shown here to affect the larvae population following pesticide applications fig 7 pesticide applications were modeled to kill only the larvae population but not the adult population or eggs this could have some unconsidered effects on the larvae population dynamics it might explain some of the discrepancies between modeled and observed larvae population dynamics at the end of the crop growing period fig 6 in conclusion we have presented here a continuous temperature driven age structured insect population model driven by satellite derived lst data the model captured well the insect population dynamics as well as the effect of pesticide application and adult population migration between neighboring fields moreover our model driven by satellite derived lst data outperformed the model that used ambient temperature from the nearest weather station this implies that the use of our proposed lst driven model should not be restricted to cases when weather information i e temperature is scarce or unavailable but rather as an alternative to the conventional use with ambient temperature as a driver even when such information is available finally our results were consistent with field observations showing the great potential of these kinds of models driven by real time satellite data in the use of ipm applications acknowledgments part of this research was supported by grant no 458 0534 11 from the chief scientist of the

g ward and esler 2011 mismanagement of livestock density in relation to the forage yield and quality of the pasture is most likely to occur in dry climates where production of primary biomass is highly erratic steinfeld et al 2006 as a result of high variability in precipitation due to their high temporal and spatial heterogeneity the complex behavior of the herbivore rangeland system in such landscapes is challenging when it comes to the prediction of effects of changes in management and or environmental conditions mccollum et al 2011 lohmann 2012 which is a precondition for the sustainable utilization of natural resources in these zones the effects of unadapted herbivory on rangelands can have dramatic long term impacts on the functions of the whole rangeland ecosystem laca 2009 leading to a reduction of primary productivity in general and palatable plant species in particular illius and o connor 1999 czegledi and radacsi 2005 which in consequence results in dissatisfying performance of the herbivores in traditional animal husbandry mitigation of these effects has been accomplished by the implementation of different grazing strategies such as rotational grazing stafford smith 1996 adaptive herd management or nomadic pastoralism where continuously controlled herd movements allow exploiting grazing resources in a very sustainable way by tracking the temporal and spatial dynamics in resource availability particularly in arid regions where high fluctuations in quantity and quality of feed and water resources require a high level of mobility the recent boost in human population combined with restricted access to rangelands as a result of lack of land ownership or clearly defined and respected use rights has increased the pressure on the currently available foraging grounds and the risks of an unsustainable utilization of these natural resources e g hobbs et al 2008 thereby these additional challenges for the utilization of rangelands demand a further increase in herd mobility involving extra energy expense for movements in search of feed or alternatively an increase in productivity at reduced space and new adaptive strategies in grazing management while extensive knowledge on grazing management is available for regions with temperate climate expertise in management and ecology of rangelands in arid environments is still relatively poor boval and dixon 2012 a major reason for this scientific shortcoming is the high level of unpredictability involved which complicates the conclusive definition of the relevant ecosystem processes the involved drivers and the respective interactions the high spatial and temporal variability in forage quality and availability in dryland pastures has been claimed to furthermore limit the advances in our understanding of the processes in these ecosystems o reagain 2001 beukes et al 2002 mcivor 2011 jakoby et al 2015 in tropical and subtropical countries pastures and crop residues constitute the main nutrient resource for ruminants lazzarini et al 2009 as a result of the short growth period for vegetation tropical grasses usually embed increased amounts of cell wall compounds e g lignin thereby in combination with low protein contents providing feed of restricted digestibility leng 1990 brown 1999 the marked decline in feed quality as a result of fast maturation of such grasses has been identified as one of the main limiting factors to animal production in the tropics van soest 1982 leng 1984 fernandez rivera et al 2005 but has been ignored in many rangeland models so far e g martin et al 2014 accatino et al 2017 but see rasch et al 2016 traditionally focus factors considered in rangeland and grazing management are stocking density animal species as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of forage offer however only few attempts have yet been made to integrate spatial heterogeneity e g derner et al 2012 and non linear scaling e g laca 2009 although landscape ecology studies have revealed many years ago the potential effects of landscape patch configuration on individual animal s movement and the reciprocal effects of herbivores on landscape heterogeneity e g moen et al 1998 with et al 1999 marion et al 2005 high resource heterogeneity one of the characteristic factors of rangelands and the according grazing systems in arid and semi arid environments is a key factor determining the dynamics of large herbivores and the landscape laca 2009 as the spatial distribution of resources and selective feeding behavior of herbivores strongly affect their movement from grazing bout to landscape scale carvalho et al 2011 it has proved to represent an important factor for grazing efficiency and therefore also foraging productivity wallis de vries 1996 dijkman and lawrence 1997 jung et al 2002 yet the impact of spatial forage heterogeneity on herbivore nutrient intake and thereby productivity is still poorly understood marion et al 2005 the application of ecological modeling has been proved to be a valuable tool to study complex processes weisberg et al 2006 especially regarding its potential to predict reactions of systems on altered environmental conditions since 1970 numerous models have been developed focusing on various ecological and economic aspects of rangelands and grazing management with a broad range of approaches and purposes e g coughenour 1993 beecham and farnsworth 1998 derry 1998 diaz solis et al 2003 adler and hall 2005 macopiyo 2005 rufino et al 2009 kuckertz et al 2011 as tietjen and jeltsch 2007 stated in their review on models for semi arid grazing systems basically all models lacked the consideration of climatic variability e g the ability to resolve changes in intra annual precipitation jakoby et al 2015 this issue is particularly challenging when aiming at assessing the effect of future climate changes on livestock production systems in sub saharan countries predictions for these countries not only indicate a general decrease in precipitation and therefore in length of the growth period of vegetation but also an increase in temporal variability and change in precipitation distribution thornton et al 2006 thornton et al 2007 rust and rust 2013 it is furthermore remarkable that the integration of the climate dependent dynamics of resources quantity their nutritive quality and their spatial arrangement in a rangeland model for analysis of their effects on grazing herbivores has to our knowledge never been accomplished deterministic mechanical models often over simplify spatial variability and fall short of being fully spatially explicit nonaka and holme 2007 these models are furthermore hardly able to embody complex event driven dynamics and non equilibrium ecosystem dynamics two further characteristics of ecological processes in arid and semi arid environments cipriotti et al 2012 agent based models abms currently represent the most promising possibility to overcome these limitations by supporting dynamic adaptive relations between individual mobile entities and the integration of stochastic events in a spatially explicit context wiegand et al 1995 grimm and railsback 2005 grimm et al 2005 while some abms have been developed to simulate different specific aspects of rangeland ecology macopiyo 2005 müller et al 2007 kuckertz et al 2011 rasch et al 2016 the dynamics of climate vegetation and foraging herbivores have rarely been integrated within a habitat and rangeland management model modeling approaches to combine vegetation characteristics with animal behavior and movement and metabolic productivity in a spatially explicit manner to incorporate important dryland aspects such as spatial heterogeneity are missing so far this paper therefore aims to broaden the understanding of ecological aspects in rangeland and herd management in semi arid environments using an agent based approach we developed a spatially explicit model integrating energetic implications of animal movements to assess the potential of highly dynamic heterogeneous semi arid rangeland for adaptive livestock production main focus of the model is to account for the specific processes in rangeland based livestock production systems in dry zones and to assess the dynamics in system performance as such we incorporated a seasonal forage quality b spatially heterogeneous forage distribution and c the effect of climatic variability on forage resources for the development of ramdry rangeland model in drylands data from a semi arid region in southwestern madagascar has been integrated however ramdry uses a modular data structure which explicitly promotes its applicability for any other arid or semi arid rangeland area due to the complexity of the model this publication provides a description of the model considering free ranging conditions excluding any active influences on animal movements by herders nevertheless we would like to note that the model has by its agents based concept been specifically developed to integrate active herding strategies and interactive behavior between herders animals and the vegetation in this paper we first give a short introduction to the exemplary study region in madagascar followed by the general description of our model conforming to the extended version of the standardized odd overview design concepts and details protocol for individual respectively agent based models grimm and railsback 2005 grimm et al 2010 to identify critical input data we then assess the consequences of the different model parameters on the model outcomes within detailed local as well as global sensitivity analysis following recommendations of wiegand et al 2003 and grimm et al 2005 for complex systems we applied a pattern oriented model validation approach where emerging non implied patterns in model variables are evaluated and discussed the extensively parameterizable character of the model enables its use for i a wide range of applications ii testing various potential scenarios and or iii easy implementation of further alternative ruminant species such as sheep which will be part of future work nevertheless to highlight the potentials of the model we feature two exemplary study cases underlining its pioneering performance with regard to effects of future climatic changes and heterogeneity in resource distribution we show preliminary results of the simple effect of a reduced growth period shortened by 20 as predicted for the year 2050 for the study area thornton et al 2007 we further present some aspects of the effects of heterogeneous versus homogeneous spatial distribution of resources at equivalent total available forage biomass demonstrating thereby the importance of incorporating correct spatial resource arrangements in spatially explicit models in its current form ramdry allows the assessment of parameters for a sustainable use of foraging resources and the overall productivity of the system the model thereby has the potential to become an analytical tool that can be used to foster local food security and household economy of livestock keepers who exploit multiple repositories of grazing resources in marginal semi arid environments in the tropics and sub tropics 1 1 study region the region from which data has been used for the development of the model is located in the southwestern corner of madagascar the mahafaly region fig 1 is characterized by arid steppe climate with an annual mean temperature of 24 c 500 mm of annual precipitation and a dry season usually lasting from march to october throughout the last few years however a shift of the seasons of about two months has been registered ratovomanana et al 2013 as a result of the low and highly seasonal precipitation pattern the vegetation is dominated by deciduous spiny forest xerophytic bushland and savannah and vegetation cover in the area is heavily structured and shows a high degree of patchiness to capture most of the effects of this small scale heterogeneous distribution of resources our model focuses on the situation of the pastoral zebu cattle based livestock systems within the surrounding 100 km2 of one representative model village miarantsoa fig 2 including two grassland communities with differing forage qualities and maturation dynamics 2 model description the model description follows the extended odd protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2010 a detailed description of the processes and submodels can be found in the appendix and the model code is freely available through the model library of the openabm net https www openabm org model 5860 the model was implemented in netlogo 5 2 0 wilensky 1999 2 1 purpose the purpose of ramdry is to understand on the landscape level the parameters for a sustainable and effective utilization of rangelands within a semi arid environment and how management or environmental changes affect the herbivore grassland system on the basis of long termed simulation that integrates data of future climate scenarios conditions and management strategies for a sustainable use of foraging resources can be assessed and the productivity of the livestock production system is evaluated by applying a scenario based analysis approach the assessment is based on changes in animal numbers and body weights as functions of the initial stocking rate the spatial distribution of grazing resources and rainy season precipitation affecting vegetation growth and quality by this assessment the system s maximum potential secondary productivity is evaluated as well as its tipping point from which on unsustainable overgrazing occurs taking into account the seasonal dynamics of rangeland productivity in dry regions the model is supposed to support decision making processes in grazing management with specific focus on savannah ecosystems on the mahafaly plateau in southwestern madagascar the model is particularly suited to simulate the effects of a temporally and spatially regulated grazing b dynamics in animal stocking rates c predicted climatic changes and d usage of multiple forage resources with differing qualities and maturation dynamics on primary and secondary productivity 2 2 entities state variables and scales ramdry incorporates three sorts of entities two agent types herds and water points and environmental spatial cells a complete list of the defining state variables of the entities including the corresponding units is shown in tables s1 s3 mobile agents represent foraging herds of zebu cattle bos indicus the herd composition in terms of sex and age of the individual herd animals is kept constant throughout the simulation and animal specific metabolic calculations are based on a herd representing non pregnant adult female animal the representative the total number of agents in the model is variable which thereby allows for temporary changes e g as a result of seasonal transhumance movements the state variables defining the individual agents include their location number of animals metabolic fitness characteristics such as the body weight or live weight both terms are used interchangeably body condition score and potential milk production of the representative animal further state variables describe behavior related indicators such as feeding strategy i e selective or non selective feeding and feed patch selection strategy high quality feed patch or any as well as values for the metabolizable energy balance calculation e g energy costs for movement feeding activities and energy gain by grazing further productivity history of the individual agents is defined by the number of days consecutively passed either loosing or gaining weight a complete overview of the state variables of the mobile agents is shown in table s1 water point agents are non mobile entities representing water sources in the landscape they have only a symbolic function to store information about the various water resources and to interact with the mobile agents they are defined by their location type of source temporary or permanent their current availability as water resource and their current and maximum water holding capacity table s2 lists the different state variables and their corresponding units for the water point agents spatial patches represent areas with a certain type of land cover i e road barren land cropland grassland and areas dominated by shrubs or forest to be able to interact with the mobile agents they are defined as a continuous mosaic of square sized grid cells representing the model world located in the center of the cell mosaic is the village fig 2 embodying therein the corral night stay of the herd agents the state variables of the patches define the location the cost distance from the village based on the optimal movement path vegetation type and in case of grassland vegetation the type of grass species community as outlined in fig 2 as well as the state of the resources found there the state of the resources is as such changing in function of natural seasonal regrowth and maturation and is characterized by the amount of green biomass and necromass per area as indicators for the available forage quantity and their respective dry matter digestibilities dmd defining the resource quality the various state variables of the spatial patches are listed in table s3 the scales of the model define its spatial and temporal range and resolution one simulated time step represents one day and simulations are run up to 20 years equal to 7300 daily time steps to be able to simulate daily movements of animals of 10 15 km as reported by feldt and schlecht 2016 the total spatial extent of the model landscape was defined as an area of 10 km 10 km as a compromise between high resolution to capture the heterogeneous landscape character best and acceptable computing time the model landscape consists of 111 111 square grid cells measuring 90 m 90 m each 2 3 process overview and scheduling after the initial simulation setup within each time step starting in the morning of a day ramdry goes through 8 major processes which are all executed sequentially fig 3 processes 4 9 are as such run for each mobile agent successively while the order of the processed agents is kept fixed based on their individual internal id numbers in climate season as the first process in the cycle the type of the prevailing season growing dry is evaluated based on the predicted precipitation data based on the current type of season the variables of spatial patches are updated in a second step vegetation growth maturation describing the natural changes in vegetation in the course of the year thus depending on the season during the growth season exponential growing functions define the regrowth of fresh green biomass at highest dmd levels in grassland cells while maturation processes during the dry season result in an exponential decrease of green biomass simultaneously throughout the dry season the digestibility of this organic resource is decreasing following a linear gradient the total amount of available metabolizable energy is thereafter calculated accordingly for each grid cell based on the relative proportions of green and dry forage and their respective dmds in the subsequent process forage site selection the mobile agent is selecting a random but spatially restricted start point in line with the actual feeding strategy for foraging for the day and moves to the selected location as described in detail in the annex a1 7 4 the model is thereat calculating the time spent for the movements and the residual daily time available for foraging activities depending on the current feeding strategy a grazing path through the pasture is simulated in the process feed intake based on decision rule based animal movement behavior herd agents will follow patches with highest plant biomass density within their cognitive horizon aiming at maximizing energy intake as outlined in annex a1 4 and a1 7 5 4 the according amount of forage consumed is calculated taking into account the available time and biomass of the selected feed resource s in the different grid cells passed during the movement following the grazing path as well as the fill level of the animals gastrointestinal tract gut as a result of these foraging activities by the mobile agents removal of green biomass and necromass is then being evaluated for each grid cell along the grazing path in the subsequent process plant biomass adjustment the state variables of the patches are adjusted accordingly i e through the reduction of their respective available biomass in the following process animal energy balance the energy balance is calculated for the mobile agent considering the amount of metabolizable energy gained through the foraging process and all sources of energy cost i e for metabolic maintenance growth and movement based on the results of this energy balance calculation the body weight of the mobile agent is adjusted by converting excess energy into body tissue fat or protein depending on whether the current weight is below or above the standard reference weight i e the animals of the herd are under or overweight or by mobilizing energy from body tissue reserves upon a negative energy balance respectively the history of these body weight changes is recorded in order to adapt feeding and forage selection strategies accordingly prolonged periods of weight loss will for example result in a change from selective to non selective feeding behavior of the mobile agents check the detailed description of the sub processes in the annex for more information about the animal s feeding behavior in herd fitness as a final process of the mobile agents in the process cycle a body condition score as an index of animal fitness is calculated based on the ratio of current body weight of the agent and its reference weight in function of the resulting body condition score herd productivity in terms of reproduction and mortality rates is calculated and herd size adjusted accordingly finally in water balance the water requirement of the animal herd is evaluated taking influences of ambient temperature walking activities and daily dry matter intake into consideration the required amount of drinking water per day is in case of a temporary character of the selected water point lastly subtracted from the currently held water amount of the respective water point agent in case of dropping below minimum water amount the water point will be designated as non available until the onset of the next growth season for more details and model information please refer to the complete odd protocol provided in the annex 3 methods 3 1 general considerations about simulation analysis as a compromise between computing time and consideration of accumulative effects of foraging behavior and success of the animal throughout multiple sequences of dry and wet growth seasons the model analysis is based on the results after a period of three consecutive years of simulation to exclude additional variability of model results induced by erratic climatic influences from model analysis we employed an exemplary periodic seasonal climate as recorded in the period 06 2012 06 2013 keeping the duration of growth and dry seasons constant throughout the simulated years and inducing a growth period length of 78 days per year growth length table b1 because of the stochastic processes of the model the estimation of experimental error variance has first been assessed as proposed by lorscheid et al 2012 results of monte carlo sampling as requested for the stochastic processes of abms lee et al 2015 by repeated simulation runs with identical parameter values which we repeated multiple times indicated that the simulation needs to be run at least nine times repeatedly to ensure a continuous decrease in the standard deviation of herd weight at the end of the third year between herds with any additional simulation exemplary output fig 4 as a result all further analyses are based on averaged results of ten repeated 3 year simulations 3 2 sensitivity analysis the high number of model parameters and their complex interacting effects in ramdry rendered manual parameter space exploration challenging as predicted by lee et al 2015 to explore the effect size of variation of the parameters and identify the most influential ones sensitivity analysis was performed in a two step manner starting with a local inspection by traditional sensitivity functions ernstberger 2008 followed by an improved morris screening morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 of the most influential parameters according to the recommendations of lilburne and tarantola 2009 for large models for the purpose of comparison between the results of the model output in function of the values of the different altered parameters and their combinations initial herd size and herd number was kept constant throughout the analysis involving one single herd with 50 animals as our model is focusing on the productivity of the livestock system the sum of body weights of all individual animals of the herds was chosen as indicator of the system s productivity therefore in the context of the sensitivity analysis the main output of the simulation was defined as the total weight of the herd given by the agent s state parameter herdweight primarily local sensitivity analysis applying a one at a time oat approach has been executed on the 33 parameters listed in table b2 each value of these model parameters was varied in a range of 20 i e for 0 10 20 swartzman and kaluzny 1987 or where additional data sources could be found in literature within accordingly extended or reduced ranges model results were checked for linearity within the tested parameter range using linear regression and visual assessment to identify localized increased sensitivity statistical significance of the individual parameters on the model result was furthermore tested using linear regression analysis in r r core team 2015 result analysis incorporating the whole parameter set was conducted applying a general linear model glm in the r package lme4 bates et al 2015 based on the relative sensitivity of the model towards the assessed parameters parameters with relative sensitivity above 50 thereby deemed sensitive jackson et al 2000 have been included in the subsequent morris screening because of the high computational requirements of the long term simulations the application of parameter screening methods has proved to be advantageous due to their improved efficiency and capability of handling large data sets thiele et al 2014 the morris elementary effects ee screening method morris 1991 is particularly suited for agent based models as it is free of any assumption it is based on an individual randomized oat design varying the input parameters randomly over a predefined range estimating thereby the effects of parameter variation contrarily to the precedent individual oat based analysis this ee analysis avoids to resume to baseline values for each parameter expanding thereby the multidimensional parameter space to allow global sensitivity analysis iooss and lemaître 2014 morris screening was performed in r using the sensitivity package pujol et al 2015 we applied morris s oat design morris 1991 following screening procedures as described by thiele et al 2014 using ten repetitions and five levels for all sensitive parameters the parameter ranges were defined similar to the local sensitivity approach except for minor range reductions for certain parameters to ensure minimal margin between their respective minimum and maximum levels the assessed parameters and the ranges are listed in table b3 morris sensitivity indices were calculated according to the euclidean distance of the absolute mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the elementary effects as suggested by beaudouin et al 2015 the absolute mean μ of the elementary effects is thereby a measure of influence of the individual input parameter on the output while the standard deviation represents the level of non linearity of the parameters and or interaction effects with other parameters 3 3 pattern oriented model validation for simplicity reasons the presented model simulates free ranging condition of zebu herds as encountered in many semi arid sub tropical grazing systems e g sahel mongolia at least during parts of the year however livestock management in the mahafaly region is characterized by active herding of ruminants on pastures feldt and schlecht 2016 this leads to the lack of real data for direct validation of the model results an obstacle observed in many bottom up models of complex system wiegand et al 2003 we therefore adapted the strategy of pattern oriented modeling pom to test for realism of model structure and mechanisms as suggested by grimm et al 2005 due to their respective importance for the modeled system we focused on three known distinct patterns a the seasonal fluctuation of body weight of free ranging ruminants as a response to changes in forage availability and quality b the constraint in system productivity resulting in reduced carrying capacity of the grazing environment at increased grazing intensities until the complete break down after exceeding the tipping point of the foraging system and c the seasonal changes in movement related energy costs for ruminants during foraging as a result of restricted resource availability in particular towards the end of the dry season for assessing the seasonal changes of body weight daily data on body weight of the animals has been retrieved from the model and seasonal changes compared to data from similar environments schlecht unpublished data zimmermann 1980 kebreab et al 2005 as observed by fernandez rivera et al 2005 see fig 1 therein the expected pattern was supposed to display an increase in body weight after the onset of the rainy season as a result of the available fresh nutrient rich forage resource which ceases after the end of the growth season when fresh feed becomes depleted and or more lignified during the dry season animals were supposed to lose weight in response to low feed quality and availability for the evaluation of the second pattern the influence of foraging intensity on long term system productivity has been assessed by comparing the initial sum of weights of all animals to the weight sum after three years therefore multiple simulation runs with varying initial values for herd sizes and herd numbers have been conducted by increasing foraging intensity above the resource limits of the ecological system we assessed the tipping point condition identifying thereby the theoretical carrying capacity of the system and its ecological overshoot the expected outcome was a pattern comparable to the seneca cliff as described by bardi 2011 to assess effects of low forage availability on increased walking activities of the animals in search for food energy costs related to walking during foraging were compared between different stages of the seasons e g early or late dry season the daily energy cost associated with movement averaged over seven days at the beginning and the end of the dry season should exhibit distinct differences as e g indicated by fernandez rivera et al 2005 energy costs for movement were analyzed on the basis of movement distance differences between the track length distances in the two seasonal stages were compared by t test analysis using r to display the effect of spatial heterogeneity in forage distribution on movement related energy cost dynamics comparative simulations with homogeneous forage distribution and an equal total amount of green forage biomass have been conducted according to previous studies on the effect of spatial simplification in foraging systems marion et al 2005 homogeneous resource distribution was expected to result in an under estimation of the optimal stocking density due to an increased energy cost for movement in search of feed 4 results 4 1 general model results fig 5 shows the dynamics in daily gain costs of metabolic energy and the overall daily energy balance in the course of a normal year for a healthy mature female animal in case of low intensive grazing pressure as an example of the model output it clearly displays periods of net energy loss when the overall energy balance is negative and of net energy gain furthermore it indicates the relative importance of the various components of the metabolic energy balance whereby energy costs for maintenance represent the most important factor in the calculation 475 kj kg0 75 mbw metabolic body weight compared to energy costs for movement from to forage grounds which are on average 80 4 kj kg0 75 mbw sd 25 4 kj kg0 75 mbw throughout the year energy costs related to movement feature a constant general trend as a result of the low intensity of grazing pressure applied the seasonal variation in energy gain by feeding of a mature female animal throughout and between seasons as displayed in fig 5 is partly a result of changes in daily dry matter intake dmi dmi of a female of 200 kg mean body weight fluctuated between 4 89 kg and 2 28 kg while the yearly average was 3 66 kg sd 0 49 kg remarkably a major driver for this fluctuation in dmi has been the seasonal variation of forage digestibility limiting the voluntary intake as described in paragraph a1 7 5 of the annex underlining thereby the pre eminent significance of this parameter on the productivity of the livestock husbandry system as further highlighted in the results of the sensitivity analysis 4 2 sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 local sensitivity functions the absolute sensitivity of the 33 tested parameters ranged from 0 07 to 273 table b4 albeit for only eleven parameters the individual regression analysis indicated statistical significance p 0 05 for linearity coefficients of determination from linear regression analysis of the statistically significant parameters ranged between 0 88 and 0 99 whereby eight parameters indicated high sensitivity values above 50 within the assessed range table 1 most of the parameters with high sensitivity displayed a high level of linearity with r2 values above 0 9 the only exception was the influence of parameter highdigesth that followed a unimodal trend giving minimum model results for a parameter value 10 below the standard value fig 6 the results of the glm showed 19 parameters to be statistically significant the results furthermore underlined the importance of the influence of the eight previously scaled parameters that exhibited highest sensitivity as they also featured highest estimates in the glm table b5 none of the analyzed parameters exhibited any sign of significant correlation 0 1 4 2 2 morris screening the two forage resource parameters lowdigesth and highdigesth which define the respective maximum digestibility of the two forage qualities had a very dominant overall influence on total system productivity as the assessed model output fig 7 in the morris screening the high impact of these two parameters in the morris screening is mainly the effect of their minimum values which in combination with unfavorable foraging or metabolic parameter values resulted in a strong reduction of animal productivity i e increasing the risk of fast loss of weight and death from starvation fig 8 parameter combinations that lead to fatal conditions resulting in final total herd weights below 500 kg and as such in the death of most animals are listed in the auxiliary table s6 remarkably all of those combinations include very low levels of the two mentioned digestibility related parameters similar absolute values of the mean μ and the absolute mean μ of the elementary effects of all parameters with the exception of grossenergy fig 7 indicate that these effects are mostly monotonic positive signs of μ of the parameters lowdigesth highdigesth and herdincreaseratebig thereby signal their positive influence on total herd weight in contrast to the other five parameters which were exhibiting negative signs for μ all tested parameters showed strong links between the absolute mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the elementary effects fig 9 4 3 pattern oriented model validation a seasonal fluctuation of body weight as expected body weight of the simulated zebus within one herd exhibited distinct changes over the course of a year as displayed for a female adult animal in fig 10 the oscillation followed the seasonal changes of precipitation respectively the quality of the feed resources fig 10 which was tightly linked to the rainfall pattern the resulting peak amplitude of the oscillation was 12 kg at an average body weight of 197 kg under normal environmental conditions as recorded during the period 2012 2013 and low grazing intensity b system tipping point fig 11 shows the change of long term productivity of the livestock based system in response to initial grazing intensities the sum of the body weights of all animals in the simulated herds after three simulated years with normal climatic conditions increased constantly with increasing initial total herd weight exhibiting only a marginal trend to saturation of the system up to an initial herd weight value of 490 000 kg sd 14 249 kg when maximum sustainable production under constant conditions was reached at a grazing intensity equivalent to an initial total herd weight above 500 000 kg the system started to get over exploited and above this threshold a steep drop in the productivity curve was salient this trend was independent of the spatial dispersion of the grazing load i e it was observed likewise for different levels of individual herd size despite the difference in environmental conditions and thereby level of values the comparison with results reviewed by aiken 2016 as outlined in fig 12 shows the high level of analogy of the observed productivity curve with the results of our simulation the outcome of an analogous analysis of long term productivity indicates a sharp decrease in livestock system performance when applying modified future climatic conditions that result in a shortened annual growth period length of 63 days fig 13 the constant linearly increasing trend ends above an initial herd weight of 120 000 kg and the tipping point of the system is reached at an initial herd weight value of 320 000 kg c seasonal changes in forage movement related energy costs the length of the herds daily itineraries tracks during foraging activities showed seasonal variation particularly after the switch to the non selective feeding strategy in the early dry season tracks were generally shorter compared to tracks from the end of the dry season as a result of the higher area density of heretofore unused low quality forage biomass after the rains the averaged value for daily track length in the week starting 9 june day 160 of year which often corresponded with the period immediately after the strategy switch was 1 286 m sd 225m in the case of low grazing pressure by animals of a total body weight of initially 40 841 kg 5 herds 50 animals per herd at the end of the dry season animals under this grazing regime moved on average 1 749 m per day sd 269m for foraging although this difference may seem small it has proved to be statistically significant p 0 005 however the effect of increased movement activities as a result of search for resources feed and water obviously gains importance only when resources get sparse at high grazing pressure the importance of this effect increased tremendously when access to resources was constrained fig 14 for grazing animals of a total body weight of initially 551 357 kg 45 herds 75 animals per herd daily track length in the corresponding week in june averaged 1 144 m sd 162 m and increased to 9 386 m sd 7 001 m towards the end of the dry season p 0 02 for the purpose of displaying the loss of accessible resources during the dry season fig 14 exemplarily includes the dynamic changes of track length resulting in according variability in energy costs related to movement as well as the available dry forage biomass in heteropogon dominated grassland under the two extreme grazing regimes interestingly independent of the maximum heteropogon necromass area density that was reached during the corresponding growth season forage track lengths at high grazing intensity consistently started to increase sharply during the following dry season as soon as mean heteropogon necromass area density fell below 1 850 kg dm ha fig 14 furthermore shows track length dynamics in case of spatially homogeneous forage distribution as compared to the real heterogeneous distribution tracks executed under homogeneous forage distribution at high grazing pressure were on average 15 longer than those encountered with heterogeneous forage distribution p 0 001 particularly during the last section of the dry season 5 discussion the analysis of the results of our spatially explicit rangeland model validated the chosen concept based on the dynamic availability and use of metabolizable energy in rangelands by ruminants and the involved digestive and metabolic processes ramdry has thereby proved the importance of integrating forage quality spatial distribution of resources and appropriate detail level for climatic conditions as well as their dynamics in assessments of livestock rangeland systems within semi arid environments because of the low quality of forage resources that prevails in tropical and sub tropical drylands for up to nine months per year the incorporation of diet quality in the assessment of the long term productivity of rangeland livestock systems is of high importance as such our model increases its potential of projecting the effects of climatic variability and management changes on rangeland based livestock production systems in comparison with alternative rangeland models implemented so far which are focusing primarily on available forage biomass e g calabrese et al 2011 martin et al 2014 ramdry furthermore allows studying the consequences of spatio temporal variability in both resource availability and quality on rangeland utilization which has been mostly lacking in existing models derner et al 2012 this is of particular importance in view of the urgent need for understanding the mechanisms of dryland dynamics as stated by lohmann et al 2012 the temporally high energy costs related to movement of grazing animals in search for food within heterogeneous environments has been depicted in other studies e g jung et al 2002 despite its importance in the metabolic energy balance of grazing animals which has been confirmed by the results of our model it has so far been largely ignored in current rangeland management models e g jakoby et al 2015 by the integration of complementary effects of precipitation and grazing on the growth decay and disappearance of vegetation forage and their high levels of heterogeneity our dynamic agent based modeling approach is well suited for the assessment of reactions of grassland ecosystem in non equilibrium state gillson and hoffman 2007 as e g semi arid savannas on changes in resource utilization 5 1 modeling approach in order to adjust the complexity of our model into the medawar zone the optimal zone between too much simplification and over complexity grimm et al 2005 we had to omit several ecological details of dryland systems influencing the suitability of the model for certain applications or conditions beside the challenges in analysis of complex ecosystem models calabrese et al 2011 computing power and lack of suitable validation data were the major constraints we were confronted with to keep the model complexity as low as possible for the target applications model development has thereby been performed in a step wise manner gradually increasing complexity by additional sub processes until ramdry was able to reproduce the dynamics we had been aiming for and the interdependencies we perceived based on own field work in semi arid african grazing systems and international literature in contrast to other grazing related studies focusing on processes in semi arid environments our model represents the vegetation by plant species communities instead of an agglomeration of individual species e g coughenour 1993 weber et al 1998 fynn and o connor 2000 adler et al 2001 or functional types e g lohmann et al 2012 the level of detail in our model was primarily restricted by the spatial scale of our landscape level approach that covers a large area of 100 km2 at a spatial resolution of 90 m and the lack of detailed data on the abundance and selective consumption of individual grassland plant species by the foragers instead of taking the risk of unreasonably high levels of uncertainty in our predictions we defined the features of the different species communities by their respective dominant species i e heteropogon contortus and aristida adscensionis which have also been identified as principal fodder plants for zebu cattle in the region marp 2011 feldt 2015 we are aware that this simplification leads inter alia to the inability of the model to assess changes in plant species composition as a result of grazing as observed in other studies e g snyman 1998 savadogo 2007 tietjen and jeltsch 2007 this would have required further long term field observations in the study area effects of soil parameters on the vegetation growth are considered via the locally adjusted regrowth rates which have been defined on the basis of remote sensed data on biomass distribution we accepted current local growth conditions as static founded e g on the level of soil compaction soil depth its potential of water retention or and nutrient availability therefore effects of change in soil nutrient content e g by fertilization or erosion or impact of over utilization through trampling or rain use efficiency ruppert et al 2012 cannot be assessed by the current model as such accumulative effects of forage utilization are limited to effective grazing intensity effects of continuous over utilization such as change in grass species composition bush encroachment reduced soil fertility as reported by many studies and reviewed by czegledi and radacsi 2005 cannot be represented in the current version of the model reducing as such its applicability in long term studies on land degradation processes as these effects highly rely on detailed soil information which is often not available in the requested resolution we decided to ignore these processes from the current model nevertheless we consider the integration of dynamically adjustable threshold values max min for forage digestibility to simulate vegetation degradation processes in future versions of the model the representation of spatial and temporal distribution of above ground biomass by the use of remotely sensed vegetation indices has been widely studied and sometimes criticized for sensitivity to soil influences particularly in semi arid rangelands reviews by eisfelder et al 2011 jacques et al 2014 other studies identified e g ndvi as reliable tool for monitoring semi arid areas pettorelli et al 2005 egeru et al 2014 comparing the prediction accuracy of several vegetation indices with observations we found ndvi the most appropriate for the studied environment to circumvent the mentioned challenges our approach linked individual remote sensing based estimation of green above ground biomass for different soil types with according time series of field measurements antsonantenainarivony 2017 which might however limit direct portability for other regions eisfelder et al 2010 5 2 general model results energy cost of walking can constitute a big proportion of daily energy need of grazing ruminants dijkman and lawrence 1997 our model results on movement costs of free ranging animals of 80 4 kj kg0 75 mbw are comparable with measurements on grazing cows in literature which estimated daily energy costs for idle walking between 84 5 and 92 4 kj kg0 75 mbw brosh et al 2010 while topography in our study region was simple and has therefore not been implemented the experimental sites of brosh et al 2010 were hilly increasing thereby a cattle s energy costs for movement variability in our results however was higher sd 25 4 kj kg0 75 mbw supposedly as a result of the random selection of foraging sites from a large area in our model as compared to the confined experimental plots of the study of brosh and colleagues total daily energy costs for all activities constituted around 15 20 of the maintenance energy requirements in our model which matched the trend of studies on grazing cattle from argentina that reported increments of 12 29 depending primarily on the grazing intensity di marco and aello 2001 the resulting daily intake of dry matter from our model 41 94 g dm kg0 75 mbw 72 9 g dm kg0 75 mbw in average aligned with results of previous studies on zebu cattle in the sahel reporting a forage intake of 62 9 86 3 g dm kg0 75 mbw per day ayantunde et al 2002 5 3 sensitivity analysis results of local sensitivity analysis revealed a strong trend of linearity in the model linear regression coefficients of determination of 0 88 and higher for all significant parameters indicate a high level of model stability the only parameter displaying a unimodal tendency the maximum digestibility value of green high quality forage is showing a slight increasing effect at low values the explanation for such a model behavior most probably lies in the very prompt switching from supposed selective high quality foraging to non selective feeding in response to the apparent negative daily energy balance during selective feeding behavior in such a parameter configuration the low levels of digestibility for the high quality forage are in fact lower than the digestibility of the low quality forage according to our model analysis quality appears to be the only feature of vegetation as feed resource namely in terms of its digestibility and gross energy content which is significantly influencing system productivity this might seem astonishing as the amount of vegetation biomass does not appear to give statistically significant effects on the modeled productivity however it must be kept in mind that sensitivity analysis has been performed at conditions of low grazing pressure where the effect of restricted biomass availability is only minor while gross energy content of tropical forage resources has been extensively assessed e g jarrige 1989 and found to be relatively constant king 1983 the digestibility of tropical forage plants exhibits a high intra annual and species specific variability van soest 1982 we therefore analyzed multiple vegetation samples taken at different seasonal stages for their respective in vitro digestibility menke et al 1979 including species specific n 340 and mixed species samples n 29 and compared them with literature data feldt et al 2017 fust unpubl mixed species analysis including all plant species found on the mahafaly pastures in their respective proportion however gave very poor digestibility results data not shown as all above ground plant parts and species had been non selectively collected for credibility reasons we therefore concluded to rely on digestibility values from well established databases heuzé et al 2015a 2015b hence for the application of our model in other study areas we strongly recommend a detailed feed quality analysis including extensive sampling of the major forage species whenever possible although using scaled parameters for easier interpretation the results of the morris screening indicate extremely high model sensitivity on the forage quality parameters in terms of low values for the maximum digestibilities of the two major grass species i e parameters highdigesth and lowdigesth morris screening is a technique particularly adapted for models with large numbers of parameters or long computational run times sumner et al 2012 as such capable of providing information about qualitative sensitivity by ranking the parameters by their importance however this method is not adapted for quantitative comparison of sensitivity between parameters campolongo et al 2005 close assessment of the influence of the two most prominent parameters showed that the extreme effects at lowest values took place only in interaction with other parameters when multiple parameters were set at levels that resulted in unfavorable conditions for metabolic processes pasture and herd productivity particularly the combination of extremely low maximum digestibilities of all forage resources proved to provide fatal conditions resulting in the death of most animals table s6 the high standard deviation values of the elementary effects σ of parameters tested in the morris screening that are comparable with the values of their respective absolute means μ can be interpreted as the result from an elevated level of interaction with other parameters campolongo et al 2005 rather than from their non linear effects thiele et al 2014 underlining thereby the interwoven and complex influence of these variables 5 4 pattern oriented model validation a seasonal fluctuation of body weight the observed dynamics of body weight change of the animals in the course of a year represented perfectly the findings of prior studies zimmermann 1980 found similar effects of changes in forage digestibility on the body weight of cattle in south africa concluding that a minimum digestibility of 53 was needed for maintenance without weight loss the yearly variation of the body weight of 12 in our model is well in the range recorded in other studies that reported seasonal weight losses of up to 20 during periods of under nutrition as a result of low forage availability and quality matulis et al 1987 schlecht et al 1999 kebreab et al 2005 the lower body weight variation level in our model is a result of the modeled seasonal changes in feed digestibility which are smaller than in comparable studies e g fernandez rivera et al 2005 comparison of the model results with data from cattle in the sahel schlecht unpublished data exhibited identical pattern dynamics fig 15 shows the averaged seasonal body weight fluctuation of female cattle in niger in 1997 1998 and the according periods of rain we overlaid the model result timely adjusted for simultaneous rain periods and found similar temporal dynamics resulting e g in the maximal body weight being reached about two months after the end of the rainy season because of the differences in feed digestibility between the measured and the model data and its effect on weight variation as outlined above calculation of goodness of fit of the two curves has not been performed weight changes as a result of changes in forage resources as described by mclean et al 1983 however cannot be simulated by the current model as proportions of the different body components and organs relative to total body weight have not been explicitly implemented b system tipping point according to our model the maximum number of zebu cattle that can sustainably be kept within the study area under continuously normal precipitation conditions would be around 3 000 individuals or an equivalent of 2 333 mature females however it is important to realize that this figure represents basically the additional grazing load on top of the already existing as we used remote sensed data from an area already utilized by grazing livestock even though unreasonable under the actual dynamic conditions in forage availability and quality calculating the theoretical grazing capacity of the modeled system including a total grass biomass of 13 234 t dm 10 000 ha and a mean daily dry matter intake rate of 4 kg for a female adult animal would result in a capacity of 9 064 animals considering a reduced actual plant biomass availability due to unpalatibility decomposition and fire of 0 5 as proposed by hein and weikard 2008 the theoretical stocking rate would be estimated at 0 59 animals body weight 210 kg per hectare which would also align with estimates of 0 313 au ha 1 animal unit 450 kg steer in other studies in semi arid savannas fynn and o connor 2000 however the result of our simulation of a maximum stocking rate of 0 26 tlu ha tlu tropical livestock unit 250 kg herbivore lies much lower confirming model results of weikard and hein 2011 for optimal stocking rates in the semi arid west african sahel of 0 12 tlu ha at half the annual precipitation amount as compared to our study area shortening the annual growth period by 20 as predicted for the study area by 2050 thornton et al 2007 would significantly reduce the maximum stocking rate by at least 40 although a reduction in animal performance and at the same time system productivity has been observed at much lower stocking rates in such a case performance is only predicted to keep constant up to 750 grazing animals equivalent to 583 mature females drastically reducing livelihood and food security of the local population considering that these numbers are based on continuous growth periods the predicted increased temporal variability in precipitation resulting in interrupted growth seasons is assumed to lead to a further aggravation of the situation for pastoral livestock producers in the area it is important to recognize that prognosis of future climate changes not only predicts the general reduction of growth period length but also the increase of its variability more detailed investigation of the effects of climate variability targeting at the presumably adverse effects of distribution of growth periods e g the change from one continuous annual growth period to multiple short periods of plant growth is currently been undertaken but will be part of a separate publication although system productivity in response to increasing stocking rate showed similar trends for different herd sizes bigger herds seemed to exhibit a higher efficiency in resource use resulting in higher maximal stocking rates within sustainable limits fig 11 this might seem counterintuitive upon first impression however it can be explained by the lower spatial dispersion of the lower number of herds which in turn might lead to a more heterogeneous utilization of the forage resources at the same stocking rate with the increase in patchiness of resource distribution chances for randomly finding foraging regions with locally elevated values of available biomass are enhanced which can affect the maximum sustainably acceptable number of livestock per area a similar effect of spatial arrangement has been found while analyzing the daily track lengths for foraging movements within an environment characterized by homogeneous versus heterogeneous forage distribution as discussed in the following paragraph c seasonal changes in forage movement related energy costs studies on movement distance of foraging livestock in general and its changes throughout the seasons in particular are primarily focusing on total walked distance without differentiation between distance for reaching forage grounds and distance walked while foraging on pasture although several studies identified a change in walked distance per day between the early and late dry season turner et al 2005 schlecht et al 2006 feldt and schlecht 2016 we were unable to find any research on free ranging pastoral livestock that explicitly measured the daily walked distance in the search of feed fernandez rivera et al 2005 direct comparison with the model results is therefore difficult however other studies explain a general increase in distance covered by a decrease in average forage availability across the seasons turner et al 2005 relating thereby forage area density kg dm ha with walking distance km d as predicted based on findings by marion et al 2005 the comparison of energy costs related to foraging movements between spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous environments showed in average higher costs in a homogeneous arrangement hereby system performance in the real heterogeneous environment was increased compared to the homogeneous case leading to 10 higher maximal sustainably allowed grazing intensity at high grazing pressure p 0 01 data not shown the increase in daily travel distance within a homogeneous landscape is in line with results of wallis de vries 1996 who predicted an increase of 10 15 in travel distance at uniform forage distribution as against a random distribution pastoral herding strategies often aim at actively influencing daily herd movements in terms of selection of foraging grounds as well as regarding resident time per grazing patch the assumption of free ranging conditions with a randomized selection of the start foraging ground in the described version of the model represents a sub optimal utilization of the available resources this might inflict increased time and accordingly energy expenses which might be optimized through active grazing management the constant search for and use of the best forage patches as implemented in the livestock grazing sub model possibly results in faster weight gain of the animals during the growth season but also in elevated energy respectively weight loss during the dry season adapted herding strategies would probably dampen the observed seasonal body weight fluctuation however in the current model version herds have free access to any grassland patch which in reality might not necessarily be the case as a result of restricted land use rights fernandez rivera et al 2005 ameliorating as such the forage availability situation for the herds in the model the most important limitation of the model we could identify was the low potential to simulate accumulative effects of environmental degradation such as change in plant community composition soil compaction or soil erosion because of its importance in rangeland management this point will be kept in mind for the future development of the model 6 summary and conclusion current and predicted future development put high pressure on the natural resources of rangelands in dry ecosystems and their sustainable use requires sound knowledge about the involved ecological processes and demands a well adapted management the application of agent based modeling proved to be ideally suited for simulating the reciprocal interactions between herbivores and vegetation in a dynamic environment as found in semi arid and arid rangelands although confronted with a lack of data for direct validation of our model the combination of sensitivity analysis and pattern oriented modeling and the verification of their results based on observed patterns and literature data provided enough insight into the capabilities and limits of the ramdry model as well as confidence in the processes included therein the simulation of changes in climatic conditions in terms of a shortened vegetation growth period as predicted by future global climate scenarios resulted in the significant reduction of sustainably acceptable grazing pressure and thereby system productivity the importance of considering the metabolic costs related to herd movements as well as of the dynamics in quality and quantity of forage resources in the assessment of environmental effects of livestock production systems in semi arid savanna ecosystems could be well validated by the presented model thereby ramdry demonstrated its capabilities to simulate livestock production systems in the dry rangelands of southwestern madagascar and to evaluate potential effects of changes in herd management and climatic conditions on rangeland and livestock system productivity acknowledgments this study was co funded by the german federal ministry

fieldwork we are particularly grateful to tobias feldt and katja brinkmann for their knowledgeable input and for providing an initial version of the digital land cover classification map we acknowledge the helpful comments of an anonymous reviewer on earlier versions of this paper special thanks go to uta berger volker grimm and henrik von wehrden for insightful advice and guidance in the development of the model appendix a odd protocol of ramdry a1 1 a1 3 a general overview of the model is described in chapter 2 a1 4 design concepts basic principles we applied at the system level an additive disturbance principle which defines the utilization of natural resources by livestock as additional stress in a dynamic ecosystem it overlays the natural dynamics of resource availability with the temporal extraction pattern ignoring thereby potential accumulative degradation effects e g soil compacting through trampling for the modeling of the feeding behavior of the agents in a general sense we adopted a classical model of optimal herbivore foraging that premised on energy maximization assuming that the goal of foraging is to maximize the long term energy intake stephens and krebs 1986 in particular on small spatial scales this foraging strategy has been proved to be predominant for free ranging ruminants fortin et al 2003 however as ramdry focuses on processes in semi arid sub tropical environments where the quality of foraging resources is generally lower than in temperate or humid sub tropical environments we furthermore applied the fill unit system as described in jarrige 1989 as the principle governing short term herbage intake this system predicts voluntary dry matter intake by animal characteristics intake capacity and the fill value of the forage relying thereby on gut capacity as intake regulating factor with regard to the energy system incorporated in ramdry we integrated the metabolizable energy me feeding system as described by the agricultural and food research council afrc 1993 embodying energetic efficiencies for ration formulation and the prediction of animal performance agnew and yan 2000 based on our own observations we realized that the principle of an ordinary foraging day involved the visit of a water point at the beginning or end of the day therefore we defined a foraging day by the movement from the village to the grazing ground from there to the closest available water point and back to the corral feldt and schlecht 2016 the application of basic biological and ecological principles related to the metabolic and ecosystem functions in the model allows its easy adaptation e g to the condition of other semi arid rangelands the model can furthermore be re adjusted for other ruminant species emergence herd productivity here expressed by herd size and cumulative body weight bw of the animals emerges from the environmental quality the animals feeding strategy decisions and anthropogenic herd management the latter factor being not considered here the dynamics of habitat quality in terms of resource provision emerges from climatic conditions precipitation and particularly in perennial plants prior grazing intensity both influencing factors are thereby partly unpredictable as the selection of foraging sites the animal movements while foraging and the intensity of use of vegetation are partly randomized processes vegetation regrowth and maturation rates however are the result of predefined functions forage site selection is restricted within certain spatial limits feeding strategy is a result of accrued foraging success therefore in direct relation with environmental quality adaptation herd agents adopt a quality before quantity feeding strategy which implies that they would rather select for high quality resources as long as these are sufficiently available before they would consider the selection of available low quality feed resources it represents basically the two foraging principles of selective and non selective feeding on a patch scale this principle manifests by switching between feeding strategies after an enduring deficit in energy for several consecutive days selective non selective or regrowth of high quality feed resources above minimum amounts non selective selective adoption of high quality feed strategy i e selective feeding results in a consequent selection of high quality foraging sites and feeding exclusively on high quality grid cells all along the daily grazing path in contrast both low and high quality foraging resources are extracted in low quality feed strategy i e non selective feeding starting at sites that are chosen randomly under such conditions all resources on each grid cell are taken into account while proceeding along the daily grazing path as the expenditure of energy for locomotion within the different land cover types varies corresponding to their resistance to movements the agents adapt their moves accordingly seeking the most energy efficient pathway while grazing low speed locomotion movement is described as a mix of correlated random and targeted walk depending on the reachability of suitable feeding targets grid cells within the agent s detection range check the section on sensingfor details in accordance with the prevailing feeding strategy however targeted low speed grazing movements are only executed if any suitable grid cell within detection range can provide better feeding conditions in terms of resource quantity than the actual current condition in case of absence of suitable targets or their inaccessibility movement directions vary as a function of a normal random distribution mobile agents adapt their movements furthermore in dependence on the availability of active water points by avoiding the visit of dried off sites objectives by the adaptation of their foraging behavior agents seek to maximize daily energy intake and thereby their body weight this ensures optimal fecundity and results in the increase in the number of herd individuals and thus signifies an increase in livestock productivity agents will primarily try to meet this objective through preference of good quality forage above maximizing gut fill however the objective of the model per se is to find parameter sets and strategies that lead to an optimized sustainable long term productivity of the complete system even if the individual agents follow egocentric benefit maximizing strategies sensing individual livestock herd agents are assumed to remember predict certain spatial and resource related aspects of the environment such as the availability and location of water points that are supposed to be visited once per day for drinking subsequent to the foraging activities in particular agents are supposed to follow the most energy efficient path from the grazing grounds to the nearest active water point in order to calculate the maximum potential time on pasture agents are furthermore assumed to be responsive to the actual astronomic day length to ensure the daily return of the herd back to the village the base corral before night fall for the daily selection of the initial grazing grid cell agents are assumed to sense the biomass density and quality at the target foraging site the cognitive capabilities of the agents during the active feeding process are being used for finding the next appropriate feeding station limited by range and angle of reception of the grid cells within a cone of radius 180 m and within 50 from the direction of the current movement agents can perceive the vegetation type biomass density corresponds to the grass sward height therefore related to the visual perception and the quality class of the grassland vegetation high or low quality related to organoleptic perception within the context of foraging strategy selection i e selective versus non selective feeding the agents are assumed to realize the number of consecutive days of energy loss and to recognize the onset of the growing season stochasticity several aspects of the process of selecting the start site of foraging are involving random sampling to reproduce behavior variability the distance from the village at which a start site might be selected is constrained within a band of fix width limited at its lower end by a minimum distance value sampled from a random normal distribution the final selection of a site within that band is made in a partly randomized manner depending on the currently active selection strategy to realistically simulate untargeted in field movement behavior of the agents correlated random walk has been implemented in the model thereby the direction of movement is dependent on the direction of the prior movement using a normal random distribution as deflection angle fig a1 collectives agents do not form or belong to aggregations observation the main output of the model is the system productivity at the end of the simulation defined by the number of individuals within the herd agents and their respective body weights for the assessment and analysis of the model it is however beneficial to follow the dynamic behavior not only of these two parameters but also some underlying factors therefore daily values of body weight energy costs and gains are collected yearly recordings of climatic condition total amount of rain duration of growth season number of individuals per agent as well as of the spatial distribution of biomass complement the dataset for analysis all of the data are used for the testing of the abm a1 5 initialization during the initialization process gis based spatial data on land cover type vegetation classes and primary production are loaded and processed into initial state variables of the spatial cells the data reflects the situation on 4th march 2013 signifying thereby the start of the dry season based on data from a land use map and a vegetation index map a vegetation class raster map is calculated defining accordingly for each grid cell the relative movement energy costs for its transition the initial amount of green herbaceous biomass per grid cell is derived from remote sensed data of normalized differential vegetation index ndvi depending on the grass vegetation community initial digestibilities of the fresh and dry forage are set for each grassland grid cell assigning one predefined value to all grid cells with high quality forage here aristida adscensionis and another lower value to the low quality forage cells here heteropogon contortus to setup the herd agents a predefined number of mobile entities are created and equipped with an initial set of parameters an initial herd size between 3 and 120 is randomly set for each agent and an initial body weight of 200 kg for the representing animal based on collected data fust unpubl is consistently assigned values for the average walking speed average foraging speed and potential milk production are set based on recorded data as outlined by feldt 2015 and feldt pers comm initial values for feeding and patch selection strategy are allotted finally additional internal agent state variables counting the days with weight gain and weight loss are reset three stationary water point agents are positioned in the model area based on location data of the real water points data not shown and initial values regarding their availability as water point temporal availability and water holding amount are set several fix global variables and parameters are defined all initial values are listed in table b1 by reference to the previously assigned energy cost of movement per individual grid cell the accumulated cost surfaces from the model center village and the different water points are calculated subsequently the shortest paths and their respective lengths based on the accumulated cost surfaces are evaluated for the ways from the various water points to the village a1 6 input data ramdry is intended to be an integral part of a socio economic and ecologic model for the mahafaly region within the context of the sulama project www sulama de therefore it is supposed to accept input data from different other sub modules of the sulama model in the current version however it includes in particular for its spatial explicitness several sources of gis based datasets with regard to climatic changes data of a dynamic climatic model for the region kuebler unpublished data based on an assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change moss et al 2008 niang et al 2014 is included as indicator for daily precipitation and mean ambient temperature a1 7 submodels a1 7 1 initialization much of the initialization process has already been described in chapter a1 5 however it seems important to us to give more detail here about the spatial setup of the model as we work with spatially explicit data we integrated remote sensed data to describe environmental parameters of the model world in a first step all necessary gis data is loaded in the model rasterized and re sampled to match the defined spatial resolution parameter spatialresol data from a land cover map of the area brinkmann et al 2014 is used to build an energy cost based distance cost map energy cost is thereby calculated by speed related energy expenditure in the different vegetation types of the land cover classes based on measured speed of movement of animals in the land cover classes by gps tracking feldt and schlecht 2016 averaged speeds were calculated thereby only speeds while traveling defined as values above 1 5 km h leeuw 1986 were taken into account using a total of 63 650 measurements average speeds in savanna and shrubland forest type vegetation have been evaluated for the conversion of speed in energy requirement a correlation of walking speed and related energy cost above standing by dijkman and lawrence 1997 was applied the resulting relations are shown in table a1 metabolizable energy costs for movement on roads and pathways were set slightly below the value used for savanna vegetation to increase the tendency to use those established pathways furthermore movement costs on agricultural fields where set at maximum levels of 1000 j m kg bw as herds were supposed not to enter nor cross these areas the relation speed energy cost as reported by dijkman and lawrence 1997 was approximated by an unimodal function with best fit r2 0 963 as shown in eq a1 where y corresponds to energy costs in j m per kg body weight and x to walking speed in km h a1 y 6 5 x 2 44 x 75 minimum energy costs i e most energy efficient movement was thereby evaluated as movement at a speed of 3 3 km h which was in coherence with findings of king 1983 stating best efficiency at speeds between 2 5 3 5 km h minimum energy cost was thereby 1 5 j m kg bw this value resulted in an energy expenditure of 450 j m for an animal of 300 kg bw aligning with the model of brosh et al 2006 who reported 2 9 j m per kg metabolic weight which resulted in energy costs of 438 j m for a 300 kg animal after the loading of the above described gis energy cost raster file and the setting of spatial coordinates of fix locations such as the village center and the water points the accumulated cost surfaces radiant from the village center and the different water points are calculated subsequently the shortest paths and their respective lengths based on the accumulated cost surfaces are evaluated for the ways from the various water points to the village center the raster data set with initial biomass density is a result of an analysis of satellite data based vegetation indices in combination with on ground validation data we repeatedly measured herbaceous biomass in the modeled study area between autumn 2012 and spring 2014 antsonantenainarivony 2017 and compared the measurements with the corresponding satellite sensor recordings made by landsat 8 satellites therefore we downloaded the time relevant atmospheric corrected landsat images from usgs http earthexplorer usgs gov and calculated the normalized differential vegetation index ndvi as an established proxy for primary productivity and thereby also for photo synthetically active biomass e g hobbs 1995 the time series analysis of the ndvi data showed a maximum near the end of the growth season end of february beginning of march which correlated well with the on ground measurements therefore we decided to use the period of highest resource availability as start time for our simulation the time sensitive gradients of the vegetation index were approximated see fig a2 for ndvi time series for period 2013 2014 of two reference locations and the minimum values assessed and compared with the ground control data in this way we were able to zero the correlation between ndvi and biomass for grassland vegetation aristida ndvi 0 21 for green biomass area density 0 t dm ha and ndvi 0 44 for green biomass area density 1 75 t dm ha heteropogon ndvi 0 23 for green biomass area density 0 t dm ha and ndvi 0 50 for green biomass area density 2 2 t dm ha and could thereby establish a correlation equation to transform the ndvi dataset into an initial green biomass dataset eqs a2 a3 aristida r2 0 89 heteropogon r2 0 90 which is calculated in the model during the initialization phase a2 ndviaristida 0 00130 greenbiomass 0 21 where greenbiomass is in g dm m2 a3 ndviheteropogon 0 00136 greenbiomass 0 23 where greenbiomass is in g dm m2 similarly we were able to establish a link between the two dominant and distinct grassland vegetation communities with differences in nutrition quality in terms of digestibility and a landsat data based redness index ri data not shown which enabled us to distinguish the distribution of the two grassland communities dominated by aristida adscensionis and heteropogon contortus respectively based on remote sensed data therefore during the initialization phase the model loads a spatial raster file with the redness index to differentiate between the two forage qualities and assigns to individual grid cells the corresponding initial maximal digestibility values highdigesth for highly digestible aristida dominated and lowdigesth for lower digestible heteropogon dominated grassland based on recordings of the typical herd age structure in the study region data not shown and associated growth functions fig a3 founded on brody s growth curves brody 1945 reference weights for the different age and sex classes are calculated body weight of female animals aged above 60 months showed minor variability and was therefore defined as constant to account for specific energetic demands for milk production by lactating females and for milk consumption and growth of unweaned animals corrective factors for individuals between 0 and 6 months of age are computed thereby the augmented efficiency in the conversion of metabolizable energy for maintenance during milk consumption the increase in direct energy requirements as the result of growth of these young animals plus the additional energy costs for lactating females due to conversion of metabolic energy into milk and the subsequent costs for milk digestion in the young are assessed and considered as correction factors for the reference weight of the corresponding age class for this calculation we followed the suggestions of csiro 2007 the corresponding functions are displayed in formula a4 a6 where the first term in formula a4 corresponds to the effect of increased efficiency in energy conversion for maintenance and the second term corresponds to the influence of energy conversion from body tissue of the mother to the growth of body mass of the suckling a4 corrected weight uncorrected weight maint

initialization phase of the simulation features of the water points are defined in particular in terms of their spatial location general availability accessibility whether the individual water points have a permanent or temporary character and their respective water holding capacities a1 7 2 climate season the first cyclic process after initialization focuses on the update of the climatic and seasonal variables following the threshold delay model of ogle and reynolds 2004 for plant responses to precipitation correlation assessments between precipitation recordings of the period august 2012 june 2013 for the study area and the according ndvi time series revealed a good correspondence of the onset and end of vegetation growth with fortnightly sums of precipitation the cumulative effect of precipitation during the precedent fourteen days proved the most reliable trigger for plant growth indicating a threshold of 30 mm rain and a delay of the response of one fortnight fig a4 climate data in terms of daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation as predicted for the study area by ipcc moss et al 2008 is loaded once at the simulation start and at the end of each growth period and daily mean temperature is calculated based on the fortnightly precipitation sums and the defined threshold the onset and length of the following growth period is assessed alternatively for test purposes fix growth seasons have also been implemented repeatedly simulating climatic conditions as recorded in 2012 2013 initiating the growth period at december 15 2012 and lasting until march 4 2013 comprising 78 growth days at the moment of onset of the growth season i e a fortnight after the onset of rainfall water points are completely refilled according to their water holding capacity and the amount of green biomass of the patches with biomass area density below minimum 4 kg dm ha for aristida and 10 kg dm ha for heteropogon grassland patches are reset to minimum as initial values for the re growth process as last operation based on the season the percentage of resting in the activity budget of the animals per rest activ is set in accordance to recordings feldt and schlecht 2016 feldt unpubl data as 20 in the dry season and 13 in the growth season a1 7 3 vegetation growth maturation natural dynamic processes in grasslands affect primarily the quantity of green and dry biomass and their respective quality as feed resource these three factors are continuously adjusted according to season based on the observed pattern of ndvi and precipitation prediction as outlined in paragraphs a1 7 1 and a1 7 2 we distinguish between two seasonal patterns dry and growth season during the dry season the model simulates maturating effects in the vegetation by reducing linearly the digestibility value of green biomass from the highest value state variables highdigesth for high quality forage and lowdigesth for low quality forage by a 200th of the difference between their respective high and low thresholds as a result after 200 days the lower digestibility threshold values as defined by the state variables highdigestdead and lowdigestdead are reached and kept constant until the start of the growth season digestibilities of dry biomass are meanwhile kept constant accordingly on the level of these low thresholds reduction of green biomass as a result of maturation as well as its increase during the growth season and the related building up and decay of necromass follow a logistic growth function using the vegetation growth model for savanna vegetation as proposed by owen smith 2007 outlined in eqs a7 and a8 a7 v gree t v gree r v 1 v total k v a8 v necro t v gree r death 1 r decay for parameter description see table a2 for the definition of the parameters rv rdeath rdecay and kv patterns of the growth model were compared with sample recordings on green and dry biomass in reference plots in the study area from different time periods antsonantenainarivony 2017 and parameters were adjusted accordingly for best fit ndvi times series indicated that plots with different maximum values at the end of the growth season exhibited different decrease during the dry season reaching minimum values about the same time fig a2 this observation signals that the density of green biomass did not influence its rate of decay and death rate could be defined as independent from biomass according to other studies e g snyman 1998 decomposition rate is increased during the growth season as a result of increased microbial activity therefore decay rate rdecay was defined variable in dependence on season the various growth and maturation related parameter values according to the different conditions are listed in table a3 thus similar patterns for the growth function could be applied to all grassland patches adjusting just the growth rate parameter rv in function of the maximum amounts of green and dry biomass by testing the growth decay function for different values of rv linear regression analysis was applied to look for the relationship between peak green biomass and the growth rate while extreme values of rv showed trends of saturation linear relationships with high level of linearity could be established within the range of expected values for biomass the resulting correlation functions eqs a9 and a10 were integrated in the model a9

its effect on the vegetation into consideration whereby harvest early in the growth period will have a lower impact on the maximal achievable biomass at the end of the growth season than late harvest as regrowth is more realistic in an early growth phase the resulting trend of biomass and digestibility of an exemplary high quality forage grid cell is outlined in fig a5 selectivity for green and dry forage is based on preference following the approach of the pasture model grazemod johnson 2008 as a function of their respective availabilities and qualities the proportion of dry and fresh matter ingested by animals is changing throughout the year whereby the preference for live matter is defined as 10 times greater than for dead matter johnson 2008 rasch et al 2016 the probability of ingesting either of the two on pasture has therefore been based on the preference factor the respective biomasses on the pasture grid cell and the respective digestibilities i e the proportion of green biomass ingested is calculated as shown in eq a11 a11 greencomp preferencefactor v gree digestibility gree preferencefactor v gree digestibility gree v necro digestibility dry for parameter description see table a4 similarly the proportion of ingested dry biomass is as outlined in eq a12 a12 deadcomp v necro digestibility dry preferencefactor v gree digestibility gree v necro digestibility dry for parameter description see table a4 based on the proportions of green and dry biomass ingested the average digestibility of the ingested matter is calculated as described in eq a13 a13 weighteddigest greencomp digestibilitygree deadcomp digestibilitydry similarly the weighted palatable biomass based on the dry and green components is set accordingly for all grassland grid cells eq a14 a14 weightedbiomass greencomp v gree deadcomp v necro subsequently the metabolizable energy content of forage metabolenergy is calculated for each grassland grid cell based on the vegetation s gross energy grossenergy concentration which is multiplied by the averaged digestibility weighteddigest and the conversion efficiency ratio from digestible to metabolizable energy de me ratio finally in this process a number of general global variables are updated such as the day of the year is increased by one and the astronomic day length is calculated accordingly following the model of glarner 2011 we thereby applied the simplified version of glarner s model as outlined in eq a15 by inserting the geographical latitude of the model area as 23 35 a15 day length 24 180 arccos 1 m i whereas m 1 tan latitude tan 23 439 cos day 180 182 625 i tan 6 cos latitude a1 7 4 forage site selection based on the two potential patch selection strategies in the simulated free ranging system namely aristida in the selective feeding state and automatic in the non selective feeding state the start location for the daily foraging activities is selected in case of aristida potentially any location in any grid cell with high quality resource could be assigned whereas in the case of automatic either a grid cell with low or high quality resource might be considered for positioning the probability of considering a dataset of low or high quality grid cells is thereby defined by the global variable testvalue out of the extracted dataset a location is subsequently randomly selected on the following conditions the sum of the current value for green biomass and necromass is above the minimum threshold defined by minimumgreenbiomass distance from any water point is more than 2 grid cells i e 180 m at a spatial resolution of 90 m the accumulated cost distance from the central model origin home lies in a band defined by a randomized inner radius out of a normal random distribution with a mean of 330 000 j kg bw and a standard deviation of 235 000 j kg bw defined by stdev radius but maximum 1 000 000 j kg bw and a band width of 300 000 j kg bw these band defining values have been arbitrarily set and tested for suitability the x and y coordinates of the selected start site are stored in x forage and y forage respectively for further calculations for the path from the central model origin to the start site the most energy cost efficient option is evaluated from the previously calculated accumulated cost surface see chapter a1 7 1 and the according distance costs and path length are calculated a1 7 5 feed intake a1 7 5 1 preparing processes the submodule simulating the feed intake is following suggestions and models of coleman 2005 jouven et al 2008 and delagarde et al 2011 as an initialization step in the feeding intake submodule a preliminary itinerary is computed to calculate the time available for foraging activities for this reason the most appropriate water point in relation to the start foraging point is evaluated based on the energy costs related to the movement from the current location to a water point and from there to the model origin home similar to the process of calculation of the path from home to the foraging site the most energy cost efficient option to reach the different water points is evaluated from the previously calculated accumulated cost surfaces the values for the according distance costs and path lengths of the most energy cost efficient path are then computed path length and total distance costs are used to compute total walking time applying thereby the averaged energy costs in the energy speed relation as shown in eq a1 to calculate averaged walking speed time spent resting is evaluated applying the perc rest activ parameter time available for foraging activity forage time is then calculated by deducting walking time and resting time from the astronomic day length day length based on the body weight of the representing adult female animal animal growth functions sex ratio and herd age structure the total body weight of the herd is calculated recorded real data of 161 individuals in representative herds revealed a sex ratio of 3 males 4 females fust unpubl which is adopted in the model the sex sensitive herd age structure is defined based on data collected in the field following for male individuals a negative logarithmic regression function r2 0 86 as outlined in fig a6 the histogram of the age distribution in the measured herds showed for male animals an immediate decrease after birth while the female numbers were fairly constant up to an age of 60 months which corresponded well with the end in growth taking into account the absolute total numbers of subadult 60 months and adult 60 months females half of the female animals in a herd were defined to follow the constant age distribution while for the other half of the female animals a constant weight corresponding to the adult weight was assumed animal numbers of the various age classes of both sexes and the according weights are individually multiplied and then summed up to indicate the total reference herd weight the actual herd weight herdweight is calculated by multiplying the reference herd weight by the ratio of actual mature female liveweight and reference animal weight referenceweight a1 7 5 2 procedure structure because of its unique and dynamic agent based modeling approach we had to develop for ramdry a new iterative calculation method for the calculation of feed intake however we tried thereby to rely as much as possible on the principles of earlier models on feed intake a simple overview of the different factors influencing daily dry matter intake of the agents in our model is shown in fig a7 in general we are applying the principle of jouven et al 2008 arguing that the amount of dry matter intake in a day by a ruminant animal is largely dependent on physiological constraints of the animal highlighted in fig a7 in blue forage density and distribution highlighted in fig a7 in yellow and forage quality shown in green in fig a7 the animal physiological part is leading to the factor intakecapacity ic and is evaluated in a mechanistic manner as the contributing parameters are supposed to stay relatively constant throughout a day the effects of relative intake hir and the fill value fv depend on the forage encountered during the feeding process and are hard to predict for the evaluation of these two parameters we developed an iterative simulation process where firstly estimated values are used for simulation compared to the simulated output and then the simulated output is reused as an approximated input for further iteration as outlined in fig a8 the first step in the feeding intake submodule is the calculation of the intake capacity following the concept of jouven et al 2008 taking into consideration the live body weight the body condition score and the potential milk production body condition score bcs is thereby defined as the ratio of the actual body weight to the normal standard weight as suggested by mayer et al 2012 a 10 weight ratio per level of bcs leads thereby to a range of bcss from 1 to 9 with bcs 5 as a standard 1 1 ratio this 1 9 bcs system is then converted into a 1 5 bcs system with bcs 3 as 1 1 ratio according to fox et al 2004 intake capacity intakecapacity is thereafter computed using the eq a16 from jouven et al 2008 a16 intakecapacity 3 2 0 015 liveweight 0 25 milkproduction 0 002 liveweight bcs 2 5 the actual evaluation of dry matter intake is modeled in a two step procedure simulating first the parameter search in an iterative way before the actual acquisition of the resources is executed this two step procedure is necessary as the amount of available biomass and its respective digestibility is an input parameter in the calculation of daily dry matter intake but both are at the beginning of the daily foraging simulation unknown variables as a result of the randomized way of the foraging path therefore they need to be initially estimated and iteratively adjusted fig a8 shows a general outline of the processes involved in dry matter intake calculation initially mean values for biomass and digestibility representing weighted and averaged values from the daily foraging path are set according to the state variables weightedbiomass and weighteddigest of the start grid cell based on these parameters a preliminary value for daily dry matter intake dmi is computed a1 7 5 3 dry matter intake calculation for dry matter intake prediction we follow the recommendations of the grazein model of delagarde et al 2011 taking into account the influences of biomass availability and time constrains while delagarde and coworkers considered the effect of biomass availability by calculating separate intake rates for biomass limited grazing and time constrained foraging we expect non exclusiveness of these two factors we therefore calculate time restricted intake rate and multiply this variable with an availability factor following the model of coleman 2005 according to delagarde et al 2011 herbage intake is calculated from intake capacity of the animal ic relative herbage intake hir as percentage of the voluntary herbage intake and herbage fill value fv as indicated in fig a7 hir represents thereby the degree of restriction of intake attributed to limiting time at pasture compared with full day grazing and maximal voluntary intake assuming that grazing ruminants need at least five hours of foraging to achieve their intake capacity without biomass restriction delagarde et al 2011 maximal voluntary intake per hour would be 20 of ic to quantify the relative influence of standing biomass on potential voluntary intake we applied the findings of coleman 2005 based on this data an asymptotic regression function for the relative intake as a function of biomass availability riba has been developed eq a17 which represented best r2 0 99 the observed relation between ad libitum intake and forage standing biomass a17 ri ba 0 9953 0 9961 e e 0 6189 standingbiomass where standingbiomass is in t dm ha riba is subsequently used as factor for maximum voluntary intake per hour vimax in the calculation of relative herbage intake hir according to delagarde et al 2011 the corresponding adapted function is shown in eq a18 a18 hir vi max forage time vi max 0 008 ln 1 e forage time 0 845 vi max 0 008 where vi max 1 h 0 2 ri ba herbage fill value fv is defined as ratio between voluntary intake of a reference herbage by an inra reference heifer and the voluntary intake of the specific forage we describe fv based on the digestibility of green forage as outlined by jouven et al 2008 given all necessary input variables an initial value for dry matter intake dmi is calculated before the execution of the iterative simulation process initial values for the number of grid cells visited numbpatchvisited and the number of steps taken during foraging nrofsteps are estimated based on time at pasture forage time and average speed while foraging forage speed furthermore the current datasets of spatial distribution of green biomass greenbiomass dry biomass necromass and proportions of green greencomp and dry deadcomp biomass in ingested matter are stored to be able to re establish the initial configuration for the actual foraging procedure after the end of the iterative simulation process a1 7 5 4 iterative foraging simulation cycle based on the estimated daily dry matter intake of the representing individual and the ratio of its body weight liveweight to the total herd weight herdweight total daily herd intake is predicted additionally incorporating the estimated number of grid cells visited throughout the foraging path numbpatchvisited an initial value for dry matter offtake per grid cell is calculated the foraging simulation is built up as a loop running as long as there is time left for foraging on pasture i e accumulated time spent for feeding is constantly compared with the calculated time at pasture forage time foraging movements are simulated in a stepwise manner based on decisions taken by the agent in response to the environment switching thereby between movement modes as described by fryxell et al 2008 based on the cognitive capabilities of the agent as described in section a1 4 the agent takes consequently decisions to stay on a grid cell to continue foraging or leave the grid cell for a more suitable habitat fig a9 the process differs slightly between the selective and the non selective feeding strategy while the first step is common for both within the view cone defined by its radius viewdistance and opening angle viewangle the dataset of grid cells corresponding to the respective feeding strategy are extracted if their value of weighted by proportion of ingested green and dry matter biomass is above the defined minimum minimumgreenbiomass from this dataset of potential target locations the highest green biomass value is evaluated the decision trees for the following step are shown in fig a10 for the selective feeding strategy and in fig a11 for the non selective strategy after a decision has been taken to make a step of length one into any direction the step is executed and the value of the counter of steps taken is increased by one for later calculation of energy cost of foraging movement in this moment in any case the x and y coordinates of the new location are added in a list subsequently the foraging decision process is simulated i e whether and which resource is potentially extracted from the current grid cell therefore the appropriateness of the resources in the current location is assessed i e if quality is not appropriate in view of the current feeding strategy no biomass extraction is executed instead only the time spent is increased based on the grid size spatialresol and average walking speed walk speed available forage biomass is evaluated in dependence of the remaining quantity of green biomass i e if the quantity of live plant material is above minimum levels in accordance to the present grass community defined by mingreenmass213 and mingreenmass216 respectively both green and dry biomass are extracted according to the calculated proportions greencomp and deadcomp otherwise only the amount of present dry biomass is defined as available biomass if the current new location carries resources of appropriate quality but available biomass is not above the minimum threshold minimumgreenbiomass only the time spent is increased similar to the case of inappropriate quality if available biomass and quality are sufficient the accumulated biomass is increased by the available biomass of the current grid cell and the accumulated digestibility is increased by the available digestibility of the current location available digestibility is thereby defined in the same way as available biomass depending on the amount of remaining green biomass similarly dry and potentially green biomass of the current grid cell is reduced by the value of the previously estimated dry matter offtake by the herd to make it unavailable for the following simulation steps time spent is increased based on the grid size spatialresol and average foraging speed forage speed as mentioned before these processes are executed repeatedly as long as the time spent is below the available time after the time available for foraging is used up by the simulation mean biomass and digestibility per step are calculated and the variables meanbiomass and meandigestib are updated accordingly based on these calculated values for average biomass and digestibility daily dry matter intake dmi is calculated again following the principle mentioned in chapter a1 7 5 3 as a final step in the simulation procedure the agent is set back at the start point of foraging and the total energy costs related to the foraging movement are calculated based on the value for relaxed walking on flat surface walkingenergy subsequently the previously stored spatial biomass grid dataset is reloaded and the newly calculated value for dmi is compared with the previously estimated value and if the difference between the two is below 0 2 kg dm d the simulation process is concluded otherwise the simulation is restarted with the new updated values for averaged biomass averaged digestibility and dry matter intake as shown in fig a8 a1 7 5 5 foraging after the successful completion of the simulation phase the foraging process is basically just the implementation of the simulated steps based on the memorized list of foraging locations visited similar to the first step in the simulation process total daily herd intake is computed based on the established daily dry matter intake of the representing individual and the ratio of its body weight liveweight to the total herd weight herdweight additionally incorporating the estimated number of grid cells visited while foraging numbpatchvisited dry matter offtake per grid cell is calculated thereafter the list of memorized locations in the list of the foraging path is worked through step by step for each entry of the list it is decided whether the current grid bears appropriate forage resources in terms of quality in the case that the feeding strategy is set on quality i e on selective feeding behavior if biomass of the current patch is above the minimum threshold minimumgreenbiomass the metabolizable energy density of the corresponding grid cell metabolenergy is multiplied by the individual dry matter offtake per grid cell and summed up the sum defines the total metabolizable energy gained by the foraging activities in a day and is stored in the entity variable feedenergy a1 7 6 plant biomass adjustment similar to the calculation of gained metabolizable energy described in chapter a1 7 5 5 for each grid cell in the location list of the foraging path green and dry biomass of the grid cells is adjusted according to the offtake for each list entry it is ensured that green biomass is above the minimum threshold minimumgreenbiomass and in this case the biomasses of the corresponding grid cell in terms of greenbiomass and necromass respectively is reduced subsequently by the previously calculated amount of dry matter offtake per grid cell a1 7 7 animal energy balance as grazing can involve considerable displacement the itinerary needs to be reassessed to find the shortest and most energy efficient paths to the nearest water point and back home to calculate the total energy expenditure for all movements the energy costs for the best tracks need to be re evaluated therefore similar to the proceedings of the computation of the preliminary itinerary as described in chapter a1 7 5 1 the most appropriate water point in relation to the end point of the foraging movement is selected based on the energy costs related to the movement from the current location to a water point and from there to home the most energy efficient option to the different water points is evaluated from the previously calculated accumulated cost surfaces and the values for the according distance costs and path lengths of the most energy efficient path are then calculated subsequently the agent is moved on the evaluated paths via the nearest water point back home based on the accumulated energy gains and costs the total energy balance is subsequently drawn therefore energy expenditures due to maintenance costs and walking costs and gains due to feeding are calculated separately and summed up in terms of metabolizable energy me taking accordingly possible conversion efficiency factors into account while values for maintenance costs are well defined in terms of metabolizable energy based on the entity parameter mem and the animal s body weight liveweight distance cost values from the distance cost analysis need to be converted into metabolizable energy via the conversion efficiency factor according to jarrige 1989 a1 7 8 herd fitness depending on the result of the energy balance body weight is adjusted as a result of body tissue mobilization in case of a negative energy balance or body tissue synthesis in case of a positive energy balance energy compensation in mammals can practically be managed by glycogen stored mainly in the liver proteins in the muscle tissue and triglycerides fats in adipose tissue several studies mentioned that synthesis and mobilization of body tissue might involve fat and protein metabolisms non exclusively e g csiro 2007 to keep our model as simple as possible we decided to concentrate only on these two metabolisms each of them has different efficiency levels for the conversion to from metabolizable energy and their respective importance depends on the overall metabolic condition generally higher relative body weight increases the importance of fat as storage medium while in lower relative body weight protein related processes are more prominent as the purpose of ramdry is not particularly to model the metabolic processes in highest detail we applied an approach in which we combine the two into one storage metabolism while keeping in mind that we are in fact modeling thereby a set of processes energy conversion efficiency rates for fats and proteins can be very different for the conversion of metabolic energy into muscle tissue via proteins richardson and hahn 2007 suggested a value of 0 3 while williams and jenkins 2003 reported an efficiency rate of 0 75 for the conversion of metabolic energy into adipose tissue similarly the conversion efficiency for mobilization of adipose tissue is reported to be around 0 84 see for example tedeschi et al 2005 while protein mobilization is suggested to happen at an efficiency of 1 taking thereby into consideration the reduced maintenance energy requirements of under nourished animals as outlined by king 1983 we therefore created weight dependent combined conversion efficiency factors incorporating both processes the conversion factor for weight gain body tissue synthesis kpf is defined as an inverse logit function based on the difference of the actual body weight from normal weight we defined thereby the minimum value of 0 3 kp min in the case of a body condition score 1 very poor condition to emphasize the high importance of muscle tissue related processes and the maximum value of 0 75 kf max in the case of body condition score 9 obese the resulting function is shown in fig a12 similarly the conversion factor for weight loss body tissue mobilization kpfm is defined as a logit function in relation to the weight difference between the current body weight and the standard weight of a reference individual the extrema are consequently set to 0 84 kmf min for the fat related process and 1 kmp max for the protein related process fig a13 in case of a negative daily energy balance the model calculates the corresponding conversion factor kmpf based on the current weight difference if the weight difference is negative i e the animals are underweight the loss of body weight is calculated on the basis of protein energy density ener dens prot simulating thereby the mobilization of muscle tissue in contrast if the weight difference is positive overweight while drawing a negative energy balance the loss of adipose tissue is simulated by applying the fat energy density ener dens fat in the calculation of body weight loss alternatively in case of an energy surplus at the end of the day the model calculates the corresponding conversion factor kpf and according to the weight difference computes the weight gain based on protein energy density ener dens prot in the case of underweight or fat energy density ener dens fat in the case of overweight body weight is then adjusted by the calculated weight gain or loss respectively and a counter totaling the consecutive days of weight loss or weight gain is updated if the number of consecutive days of weight loss is exceeding five the feeding strategy feedstrategy and site selection strategy selectionstrategy are set to non selective feeding behavior contrarily if the average of green biomass in aristida dominated patches rises above minimum level and their weighted digestibility climbs above 55 indicating sufficient re growth of fresh biomass the strategies are set to selective feeding behavior despite preceding weight loss as a final step in the herd fitness procedure the change in herd size is computed considering the resulting birth and mortality rates birth rate in the model is set fix depending on the total size of the herd to herdincreaseratesmall or herdincreaseratebig respectively mortality rate however is defined as a function of weight ratio i e body weight to reference weight according the model of richardson and hahn 2007 in case of a weight ratio above or equal 0 6 the daily rate of natural mortality is set at 0 018 while below a weight ratio of 0 6 a weight ratio sensitive additional term is considered following the recommendations of richardson and hahn 2007 eq a19 a19 dm r dt α mr γ mr β mr cd for parameter description and values see table a5 in case that the herd size has decreased below the threshold of 2 individual animals minimum for reproduction the herd agent dies and will thereby be ignored during calculations at subsequent time steps a1 7 9 water balance the last procedure of the simulation considers the water need of the animals and the use of the corresponding resources we thereby applied the approach of king 1983 including water needs and gains for metabolic processes respiratory and cutaneous water water costs for walking in high solar heat loads forage intake and milk production due to the lack of appropriate data it comprises furthermore rudimentary estimates for water intake from forage the water pool p of a mammal animal comes to 2 3 of the live body weight body water turnover tbw was approximated for zebu cattle in kenya by a function of mean ambient temperature eq a20 a20 tbw 21 518 temp 390 where tbw is in ml l and temp is in c water gain from metabolic processes has been estimated at 0 0294 times the total heat production a21 w m 0 0294 me where wm is in kg and me is in mj water gains by respiratory and cutaneous intake has been approximated as outlined in eq a22 a22 w rc 0 11 tbw t 0 11 tbw p 1000 where wrc is in kg and tbwt is the total body water turnover water costs as a result of walking wkw in high ambient temperature was defined depending on the body condition of the animals as suggested by king 1983 thereby undernourished animals are supposed to display lower sweating rates restricting the period of significant high solar load to 3 h per day while animals in normal body conditions experience increased sweating rates during 6 5 h per day eq a23 a23 wk w t ht daylength 0 0014 liveweight where tht is n of hot hours per day liveweightis in kg water cost related to milk production wmy has been estimated as 0 87 l per kg milk produced king 1983 finally water gain from forage wf was approximated as outlined in eq a24 assuming a mean forage moisture content of 15 as suggested by king 1983 a24 w f dmi foragemoisture 1 foragemoisture where dmi is in kg d and foragemoisture 0 15 as suggested water costs for forage intake iw have subsequently been calculated as described in eq a25 a25 i w 1

subtracted from the water amount in the water point if the water point ends up with no water left it is defined as unavailable and will not be considered as water resource until the onset of the next

maintain the long term productivity of the rangeland ecosystem especially in dry climates where precipitation is highly erratic and where forage yield and quality of the pasture are highly dynamic we used an agent based approach to develop a spatially explicit model for a case study region in madagascar our model ramdry integrates the movements and feeding metabolism of domesticated ruminants in order to assess the potential of adaptive livestock production in a highly dynamic heterogeneous semi arid rangeland system it evaluates the additional metabolic energy costs due to pastoral herd movements in search of forage incorporates seasonal dynamics in forage quality in terms of feed digestibility and relates forage availability and quality to climatic conditions in the presented study we focused on describing the processes simulated in ramdry in detail simplifying model conditions by implying free ranging conditions we verified the results of the model through global and local sensitivity analysis and pattern oriented modeling and compared findings with observed patterns and existing data from literature our model provides a useful tool to assess strategies and effects of locally adapted herd and rangeland utilization for sustained food security and household economy of livestock keepers in the semi arid tropics and sub tropics subject for further analysis of the model

2009 leading to a reduction of primary productivity in general and palatable plant species in particular illius and o connor 1999 czegledi and radacsi 2005 which in consequence results in dissatisfying performance of the herbivores in traditional animal husbandry mitigation of these effects has been accomplished by the implementation of different grazing strategies such as rotational grazing stafford smith 1996 adaptive herd management or nomadic pastoralism where continuously controlled herd movements allow exploiting grazing resources in a very sustainable way by tracking the temporal and spatial dynamics in resource availability particularly in arid regions where high fluctuations in quantity and quality of feed and water resources require a high level of mobility the recent boost in human population combined with restricted access to rangelands as a result of lack of land ownership or clearly defined and respected use rights has increased the pressure on the currently available foraging grounds and the risks of an unsustainable utilization of these natural resources e g hobbs et al 2008 thereby these additional challenges for the utilization of rangelands demand a further increase in herd mobility involving extra energy expense for movements in search of feed or alternatively an increase in productivity at reduced space and new adaptive strategies in grazing management while extensive knowledge on grazing management is available for regions with temperate climate expertise in management and ecology of rangelands in arid environments is still relatively poor boval and dixon 2012 a major reason for this scientific shortcoming is the high level of unpredictability involved which complicates the conclusive definition of the relevant ecosystem processes the involved drivers and the respective interactions the high spatial and temporal variability in forage quality and availability in dryland pastures has been claimed to furthermore limit the advances in our understanding of the processes in these ecosystems o reagain 2001 beukes et al 2002 mcivor 2011 jakoby et al 2015 in tropical and subtropical countries pastures and crop residues constitute the main nutrient resource for ruminants lazzarini et al 2009 as a result of the short growth period for vegetation tropical grasses usually embed increased amounts of cell wall compounds e g lignin thereby in combination with low protein contents providing feed of restricted digestibility leng 1990 brown 1999 the marked decline in feed quality as a result of fast maturation of such grasses has been identified as one of the main limiting factors to animal production in the tropics van soest 1982 leng 1984 fernandez rivera et al 2005 but has been ignored in many rangeland models so far e g martin et al 2014 accatino et al 2017 but see rasch et al 2016 traditionally focus factors considered in rangeland and grazing management are stocking density animal species as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of forage offer however only few attempts have yet been made to integrate spatial heterogeneity e g derner et al 2012 and non linear scaling e g laca 2009 although landscape ecology studies have revealed many years ago the potential effects of landscape patch configuration on individual animal s movement and the reciprocal effects of herbivores on landscape heterogeneity e g moen et al 1998 with et al 1999 marion et al 2005 high resource heterogeneity one of the characteristic factors of rangelands and the according grazing systems in arid and semi arid environments is a key factor determining the dynamics of large herbivores and the landscape laca 2009 as the spatial distribution of resources and selective feeding behavior of herbivores strongly affect their movement from grazing bout to landscape scale carvalho et al 2011 it has proved to represent an important factor for grazing efficiency and therefore also foraging productivity wallis de vries 1996 dijkman and lawrence 1997 jung et al 2002 yet the impact of spatial forage heterogeneity on herbivore nutrient intake and thereby productivity is still poorly understood marion et al 2005 the application of ecological modeling has been proved to be a valuable tool to study complex processes weisberg et al 2006 especially regarding its potential to predict reactions of systems on altered environmental conditions since 1970 numerous models have been developed focusing on various ecological and economic aspects of rangelands and grazing management with a broad range of approaches and purposes e g coughenour 1993 beecham and farnsworth 1998 derry 1998 diaz solis et al 2003 adler and hall 2005 macopiyo 2005 rufino et al 2009 kuckertz et al 2011 as tietjen and jeltsch 2007 stated in their review on models for semi arid grazing systems basically all models lacked the consideration of climatic variability e g the ability to resolve changes in intra annual precipitation jakoby et al 2015 this issue is particularly challenging when aiming at assessing the effect of future climate changes on livestock production systems in sub saharan countries predictions for these countries not only indicate a general decrease in precipitation and therefore in length of the growth period of vegetation but also an increase in temporal variability and change in precipitation distribution thornton et al 2006 thornton et al 2007 rust and rust 2013 it is furthermore remarkable that the integration of the climate dependent dynamics of resources quantity their nutritive quality and their spatial arrangement in a rangeland model for analysis of their effects on grazing herbivores has to our knowledge never been accomplished deterministic mechanical models often over simplify spatial variability and fall short of being fully spatially explicit nonaka and holme 2007 these models are furthermore hardly able to embody complex event driven dynamics and non equilibrium ecosystem dynamics two further characteristics of ecological processes in arid and semi arid environments cipriotti et al 2012 agent based models abms currently represent the most promising possibility to overcome these limitations by supporting dynamic adaptive relations between individual mobile entities and the integration of stochastic events in a spatially explicit context wiegand et al 1995 grimm and railsback 2005 grimm et al 2005 while some abms have been developed to simulate different specific aspects of rangeland ecology macopiyo 2005 müller et al 2007 kuckertz et al 2011 rasch et al 2016 the dynamics of climate vegetation and foraging herbivores have rarely been integrated within a habitat and rangeland management model modeling approaches to combine vegetation characteristics with animal behavior and movement and metabolic productivity in a spatially explicit manner to incorporate important dryland aspects such as spatial heterogeneity are missing so far this paper therefore aims to broaden the understanding of ecological aspects in rangeland and herd management in semi arid environments using an agent based approach we developed a spatially explicit model integrating energetic implications of animal movements to assess the potential of highly dynamic heterogeneous semi arid rangeland for adaptive livestock production main focus of the model is to account for the specific processes in rangeland based livestock production systems in dry zones and to assess the dynamics in system performance as such we incorporated a seasonal forage quality b spatially heterogeneous forage distribution and c the effect of climatic variability on forage resources for the development of ramdry rangeland model in drylands data from a semi arid region in southwestern madagascar has been integrated however ramdry uses a modular data structure which explicitly promotes its applicability for any other arid or semi arid rangeland area due to the complexity of the model this publication provides a description of the model considering free ranging conditions excluding any active influences on animal movements by herders nevertheless we would like to note that the model has by its agents based concept been specifically developed to integrate active herding strategies and interactive behavior between herders animals and the vegetation in this paper we first give a short introduction to the exemplary study region in madagascar followed by the general description of our model conforming to the extended version of the standardized odd overview design concepts and details protocol for individual respectively agent based models grimm and railsback 2005 grimm et al 2010 to identify critical input data we then assess the consequences of the different model parameters on the model outcomes within detailed local as well as global sensitivity analysis following recommendations of wiegand et al 2003 and grimm et al 2005 for complex systems we applied a pattern oriented model validation approach where emerging non implied patterns in model variables are evaluated and discussed the extensively parameterizable character of the model enables its use for i a wide range of applications ii testing various potential scenarios and or iii easy implementation of further alternative ruminant species such as sheep which will be part of future work nevertheless to highlight the potentials of the model we feature two exemplary study cases underlining its pioneering performance with regard to effects of future climatic changes and heterogeneity in resource distribution we show preliminary results of the simple effect of a reduced growth period shortened by 20 as predicted for the year 2050 for the study area thornton et al 2007 we further present some aspects of the effects of heterogeneous versus homogeneous spatial distribution of resources at equivalent total available forage biomass demonstrating thereby the importance of incorporating correct spatial resource arrangements in spatially explicit models in its current form ramdry allows the assessment of parameters for a sustainable use of foraging resources and the overall productivity of the system the model thereby has the potential to become an analytical tool that can be used to foster local food security and household economy of livestock keepers who exploit multiple repositories of grazing resources in marginal semi arid environments in the tropics and sub tropics 1 1 study region the region from which data has been used for the development of the model is located in the southwestern corner of madagascar the mahafaly region fig 1 is characterized by arid steppe climate with an annual mean temperature of 24 c 500 mm of annual precipitation and a dry season usually lasting from march to october throughout the last few years however a shift of the seasons of about two months has been registered ratovomanana et al 2013 as a result of the low and highly seasonal precipitation pattern the vegetation is dominated by deciduous spiny forest xerophytic bushland and savannah and vegetation cover in the area is heavily structured and shows a high degree of patchiness to capture most of the effects of this small scale heterogeneous distribution of resources our model focuses on the situation of the pastoral zebu cattle based livestock systems within the surrounding 100 km2 of one representative model village miarantsoa fig 2 including two grassland communities with differing forage qualities and maturation dynamics 2 model description the model description follows the extended odd protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2010 a detailed description of the processes and submodels can be found in the appendix and the model code is freely available through the model library of the openabm net https www openabm org model 5860 the model was implemented in netlogo 5 2 0 wilensky 1999 2 1 purpose the purpose of ramdry is to understand on the landscape level the parameters for a sustainable and effective utilization of rangelands within a semi arid environment and how management or environmental changes affect the herbivore grassland system on the basis of long termed simulation that integrates data of future climate scenarios conditions and management strategies for a sustainable use of foraging resources can be assessed and the productivity of the livestock production system is evaluated by applying a scenario based analysis approach the assessment is based on changes in animal numbers and body weights as functions of the initial stocking rate the spatial distribution of grazing resources and rainy season precipitation affecting vegetation growth and quality by this assessment the system s maximum potential secondary productivity is evaluated as well as its tipping point from which on unsustainable overgrazing occurs taking into account the seasonal dynamics of rangeland productivity in dry regions the model is supposed to support decision making processes in grazing management with specific focus on savannah ecosystems on the mahafaly plateau in southwestern madagascar the model is particularly suited to simulate the effects of a temporally and spatially regulated grazing b dynamics in animal stocking rates c predicted climatic changes and d usage of multiple forage resources with differing qualities and maturation dynamics on primary and secondary productivity 2 2 entities state variables and scales ramdry incorporates three sorts of entities two agent types herds and water points and environmental spatial cells a complete list of the defining state variables of the entities including the corresponding units is shown in tables s1 s3 mobile agents represent foraging herds of zebu cattle bos indicus the herd composition in terms of sex and age of the individual herd animals is kept constant throughout the simulation and animal specific metabolic calculations are based on a herd representing non pregnant adult female animal the representative the total number of agents in the model is variable which thereby allows for temporary changes e g as a result of seasonal transhumance movements the state variables defining the individual agents include their location number of animals metabolic fitness characteristics such as the body weight or live weight both terms are used interchangeably body condition score and potential milk production of the representative animal further state variables describe behavior related indicators such as feeding strategy i e selective or non selective feeding and feed patch selection strategy high quality feed patch or any as well as values for the metabolizable energy balance calculation e g energy costs for movement feeding activities and energy gain by grazing further productivity history of the individual agents is defined by the number of days consecutively passed either loosing or gaining weight a complete overview of the state variables of the mobile agents is shown in table s1 water point agents are non mobile entities representing water sources in the landscape they have only a symbolic function to store information about the various water resources and to interact with the mobile agents they are defined by their location type of source temporary or permanent their current availability as water resource and their current and maximum water holding capacity table s2 lists the different state variables and their corresponding units for the water point agents spatial patches represent areas with a certain type of land cover i e road barren land cropland grassland and areas dominated by shrubs or forest to be able to interact with the mobile agents they are defined as a continuous mosaic of square sized grid cells representing the model world located in the center of the cell mosaic is the village fig 2 embodying therein the corral night stay of the herd agents the state variables of the patches define the location the cost distance from the village based on the optimal movement path vegetation type and in case of grassland vegetation the type of grass species community as outlined in fig 2 as well as the state of the resources found there the state of the resources is as such changing in function of natural seasonal regrowth and maturation and is characterized by the amount of green biomass and necromass per area as indicators for the available forage quantity and their respective dry matter digestibilities dmd defining the resource quality the various state variables of the spatial patches are listed in table s3 the scales of the model define its spatial and temporal range and resolution one simulated time step represents one day and simulations are run up to 20 years equal to 7300 daily time steps to be able to simulate daily movements of animals of 10 15 km as reported by feldt and schlecht 2016 the total spatial extent of the model landscape was defined as an area of 10 km 10 km as a compromise between high resolution to capture the heterogeneous landscape character best and acceptable computing time the model landscape consists of 111 111 square grid cells measuring 90 m 90 m each 2 3 process overview and scheduling after the initial simulation setup within each time step starting in the morning of a day ramdry goes through 8 major processes which are all executed sequentially fig 3 processes 4 9 are as such run for each mobile agent successively while the order of the processed agents is kept fixed based on their individual internal id numbers in climate season as the first process in the cycle the type of the prevailing season growing dry is evaluated based on the predicted precipitation data based on the current type of season the variables of spatial patches are updated in a second step vegetation growth maturation describing the natural changes in vegetation in the course of the year thus depending on the season during the growth season exponential growing functions define the regrowth of fresh green biomass at highest dmd levels in grassland cells while maturation processes during the dry season result in an exponential decrease of green biomass simultaneously throughout the dry season the digestibility of this organic resource is decreasing following a linear gradient the total amount of available metabolizable energy is thereafter calculated accordingly for each grid cell based on the relative proportions of green and dry forage and their respective dmds in the subsequent process forage site selection the mobile agent is selecting a random but spatially restricted start point in line with the actual feeding strategy for foraging for the day and moves to the selected location as described in detail in the annex a1 7 4 the model is thereat calculating the time spent for the movements and the residual daily time available for foraging activities depending on the current feeding strategy a grazing path through the pasture is simulated in the process feed intake based on decision rule based animal movement behavior herd agents will follow patches with highest plant biomass density within their cognitive horizon aiming at maximizing energy intake as outlined in annex a1 4 and a1 7 5 4 the according amount of forage consumed is calculated taking into account the available time and biomass of the selected feed resource s in the different grid cells passed during the movement following the grazing path as well as the fill level of the animals gastrointestinal tract gut as a result of these foraging activities by the mobile agents removal of green biomass and necromass is then being evaluated for each grid cell along the grazing path in the subsequent process plant biomass adjustment the state variables of the patches are adjusted accordingly i e through the reduction of their respective available biomass in the following process animal energy balance the energy balance is calculated for the mobile agent considering the amount of metabolizable energy gained through the foraging process and all sources of energy cost i e for metabolic maintenance growth and movement based on the results of this energy balance calculation the body weight of the mobile agent is adjusted by converting excess energy into body tissue fat or protein depending on whether the current weight is below or above the standard reference weight i e the animals of the herd are under or overweight or by mobilizing energy from body tissue reserves upon a negative energy balance respectively the history of these body weight changes is recorded in order to adapt feeding and forage selection strategies accordingly prolonged periods of weight loss will for example result in a change from selective to non selective feeding behavior of the mobile agents check the detailed description of the sub processes in the annex for more information about the animal s feeding behavior in herd fitness as a final process of the mobile agents in the process cycle a body condition score as an index of animal fitness is calculated based on the ratio of current body weight of the agent and its reference weight in function of the resulting body condition score herd productivity in terms of reproduction and mortality rates is calculated and herd size adjusted accordingly finally in water balance the water requirement of the animal herd is evaluated taking influences of ambient temperature walking activities and daily dry matter intake into consideration the required amount of drinking water per day is in case of a temporary character of the selected water point lastly subtracted from the currently held water amount of the respective water point agent in case of dropping below minimum water amount the water point will be designated as non available until the onset of the next growth season for more details and model information please refer to the complete odd protocol provided in the annex 3 methods 3 1 general considerations about simulation analysis as a compromise between computing time and consideration of accumulative effects of foraging behavior and success of the animal throughout multiple sequences of dry and wet growth seasons the model analysis is based on the results after a period of three consecutive years of simulation to exclude additional variability of model results induced by erratic climatic influences from model analysis we employed an exemplary periodic seasonal climate as recorded in the period 06 2012 06 2013 keeping the duration of growth and dry seasons constant throughout the simulated years and inducing a growth period length of 78 days per year growth length table b1 because of the stochastic processes of the model the estimation of experimental error variance has first been assessed as proposed by lorscheid et al 2012 results of monte carlo sampling as requested for the stochastic processes of abms lee et al 2015 by repeated simulation runs with identical parameter values which we repeated multiple times indicated that the simulation needs to be run at least nine times repeatedly to ensure a continuous decrease in the standard deviation of herd weight at the end of the third year between herds with any additional simulation exemplary output fig 4 as a result all further analyses are based on averaged results of ten repeated 3 year simulations 3 2 sensitivity analysis the high number of model parameters and their complex interacting effects in ramdry rendered manual parameter space exploration challenging as predicted by lee et al 2015 to explore the effect size of variation of the parameters and identify the most influential ones sensitivity analysis was performed in a two step manner starting with a local inspection by traditional sensitivity functions ernstberger 2008 followed by an improved morris screening morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 of the most influential parameters according to the recommendations of lilburne and tarantola 2009 for large models for the purpose of comparison between the results of the model output in function of the values of the different altered parameters and their combinations initial herd size and herd number was kept constant throughout the analysis involving one single herd with 50 animals as our model is focusing on the productivity of the livestock system the sum of body weights of all individual animals of the herds was chosen as indicator of the system s productivity therefore in the context of the sensitivity analysis the main output of the simulation was defined as the total weight of the herd given by the agent s state parameter herdweight primarily local sensitivity analysis applying a one at a time oat approach has been executed on the 33 parameters listed in table b2 each value of these model parameters was varied in a range of 20 i e for 0 10 20 swartzman and kaluzny 1987 or where additional data sources could be found in literature within accordingly extended or reduced ranges model results were checked for linearity within the tested parameter range using linear regression and visual assessment to identify localized increased sensitivity statistical significance of the individual parameters on the model result was furthermore tested using linear regression analysis in r r core team 2015 result analysis incorporating the whole parameter set was conducted applying a general linear model glm in the r package lme4 bates et al 2015 based on the relative sensitivity of the model towards the assessed parameters parameters with relative sensitivity above 50 thereby deemed sensitive jackson et al 2000 have been included in the subsequent morris screening because of the high computational requirements of the long term simulations the application of parameter screening methods has proved to be advantageous due to their improved efficiency and capability of handling large data sets thiele et al 2014 the morris elementary effects ee screening method morris 1991 is particularly suited for agent based models as it is free of any assumption it is based on an individual randomized oat design varying the input parameters randomly over a predefined range estimating thereby the effects of parameter variation contrarily to the precedent individual oat based analysis this ee analysis avoids to resume to baseline values for each parameter expanding thereby the multidimensional parameter space to allow global sensitivity analysis iooss and lemaître 2014 morris screening was performed in r using the sensitivity package pujol et al 2015 we applied morris s oat design morris 1991 following screening procedures as described by thiele et al 2014 using ten repetitions and five levels for all sensitive parameters the parameter ranges were defined similar to the local sensitivity approach except for minor range reductions for certain parameters to ensure minimal margin between their respective minimum and maximum levels the assessed parameters and the ranges are listed in table b3 morris sensitivity indices were calculated according to the euclidean distance of the absolute mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the elementary effects as suggested by beaudouin et al 2015 the absolute mean μ of the elementary effects is thereby a measure of influence of the individual input parameter on the output while the standard deviation represents the level of non linearity of the parameters and or interaction effects with other parameters 3 3 pattern oriented model validation for simplicity reasons the presented model simulates free ranging condition of zebu herds as encountered in many semi arid sub tropical grazing systems e g sahel mongolia at least during parts of the year however livestock management in the mahafaly region is characterized by active herding of ruminants on pastures feldt and schlecht 2016 this leads to the lack of real data for direct validation of the model results an obstacle observed in many bottom up models of complex system wiegand et al 2003 we therefore adapted the strategy of pattern oriented modeling pom to test for realism of model structure and mechanisms as suggested by grimm et al 2005 due to their respective importance for the modeled system we focused on three known distinct patterns a the seasonal fluctuation of body weight of free ranging ruminants as a response to changes in forage availability and quality b the constraint in system productivity resulting in reduced carrying capacity of the grazing environment at increased grazing intensities until the complete break down after exceeding the tipping point of the foraging system and c the seasonal changes in movement related energy costs for ruminants during foraging as a result of restricted resource availability in particular towards the end of the dry season for assessing the seasonal changes of body weight daily data on body weight of the animals has been retrieved from the model and seasonal changes compared to data from similar environments schlecht unpublished data zimmermann 1980 kebreab et al 2005 as observed by fernandez rivera et al 2005 see fig 1 therein the expected pattern was supposed to display an increase in body weight after the onset of the rainy season as a result of the available fresh nutrient rich forage resource which ceases after the end of the growth season when fresh feed becomes depleted and or more lignified during the dry season animals were supposed to lose weight in response to low feed quality and availability for the evaluation of the second pattern the influence of foraging intensity on long term system productivity has been assessed by comparing the initial sum of weights of all animals to the weight sum after three years therefore multiple simulation runs with varying initial values for herd sizes and herd numbers have been conducted by increasing foraging intensity above the resource limits of the ecological system we assessed the tipping point condition identifying thereby the theoretical carrying capacity of the system and its ecological overshoot the expected outcome was a pattern comparable to the seneca cliff as described by bardi 2011 to assess effects of low forage availability on increased walking activities of the animals in search for food energy costs related to walking during foraging were compared between different stages of the seasons e g early or late dry season the daily energy cost associated with movement averaged over seven days at the beginning and the end of the dry season should exhibit distinct differences as e g indicated by fernandez rivera et al 2005 energy costs for movement were analyzed on the basis of movement distance differences between the track length distances in the two seasonal stages were compared by t test analysis using r to display the effect of spatial heterogeneity in forage distribution on movement related energy cost dynamics comparative simulations with homogeneous forage distribution and an equal total amount of green forage biomass have been conducted according to previous studies on the effect of spatial simplification in foraging systems marion et al 2005 homogeneous resource distribution was expected to result in an under estimation of the optimal stocking density due to an increased energy cost for movement in search of feed 4 results 4 1 general model results fig 5 shows the dynamics in daily gain costs of metabolic energy and the overall daily energy balance in the course of a normal year for a healthy mature female animal in case of low intensive grazing pressure as an example of the model output it clearly displays periods of net energy loss when the overall energy balance is negative and of net energy gain furthermore it indicates the relative importance of the various components of the metabolic energy balance whereby energy costs for maintenance represent the most important factor in the calculation 475 kj kg0 75 mbw metabolic body weight compared to energy costs for movement from to forage grounds which are on average 80 4 kj kg0 75 mbw sd 25 4 kj kg0 75 mbw throughout the year energy costs related to movement feature a constant general trend as a result of the low intensity of grazing pressure applied the seasonal variation in energy gain by feeding of a mature female animal throughout and between seasons as displayed in fig 5 is partly a result of changes in daily dry matter intake dmi dmi of a female of 200 kg mean body weight fluctuated between 4 89 kg and 2 28 kg while the yearly average was 3 66 kg sd 0 49 kg remarkably a major driver for this fluctuation in dmi has been the seasonal variation of forage digestibility limiting the voluntary intake as described in paragraph a1 7 5 of the annex underlining thereby the pre eminent significance of this parameter on the productivity of the livestock husbandry system as further highlighted in the results of the sensitivity analysis 4 2 sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 local sensitivity functions the absolute sensitivity of the 33 tested parameters ranged from 0 07 to 273 table b4 albeit for only eleven parameters the individual regression analysis indicated statistical significance p 0 05 for linearity coefficients of determination from linear regression analysis of the statistically significant parameters ranged between 0 88 and 0 99 whereby eight parameters indicated high sensitivity values above 50 within the assessed range table 1 most of the parameters with high sensitivity displayed a high level of linearity with r2 values above 0 9 the only exception was the influence of parameter highdigesth that followed a unimodal trend giving minimum model results for a parameter value 10 below the standard value fig 6 the results of the glm showed 19 parameters to be statistically significant the results furthermore underlined the importance of the influence of the eight previously scaled parameters that exhibited highest sensitivity as they also featured highest estimates in the glm table b5 none of the analyzed parameters exhibited any sign of significant correlation 0 1 4 2 2 morris screening the two forage resource parameters lowdigesth and highdigesth which define the respective maximum digestibility of the two forage qualities had a very dominant overall influence on total system productivity as the assessed model output fig 7 in the morris screening the high impact of these two parameters in the morris screening is mainly the effect of their minimum values which in combination with unfavorable foraging or metabolic parameter values resulted in a strong reduction of animal productivity i e increasing the risk of fast loss of weight and death from starvation fig 8 parameter combinations that lead to fatal conditions resulting in final total herd weights below 500 kg and as such in the death of most animals are listed in the auxiliary table s6 remarkably all of those combinations include very low levels of the two mentioned digestibility related parameters similar absolute values of the mean μ and the absolute mean μ of the elementary effects of all parameters with the exception of grossenergy fig 7 indicate that these effects are mostly monotonic positive signs of μ of the parameters lowdigesth highdigesth and herdincreaseratebig thereby signal their positive influence on total herd weight in contrast to the other five parameters which were exhibiting negative signs for μ all tested parameters showed strong links between the absolute mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the elementary effects fig 9 4 3 pattern oriented model validation a seasonal fluctuation of body weight as expected body weight of the simulated zebus within one herd exhibited distinct changes over the course of a year as displayed for a female adult animal in fig 10 the oscillation followed the seasonal changes of precipitation respectively the quality of the feed resources fig 10 which was tightly linked to the rainfall pattern the resulting peak amplitude of the oscillation was 12 kg at an average body weight of 197 kg under normal environmental conditions as recorded during the period 2012 2013 and low grazing intensity b system tipping point fig 11 shows the change of long term productivity of the livestock based system in response to initial grazing intensities the sum of the body weights of all animals in the simulated herds after three simulated years with normal climatic conditions increased constantly with increasing initial total herd weight exhibiting only a marginal trend to saturation of the system up to an initial herd weight value of 490 000 kg sd 14 249 kg when maximum sustainable production under constant conditions was reached at a grazing intensity equivalent to an initial total herd weight above 500 000 kg the system started to get over exploited and above this threshold a steep drop in the productivity curve was salient this trend was independent of the spatial dispersion of the grazing load i e it was observed likewise for different levels of individual herd size despite the difference in environmental conditions and thereby level of values the comparison with results reviewed by aiken 2016 as outlined in fig 12 shows the high level of analogy of the observed productivity curve with the results of our simulation the outcome of an analogous analysis of long term productivity indicates a sharp decrease in livestock system performance when applying modified future climatic conditions that result in a shortened annual growth period length of 63 days fig 13 the constant linearly increasing trend ends above an initial herd weight of 120 000 kg and the tipping point of the system is reached at an initial herd weight value of 320 000 kg c seasonal changes in forage movement related energy costs the length of the herds daily itineraries tracks during foraging activities showed seasonal variation particularly after the switch to the non selective feeding strategy in the early dry season tracks were generally shorter compared to tracks from the end of the dry season as a result of the higher area density of heretofore unused low quality forage biomass after the rains the averaged value for daily track length in the week starting 9 june day 160 of year which often corresponded with the period immediately after the strategy switch was 1 286 m sd 225m in the case of low grazing pressure by animals of a total body weight of initially 40 841 kg 5 herds 50 animals per herd at the end of the dry season animals under this grazing regime moved on average 1 749 m per day sd 269m for foraging although this difference may seem small it has proved to be statistically significant p 0 005 however the effect of increased movement activities as a result of search for resources feed and water obviously gains importance only when resources get sparse at high grazing pressure the importance of this effect increased tremendously when access to resources was constrained fig 14 for grazing animals of a total body weight of initially 551 357 kg 45 herds 75 animals per herd daily track length in the corresponding week in june averaged 1 144 m sd 162 m and increased to 9 386 m sd 7 001 m towards the end of the dry season p 0 02 for the purpose of displaying the loss of accessible resources during the dry season fig 14 exemplarily includes the dynamic changes of track length resulting in according variability in energy costs related to movement as well as the available dry forage biomass in heteropogon dominated grassland under the two extreme grazing regimes interestingly independent of the maximum heteropogon necromass area density that was reached during the corresponding growth season forage track lengths at high grazing intensity consistently started to increase sharply during the following dry season as soon as mean heteropogon necromass area density fell below 1 850 kg dm ha fig 14 furthermore shows track length dynamics in case of spatially homogeneous forage distribution as compared to the real heterogeneous distribution tracks executed under homogeneous forage distribution at high grazing pressure were on average 15 longer than those encountered with heterogeneous forage distribution p 0 001 particularly during the last section of the dry season 5 discussion the analysis of the results of our spatially explicit rangeland model validated the chosen concept based on the dynamic availability and use of metabolizable energy in rangelands by ruminants and the involved digestive and metabolic processes ramdry has thereby proved the importance of integrating forage quality spatial distribution of resources and appropriate detail level for climatic conditions as well as their dynamics in assessments of livestock rangeland systems within semi arid environments because of the low quality of forage resources that prevails in tropical and sub tropical drylands for up to nine months per year the incorporation of diet quality in the assessment of the long term productivity of rangeland livestock systems is of high importance as such our model increases its potential of projecting the effects of climatic variability and management changes on rangeland based livestock production systems in comparison with alternative rangeland models implemented so far which are focusing primarily on available forage biomass e g calabrese et al 2011 martin et al 2014 ramdry furthermore allows studying the consequences of spatio temporal variability in both resource availability and quality on rangeland utilization which has been mostly lacking in existing models derner et al 2012 this is of particular importance in view of the urgent need for understanding the mechanisms of dryland dynamics as stated by lohmann et al 2012 the temporally high energy costs related to movement of grazing animals in search for food within heterogeneous environments has been depicted in other studies e g jung et al 2002 despite its importance in the metabolic energy balance of grazing animals which has been confirmed by the results of our model it has so far been largely ignored in current rangeland management models e g jakoby et al 2015 by the integration of complementary effects of precipitation and grazing on the growth decay and disappearance of vegetation forage and their high levels of heterogeneity our dynamic agent based modeling approach is well suited for the assessment of reactions of grassland ecosystem in non equilibrium state gillson and hoffman 2007 as e g semi arid savannas on changes in resource utilization 5 1 modeling approach in order to adjust the complexity of our model into the medawar zone the optimal zone between too much simplification and over complexity grimm et al 2005 we had to omit several ecological details of dryland systems influencing the suitability of the model for certain applications or conditions beside the challenges in analysis of complex ecosystem models calabrese et al 2011 computing power and lack of suitable validation data were the major constraints we were confronted with to keep the model complexity as low as possible for the target applications model development has thereby been performed in a step wise manner gradually increasing complexity by additional sub processes until ramdry was able to reproduce the dynamics we had been aiming for and the interdependencies we perceived based on own field work in semi arid african grazing systems and international literature in contrast to other grazing related studies focusing on processes in semi arid environments our model represents the vegetation by plant species communities instead of an agglomeration of individual species e g coughenour 1993 weber et al 1998 fynn and o connor 2000 adler et al 2001 or functional types e g lohmann et al 2012 the level of detail in our model was primarily restricted by the spatial scale of our landscape level approach that covers a large area of 100 km2 at a spatial resolution of 90 m and the lack of detailed data on the abundance and selective consumption of individual grassland plant species by the foragers instead of taking the risk of unreasonably high levels of uncertainty in our predictions we defined the features of the different species communities by their respective dominant species i e heteropogon contortus and aristida adscensionis which have also been identified as principal fodder plants for zebu cattle in the region marp 2011 feldt 2015 we are aware that this simplification leads inter alia to the inability of the model to assess changes in plant species composition as a result of grazing as observed in other studies e g snyman 1998 savadogo 2007 tietjen and jeltsch 2007 this would have required further long term field observations in the study area effects of soil parameters on the vegetation growth are considered via the locally adjusted regrowth rates which have been defined on the basis of remote sensed data on biomass distribution we accepted current local growth conditions as static founded e g on the level of soil compaction soil depth its potential of water retention or and nutrient availability therefore effects of change in soil nutrient content e g by fertilization or erosion or impact of over utilization through trampling or rain use efficiency ruppert et al 2012 cannot be assessed by the current model as such accumulative effects of forage utilization are limited to effective grazing intensity effects of continuous over utilization such as change in grass species composition bush encroachment reduced soil fertility as reported by many studies and reviewed by czegledi and radacsi 2005 cannot be represented in the current version of the model reducing as such its applicability in long term studies on land degradation processes as these effects highly rely on detailed soil information which is often not available in the requested resolution we decided to ignore these processes from the current model nevertheless we consider the integration of dynamically adjustable threshold values max min for forage digestibility to simulate vegetation degradation processes in future versions of the model the representation of spatial and temporal distribution of above ground biomass by the use of remotely sensed vegetation indices has been widely studied and sometimes criticized for sensitivity to soil influences particularly in semi arid rangelands reviews by eisfelder et al 2011 jacques et al 2014 other studies identified e g ndvi as reliable tool for monitoring semi arid areas pettorelli et al 2005 egeru et al 2014 comparing the prediction accuracy of several vegetation indices with observations we found ndvi the most appropriate for the studied environment to circumvent the mentioned challenges our approach linked individual remote sensing based estimation of green above ground biomass for different soil types with according time series of field measurements antsonantenainarivony 2017 which might however limit direct portability for other regions eisfelder et al 2010 5 2 general model results energy cost of walking can constitute a big proportion of daily energy need of grazing ruminants dijkman and lawrence 1997 our model results on movement costs of free ranging animals of 80 4 kj kg0 75 mbw are comparable with measurements on grazing cows in literature which estimated daily energy costs for idle walking between 84 5 and 92 4 kj kg0 75 mbw brosh et al 2010 while topography in our study region was simple and has therefore not been implemented the experimental sites of brosh et al 2010 were hilly increasing thereby a cattle s energy costs for movement variability in our results however was higher sd 25 4 kj kg0 75 mbw supposedly as a result of the random selection of foraging sites from a large area in our model as compared to the confined experimental plots of the study of brosh and colleagues total daily energy costs for all activities constituted around 15 20 of the maintenance energy requirements in our model which matched the trend of studies on grazing cattle from argentina that reported increments of 12 29 depending primarily on the grazing intensity di marco and aello 2001 the resulting daily intake of dry matter from our model 41 94 g dm kg0 75 mbw 72 9 g dm kg0 75 mbw in average aligned with results of previous studies on zebu cattle in the sahel reporting a forage intake of 62 9 86 3 g dm kg0 75 mbw per day ayantunde et al 2002 5 3 sensitivity analysis results of local sensitivity analysis revealed a strong trend of linearity in the model linear regression coefficients of determination of 0 88 and higher for all significant parameters indicate a high level of model stability the only parameter displaying a unimodal tendency the maximum digestibility value of green high quality forage is showing a slight increasing effect at low values the explanation for such a model behavior most probably lies in the very prompt switching from supposed selective high quality foraging to non selective feeding in response to the apparent negative daily energy balance during selective feeding behavior in such a parameter configuration the low levels of digestibility for the high quality forage are in fact lower than the digestibility of the low quality forage according to our model analysis quality appears to be the only feature of vegetation as feed resource namely in terms of its digestibility and gross energy content which is significantly influencing system productivity this might seem astonishing as the amount of vegetation biomass does not appear to give statistically significant effects on the modeled productivity however it must be kept in mind that sensitivity analysis has been performed at conditions of low grazing pressure where the effect of restricted biomass availability is only minor while gross energy content of tropical forage resources has been extensively assessed e g jarrige 1989 and found to be relatively constant king 1983 the digestibility of tropical forage plants exhibits a high intra annual and species specific variability van soest 1982 we therefore analyzed multiple vegetation samples taken at different seasonal stages for their respective in vitro digestibility menke et al 1979 including species specific n 340 and mixed species samples n 29 and compared them with literature data feldt et al 2017 fust unpubl mixed species analysis including all plant species found on the mahafaly pastures in their respective proportion however gave very poor digestibility results data not shown as all above ground plant parts and species had been non selectively collected for credibility reasons we therefore concluded to rely on digestibility values from well established databases heuzé et al 2015a 2015b hence for the application of our model in other study areas we strongly recommend a detailed feed quality analysis including extensive sampling of the major forage species whenever possible although using scaled parameters for easier interpretation the results of the morris screening indicate extremely high model sensitivity on the forage quality parameters in terms of low values for the maximum digestibilities of the two major grass species i e parameters highdigesth and lowdigesth morris screening is a technique particularly adapted for models with large numbers of parameters or long computational run times sumner et al 2012 as such capable of providing information about qualitative sensitivity by ranking the parameters by their importance however this method is not adapted for quantitative comparison of sensitivity between parameters campolongo et al 2005 close assessment of the influence of the two most prominent parameters showed that the extreme effects at lowest values took place only in interaction with other parameters when multiple parameters were set at levels that resulted in unfavorable conditions for metabolic processes pasture and herd productivity particularly the combination of extremely low maximum digestibilities of all forage resources proved to provide fatal conditions resulting in the death of most animals table s6 the high standard deviation values of the elementary effects σ of parameters tested in the morris screening that are comparable with the values of their respective absolute means μ can be interpreted as the result from an elevated level of interaction with other parameters campolongo et al 2005 rather than from their non linear effects thiele et al 2014 underlining thereby the interwoven and complex influence of these variables 5 4 pattern oriented model validation a seasonal fluctuation of body weight the observed dynamics of body weight change of the animals in the course of a year represented perfectly the findings of prior studies zimmermann 1980 found similar effects of changes in forage digestibility on the body weight of cattle in south africa concluding that a minimum digestibility of 53 was needed for maintenance without weight loss the yearly variation of the body weight of 12 in our model is well in the range recorded in other studies that reported seasonal weight losses of up to 20 during periods of under nutrition as a result of low forage availability and quality matulis et al 1987 schlecht et al 1999 kebreab et al 2005 the lower body weight variation level in our model is a result of the modeled seasonal changes in feed digestibility which are smaller than in comparable studies e g fernandez rivera et al 2005 comparison of the model results with data from cattle in the sahel schlecht unpublished data exhibited identical pattern dynamics fig 15 shows the averaged seasonal body weight fluctuation of female cattle in niger in 1997 1998 and the according periods of rain we overlaid the model result timely adjusted for simultaneous rain periods and found similar temporal dynamics resulting e g in the maximal body weight being reached about two months after the end of the rainy season because of the differences in feed digestibility between the measured and the model data and its effect on weight variation as outlined above calculation of goodness of fit of the two curves has not been performed weight changes as a result of changes in forage resources as described by mclean et al 1983 however cannot be simulated by the current model as proportions of the different body components and organs relative to total body weight have not been explicitly implemented b system tipping point according to our model the maximum number of zebu cattle that can sustainably be kept within the study area under continuously normal precipitation conditions would be around 3 000 individuals or an equivalent of 2 333 mature females however it is important to realize that this figure represents basically the additional grazing load on top of the already existing as we used remote sensed data from an area already utilized by grazing livestock even though unreasonable under the actual dynamic conditions in forage availability and quality calculating the theoretical grazing capacity of the modeled system including a total grass biomass of 13 234 t dm 10 000 ha and a mean daily dry matter intake rate of 4 kg for a female adult animal would result in a capacity of 9 064 animals considering a reduced actual plant biomass availability due to unpalatibility decomposition and fire of 0 5 as proposed by hein and weikard 2008 the theoretical stocking rate would be estimated at 0 59 animals body weight 210 kg per hectare which would also align with estimates of 0 313 au ha 1 animal unit 450 kg steer in other studies in semi arid savannas fynn and o connor 2000 however the result of our simulation of a maximum stocking rate of 0 26 tlu ha tlu tropical livestock unit 250 kg herbivore lies much lower confirming model results of weikard and hein 2011 for optimal stocking rates in the semi arid west african sahel of 0 12 tlu ha at half the annual precipitation amount as compared to our study area shortening the annual growth period by 20 as predicted for the study area by 2050 thornton et al 2007 would significantly reduce the maximum stocking rate by at least 40 although a reduction in animal performance and at the same time system productivity has been observed at much lower stocking rates in such a case performance is only predicted to keep constant up to 750 grazing animals equivalent to 583 mature females drastically reducing livelihood and food security of the local population considering that these numbers are based on continuous growth periods the predicted increased temporal variability in precipitation resulting in interrupted growth seasons is assumed to lead to a further aggravation of the situation for pastoral livestock producers in the area it is important to recognize that prognosis of future climate changes not only predicts the general reduction of growth period length but also the increase of its variability more detailed investigation of the effects of climate variability targeting at the presumably adverse effects of distribution of growth periods e g the change from one continuous annual growth period to multiple short periods of plant growth is currently been undertaken but will be part of a separate publication although system productivity in response to increasing stocking rate showed similar trends for different herd sizes bigger herds seemed to exhibit a higher efficiency in resource use resulting in higher maximal stocking rates within sustainable limits fig 11 this might seem counterintuitive upon first impression however it can be explained by the lower spatial dispersion of the lower number of herds which in turn might lead to a more heterogeneous utilization of the forage resources at the same stocking rate with the increase in patchiness of resource distribution chances for randomly finding foraging regions with locally elevated values of available biomass are enhanced which can affect the maximum sustainably acceptable number of livestock per area a similar effect of spatial arrangement has been found while analyzing the daily track lengths for foraging movements within an environment characterized by homogeneous versus heterogeneous forage distribution as discussed in the following paragraph c seasonal changes in forage movement related energy costs studies on movement distance of foraging livestock in general and its changes throughout the seasons in particular are primarily focusing on total walked distance without differentiation between distance for reaching forage grounds and distance walked while foraging on pasture although several studies identified a change in walked distance per day between the early and late dry season turner et al 2005 schlecht et al 2006 feldt and schlecht 2016 we were unable to find any research on free ranging pastoral livestock that explicitly measured the daily walked distance in the search of feed fernandez rivera et al 2005 direct comparison with the model results is therefore difficult however other studies explain a general increase in distance covered by a decrease in average forage availability across the seasons turner et al 2005 relating thereby forage area density kg dm ha with walking distance km d as predicted based on findings by marion et al 2005 the comparison of energy costs related to foraging movements between spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous environments showed in average higher costs in a homogeneous arrangement hereby system performance in the real heterogeneous environment was increased compared to the homogeneous case leading to 10 higher maximal sustainably allowed grazing intensity at high grazing pressure p 0 01 data not shown the increase in daily travel distance within a homogeneous landscape is in line with results of wallis de vries 1996 who predicted an increase of 10 15 in travel distance at uniform forage distribution as against a random distribution pastoral herding strategies often aim at actively influencing daily herd movements in terms of selection of foraging grounds as well as regarding resident time per grazing patch the assumption of free ranging conditions with a randomized selection of the start foraging ground in the described version of the model represents a sub optimal utilization of the available resources this might inflict increased time and accordingly energy expenses which might be optimized through active grazing management the constant search for and use of the best forage patches as implemented in the livestock grazing sub model possibly results in faster weight gain of the animals during the growth season but also in elevated energy respectively weight loss during the dry season adapted herding strategies would probably dampen the observed seasonal body weight fluctuation however in the current model version herds have free access to any grassland patch which in reality might not necessarily be the case as a result of restricted land use rights fernandez rivera et al 2005 ameliorating as such the forage availability situation for the herds in the model the most important limitation of the model we could identify was the low potential to simulate accumulative effects of environmental degradation such as change in plant community composition soil compaction or soil erosion because of its importance in rangeland management this point will be kept in mind for the future development of the model 6 summary and conclusion current and predicted future development put high pressure on the natural resources of rangelands in dry ecosystems and their sustainable use requires sound knowledge about the involved ecological processes and demands a well adapted management the application of agent based modeling proved to be ideally suited for simulating the reciprocal interactions between herbivores and vegetation in a dynamic environment as found in semi arid and arid rangelands although confronted with a lack of data for direct validation of our model the combination of sensitivity analysis and pattern oriented modeling and the verification of their results based on observed patterns and literature data provided enough insight into the capabilities and limits of the ramdry model as well as confidence in the processes included therein the simulation of changes in climatic conditions in terms of a shortened vegetation growth period as predicted by future global climate scenarios resulted in the significant reduction of sustainably acceptable grazing pressure and thereby system productivity the importance of considering the metabolic costs related to herd movements as well as of the dynamics in quality and quantity of forage resources in the assessment of environmental effects of livestock production systems in semi arid savanna ecosystems could be well validated by the presented model thereby ramdry demonstrated its capabilities to simulate livestock production systems in the dry rangelands of southwestern madagascar and to evaluate potential effects of changes in herd management and climatic conditions on rangeland and livestock system productivity acknowledgments this study was co funded by the german federal ministry

fieldwork we are particularly grateful to tobias feldt and katja brinkmann for their knowledgeable input and for providing an initial version of the digital land cover classification map we acknowledge the helpful comments of an anonymous reviewer on earlier versions of this paper special thanks go to uta berger volker grimm and henrik von wehrden for insightful advice and guidance in the development of the model appendix a odd protocol of ramdry a1 1 a1 3 a general overview of the model is described in chapter 2 a1 4 design concepts basic principles we applied at the system level an additive disturbance principle which defines the utilization of natural resources by livestock as additional stress in a dynamic ecosystem it overlays the natural dynamics of resource availability with the temporal extraction pattern ignoring thereby potential accumulative degradation effects e g soil compacting through trampling for the modeling of the feeding behavior of the agents in a general sense we adopted a classical model of optimal herbivore foraging that premised on energy maximization assuming that the goal of foraging is to maximize the long term energy intake stephens and krebs 1986 in particular on small spatial scales this foraging strategy has been proved to be predominant for free ranging ruminants fortin et al 2003 however as ramdry focuses on processes in semi arid sub tropical environments where the quality of foraging resources is generally lower than in temperate or humid sub tropical environments we furthermore applied the fill unit system as described in jarrige 1989 as the principle governing short term herbage intake this system predicts voluntary dry matter intake by animal characteristics intake capacity and the fill value of the forage relying thereby on gut capacity as intake regulating factor with regard to the energy system incorporated in ramdry we integrated the metabolizable energy me feeding system as described by the agricultural and food research council afrc 1993 embodying energetic efficiencies for ration formulation and the prediction of animal performance agnew and yan 2000 based on our own observations we realized that the principle of an ordinary foraging day involved the visit of a water point at the beginning or end of the day therefore we defined a foraging day by the movement from the village to the grazing ground from there to the closest available water point and back to the corral feldt and schlecht 2016 the application of basic biological and ecological principles related to the metabolic and ecosystem functions in the model allows its easy adaptation e g to the condition of other semi arid rangelands the model can furthermore be re adjusted for other ruminant species emergence herd productivity here expressed by herd size and cumulative body weight bw of the animals emerges from the environmental quality the animals feeding strategy decisions and anthropogenic herd management the latter factor being not considered here the dynamics of habitat quality in terms of resource provision emerges from climatic conditions precipitation and particularly in perennial plants prior grazing intensity both influencing factors are thereby partly unpredictable as the selection of foraging sites the animal movements while foraging and the intensity of use of vegetation are partly randomized processes vegetation regrowth and maturation rates however are the result of predefined functions forage site selection is restricted within certain spatial limits feeding strategy is a result of accrued foraging success therefore in direct relation with environmental quality adaptation herd agents adopt a quality before quantity feeding strategy which implies that they would rather select for high quality resources as long as these are sufficiently available before they would consider the selection of available low quality feed resources it represents basically the two foraging principles of selective and non selective feeding on a patch scale this principle manifests by switching between feeding strategies after an enduring deficit in energy for several consecutive days selective non selective or regrowth of high quality feed resources above minimum amounts non selective selective adoption of high quality feed strategy i e selective feeding results in a consequent selection of high quality foraging sites and feeding exclusively on high quality grid cells all along the daily grazing path in contrast both low and high quality foraging resources are extracted in low quality feed strategy i e non selective feeding starting at sites that are chosen randomly under such conditions all resources on each grid cell are taken into account while proceeding along the daily grazing path as the expenditure of energy for locomotion within the different land cover types varies corresponding to their resistance to movements the agents adapt their moves accordingly seeking the most energy efficient pathway while grazing low speed locomotion movement is described as a mix of correlated random and targeted walk depending on the reachability of suitable feeding targets grid cells within the agent s detection range check the section on sensingfor details in accordance with the prevailing feeding strategy however targeted low speed grazing movements are only executed if any suitable grid cell within detection range can provide better feeding conditions in terms of resource quantity than the actual current condition in case of absence of suitable targets or their inaccessibility movement directions vary as a function of a normal random distribution mobile agents adapt their movements furthermore in dependence on the availability of active water points by avoiding the visit of dried off sites objectives by the adaptation of their foraging behavior agents seek to maximize daily energy intake and thereby their body weight this ensures optimal fecundity and results in the increase in the number of herd individuals and thus signifies an increase in livestock productivity agents will primarily try to meet this objective through preference of good quality forage above maximizing gut fill however the objective of the model per se is to find parameter sets and strategies that lead to an optimized sustainable long term productivity of the complete system even if the individual agents follow egocentric benefit maximizing strategies sensing individual livestock herd agents are assumed to remember predict certain spatial and resource related aspects of the environment such as the availability and location of water points that are supposed to be visited once per day for drinking subsequent to the foraging activities in particular agents are supposed to follow the most energy efficient path from the grazing grounds to the nearest active water point in order to calculate the maximum potential time on pasture agents are furthermore assumed to be responsive to the actual astronomic day length to ensure the daily return of the herd back to the village the base corral before night fall for the daily selection of the initial grazing grid cell agents are assumed to sense the biomass density and quality at the target foraging site the cognitive capabilities of the agents during the active feeding process are being used for finding the next appropriate feeding station limited by range and angle of reception of the grid cells within a cone of radius 180 m and within 50 from the direction of the current movement agents can perceive the vegetation type biomass density corresponds to the grass sward height therefore related to the visual perception and the quality class of the grassland vegetation high or low quality related to organoleptic perception within the context of foraging strategy selection i e selective versus non selective feeding the agents are assumed to realize the number of consecutive days of energy loss and to recognize the onset of the growing season stochasticity several aspects of the process of selecting the start site of foraging are involving random sampling to reproduce behavior variability the distance from the village at which a start site might be selected is constrained within a band of fix width limited at its lower end by a minimum distance value sampled from a random normal distribution the final selection of a site within that band is made in a partly randomized manner depending on the currently active selection strategy to realistically simulate untargeted in field movement behavior of the agents correlated random walk has been implemented in the model thereby the direction of movement is dependent on the direction of the prior movement using a normal random distribution as deflection angle fig a1 collectives agents do not form or belong to aggregations observation the main output of the model is the system productivity at the end of the simulation defined by the number of individuals within the herd agents and their respective body weights for the assessment and analysis of the model it is however beneficial to follow the dynamic behavior not only of these two parameters but also some underlying factors therefore daily values of body weight energy costs and gains are collected yearly recordings of climatic condition total amount of rain duration of growth season number of individuals per agent as well as of the spatial distribution of biomass complement the dataset for analysis all of the data are used for the testing of the abm a1 5 initialization during the initialization process gis based spatial data on land cover type vegetation classes and primary production are loaded and processed into initial state variables of the spatial cells the data reflects the situation on 4th march 2013 signifying thereby the start of the dry season based on data from a land use map and a vegetation index map a vegetation class raster map is calculated defining accordingly for each grid cell the relative movement energy costs for its transition the initial amount of green herbaceous biomass per grid cell is derived from remote sensed data of normalized differential vegetation index ndvi depending on the grass vegetation community initial digestibilities of the fresh and dry forage are set for each grassland grid cell assigning one predefined value to all grid cells with high quality forage here aristida adscensionis and another lower value to the low quality forage cells here heteropogon contortus to setup the herd agents a predefined number of mobile entities are created and equipped with an initial set of parameters an initial herd size between 3 and 120 is randomly set for each agent and an initial body weight of 200 kg for the representing animal based on collected data fust unpubl is consistently assigned values for the average walking speed average foraging speed and potential milk production are set based on recorded data as outlined by feldt 2015 and feldt pers comm initial values for feeding and patch selection strategy are allotted finally additional internal agent state variables counting the days with weight gain and weight loss are reset three stationary water point agents are positioned in the model area based on location data of the real water points data not shown and initial values regarding their availability as water point temporal availability and water holding amount are set several fix global variables and parameters are defined all initial values are listed in table b1 by reference to the previously assigned energy cost of movement per individual grid cell the accumulated cost surfaces from the model center village and the different water points are calculated subsequently the shortest paths and their respective lengths based on the accumulated cost surfaces are evaluated for the ways from the various water points to the village a1 6 input data ramdry is intended to be an integral part of a socio economic and ecologic model for the mahafaly region within the context of the sulama project www sulama de therefore it is supposed to accept input data from different other sub modules of the sulama model in the current version however it includes in particular for its spatial explicitness several sources of gis based datasets with regard to climatic changes data of a dynamic climatic model for the region kuebler unpublished data based on an assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change moss et al 2008 niang et al 2014 is included as indicator for daily precipitation and mean ambient temperature a1 7 submodels a1 7 1 initialization much of the initialization process has already been described in chapter a1 5 however it seems important to us to give more detail here about the spatial setup of the model as we work with spatially explicit data we integrated remote sensed data to describe environmental parameters of the model world in a first step all necessary gis data is loaded in the model rasterized and re sampled to match the defined spatial resolution parameter spatialresol data from a land cover map of the area brinkmann et al 2014 is used to build an energy cost based distance cost map energy cost is thereby calculated by speed related energy expenditure in the different vegetation types of the land cover classes based on measured speed of movement of animals in the land cover classes by gps tracking feldt and schlecht 2016 averaged speeds were calculated thereby only speeds while traveling defined as values above 1 5 km h leeuw 1986 were taken into account using a total of 63 650 measurements average speeds in savanna and shrubland forest type vegetation have been evaluated for the conversion of speed in energy requirement a correlation of walking speed and related energy cost above standing by dijkman and lawrence 1997 was applied the resulting relations are shown in table a1 metabolizable energy costs for movement on roads and pathways were set slightly below the value used for savanna vegetation to increase the tendency to use those established pathways furthermore movement costs on agricultural fields where set at maximum levels of 1000 j m kg bw as herds were supposed not to enter nor cross these areas the relation speed energy cost as reported by dijkman and lawrence 1997 was approximated by an unimodal function with best fit r2 0 963 as shown in eq a1 where y corresponds to energy costs in j m per kg body weight and x to walking speed in km h a1 y 6 5 x 2 44 x 75 minimum energy costs i e most energy efficient movement was thereby evaluated as movement at a speed of 3 3 km h which was in coherence with findings of king 1983 stating best efficiency at speeds between 2 5 3 5 km h minimum energy cost was thereby 1 5 j m kg bw this value resulted in an energy expenditure of 450 j m for an animal of 300 kg bw aligning with the model of brosh et al 2006 who reported 2 9 j m per kg metabolic weight which resulted in energy costs of 438 j m for a 300 kg animal after the loading of the above described gis energy cost raster file and the setting of spatial coordinates of fix locations such as the village center and the water points the accumulated cost surfaces radiant from the village center and the different water points are calculated subsequently the shortest paths and their respective lengths based on the accumulated cost surfaces are evaluated for the ways from the various water points to the village center the raster data set with initial biomass density is a result of an analysis of satellite data based vegetation indices in combination with on ground validation data we repeatedly measured herbaceous biomass in the modeled study area between autumn 2012 and spring 2014 antsonantenainarivony 2017 and compared the measurements with the corresponding satellite sensor recordings made by landsat 8 satellites therefore we downloaded the time relevant atmospheric corrected landsat images from usgs http earthexplorer usgs gov and calculated the normalized differential vegetation index ndvi as an established proxy for primary productivity and thereby also for photo synthetically active biomass e g hobbs 1995 the time series analysis of the ndvi data showed a maximum near the end of the growth season end of february beginning of march which correlated well with the on ground measurements therefore we decided to use the period of highest resource availability as start time for our simulation the time sensitive gradients of the vegetation index were approximated see fig a2 for ndvi time series for period 2013 2014 of two reference locations and the minimum values assessed and compared with the ground control data in this way we were able to zero the correlation between ndvi and biomass for grassland vegetation aristida ndvi 0 21 for green biomass area density 0 t dm ha and ndvi 0 44 for green biomass area density 1 75 t dm ha heteropogon ndvi 0 23 for green biomass area density 0 t dm ha and ndvi 0 50 for green biomass area density 2 2 t dm ha and could thereby establish a correlation equation to transform the ndvi dataset into an initial green biomass dataset eqs a2 a3 aristida r2 0 89 heteropogon r2 0 90 which is calculated in the model during the initialization phase a2 ndviaristida 0 00130 greenbiomass 0 21 where greenbiomass is in g dm m2 a3 ndviheteropogon 0 00136 greenbiomass 0 23 where greenbiomass is in g dm m2 similarly we were able to establish a link between the two dominant and distinct grassland vegetation communities with differences in nutrition quality in terms of digestibility and a landsat data based redness index ri data not shown which enabled us to distinguish the distribution of the two grassland communities dominated by aristida adscensionis and heteropogon contortus respectively based on remote sensed data therefore during the initialization phase the model loads a spatial raster file with the redness index to differentiate between the two forage qualities and assigns to individual grid cells the corresponding initial maximal digestibility values highdigesth for highly digestible aristida dominated and lowdigesth for lower digestible heteropogon dominated grassland based on recordings of the typical herd age structure in the study region data not shown and associated growth functions fig a3 founded on brody s growth curves brody 1945 reference weights for the different age and sex classes are calculated body weight of female animals aged above 60 months showed minor variability and was therefore defined as constant to account for specific energetic demands for milk production by lactating females and for milk consumption and growth of unweaned animals corrective factors for individuals between 0 and 6 months of age are computed thereby the augmented efficiency in the conversion of metabolizable energy for maintenance during milk consumption the increase in direct energy requirements as the result of growth of these young animals plus the additional energy costs for lactating females due to conversion of metabolic energy into milk and the subsequent costs for milk digestion in the young are assessed and considered as correction factors for the reference weight of the corresponding age class for this calculation we followed the suggestions of csiro 2007 the corresponding functions are displayed in formula a4 a6 where the first term in formula a4 corresponds to the effect of increased efficiency in energy conversion for

initialization phase of the simulation features of the water points are defined in particular in terms of their spatial location general availability accessibility whether the individual water points have a permanent or temporary character and their respective water holding capacities a1 7 2 climate season the first cyclic process after initialization focuses on the update of the climatic and seasonal variables following the threshold delay model of ogle and reynolds 2004 for plant responses to precipitation correlation assessments between precipitation recordings of the period august 2012 june 2013 for the study area and the according ndvi time series revealed a good correspondence of the onset and end of vegetation growth with fortnightly sums of precipitation the cumulative effect of precipitation during the precedent fourteen days proved the most reliable trigger for plant growth indicating a threshold of 30 mm rain and a delay of the response of one fortnight fig a4 climate data in terms of daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation as predicted for the study area by ipcc moss et al 2008 is loaded once at the simulation start and at the end of each growth period and daily mean temperature is calculated based on the fortnightly precipitation sums and the defined threshold the onset and length of the following growth period is assessed alternatively for test purposes fix growth seasons have also been implemented repeatedly simulating climatic conditions as recorded in 2012 2013 initiating the growth period at december 15 2012 and lasting until march 4 2013 comprising 78 growth days at the moment of onset of the growth season i e a fortnight after the onset of rainfall water points are completely refilled according to their water holding capacity and the amount of green biomass of the patches with biomass area density below minimum 4 kg dm ha for aristida and 10 kg dm ha for heteropogon grassland patches are reset to minimum as initial values for the re growth process as last operation based on the season the percentage of resting in the activity budget of the animals per rest activ is set in accordance to recordings feldt and schlecht 2016 feldt unpubl data as 20 in the dry season and 13 in the growth season a1 7 3 vegetation growth maturation natural dynamic processes in grasslands affect primarily the quantity of green and dry biomass and their respective quality as feed resource these three factors are continuously adjusted according to season based on the observed pattern of ndvi and precipitation prediction as outlined in paragraphs a1 7 1 and a1 7 2 we distinguish between two seasonal patterns dry and growth season during the dry season the model simulates maturating effects in the vegetation by reducing linearly the digestibility value of green biomass from the highest value state variables highdigesth for high quality forage and lowdigesth for low quality forage by a 200th of the difference between their respective high and low thresholds as a result after 200 days the lower digestibility threshold values as defined by the state variables highdigestdead and lowdigestdead are reached and kept constant until the start of the growth season digestibilities of dry biomass are meanwhile kept constant accordingly on the level of these low thresholds reduction of green biomass as a result of maturation as well as its increase during the growth season and the related building up and decay of necromass follow a logistic growth function using the vegetation growth model for savanna vegetation as proposed by owen smith 2007 outlined in eqs a7 and a8 a7 v gree t v gree r v 1 v total k v a8 v necro t v gree r death 1 r decay for parameter description see table a2 for the definition of the parameters rv rdeath rdecay and kv patterns of the growth model were compared with sample recordings on green and dry biomass in reference plots in the study area from different time periods antsonantenainarivony 2017 and parameters were adjusted accordingly for best fit ndvi times series indicated that plots with different maximum values at the end of the growth season exhibited different decrease during the dry season reaching minimum values about the same time fig a2 this observation signals that the density of green biomass did not influence its rate of decay and death rate could be defined as independent from biomass according to other studies e g snyman 1998 decomposition rate is increased during the growth season as a result of increased microbial activity therefore decay rate rdecay was defined variable in dependence on season the various growth and maturation related parameter values according to the different conditions are listed in table a3 thus similar patterns for the growth function could be applied to all grassland patches adjusting just the growth rate parameter rv in function of the maximum amounts of green and dry biomass by testing the growth decay function for different values of rv linear regression analysis was applied to look for the relationship between peak green biomass and the growth rate while extreme values of rv showed trends of saturation linear relationships with high level of linearity could be established within the range of expected values for biomass the resulting correlation functions eqs a9 and a10 were integrated in the model a9

its effect on the vegetation into consideration whereby harvest early in the growth period will have a lower impact on the maximal achievable biomass at the end of the growth season than late harvest as regrowth is more realistic in an early growth phase the resulting trend of biomass and digestibility of an exemplary high quality forage grid cell is outlined in fig a5 selectivity for green and dry forage is based on preference following the approach of the pasture model grazemod johnson 2008 as a function of their respective availabilities and qualities the proportion of dry and fresh matter ingested by animals is changing throughout the year whereby the preference for live matter is defined as 10 times greater than for dead matter johnson 2008 rasch et al 2016 the probability of ingesting either of the two on pasture has therefore been based on the preference factor the respective biomasses on the pasture grid cell and the respective digestibilities i e the proportion of green biomass ingested is calculated as shown in eq a11 a11 greencomp preferencefactor v gree digestibility gree preferencefactor v gree digestibility gree v necro digestibility dry for parameter description see table a4 similarly the proportion of ingested dry biomass is as outlined in eq a12 a12 deadcomp v necro digestibility dry preferencefactor v gree digestibility gree v necro digestibility dry for parameter description see table a4 based on the proportions of green and dry biomass ingested the average digestibility of the ingested matter is calculated as described in eq a13 a13 weighteddigest greencomp digestibilitygree deadcomp digestibilitydry similarly the weighted palatable biomass based on the dry and green components is set accordingly for all grassland grid cells eq a14 a14 weightedbiomass greencomp v gree deadcomp v necro subsequently the metabolizable energy content of forage metabolenergy is calculated for each grassland grid cell based on the vegetation s gross energy grossenergy concentration which is multiplied by the averaged digestibility weighteddigest and the conversion efficiency ratio from digestible to metabolizable energy de me ratio finally in this process a number of general global variables are updated such as the day of the year is increased by one and the astronomic day length is calculated accordingly following the model of glarner 2011 we thereby applied the simplified version of glarner s model as outlined in eq a15 by inserting the geographical latitude of the model area as 23 35 a15 day length 24 180 arccos 1 m i whereas m 1 tan latitude tan 23 439 cos day 180 182 625 i tan 6 cos latitude a1 7 4 forage site selection based on the two potential patch selection strategies in the simulated free ranging system namely aristida in the selective feeding state and automatic in the non selective feeding state the start location for the daily foraging activities is selected in case of aristida potentially any location in any grid cell with high quality resource could be assigned whereas in the case of automatic either a grid cell with low or high quality resource might be considered for positioning the probability of considering a dataset of low or high quality grid cells is thereby defined by the global variable testvalue out of the extracted dataset a location is subsequently randomly selected on the following conditions the sum of the current value for green biomass and necromass is above the minimum threshold defined by minimumgreenbiomass distance from any water point is more than 2 grid cells i e 180 m at a spatial resolution of 90 m the accumulated cost distance from the central model origin home lies in a band defined by a randomized inner radius out of a normal random distribution with a mean of 330 000 j kg bw and a standard deviation of 235 000 j kg bw defined by stdev radius but maximum 1 000 000 j kg bw and a band width of 300 000 j kg bw these band defining values have been arbitrarily set and tested for suitability the x and y coordinates of the selected start site are stored in x forage and y forage respectively for further calculations for the path from the central model origin to the start site the most energy cost efficient option is evaluated from the previously calculated accumulated cost surface see chapter a1 7 1 and the according distance costs and path length are calculated a1 7 5 feed intake a1 7 5 1 preparing processes the submodule simulating the feed intake is following suggestions and models of coleman 2005 jouven et al 2008 and delagarde et al 2011 as an initialization step in the feeding intake submodule a preliminary itinerary is computed to calculate the time available for foraging activities for this reason the most appropriate water point in relation to the start foraging point is evaluated based on the energy costs related to the movement from the current location to a water point and from there to the model origin home similar to the process of calculation of the path from home to the foraging site the most energy cost efficient option to reach the different water points is evaluated from the previously calculated accumulated cost surfaces the values for the according distance costs and path lengths of the most energy cost efficient path are then computed path length and total distance costs are used to compute total walking time applying thereby the averaged energy costs in the energy speed relation as shown in eq a1 to calculate averaged walking speed time spent resting is evaluated applying the perc rest activ parameter time available for foraging activity forage time is then calculated by deducting walking time and resting time from the astronomic day length day length based on the body weight of the representing adult female animal animal growth functions sex ratio and herd age structure the total body weight of the herd is calculated recorded real data of 161 individuals in representative herds revealed a sex ratio of 3 males 4 females fust unpubl which is adopted in the model the sex sensitive herd age structure is defined based on data collected in the field following for male individuals a negative logarithmic regression function r2 0 86 as outlined in fig a6 the histogram of the age distribution in the measured herds showed for male animals an immediate decrease after birth while the female numbers were fairly constant up to an age of 60 months which corresponded well with the end in growth taking into account the absolute total numbers of subadult 60 months and adult 60 months females half of the female animals in a herd were defined to follow the constant age distribution while for the other half of the female animals a constant weight corresponding to the adult weight was assumed animal numbers of the various age classes of both sexes and the according weights are individually multiplied and then summed up to indicate the total reference herd weight the actual herd weight herdweight is calculated by multiplying the reference herd weight by the ratio of actual mature female liveweight and reference animal weight referenceweight a1 7 5 2 procedure structure because of its unique and dynamic agent based modeling approach we had to develop for ramdry a new iterative calculation method for the calculation of feed intake however we tried thereby to rely as much as possible on the principles of earlier models on feed intake a simple overview of the different factors influencing daily dry matter intake of the agents in our model is shown in fig a7 in general we are applying the principle of jouven et al 2008 arguing that the amount of dry matter intake in a day by a ruminant animal is largely dependent on physiological constraints of the animal highlighted in fig a7 in blue forage density and distribution highlighted in fig a7 in yellow and forage quality shown in green in fig a7 the animal physiological part is leading to the factor intakecapacity ic and is evaluated in a mechanistic manner as the contributing parameters are supposed to stay relatively constant throughout a day the effects of relative intake hir and the fill value fv depend on the forage encountered during the feeding process and are hard to predict for the evaluation of these two parameters we developed an iterative simulation process where firstly estimated values are used for simulation compared to the simulated output and then the simulated output is reused as an approximated input for further iteration as outlined in fig a8 the first step in the feeding intake submodule is the calculation of the intake capacity following the concept of jouven et al 2008 taking into consideration the live body weight the body condition score and the potential milk production body condition score bcs is thereby defined as the ratio of the actual body weight to the normal standard weight as suggested by mayer et al 2012 a 10 weight ratio per level of bcs leads thereby to a range of bcss from 1 to 9 with bcs 5 as a standard 1 1 ratio this 1 9 bcs system is then converted into a 1 5 bcs system with bcs 3 as 1 1 ratio according to fox et al 2004 intake capacity intakecapacity is thereafter computed using the eq a16 from jouven et al 2008 a16 intakecapacity 3 2 0 015 liveweight 0 25 milkproduction 0 002 liveweight bcs 2 5 the actual evaluation of dry matter intake is modeled in a two step procedure simulating first the parameter search in an iterative way before the actual acquisition of the resources is executed this two step procedure is necessary as the amount of available biomass and its respective digestibility is an input parameter in the calculation of daily dry matter intake but both are at the beginning of the daily foraging simulation unknown variables as a result of the randomized way of the foraging path therefore they need to be initially estimated and iteratively adjusted fig a8 shows a general outline of the processes involved in dry matter intake calculation initially mean values for biomass and digestibility representing weighted and averaged values from the daily foraging path are set according to the state variables weightedbiomass and weighteddigest of the start grid cell based on these parameters a preliminary value for daily dry matter intake dmi is computed a1 7 5 3 dry matter intake calculation for dry matter intake prediction we follow the recommendations of the grazein model of delagarde et al 2011 taking into account the influences of biomass availability and time constrains while delagarde and coworkers considered the effect of biomass availability by calculating separate intake rates for biomass limited grazing and time constrained foraging we expect non exclusiveness of these two factors we therefore calculate time restricted intake rate and multiply this variable with an availability factor following the model of coleman 2005 according to delagarde et al 2011 herbage intake is calculated from intake capacity of the animal ic relative herbage intake hir as percentage of the voluntary herbage intake and herbage fill value fv as indicated in fig a7 hir represents thereby the degree of restriction of intake attributed to limiting time at pasture compared with full day grazing and maximal voluntary intake assuming that grazing ruminants need at least five hours of foraging to achieve their intake capacity without biomass restriction delagarde et al 2011 maximal voluntary intake per hour would be 20 of ic to quantify the relative influence of standing biomass on potential voluntary intake we applied the findings of coleman 2005 based on this data an asymptotic regression function for the relative intake as a function of biomass availability riba has been developed eq a17 which represented best r2 0 99 the observed relation between ad libitum intake and forage standing biomass a17 ri ba 0 9953 0 9961 e e 0 6189 standingbiomass where standingbiomass is in t dm ha riba is subsequently used as factor for maximum voluntary intake per hour vimax in the calculation of relative herbage intake hir according to delagarde et al 2011 the corresponding adapted function is shown in eq a18 a18 hir vi max forage time vi max 0 008 ln 1 e forage time 0 845 vi max 0 008 where vi max 1 h 0 2 ri ba herbage fill value fv is defined as ratio between voluntary intake of a reference herbage by an inra reference heifer and the voluntary intake of the specific forage we describe fv based on the digestibility of green forage as outlined by jouven et al 2008 given all necessary input variables an initial value for dry matter intake dmi is calculated before the execution of the iterative simulation process initial values for the number of grid cells visited numbpatchvisited and the number of steps taken during foraging nrofsteps are estimated based on time at pasture forage time and average speed while foraging forage speed furthermore the current datasets of spatial distribution of green biomass greenbiomass dry biomass necromass and proportions of green greencomp and dry deadcomp biomass in ingested matter are stored to be able to re establish the initial configuration for the actual foraging procedure after the end of the iterative simulation process a1 7 5 4 iterative foraging simulation cycle based on the estimated daily dry matter intake of the representing individual and the ratio of its body weight liveweight to the total herd weight herdweight total daily herd intake is predicted additionally incorporating the estimated number of grid cells visited throughout the foraging path numbpatchvisited an initial value for dry matter offtake per grid cell is calculated the foraging simulation is built up as a loop running as long as there is time left for foraging on pasture i e accumulated time spent for feeding is constantly compared with the calculated time at pasture forage time foraging movements are simulated in a stepwise manner based on decisions taken by the agent in response to the environment switching thereby between movement modes as described by fryxell et al 2008 based on the cognitive capabilities of the agent as described in section a1 4 the agent takes consequently decisions to stay on a grid cell to continue foraging or leave the grid cell for a more suitable habitat fig a9 the process differs slightly between the selective and the non selective feeding strategy while the first step is common for both within the view cone defined by its radius viewdistance and opening angle viewangle the dataset of grid cells corresponding to the respective feeding strategy are extracted if their value of weighted by proportion of ingested green and dry matter biomass is above the defined minimum minimumgreenbiomass from this dataset of potential target locations the highest green biomass value is evaluated the decision trees for the following step are shown in fig a10 for the selective feeding strategy and in fig a11 for the non selective strategy after a decision has been taken to make a step of length one into any direction the step is executed and the value of the counter of steps taken is increased by one for later calculation of energy cost of foraging movement in this moment in any case the x and y coordinates of the new location are added in a list subsequently the foraging decision process is simulated i e whether and which resource is potentially extracted from the current grid cell therefore the appropriateness of the resources in the current location is assessed i e if quality is not appropriate in view of the current feeding strategy no biomass extraction is executed instead only the time spent is increased based on the grid size spatialresol and average walking speed walk speed available forage biomass is evaluated in dependence of the remaining quantity of green biomass i e if the quantity of live plant material is above minimum levels in accordance to the present grass community defined by mingreenmass213 and mingreenmass216 respectively both green and dry biomass are extracted according to the calculated proportions greencomp and deadcomp otherwise only the amount of present dry biomass is defined as available biomass if the current new location carries resources of appropriate quality but available biomass is not above the minimum threshold minimumgreenbiomass only the time spent is increased similar to the case of inappropriate quality if available biomass and quality are sufficient the accumulated biomass is increased by the available biomass of the current grid cell and the accumulated digestibility is increased by the available digestibility of the current location available digestibility is thereby defined in the same way as available biomass depending on the amount of remaining green biomass similarly dry and potentially green biomass of the current grid cell is reduced by the value of the previously estimated dry matter offtake by the herd to make it unavailable for the following simulation steps time spent is increased based on the grid size spatialresol and average foraging speed forage speed as mentioned before these processes are executed repeatedly as long as the time spent is below the available time after the time available for foraging is used up by the simulation mean biomass and digestibility per step are calculated and the variables meanbiomass and meandigestib are updated accordingly based on these calculated values for average biomass and digestibility daily dry matter intake dmi is calculated again following the principle mentioned in chapter a1 7 5 3 as a final step in the simulation procedure the agent is set back at the start point of foraging and the total energy costs related to the foraging movement are calculated based on the value for relaxed walking on flat surface walkingenergy subsequently the previously stored spatial biomass grid dataset is reloaded and the newly calculated value for dmi is compared with the previously estimated value and if the difference between the two is below 0 2 kg dm d the simulation process is concluded otherwise the simulation is restarted with the new updated values for averaged biomass averaged digestibility and dry matter intake as shown in fig a8 a1 7 5 5 foraging after the successful completion of the simulation phase the foraging process is basically just the implementation of the simulated steps based on the memorized list of foraging locations visited similar to the first step in the simulation process total daily herd intake is computed based on the established daily dry matter intake of the representing individual and the ratio of its body weight liveweight to the total herd weight herdweight additionally incorporating the estimated number of grid cells visited while foraging numbpatchvisited dry matter offtake per grid cell is calculated thereafter the list of memorized locations in the list of the foraging path is worked through step by step for each entry of the list it is decided whether the current grid bears appropriate forage resources in terms of quality in the case that the feeding strategy is set on quality i e on selective feeding behavior if biomass of the current patch is above the minimum threshold minimumgreenbiomass the metabolizable energy density of the corresponding grid cell metabolenergy is multiplied by the individual dry matter offtake per grid cell and summed up the sum defines the total metabolizable energy gained by the foraging activities in a day and is stored in the entity variable feedenergy a1 7 6 plant biomass adjustment similar to the calculation of gained metabolizable energy described in chapter a1 7 5 5 for each grid cell in the location list of the foraging path green and dry biomass of the grid cells is adjusted according to the offtake for each list entry it is ensured that green biomass is above the minimum threshold minimumgreenbiomass and in this case the biomasses of the corresponding grid cell in terms of greenbiomass and necromass respectively is reduced subsequently by the previously calculated amount of dry matter offtake per grid cell a1 7 7 animal energy balance as grazing can involve considerable displacement the itinerary needs to be reassessed to find the shortest and most energy efficient paths to the nearest water point and back home to calculate the total energy expenditure for all movements the energy costs for the best tracks need to be re evaluated therefore similar to the proceedings of the computation of the preliminary itinerary as described in chapter a1 7 5 1 the most appropriate water point in relation to the end point of the foraging movement is selected based on the energy costs related to the movement from the current location to a water point and from there to home the most energy efficient option to the different water points is evaluated from the previously calculated accumulated cost surfaces and the values for the according distance costs and path lengths of the most energy efficient path are then calculated subsequently the agent is moved on the evaluated paths via the nearest water point back home based on the accumulated energy gains and costs the total energy balance is subsequently drawn therefore energy expenditures due to maintenance costs and walking costs and gains due to feeding are calculated separately and summed up in terms of metabolizable energy me taking accordingly possible conversion efficiency factors into account while values for maintenance costs are well defined in terms of metabolizable energy based on the entity parameter mem and the animal s body weight liveweight distance cost values from the distance cost analysis need to be converted into metabolizable energy via the conversion efficiency factor according to jarrige 1989 a1 7 8 herd fitness depending on the result of the energy balance body weight is adjusted as a result of body tissue mobilization in case of a negative energy balance or body tissue synthesis in case of a positive energy balance energy compensation in mammals can practically be managed by glycogen stored mainly in the liver proteins in the muscle tissue and triglycerides fats in adipose tissue several studies mentioned that synthesis and mobilization of body tissue might involve fat and protein metabolisms non exclusively e g csiro 2007 to keep our model as simple as possible we decided to concentrate only on these two metabolisms each of them has different efficiency levels for the conversion to from metabolizable energy and their respective importance depends on the overall metabolic condition generally higher relative body weight increases the importance of fat as storage medium while in lower relative body weight protein related processes are more prominent as the purpose of ramdry is not particularly to model the metabolic processes in highest detail we applied an approach in which we combine the two into one storage metabolism while keeping in mind that we are in fact modeling thereby a set of processes energy conversion efficiency rates for fats and proteins can be very different for the conversion of metabolic energy into muscle tissue via proteins richardson and hahn 2007 suggested a value of 0 3 while williams and jenkins 2003 reported an efficiency rate of 0 75 for the conversion of metabolic energy into adipose tissue similarly the conversion efficiency for mobilization of adipose tissue is reported to be around 0 84 see for example tedeschi et al 2005 while protein mobilization is suggested to happen at an efficiency of 1 taking thereby into consideration the reduced maintenance energy requirements of under nourished animals as outlined by king 1983 we therefore created weight dependent combined conversion efficiency factors incorporating both processes the conversion factor for weight gain body tissue synthesis kpf is defined as an inverse logit function based on the difference of the actual body weight from normal weight we defined thereby the minimum value of 0 3 kp min in the case of a body condition score 1 very poor condition to emphasize the high importance of muscle tissue related processes and the maximum value of 0 75 kf max in the case of body condition score 9 obese the resulting function is shown in fig a12 similarly the conversion factor for weight loss body tissue mobilization kpfm is defined as a logit function in relation to the weight difference between the current body weight and the standard weight of a reference individual the extrema are consequently set to 0 84 kmf min for the fat related process and 1 kmp max for the protein related process fig a13 in case of a negative daily energy balance the model calculates the corresponding conversion factor kmpf based on the current weight difference if the weight difference is negative i e the animals are underweight the loss of body weight is calculated on the basis of protein energy density ener dens prot simulating thereby the mobilization of muscle tissue in contrast if the weight difference is positive overweight while drawing a negative energy balance the loss of adipose tissue is simulated by applying the fat energy density ener dens fat in the calculation of body weight loss alternatively in case of an energy surplus at the end of the day the model calculates the corresponding conversion factor kpf and according to the weight difference computes the weight gain based on protein energy density ener dens prot in the case of underweight or fat energy density ener dens fat in the case of overweight body weight is then adjusted by the calculated weight gain or loss respectively and a counter totaling the consecutive days of weight loss or weight gain is updated if the number of consecutive days of weight loss is exceeding five the feeding strategy feedstrategy and site selection strategy selectionstrategy are set to non selective feeding behavior contrarily if the average of green biomass in aristida dominated patches rises above minimum level and their weighted digestibility climbs above 55 indicating sufficient re growth of fresh biomass the strategies are set to selective feeding behavior despite preceding weight loss as a final step in the herd fitness procedure the change in herd size is computed considering the resulting birth and mortality rates birth rate in the model is set fix depending on the total size of the herd to herdincreaseratesmall or herdincreaseratebig respectively mortality rate however is defined as a function of weight ratio i e body weight to reference weight according the model of richardson and hahn 2007 in case of a weight ratio above or equal 0 6 the daily rate of natural mortality is set at 0 018 while below a weight ratio of 0 6 a weight ratio sensitive additional term is considered following the recommendations of richardson and hahn 2007 eq a19 a19 dm r dt α mr γ mr β mr cd for parameter description and values see table a5 in case that the herd size has decreased below the threshold of 2 individual animals minimum for reproduction the herd agent dies and will thereby be ignored during calculations at subsequent time steps a1 7 9 water balance the last procedure of the simulation considers the water need of the animals and the use of the corresponding resources we thereby applied the approach of king 1983 including water needs and gains for metabolic processes respiratory and cutaneous water water costs for walking in high solar heat loads forage intake and milk production due to the lack of appropriate data it comprises furthermore rudimentary estimates for water intake from forage the water pool p of a mammal animal comes to 2 3 of the live body weight body water turnover tbw was approximated for zebu cattle in kenya by a function of mean ambient temperature eq a20 a20 tbw 21 518 temp 390 where tbw is in ml l and temp is in c water gain from metabolic processes has been estimated at 0 0294 times the total heat production a21 w m 0 0294 me where wm is in kg and me is in mj water gains by respiratory and cutaneous intake has been approximated as outlined in eq a22 a22 w rc 0 11 tbw t 0 11 tbw p 1000 where wrc is in kg and tbwt is the total body water turnover water costs as a result of walking wkw in high ambient temperature was defined depending on the body condition of the animals as suggested by king 1983 thereby undernourished animals are supposed to display lower sweating rates restricting the period of significant high solar load to 3 h per day while animals in normal body conditions experience increased sweating rates during 6 5 h per day eq a23 a23 wk w t ht daylength 0 0014 liveweight where tht is n of hot hours per day liveweightis in kg water cost related to milk production wmy has been estimated as 0 87 l per kg milk produced king 1983 finally water gain from forage wf was approximated as outlined in eq a24 assuming a mean forage moisture content of 15 as suggested by king 1983 a24 w f dmi foragemoisture 1 foragemoisture where dmi is in kg d and foragemoisture 0 15 as suggested water costs for forage intake iw have subsequently been calculated as described in eq a25 a25 i w 1

subtracted from the water amount in the water point if the water point ends up with no water left it is defined as unavailable and will not be considered as water resource until the onset of the next

25337,we report energy stocks and flows as well as other ecosystem properties measured in little sandy creek in upstate new york as part of an intensive class project in a graduate level systems ecology course at the suny college of environmental science and forestry our study synthesizes information on little sandy creek both as a whole system and through examination of key individual trophic components we also test allen s paradox in little sandy creek whether there is enough biomass produced by the invertebrate community to support the energetic needs of the fish community students collected data in the field over the course of a weekend in september 2012 during the ensuing semester we synthesized all of these data often utilizing relatively simple quantitative models to generate a spatial synthesis populated with trophic levels for a one kilometer reach of stream we utilized two synthesizing procedures during our trophic flow analysis first we sampled organisms along a depth gradient and modeled trophic levels and size class with depth to give more precise estimates of biomass second we used models for the relation between production and also respiration energy requirements and organism size to estimate production and energy use of trophic levels and functional feeding groups we synthesized and extrapolated upon our data with a numerical model that simulated the stocks and flows in little sandy creek using abiotic forcing functions and functional responses derived from our field measurements the mean values indicate the benthic macroinvertebrate production 11 kj m 2 day 1 is insufficient to support the fish energy requirements 13 kj m 2 day 1 within our uncertainty estimates given an 80 assimilation efficiency for fish the macroinvertebrate production is enough to supply only 68 of the fish needs our primary hypothesis was supported students were able to thoroughly collect and organize data from little sandy creek in a single weekend further over the course of a semester students successfully analyzed their data we were then able to take that data and build a realistic model of the little sandy creek system based on our model outputs we fail to reject our secondary hypothesis that allen s paradox is present in little sandy creek keywords systems ecology allen s paradox ecosystem modeling trophic level stream ecosystem stocks and flows 1 introduction ecology as a discipline had been unified by eugene odum s textbook odum 1953 when one of us c hall took the course in 1963 in recent years there has been a compartmentalization of ecology into sub disciplines e g population ecology and community ecology that from our perspective has diluted the impact of the odum brother s eugene and howard teachings of systems thinking that ecology was once founded upon despite its continuation in some quarters there is a need to bring back systems thinking more generally to the field because of the increasing complexity scope and urgency of environmental issues specifically due to the proliferation of compartmentalized approaches to ecology and the death or retirement of most of the second generation of systems ecologists it is imperative that we formally document successful approaches to teaching systems ecology while there are a number of systems ecology textbooks available e g odum 1994 jørgensen 2012 in our opinion none of them capture the essence of what we perceive as a true systems ecology teaching experience we believe systems perspectives and ideas should first be introduced by having students study nature conceptually and quantitatively from a systems approach including physical and biotic elements and the interactions among them thus in our opinion modeling should be complementary to the conceptual and quantitative studies in the field with this in mind we present here the methods and results of our experience with developing such an approach including conceptualization field data collection and modeling in a graduate class called systems ecology the concepts and methodology described here were formalized over the span of 30 years as part of the systems ecology course taught at cornell university in ithaca n y and the state university of new york college of environmental science and forestry suny esf in syracuse ny the concepts taught in the systems ecology course are derived from the teachings and writings of howard odum see hall and day 1977 odum 1994 modified by sampling developments in stream ecology the objective of this class was to teach students how to understand measure synthesize and ultimately model general properties and principles of natural and human dominated systems not from books or equations but from nature herself the systems ecology course included a field trip wherein the students measured and analyzed different elements of the biotic physical and chemical characteristics of a stream ecosystem the field trip and successive analyses are based on odum s silver springs study odum 1957 and hall s stream ecosystem analysis hall 1972 the students were given a series of assignments which use their own data as a primary tool for learning a systems approach to ecology by building parameterizing and analyzing models over the years we have found that for our students the lessons taken from investigating and quantifying the stream system are broadly applicable to many other systems this experience has prepared our students very well for applying a systems approach to later careers in ecology resource management health and many other disciplines this publication is meant to give others an introduction to this teaching approach within the context of generating a scientific paper as suggested by the editor of this journal it is based on giving the summary and synthesis of data gathered principally on one weekend in 2012 although we compare these students results to the much more extensive database on little sandy creek of mead 2007 and that of other years as such it is one of the relatively few recent papers to summarize the complete physical and trophic energy structure and flow for any ecosystem but see gaichas et al 2009 energy in an ecosystem can be quantified as stocks e g biomass and flows e g trophic energy fluxes stocks known as state variables or endogenous variables are influenced by the dynamics of other internal stocks stocks and flows are also influenced by the forcing functions or exogenous variables external factors e g solar input that affect the ecosystem but are themselves not affected by the dynamics of the ecosystem in a single field trip we measured key stocks and flows for our ecosystem little sandy creek a small creek in upstate new york the exercise allowed us to trace energy flow from the sun through the various trophic levels in the stream community we found that a group of 15 25 highly motivated students could indeed quantify the essential features of a stream ecosystem in one demanding weekend we would not expect others using this paper as a guide for a class exercise would necessarily go to such detailed assessment as we did e g correcting organism density and metabolism for specific depths vs just using riffles and pools so that the sampling and calculations can be undertaken much more easily than presented here we hope to formalize and promulgate a very successful teaching experience with the anticipation that others might find it useful we have included considerable information and analyses here in an effort to address the entire ecosystem and used the data generated by the students to address a specific research question allen s paradox instructors and or students may find certain sections to be more relevant than others depending on the context of instruction nevertheless the information presented here provides an example of the extent types of data and analyses that can be generated in a graduate level systems ecology course given the fragmentation and non quantitative nature of much environmental education we hope this will help to make a systems perspective more accessible to ambitious teachers of ecology and environmental science once the general principles of systems are identified modeled and understood scientists as well as managers policy makers economists etc are better prepared to ask questions and solve problems objectively and quantitatively 1 1 streams as excellent laboratories for systems studies small streams are superb ecosystems for this exercise because they have clear boundaries banks bottom and water surface and are a manageable size additionally it is possible for a group of students to sample individual components and total ecosystem metabolism with modest equipment the biotic community of a stream can be classified into trophic levels by which energy captured by the primary producers notably benthic algae flows in the form of measureable food webs these ecological food webs reflect energy transformation among trophic levels odum 1994 we measured physical chemical and biotic properties of the little sandy creek ecosystem both as a whole system gestalt and by examining its principal sub systems 1 2 allen s paradox revisited allen 1951 studied the horokiwi stream in new zealand and found that the secondary production of the prey benthic invertebrates community was insufficient to support trout biomass and production in the same section of stream utilizing 40 150 the benthic invertebrate production even though macroinvertebrate communities remained present in the system over time while production did not appear sufficient to support the energy needs of the fish community the benthic invertebrate community persisted and therefore must not have all been consumed waters 1988 if organisms are to reproduce they must acquire a large enough net energy gain to overcome environmental stress procure food and mate all while maintaining a basic rate of maintenance metabolism for populations to persist enough individuals must acquire energy surpluses to compensate for the majority that do not reproduce hall et al 1992 huryn 1996 reassessed allen s paradox by analyzing the production budgets for a different stream sutton stream in new zealand huryn expanded the boundaries of his study to include terrestrial and hyporheic sources of invertebrate production and found that these sources were roughly equal to the trout s respiration requirements and perhaps enough surplus production occurred to support the continued abundance of invertebrates huryn 1996 allen s paradox has served as a troubling issue in ecology for some 60 years for systems that appear to be food limited in this paper we test the hypothesis that allen s paradox exists in little sandy creek by measuring and quantifying stocks e g biomass and flows e g respiration and production of invertebrates and fish as this was a simple class exercise constrained by equipment funding and sampling time we do not contribute any novel sampling techniques that might improve quantitative approaches to detecting allen s paradox in the field however by developing a size class and trophic level based respiration production model that can be used with a small amount of non destructive sampling techniques we believe we have made a small but noteworthy contribution to the methodology of the allen s paradox literature 1 3 site description the study site is a 975 m stretch of little sandy creek a tributary to lake ontario located in upstate new york fig 1 little sandy creek is known as a good fishing stream for migratory chinook salmon coho salmon and steelhead trout and provides particularly productive nursery habitat for these species the water level in little sandy creek fluctuates seasonally and is characterized by low water levels in early september on september 8 2012 the principal day of our study the area sampled had a mean width of 8 8 m a mean depth of 20 cm and a mean discharge of 0 49 m3 s 1 the average stream temperature for september 7 9 was 19 5 c the stream section that we studied emerges from dense mixed hardwood forest flows through a meadow and then below norton road re enters a heavily forested area little sandy creek is generally a clear stream with relatively clean and well oxygenated waters it contains a variety of substrate types ranging from silt to bedrock but most common are various sizes of stones and cobble it has a golden brown hue due to the growth of diatoms and other algae on the rock surfaces during our study the depth in our section varied from 1 to 102 centimeters with relatively well defined pools and riffles we considered pools to have a water depth greater than or equal to 0 40 m any depth less than 0 40 m was considered a riffle most of the area about 90 percent consists of relatively shallow riffles the stream is populated with a wide variety of invertebrates including the larvae of caddisflies stoneflies blackflies and mayflies and a variety of fish species including brown and rainbow trout juvenile silver coho and chinook salmon various minnow species suckers darters and a few centrarchids the benthic community consists of various species of bacteria diatomic algae macroinvertebrates arthropods and some fish that live on and within the substrate bott et al 1985 although the stream appears to have the characteristics of a biological system relatively untouched by human activities there is some treated sewage input approximately 5 km upstream and anglers frequent the creek seasonally of importance to its role in teaching the stream is clear and lovely and just the right size and we had excellent relations with the land owners 2 methods 2 1 overview we estimated biomass stocks and energy flows of little sandy creek using representative locations sampled with standard stream sampling gear and methods for each entity described below because the stream itself had considerable heterogeneity pools riffles and runs most of the samples were taken along gradients of depth and velocity from these data we established relations for biomass and metabolism subdivided by trophic level as a function of depth water velocity the principle determinants we developed a model using these relations along with extensive physical measurements to populate the entire one kilometer stream section with fish and invertebrate biomass and metabolism from this data we derived estimates of the stocks and flows of energy in the biotic community of the stream ecosystem and hence the production of invertebrates and energy requirements of fish to test allen s paradox we divided our systems ecology class into five groups physical stream metabolism benthic metabolism benthic invertebrates and fish each group was responsible for measuring stocks and flows for their respective component using conventional stream sampling techniques e g hall and moll 1975 hauer and hill 2006 hall 2012 the frequency and accuracy of our measurements were slightly compromised by an unexpected thunderstorm that occurred mid day on september 8th to compensate for this we took additional measurements the next morning on a relatively sunny september 9th in addition we used summary data from other studies conducted in little sandy creek to check for the general validity of our results this included data from mead 2007 as well as data from the 2011 and 2013 systems ecology classes we also measured the metabolism of representative species through oxygen consumption during incubations in various metabolic chambers we measured or estimated the principal abiotic physical dimensions sunlight and dissolved oxygen and biotic properties biomass respiration and production of aquatic macroinvertebrates fishes and the entire benthic community our characterization of the stream ecosystem was done in four steps first observation and systematic collection of data from the study site under the assumption that depth and its inverse relation with water velocity was the principal determinant of community structure for different organisms second we analyzed the collected data to derive functional relations with depth that characterized the component systems third we used these functional relations to populate stocks and flows in energy units for the one kilometer stretch of stream that was the focus of our research in a few cases as noted we had to eliminate some outliers we assume these to be due to student inexperience or equipment difficulties instead we use interpolations based on decades of field experience and common sense finally we simulated the behavior of the ecosystem over that day with a computer model thus we were able to do an entire systems analysis of a complete ecosystem in one semester including additional analysis and write up time while exploring a fundamental issue in ecology we have done more or less this same exercise for some 30 years on several ecosystem types always with at least moderate success details of all procedures follow 2 2 field data collection as a general rule we attempted to organize our sampling not so much by habitat type but by functional response such as biomass of a taxon as a function of depth this was done in order to interpolate our point samples necessary given the impossibility of sampling every square meter of the entire stream so that we could extrapolate our point data to the entire stream and to facilitate later modeling we also did this as a means of exposing the students to thinking in terms of deriving and using functional responses for their later modeling and professional lives 2 2 1 physical measurements we divided the study area of little sandy creek longitudinally into 39 transects each 25 m in length from upstream to downstream with norton road as the midpoint fig 1 the upstream sections transects 1 22 were classified as meadow and the downstream sections transects 23 39 were classified as forested each section had varied geomorphology table a in the appendix we categorized each transect as riffle or pool depending on depth fig 2 and table 4 in the middle of each transect we estimated the canopy cover over the banks and the center of the stream we then measured the width of the stream as well as the depth at 1 m intervals across the width at each transect we also measured the velocity of the stream at each transect point and for the entire length of both the meadow and the forested areas by following six neutrally buoyant objects lemons downstream we took measurements of solar flux photosynthetically active radiation par using a li cor li 190 quantum sensor μmol m 2 s 1 at five minute intervals from an unobstructed location in addition we took seven measurements of the solar intensity at each benthic chamber 2 2 2 metabolism of whole stream our objective here was to measure whole stream metabolism net ecosystem production respiration and gross primary production using the diel curve method summarized below and described in detail in hall and moll 1975 we achieved this by measuring the change in the concentration of dissolved oxygen do during the time taken for a unit volume of water to travel between sites as measured by the physical team i e the free water method the advantage of the diel curve method is that it does not use bottle incubation which might interfere with the natural processes one is trying to measure the disadvantage is that one has to correct for the diffusion of oxygen across the stream s surface which is likely to be an issue with a shallow turbulent stream such as little sandy creek we define net ecosystem production nep as the diffusion adjusted do change during the day we define respiration of the entire stream ecosystem as the diffusion adjusted do change measured at night and interpolated during the day we discarded positive do changes at night and inserted the average respiration value we estimate gross primary production gpp as nep minus respiration we sampled stream temperature and do using the winkler method hall and moll 1975 hall 2012 at transects 1 beginning of top meadow 22 norton road and 39 below the second forested area at three hour intervals over a 24 h period fundamentally a triplicate oxygen and temperature sample was taken at the top middle and bottom of our one km river stretch we sampled each location approximately one half hour apart this interval was determined by the time it took neutrally buoyant objects lemons to travel from one section to another thus in principle we are following a parcel of water as it flows through first the meadow and then the forested section of our ecosystem 2 2 3 metabolism of benthic community we set up eight benthic chambers in the streambed to measure metabolism of the benthic community we assume that the benthic community lives within the stream substrate and is comprised of invertebrates microbes and primary producers we did not attempt to quantify the respiration of sub communities within the benthic substrate therefore respiration was estimated as the average of negative do changes observed at night positive do changes recorded at night were disregarded and replaced with the average it is very difficult to gain an estimate of primary producer respiration in the benthos so we do not report any values for net primary productivity npp of the periphyton alone rather we measured net benthic primary productivity nbp as the do changes measured during the day the net change in oxygen from photosynthesis including that which compensates for respiration of the entire benthic community in the chambers we calculated gpp as the difference between nbp and benthic community respiration see fig b2 in appendix since there was insignificant metabolism of the water column organisms as determined by light and dark bottle studies we would expect the values measured by free water and benthic community techniques to be somewhat similar we installed the chambers in two riffles and two pools in both the meadow and the forest sections of our study area a week before the field trip on september 1 2012 when installing the chambers we removed the stream substrate layer by layer and then reconstructed the strata as they occurred in the stream within the chamber we submerged the chambers at the spot from which we dug out the substrate we measured depth from the top of the substrate to the surface of the stream making sure that each chamber had sufficient depth so that it would not breach the surface if water levels decreased we left the chambers open to the stream for one week which allowed the resident biota to recolonize and establish within each chamber before measurement for the chambers we used rubbermaid roughneck bins with dimensions of 48 by 35 cm width x 31 0 cm or 22 1 cm height fig a in the appendix we put the 22 1 cm tall bins in the riffles and the 31 0 cm tall bins in the pools to reduce the risk of the water level falling below the chamber on september 7th 2012 the night before measurements we sealed the chambers with plexiglas lids held in place by a series of clamps and foam rubber seals there was a small electric bilge pump installed on the inside of each lid to simulate stream water flow each lid also contained a circular hole which could be sealed by a removable rubber stopper which allowed us to take do measurements using a ysi 550 probe fig a in the appendix we took measurements of air temperature do of the stream and do inside the chamber approximately every hour for 24 h starting from 01 00 on september 7th on september 9th at 18 00 we flushed the forest chambers with stream water to avoid critically low oxygen concentrations and on september 9th from 10 00 13 30 a sunnier day we recorded additional measurements for all chambers at half hour intervals to get do response in the chambers at higher solar flux after the study period we removed the benthic chambers from the streambed and measured the volume of water present above the substrate and within the interstitial space table 4 2 2 4 stocks of benthic invertebrates and fish based on past experience we assumed that biomass of different taxa and sizes within taxa were principally a function of water depth or velocity as they were inversely related so we deliberately chose representative shallow riffles and deep pools as areas to sample table 4 we classified all organisms captured into trophic levels to examine energy flow pathways and to test allen s paradox and size class as respiration and production are a function of organism size brown et al in press we sampled aquatic macroinvertebrates quantitatively using a portable invertebrate box sampler pibs with an area of 0 1 m2 in duplicate at four sites at each site we recorded water depth cm took samples sorted the macroinvertebrate samples and recorded the dry weight biomass of each taxon dried at 60 c for 24 h in the laboratory see table 4 taxa were classified to genus where possible and assigned to a trophic level merritt et al 2008 table b in the appendix we determined the number biomass and trophic levels of each species within the fish community at five locations table 4 we used two fine meshed seines to block off each section and an electro shocker to stun and collect the fish we measured temperature length and average width and depth of the area sampled at each location sampling efficiency was assessed using duplicate samples additionally using the seber le cren equation seber and le cren 1967 we estimated the total biomass and abundance that were present table c in the appendix we identified fish to species and measured the length and weight for each fish caught werner 2004 2 2 5 other stocks we measured allochthonous input over a 24 h period at eight forested and four meadow locations tops of the benthic chamber rubbermaid bins dimensions of 60 7 cm length x 40 4 cm width were placed in the riparian zone approximately 1 m from the water line at a given location after 24 h all terrestrial material that had fallen on the bin tops was collected and stored in ziploc bags for transport back to the laboratory all material was dried at 60 c for at least 24 h weighed to obtain dry biomass g and converted to area g m 2 then to energy units mj the occurrence of top predators such as kingfishers and great blue herons were noted when observed but their biomass or metabolism per hour per square meter was trivial and hence ignored we did not directly measure the abundance of terrestrial predators viruses bacteria fungi etc but assume they are abundant if not weighty see odum 1957 likewise we did not quantify terrestrial invertebrate inputs although we measured leaf inputs or measure the meiofauna of the stream hyporheic zone plus upstream detrital or macroinvertebrate inputs into our study reach explicitly 2 2 6 energy flows of invertebrates and fish we measured the oxygen consumed mg o2 g 1 h 1 for small and large individuals of the dominant taxa stoneflies and caddisflies using the winkler method at 3 c 12 c and 20 c we used winkler bottles as incubation chambers and found that we could get detectable oxygen changes with several grams of insects in several hours we measured the oxygen consumption mg o2 g 1 h 1 of several characteristic species of fish brown trout salmo trutta fallfish semotilus corporalis northern hogsucker hypentelium nigricans rock bass ambloplites rupestris and yellow perch perca flavescens at the ambient stream temperature 20 c using the winkler method and winkler bottles or gallon jars depending on the size of the fish we also used the wisconsin bioenergetics model kitchell et al 1977 to calculate the size and temperature specific metabolism of all sampled fish 2 3 data analysis we adjusted sunlight data collected at the hill over the entire day to values at the water surface in the meadow and the forest i e corrected for shading by examining the relation between par measurements taken at each chamber relative to the open hill location i e estimating of available par that was transmitted to the stream surface estpar we measured the metabolism of the primary producers in the open water and in the benthic chambers directly with oxygen changes in the water and plotted the results as a function of sunlight and depth additionally we compared our metabolism results with the much more extensive record for the same stream in mead 2007 for higher trophic levels we took our biotic samples and derived the total number and biomass of each trophic level as a function of depth then populated the entire one kilometer stream by multiplying the relation between the number of individuals in size classes by trophic level to depth for the area of each depth of our section see table 1 this allowed us to derive values for the total biomass and metabolism of each trophic level for our entire one kilometer stream section 2 3 1 summary of conversion processes table 1 provides examples of the calculations used to convert number and biomass for macroinvertebrates and fish table 2 gives the standard conversion factors used in tables 1 3a and 3b tables 3a and 3b summarize the various conversions by which we went from raw data to kilojoules kj per square meter for each metabolic process in general we went from volume changes of dissolved oxygen such as measured with a winkler titration or oxygen meter to area values and then converted from dissolved oxygen changes to its equivalent in kj we derived daily values by summing hourly values in some cases these values were derived from functional relations 2 3 2 extrapolation to entire reach model construction we generated quantitative summaries of stocks and flows of the various trophic levels of little sandy creek for september 8 2012 first in tabular form then in functional relations with depth this was followed by multiplying the value for each depth by the area of that depth interval within the one kilometer section thus giving us an estimate for the entire reach of the stream these values were summarized in a quantitative odum flow diagram and in a fortran computer model see model code in appendix our computer model calculated stocks and flows in little sandy creek using depth as an abiotic forcing function the program read in depth values measured at 1 m increments across the stream every 25 m for the 1 km transect each grid cell had an area of 25 m2 we used functional responses derived from our field measurements of abundance with depth for each size class and trophic level to populate the stream the abundance estimates were multiplied by the average mass of size classes to obtain biomass estimates j m 2 respiration was modeled as a function of size class and trophic level and temperature which changed only 3 during the study productivity was modeled as a function of respiration eqs 16 19 humphreys 1979 see also brown et al in press we did not measure production as part of our initial data collection or collect data on the many variables normally used to calculate production therefore we used the humphreys equations which were derived from multiple data sets of various animals to estimate production stocks and flows for the 1 km transect 7000 m2 of wetted area were obtained by multiplying the model outputs by the area of each grid cell 25 m2 to convert stocks and flows to mean per m2 over the entire stretch to facilitate comparison with other studies the total stream estimate was divided by 7000 m2 the total invertebrate production was then compared to total fish respiration energy availability versus energy need to test whether allen s paradox existed on september 8 2012 in little sandy creek specific procedures for field data and model calculations follow listed as numbered steps in ascending order by trophic level or energy hierarchy for stocks then flows 2 3 3 sunlight we used two steps to obtain hourly estimates of par corrected for shading see tables d1 2 in the appendix to estimate the percent of sunlight transmission at each chamber we took the mean par measured at a benthic chamber over the course of the day and divided by mean par observed at the unshaded hill at corresponding times step 1 subsequently to estimate the amount of light reaching each benthic chamber at every hour of the day we multiplied the percent transmission calculated for each chamber by the observed values measured at the hill over the course of the day step 2 step 1 estimate percent transmission of sunlight at each benthic chamber 1 transbc mparbc mparhill where mpar is mean photosysnthetically active radiation observed at benthic chambers bc or hill step 2 estimate shade adjusted par values for each benthic chamber at each time period 2 est parbc t kj m 2 s 1 transbc mparhill t μmol m 2 s 1 4 78 10 4 kj

table d parhill t is the mean sunlight flow observed at the hill during time period t see appendix table j 4 78 10 4 is a conversion factor from μmol to kj taken as the ratio of j s 1 watts per μmol 4 78 divided by the number of joules per kj 1000 the ratio of watts per μmol was obtained through light measurements taken simultaneously at little sandy creek using a pyranometer w m 2 and a quantum μmol m 2 s 1 light sensor 2 3 4 whole stream metabolism we calculated whole stream metabolism using the 2 station diel curve method described in hall and moll 1975 we adjusted our open water dissolved oxygen measurements for diffusion of oxygen from or to the atmosphere as a function of the o2 saturation deficit at the ambient water temperature of a measurement interval step 1 and calculated the diffused quantity of oxygen per volume of stream step 2 the average travel time between sites was roughly 30 min we calculated the rate of do change between sites based on travel time and then adjusted for an estimate of the oxygen that had been lost or gained by diffusion step 3 we converted the diffusion corrected rates of oxygen changes to kj per square meter table 3a and summed hourly values to get estimated daily production and respiration step 4 we took interpolated respiration ideally just before sunrise and just after sunset hall and moll 1975 and calculated daytime gross photosynthesis gpp from daytime nep measurements the sum of respiration and gpp values for each hour were adjusted for the measurement interval to obtain a daily total we then multiplied values by average stream depth to convert from volume to area step 4 step 1 calculate saturation values at water temperature of each measurement 3 s mg o2 l 1 14 652 0 41001 t 0 0079910 t2 0 000077774 t3 where s represents saturation value for oxygen in water and t represents temperature mead 2007 step 2 calculate the saturation deficit and change in oxygen per hour via diffusion 4 sat do s 5 dvol k 1 sat

the median depth between sample sites totgpp and totresp are the summed daily total gross photosynthesis and respiration respectively see fig 5a and b 2 3 5 benthic community metabolism we derived a rate of metabolic flow for each measurement interval at each benthic chamber and converted this rate from g o2 m 3 to kj m 2 metabolism was converted from g o2 to joules by multiplying by a conversion factor of 3 5 kcal g 1 o2 from hall and moll 1975 and by 4 184 kilojoules kcal 1 table 3a the conversion from volume to area is adapted from mead 2007 and hall et al 1979 table 3a this was done by multiplying by the volume of water between the substrate and the lid of the benthic chamber and dividing by the area of the chamber effectively this is the same as multiplying by height of water between the substrate and the lid of the benthic chamber we plotted data to test functional relations between benthic metabolism depth and sunlight metabolism was plotted as a function of sunlight estpar for each chamber fig b1 2 in the appendix we fit a michaelis menten regression for nbp as a function of solar intensity step 3 step 1 calculate the rate of change of do for each benthic chamber

the curve should be for values above the nighttime respiration value not above zero fig b1 and b5 in the appendix the michaelis menten gpp max parameter was fit in excel using the solver function to minimize sum of square residuals for michaelis menten functions ks is set to 200 w m 2 respiration is set to the average negative do change at night step 4 develop functional relations for primary production gppmax and respiration with depth we did not find statistically significant correlations with depth in the benthic chambers see figure b4 in appendix therefore in the model gpp and resp were set to averages of data measured in forest and riffle sections to extrapolate benthic community metabolism to the entire stream values reported per m2 were multiplied by area 3850 m2 in the forest and 3150 m2 in the meadow 2 3 6 stocks of benthic invertebrates and fish stocks biomass per square meter of benthic invertebrates and fish were collected quantitatively as a function of depth and expressed as grams and joules per square meter we subdivided mass measurements for each sample of benthic invertebrates and fish by trophic level and size class to tabulate field data we summed the mass of individuals within each size class and trophic level from a given sample site we plotted abundance and subsequent biomass with depth for each size class of each trophic level from these plots we derived linear functions with depth so that the number of individuals was modeled as a function of depth in the model we calculated mass of each size class within each trophic level by multiplying the number of individuals in each size class by the average mass of an individual of a size class in that trophic level step 1 for both field data and model results mass was converted from grams to joules per square meter by multiplying the estimated dry mass g of the sub sample by its energy density cal g 1 cummins and wuycheck 1971 an expansion factor to correct for sampling efficiency and sample area step 2 table 1 total trophic level biomass was determined by summing all biomass estimates for each size class step 3 for field data see table 1 for model results see table 7 steps 1 through 3 were done for each sample of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish step 1 calculate the mass for each size class 13 mass tl sc numtl sc indmasstl sc where mass tl sc is the total mass g of a size class sc in each trophic level tl numtl sc is the number of individuals in the size class within each trophic level in a sampled area and indmasstl sc is the midpoint mass g of the size class of that trophic level step 2 convert size class mass to energy per square meter 14 bm m2 tl sc mass tl sc edens expfact area where bm is biomass j m 2 mass tl sc is the mass of a size class g edens j g 1 is mean energy density of that particular trophic group area m2 is s area sampled expfact no units is an expansion factor which is equal to the inverse of the sampling efficiency table 1 energy density is calculated by converting from grams of dry weight to joules using the appropriate values cal g 1 from cummins and wuycheck 1971 multiplied by 4 184 j cal 1 tables 2 3a and 3b for benthic invertebrate samples the area of the pib sampler was approximately 0 1 m2 and we assumed 100 percent sampling efficiency pollard and kinney 1979 therefore our expansion factor for benthic macroinvertebrates was equal to 10 the area of the fish sample sites varied table 4 thus we used the seber le cren method seber and le cren 1967 to derive a mean expansion factor of 3 1 table c in

classes within a trophic level 2 3 7 energy flows of benthic invertebrates and fish for benthic invertebrates and fish the rate of energy use by each trophic level was derived in the same fashion as biomass values with the following exception metabolism is very strongly related to organism size and the size of our organisms varied widely to gain more precise estimates of respiration for a given trophic level it was necessary to break our benthic invertebrate and fish data into size classes using size classes allowed us to quantify and model respiration to represent the frequency distribution of body sizes within each trophic level size specific metabolism was derived for individuals of each size class and trophic level based on field derived respiration relations with size eq 16 is the respiration equation used in the model for benthic invertebrates and fish in addition to our own field measurements fish respiration was calculated using the generalized wisconsin bioenergetics model kitchell et al 1977 to supplement our limited field data r rmax a rr s c where r is respiration in g o2 g 1 fish day 1 r max is maximum respiration a is an activity parameter to specify respiration rates above standard kitchell et al 1977 rr is an intermediate respiration calculation s is the specific dynamic action coefficient and c is consumption see table e in the appendix for specifics stream temperature is used in calculating both rmax and rr fish size mass is used to calculate rmax and c thus fish respiration will vary based on both the stream temperature and the fish size we used the little sandy creek stream temperature and the mass of our sampled fish in these calculations the determination of production is a very complex and time intensive process requiring far more information than we had fortunately we were able to implement humphreys 1979 general relation between respiration and production for both invertebrates and fish step 3 step 1 calculate respiration by

indmasstl sc is the midpoint mass of the size class numtl sc is the number of individuals in the size class within each trophic level in a sampled area for fish a conversion factor derived from the wisconsin bioenergetics model described above was used to set respfunct tl sc for each size class and trophic level for all invertebrates functional relations from incubated invertebrate samples were

production is about 75 of respiration for invertebrates and about 12 for fish 3 results 3 1 overview we display modeled stocks e g biomass and flows e g energy movement through trophic levels in little sandy creek using an odum energy circuit diagram odum 1983 fig 3 the outputs indicate that during our study the little sandy creek ecosystem was primarily fueled by both the sun and internally derived production with a much smaller amount of energy coming from allochthonous material we found that similar to terrestrial systems stocks and flows of energy declined with each ascending trophic level note that all data are presented in their original form usually grams per square meter and then extrapolated to the entire one kilometer stream reach using functional relations with depth and units of joules this is important because there are many more shallow areas than deep locations in the study reach the result of model extrapolation and range of model uncertainty does not support the operation of allen s paradox in little sandy creek the data we collected on september 8 2012 imply that the benthic macroinvertebrate production appears to be sufficient to support the fish energy requirements fig 9 and table 7 details follow 3 2 sunlight the sunlight fluctuated throughout the 24 h period and the intensity was generally very low compared to a typical day in early september fig 4 we recorded that the hill site 100 transmission of available par received a total of 4640 kj m 2 day 1 the meadow section which had an area of 3150 m2 received about 63 of available par at the stream surface the forest section had an area of 3850 m2 and received about 28 of available par at the stream surface over the course of the day meadow transects received about 2900 kj m 2 day 1 or 9200 mj in total for the km reach while forested stream transects received about 1300 kj m 2 day 1 or 5000 mj in total fig 3 sunlight inputs did not vary significantly between riffles and pools 3 3 whole stream metabolism the two station or free water fw analysis indicates that gross photosynthesis gpp was higher in the meadow than in the forest in the meadow nep followed a bell shaped pattern gross photosynthesis peaked in the early afternoon fig 5d in the meadow the integrated respiration over 24 h was 46 kj m 2 day 1 and the integrated gross photosynthesis was 93 kj m 2 day 1 in the forest gpp of the stream was variable during daytime we observed a peak in the late morning fig 5h gpp fell to zero in the cloudy early afternoon then rose above zero briefly in the late afternoon in the forest the integrated respiration was 80 kj m 2 day 1 and the integrated gross photosynthesis was 31 kj m 2 day 1 the nep gpp minus respiration over 24 h was 47 kj m 2 day 1 3 2 g o2 m 2day 1 in the meadow and 49 kj m 2 day 1 3 3 g o2 m 2day 1 in the forest table 5 from the results of the two station analysis we estimated the respiration gpp and nep in for the wetted area meadow and forest sections of little sandy creek table 5 community respiration was 354 mj day 1 in the forest and 169 mj day 1 in the meadow 523 mj day 1 for all of little sandy creek gpp in the forest was 138 mj day 1 and at 339 mj day 1 in the meadow 477 mj day 1 for all of little sandy creek thus based on the two station analysis we estimate that the total nep in little sandy creek on the day of our study was 46 0 mj day 1 which is very close to zero 3 4 benthic community metabolism estimated daily metabolism for the benthic chambers are given in table 4 benthic metabolism was highly variable fig b1 and b2 in appendix standard deviation was calculated to be about 40 of our mean estimates for gpp and about 50 for our estimates of respiration production showed little relation to sunlight intensity above minimum levels across all chambers even on a cloudy day when our data were primarily collected figs b1 b2 and b5 the nbp and respiration inside of the benthic chambers had no significant correlation with depth after adjusting for outliers table 5 compares per square meter and stream section estimates of primary production between free water and benthic chamber analyses average gpp from the benthic chamber analysis was slightly higher though not significantly in the meadow than in the forest table 5 we plotted gpp max and respiration for each chamber versus depth of chambers step 4 and sunlight transmission see values in table 4 but there was no significant linear relation between gpp and depth or sunlight therefore the analysis of functional relations with depth and sunlight have been excluded from our results to the model benthic community on the day of september 8th 2012 we used averages from the meadow and forest chambers table 5 and extrapolated them to the entire stream yielding gpp of 119 mj day 1 and respiration of 130 mj day 1 3 5 benthic invertebrate and fish stocks biomass and abundance of macroinvertebrates differed between riffles and pools and was largely dependent on stream depth in general greater biomass and abundance for a given trophic level were found in riffles compared to pools table 4 fig 6 the number and biomass of invertebrates per square meter was much greater in shallower environments while the pattern of fish abundance with depth was variable table 4 however the larger fish and hence the largest total biomass were found exclusively in pools while smaller fish were found in all areas but were more abundant in shallower sample sites the taxa of biota sampled in little sandy creek and their trophic level designations are listed in table b in the appendix size class designations for invertebrates and fish are shown in table f in the appendix fish biomass in each location was largely dependent on the depth of the sample site fig 7 fish number was greatest in the pool riffle location transect 25 however fish in this location transect 25 were significantly smaller than fish sampled in pool locations transects 22 and 34 the total mass of fish in transect 25 was smaller than the total masses of transects 22 and 34 insectivores sampled in the pool riffle had the greatest abundance 288 fish piscivores were absent in riffle locations transects 33 and 20 mixotrophs were also absent from transect 20 and had the lowest overall biomass see table 4 for additional results 3 6 other stocks while our study did not address the issue of upstream inputs of detritus directly it does appear there is roughly twice as much respiration as photosynthesis this means that about half the energy that is running through the stream came from sources other than photosynthesis similar to what hall 1972 found for new hope creek specifically we measured averages of 30 open canopy to 50 closed canopy g m 2 day 1 530 880 kj m 2 day 1 of allochthonous material input fig 3 which is comparatively higher that other lotic systems although similar to one autumn value see table g in appendix we did not measure other inputs e g terrestrial invertebrates or the meiofauna found within the interbed of the stream 3 7 benthic invertebrate and fish energy flows for each trophic level invertebrate respiration and production were greater in riffles compared to pools table 6 insectivores demonstrated the greatest overall respiration 48 6 kilojoule m 2 day 1 in riffles as well as the greatest variation in respiration and production between riffles and pools average respiration was 1 16 kilojoule m 2 day 1 in pool habitats the per unit mass respiration of fish measured decreased with mass the range was 0 05 g g 1 day 1 for a 3 3 g fish to 0 001 g g 1 day 1 for a 108 5 g fish on a log log scale the respiration slope of the trendline of all the fish when calculated using the wisconsin bioenergetics model equations was slightly higher than the trend found for our field measurements fig 8 mixotrophs had the lowest overall respiration rates averaging 449 j m 2 day 1 with a minimum of 6 5 j m 2 day 1 insectivores had the highest overall respiration and the greatest range of respiration rates interestingly the two riffle transects 33 and 25 had the highest insectivore respiration 696 j m 2 day 1 and 3394 j m 2 day 1 respectively in contrast piscivorous fish had higher respiration rates in deeper waters than in the riffle as production is calculated using respiration similar trends were found see table 6 for additional results 3 8 synthesis and extrapolation to entire reach depths within our study reach of little sandy creek were skewed towards shallower depths i e riffles were much more abundant in the stream than pools since we defined abundance of organisms in trophic levels and size classes by depth our integration over the full one km area and the simulations resulted in greater biomass of trophic levels that were found more frequently in riffles and lower biomass of trophic levels that were generally found in pools this is one reason that our invertebrate production values are large relative to fish consumption for the entire stream section the respective biomass respiration and production of the trophic levels of the entire length of little sandy creek are detailed in table 7 stocks of benthic invertebrates e g biomass were much larger than stocks of fish production generally decreased with ascending trophic level table 7 the total respiration of invertebrates and fish in little sandy creek was estimated to be about 205 mj day 1 3 9 allen s paradox the calculations and the model results do not support the existence of allen s paradox in little sandy creek as noted above we found that shallow depths comprised the vast majority of the study reach with relatively few deep pools fig 2 when the relations between fish and invertebrate abundance with depth were extrapolated across the entire reach we found that modeled benthic invertebrate production was about the same as modeled insectivorous fish respiration table 7 and fig 9 overall in stream invertebrate production of 79 mj day 1 38 or 34 mj appears to be sufficient to support fish respiration needs of 93 mj day 1 60 or 25 mj within the uncertainty of the data and analysis given an 80 assimilation efficiency for fish the macroinvertebrate production is enough to supply 68 of the insectivorous fish needs however during model sensitivity tests we found that changing the type of function e g power versus log linear for invertebrate respiration versus individual mass fig 8 resulted in estimates of invertebrate production that were up to three times higher or three times lower than our final best estimate these uncertainties highlight the difficulty of quantifying allen s paradox 4 discussion this entire exercise and corresponding class exercises was meant to serve as an introduction to systems ecology and more generally quantitative environmental science as such we the students were really surprised at its effectiveness in preparing us for later quantitative life the preparation of a real manuscript was especially effective in teaching us how to do real quantitative science we cannot emphasize enough the difference between reading about models and generating one from one s own data this plus the uncertainty in our estimation of invertebrate and fish metabolism used to test allan s paradox highlight the importance of having the modelers gain an intimate understanding of how data is collected and the types of error associated with the methods used for this reason we believe that it is crucial that modelers participate directly in the planning and collection of data from field studies in addition we believe that the basic methods given here serve as a template for more comprehensive and rigorous studies of stream ecosystem energy flow should that be of research interest energy is the common denominator for all metabolic and ecological processes hall 1972 with standard conversions from published literature we converted our biomass respiration and production values to energy units which allowed us to compare between trophic levels and to test allen s paradox we built unit conversion tables tables 4 so that others can easily convert to energy units with standard stream ecology data these estimates may not be precise but we believe that the order of magnitude of differences among trophic level values makes our analysis robust enough for the conclusions we draw it was unrealistic to undertake enough sampling in a few days to utilize robust statistics with our data hence rather than report elaborate statistical analyses we examined the data we obtained in 2012 with data from other years and from mead 2007 the results indicate that the data for 2012 were generally within the range of values collected by other systems ecology classes figs 12 and 13 and table 8 and mead 2007 fig 10 these values were not sufficiently different to negate our conclusions using sensitivity analysis specific comparisons are given by taxon below further the methodologies used in this study are relatively simple and more robust methodologies exist to quantify stream ecosystem metabolism see huryn et al 2014 for example 4 1 sunlight we measured par at each benthic chamber periodically to obtain functional responses with photosynthesis because par was not measured at regular frequent intervals at the chambers we did not have a sunlight measurement for each benthic chamber reading instead we assumed sunlight in the stream was proportional to sunlight measured at the hill and a shading factor eq 1 was used to estimate sunlight the use of a single shading factor eliminated the possibility of characterizing shading at different times of the day to eliminate this source of uncertainty in future studies sunlight estimates at each chamber could be improved by setting up solar flux meters to take regular readings in the areas of the stream near the benthic chambers if monitoring equipment is limited then the benthic chamber team should be given a solarimeter and the solar flux measurements should be taken hourly at each chamber at the time do readings are being recorded 4 2 whole stream metabolism for the entire stream the integrated 24 h net benthic production nbp estimate from the benthic chamber analysis of 11 mj day 1 was lower than the net ecosystem production nep estimate from the free water analysis of 46 mj day 1 table 5 both net production estimates were close to zero which indicates that the stream used about the same amount of energy on the day of our study as it produced free water estimates for gpp and respiration were about 2 6 times greater than benthic chamber estimates fig 10 similarities in trends between the metabolism estimates from the meadow and the forest in conjunction with observed weather patterns indicate a general agreement between the free water and benthic chamber analyses despite this difference nep and nbp were generally above zero during the day in the morning and late afternoon where there was higher sunlight transmission the negative daytime nep and nbp values are indicative of the compounding effects of low light transmission due to tree cover and heavy clouds which limited photosynthetic activity on the day of our study low or negative nep is typical of partially shaded temperate stream ecosystems such patterns have been observed by hall 1972 bott et al 1997 mulholland et al 2001 and others according to hall 1972 and bunn and davies 2000 the primary control on gpp in many streams tends to be riparian zone vegetation where a closed tree canopy during the warm season tends to reduce gpp young and huryn 1999 this was consistent with our study as the gpp estimated in the meadow from the two station analysis 6 5 g o2 m 2 day 1 was greater than in the forest 2 25 g o2 m 2 day 1 the gpp estimates from the free water analysis for the meadow and the forest had a similar range to mead s 2007 findings for open canopy and closed canopy samples sites fig 10 however the meadow gpp was particularly high we observed some very high oxygen concentrations during the day do values were above 10 0 g o2 m 3 at site 2 between 12 30 and 18 30 which was more than 10 above oxygen saturation we are not sure why the do concentration was so high in the water column in the afternoon the heavy rains and wind and our use of a diffusion constant of 1 0 g m 2 h 1 at 100 saturation which has been found as an approximate value in other streams churchill et al 1962 hall 1972 have all contributed to the uncertainty of the free water analysis wind and heavy rain can create surface turbulence which reduces the laminar layer of the stream air interface leading to increases the rate of diffusion however for obvious practical reasons we were unable to quantify the influence of any of these physical forces on do concentrations in little sandy creek nonetheless the data from the free water analysis gives a rough representation of what occurred september 8 2012 4 3 benthic community metabolism the estimated nbp over the entire 24 h study period was negative the sunlight was barely sufficient to generate positive oxygen changes in both the free water and benthic chambers however it appears that at about 100 200 j m 2 s 1 210 420 μmol m 2 s 1 oxygen production did not increase with increasing sunlight fig b1 in appendix while there is a lot of scatter in the sunlight data collected by students the basic results are similar to those of more professional analyses of little sandy creek see mead 2007 the low amounts of sunlight and heavy rain received during our study helps to explain the very low levels of gpp benthic chambers are also known to reduce productivity due to insufficient water turbulence hall et al 1979 the effect of highly variable conditions with variable sun flecks especially in the shaded woods and probably somewhat inexperienced investigators are apparent in the widely scattered data figs b1 b2 and b5 in appendix we compared adjusted gpp data for the meadow and the forest from 2012 with mead s 2007 more abundant and presumably more sophisticatedly derived data fig 10 our mean adjusted gpp ranged from 0 96 g m 2 day 1 in forest chambers to 1 07 g m 2 day 1 the meadow chambers our estimates from the benthic chamber analysis were on the low end of values reported by mead 2007 who estimated gpp of about 1 g m 2 day 1 in shaded pools and 4 5 g m 2 day 1 in non shaded riffles in august and october the agreement between mead s 2007 benthic chamber data and our 2012 data is satisfying given the low level of sunlight that reached the stream on sept 9 2012 shown on fig 4 the gpp estimates from 2012 are close to what is typically observed in closed to semi closed canopy stream ecosystems at similar latitudes in an inter biome comparison of streams across the united states mulholland et al 2001 found gpp rates between 0 1 and 2 0 g m 2 day 1 in six closed and semi closed canopy streams roberts et al 2007 found gpp rates of about 1 g m 2day 1 in a forested reach of the walker branch in tennessee we suspect that there may have been faulty seals on certain chambers which would have reduced both positive nbp and negative respiration measurements of o2 change the benthic chambers were made of a pink or blue opaque plastic and the walls of the chambers were generally raised between 10 and 30 cm above the stream surface photosynthesis in the benthic chambers could have been reduced due to shading and ambient light reduction caused by the container walls hence it is likely that both respiration and production were underestimated by the benthic chamber analysis using clear chambers and better materials to seal the chamber lids and a more comprehensive sampling procedure could improve the accuracy of benthic chamber measurements nevertheless the general similarities between trends in the benthic chamber data free water data and values from the literature indicate that our findings were roughly representative of the activity of the benthic primary producers in little sandy creek the true primary productivity rates likely fall between the benthic metabolism and two station analysis estimates 4 4 benthic invertebrate and fish stocks benthic invertebrate biomass in lotic ecosystems can be highly variable both spatially and temporally merritt et al 2008 mead 2007 although cummins 1973 mentions that in temperate freshwater ecosystems biomass of aquatic macrobenthic animals is generally consistent we found for both our own samples and those summarized by mead 2007 that there was a general pattern of greater benthic invertebrate biomass in shallower faster water and less biomass at deeper locations we found the biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates in little sandy creek to be roughly comparable with similar stream ecosystems for example griffith et al 1994 found shredder detritivore biomass ranged from 1 19 g m 2 to 3 77 g m 2 in west virginia streams in comparison detritivore biomass in little sandy creek ranged from 0 1 g m 2 to 1 3 g m 2 the lower values found in little sandy creek might be explained by the limited temporal resolution e g approximately 24 h in which our data were collected thus not capturing seasonal biomass variation in little sandy creek further cummins et al 1966 quantified the biomass of macroinvertebrates in linesville creek a small woodland stream in pennsylvania and found predators to have the highest proportional biomass 40 9 while herbivores composed a smaller percentage 31 8 one might predict that little sandy creek trophic levels would be organized in a relatively similar manner e g proportional biomasses for specific trophic levels between systems given that both are found in similar geographic settings with forested riparian habitat however our results indicate that herbivores and detritivores dominate the benthic invertebrate biomass in little sandy creek comprising greater than 90 of the total community whereas predator insectivore biomass was less than 1 differences in trophic level biomass between little sandy creek and the community described by cummins et al 1966 suggest that different forcing functions and mechanisms across systems may be affecting how trophic levels are organized with the pib sampler we could not sample anything deeper than the top of the net frame approximately 0 5 m a quantitative sample of benthic invertebrates in the area of the frame must operate close to 100 percent sampling efficiency this means we did not account for benthic invertebrates inhabiting the deepest portions of the stream when we extrapolated these data into the depths included in our model we assumed that the trend of benthic invertebrate biomass would continue at deeper depths we found herbivores were the most abundant trophic level amongst benthic macroinvertebrates while herbivore detritivores e g filterers were the least abundant note that in previous years filtering benthic macroinvertebrates e g hydropsychidae dominated the invertebrate community contrary to the data collected in 2012 this may be related to the temporal variation in available suspended food particles present in little sandy creek where reduced litter fall limits filterer populations and or higher abundance of benthic algae support a greater number of herbivores e g scrapers we compared our results to those from the 2011 and 2013 systems ecology class and found that in 2012 a much greater number of benthic invertebrates were collected fig 11 see table h1 3 in the appendix for raw data generally benthic invertebrate biomass and abundance varied by depth across the three years analyzed our results indicated that open meadow riffles had the greatest total abundance fig 11 and table 8 however there was not an overall significant difference between habitat types fig 11 and table 8 invertebrates collected by students in 2011 2013 ranged from 0 1 g m 2 in open pools to 9 g m 2 in open riffles table 8 in september 2003 simulated benthic invertebrate biomass average 1 8 g m 2 see fig 13 on page 108 in mead 2007 this was smaller than the average of the 2011 2013 biomass 2 3 g m 2 but well within the range of our data note that the actual total invertebrate mass from 2013 is higher than reported here as mass was recorded for only select trophic levels it is possible that the 2012 benthic invertebrate community structure was an aberration compared to other years indicated by higher abundance values relative to 2011 and 2013 fig 11 and table 8 there were various factors that could have reduced the effectiveness of our fish measurements fish were collected with the use of an electro shocker in blocked off cross sections of the stream the seber le cren method used for analysis gives an expansion factor that corrects for these potential errors we have attempted to quantify how the inclusion of second pass data would have affected our results since we used a combination of two factors mass and abundance to determine whether our sample size had decreased from the first pass to the second we had several estimates of sampling efficiency see table c which we combined for expanding abundance and biomass from each location we found our fish density data 2 02 fish m 2 to be comparable with similar stream ecosystems for example angermeier and smogor 1995 found density was approximately 1 95 fish m 2 in jordan creek in virginia and density ranged from 0 1 to 3 2 fish m 2 in the sedgeunkedunk stream in maine gardner et al 2013 gardner et al 2013 additionally found average fish biomass ranged from approximately 1 0 g m 2 to 18 0 g m 2 in two streams in maine compared to gardner et al 2013 fish biomass in little sandy creek had a much larger range from 0 7 g m 2 to 29 8 g m 2 though the area weighted average 17 g m 2 was similar furthermore we compared our results to those from the systems ecology classes in 2011 and 2013 see table i1 5 for raw data fish abundance was similar for all size classes in all three years 2011 2013 with the exception of the small 2 1 30 g size class fig 12a c the abundance of fish of any given size in a location is strongly related to stream depth small fish are more abundant in shallower areas while the largest fish are found almost exclusively in deeper areas overall the largest number of fish caught in little sandy creek was in the 2 1 30 g range fish in this size class were found primarily in the middle depths between 0 35 0 65 m fig 12b relatively few fish were caught in any given year in the largest size class 100 1 g fig 12c given the relation between fish size and the depth of capture the total mass of fish caught in 2012 and 2013 increased with an increase in stream depth fig 13 4 5 benthic invertebrate and fish energy flows benthic invertebrate respiration estimates were conducted using several invertebrate taxa of different sizes to generate functional relations these simple measurements demonstrated what is well known in physiology that smaller individuals consumed more oxygen per gram of weight than larger individuals for example a 1 0 mg macroinvertebrate consumed approximately 35 μg o2 hr 1 which is in agreement with literature estimates summarized in mead s 2007 little sandy creek study while a 4 mg macroinvertebrate consumed oxygen at a slower rate approximately 4 5 μg o2 hr 1 we compared our in situ benthic invertebrate respiration values to those measured by rostgaard and jacobsen 2005 and found comparable respiration rates for example the respiration of stoneflies in little sandy creek at 20 c was measured at 4 57 mg o2 g 1 h 1 while rostgaard and jacobsen 2005 found a respiration rate across all taxa sampled 87 individuals at 20 c to be 4 89 mg o2 g 1 h 1 the general functional relations from our in situ measurements were subsequently used to estimate respiration of size classes of each trophic level for the benthic invertebrate community sampled in the stream and respiration rates were converted to generate production estimates as energy is consumed a proportion will be used to maintain metabolic functioning of the individual with the remaining energy generally utilized for growth and reproduction i e production humphreys 1979 demonstrated that a greater proportional production is observed as respiration increases up to an organism s temperature optimum in other words as the respiration of an individual increases the difference between respiration and production also increases due to a greater amount of total energy available for growth assuming food is unlimited we estimated fish respiration in the field using fish of varying sizes from different taxa these data were then used to generate functional relations however due to inappropriate container size along with questionable seals the respiration data were not successful for all of the species sampled thus we used the wisconsin bioenergetics model refer to equations in table e of the appendix as our primary method of calculating fish respiration rates per gram of fish and to generate functional relations to use in the little sandy creek system model we subsequently compared our field results to those from the wisconsin bioenergetics model output variability in fish respiration from 2 to 3400 j m 2day 1 see fig 8 and table 6 in little sandy creek was primarily a function of fish mass nonetheless it seems likely that fish species and the depth of measurement also caused small amounts of variability in fish respiration the constants in the wisconsin bioenergetics model equations vary by fish species thus contributing to some of the variability in respiration in addition respiration and production of aquatic animal populations can vary depending on activity environmental stress such as oxygen levels food availability and stream temperature warren and doudoroff 1971 the fish respiration rates we measured in the field were similar to the results produced by the wisconsin bioenergetics model for similar sized fish fig 8 our field results were also comparable to those in the literature for example beauchamp et al 1989 found that the respiration of juvenile sockeye salmon in babine lake canada was approximately 0 04 g g 1 day 1 see fig 4 in beauchamp et al 1989 in september slightly less than the maximum fish respiration we measured in the field 0 05 g g 1 day 1 further kitchell et al 1977 reported simulated yellow perch respiration rates ranging from approximately 1 mg o2 g 1 day 1 in early september to 7 5 mg o2 g 1 day 1 in late september by comparison our field measurements of fish respiration ranged from 0 24 mg o2 g 1 day 1 to 50 mg o2 g 1 day 1 fig 8 while there was a large range of respiration values in the modeled little sandy creek results due to fish of many sizes and types 2 3 163 mg o2 g 1fish day 1 respiration values found in the literature for similar ecosystems generally fall within this range for example the average respiration value for new hope creek was 0 0034 g o2 g 1fish day 1 hall 1972 the rate of oxygen use by the fish community of little sandy creek at location 2 transect 25 which had an average depth of 0 21m was 4 73 cal m 2 day 1 compared to 0 79 cal m 2day 1 in the upstream fish community of new hope creek which had an average depth of 0 28 m hall 1972 however hall 1972 did not report fish respiration as a function of mass so it is difficult to make a direct comparison 4 6 allen s paradox allen s paradox was famously shown to be operating in horokiwi stream new zealand allen 1951 harvey and marti 1993 huryn 1996 allen estimated that fish predation utilized 40 150 times the aquatic macroinvertebrate production allen 1951 williams et al 2003 a much clearer case for allen s paradox than we found benthic invertebrate production must be greater than or equal to fish respiration in order to support the presence of a fish community through time benke 1976 has attributed allen s paradox to inadequate sampling methods for the macroinvertebrate community especially macroinvertebrate secondary production this might also apply in little sandy creek especially due to our exclusion of the hyporheic community which stanford and ward 1993 suggest may be more important in some systems than conventionally sampled benthic invertebrate communities we hypothesized that allen s paradox would be extant in little sandy creek on september 8th 2012 the hypothesis was tested by modeling benthic invertebrate production and fish respiration considering the limitations of our analysis we conclude that allen s paradox was not observed in our study reach although the benthic invertebrate production and fish respiration are similar total benthic invertebrate production 78 mj day 1 uncertainty range 40 113 mj day1 is sufficient to support insectivorous fish respiration 93 mj day 1 uncertainty range 35 117 mj day1 the two outputs generated by the little sandy creek model are not significantly different after considering sensitivity tests and the error estimates of functions used in the extrapolation to the entire stream we can highlight several other important factors that contribute to uncertainty surrounding modeled allen s paradox outputs these factors include additional food sources for fish seasonal and inter annual variability in species abundance and size spatial heterogeneity in the stream such as depth substrate and physical forces benke et al 1988 although there is a large amount of uncertainty surrounding our results when we account for energy transfer between trophic levels there does appear to be enough invertebrate production to support the insectivorous fish respiration needs we did not measure additional potential food sources for fish such as terrestrial insects falling into the stream hyporheic macroinvertebrates or meiofauna huryn 1996 incorporated macroinvertebrate samples from the terrestrial and hyporheic zones into an analysis of allen s paradox in sutton stream in new zealand and found that primary consumer production was greater than that of secondary consumers e g fish thus a surplus of prey production was available to the fish community in sutton stream the link between hyporheic invertebrates to fish production is often overlooked likely due to hyporheic invertebrates being under represented in standard stream benthic sampling waters 1993 huryn 1996 waters 1993 conducted a literature review of allen s paradox and found that in certain streams during certain times of the year ample invertebrate production is present to support to fish energy demand mead s 2007 study in little sandy creek reported that invertebrate biomass and production were highest in september variables such as temperature stream community biomass and composition vary significantly throughout the year respiration rates of all organisms are tightly related to temperature which varies from 0 c to about 25 c in little sandy creek without further modeling and analysis it is difficult to assess how seasonal changes alters the balance of in stream fish respiration and invertebrate production collecting data on a quarterly or even biannual basis would allow students to more adequately address questions that vary on a temporal scale inter annual variability in trophic level abundance and biomass is likely to have affected the magnitude of allen s paradox between 2011 and 2013 fish abundance was not significantly different from 2011 to 2013 fig 12 in 2013 fish mass was higher than in 2012 fig 13 however invertebrate biomass and abundance was much lower table 8 fig 11 which suggests that allen s paradox was in operation in 2013 the 2011data are more ambiguous invertebrate samples from 2012 had high abundances relative to 2011 while total biomass was much lower fig 11 and table 8 this indicates that the 2012 community was comprised of smaller individuals which led to higher estimates of respiration and production given the similar abundance and mass of fish in 2011 and 2012 compared to the relatively low abundance and high biomass of benthic invertebrates in 2011 it is possible that allen s paradox was operating in september of 2011 from annual sampling of the stream by the suny esf systems ecology course plus additional studies from mead 2007 we know that fish and benthic invertebrates have inhabited little sandy creek at roughly similar levels over a long term period however it seems as though interannual invertebrate population changes may be large enough shift the balance of estimate invertebrate production and fish respiration we measured benthic invertebrate biomass and respiration over a very short period of time approximately 24 h and we used a somewhat crude and generalized approach to estimate production an equation from humphreys 1979 with a more robust dataset stronger statistical relations could be developed and the range of model uncertainty be reduced 4 7 a student s perspective what did the field trip and modeling the results teach us the systems ecology course began with an invitation to the students to hypothesize about the various explanations of ecosystem processes we learned that systems ecology was defined by odum 1964 as the structure and function of levels of organization beyond that of the individual and species specifically it is the idea that there is a set of elements connected and related in order to form a whole whose properties are not just those of the component elements but are properties of the whole itself peet 1992 as developing systems thinkers we learned to look for the connections between elements and think about how they impact ecosystem structure we were immersed in process of in class literature discussions hypothesis formation field sampling data analysis deep thinking when our hypotheses were not supported and modeling quantifying stocks and flows in little sandy creek and conceptualizing them in a flow diagram allowed us to learn how the stream operates over much of its length though we examined only individual components in discreet locations within the stream this allowed us to engage in systems thinking and enhance our understanding of little sandy creek specifically how each individual component of the stream contributes to the overall function of the ecosystem such as organic debris imported by rain storms as an energy input to detritivores and ultimately fish ultimately this iterative learning experience left us with humility for the aspects of the ecosystem we didn t immediately understand and or could not capture with our sampling techniques e g nutrient dynamics and a deeper knowledge of stream ecosystems and their complexity this class enlightened us to the utility of formally identifying system components and interactions with observation and modeling and imbued us with a fundamentally different view of the world by learning to look for connections between system components everywhere we go 4 8 teaching systems ecology we have found that students learn about systems thinking and modeling much more concretely when they observe measure and derive relations from a real specific ecosystem rather than abstractions from books or equations from our perspective models are simplifications of complex systems that ideally capture the most important behavior of interest more than twenty years of data have been recorded at little sandy creek which we have come to know as a thriving ecosystem driven by allochthonous energy inputs this has been a result of hard work borrowed equipment good land owner relations and overall extremely low cost of implementation with such copious data archived this systems ecology class can be seen as a mini long term ecological research project it allowed for an enormous amount of student involvement as well as support by many other volunteers the legacy of research on this stream facilitated the development of a state of the art benthic invertebrate model mead 2007 one future possibility is making the entire data set digitally available so that more studies can be performed on this creek in addition many students have indicated that experiencing or watching the use of quantitative methods including winklers stream morphology measurements with meter sticks and meter tapes solarimeters pib invertebrate samples electric fish sampling equipment and so on has equipped them well for later careers in ecology and environmental science then of course taking their field measurements and figuring out how to handle them in spreadsheets and computer modeling gave many a leg up for everything from field positions to environmental ngos to faculty positions our hope is that this paper will be useful as a resource for young scientists in training and teaching tool for early career professors one of the key components of the systems ecology course was in class discussion of papers in ecology the seminar style exercise forced students to be critical of what they read and to think in real time rather than training technicians the goal is to train thinkers this paper reflects the thought pathways dr hall encouraged students to use when thinking about ecosystems we encourage readers of this paper to think not just about how we applied technical approaches in field methods and data analysis but how we have defined the ecosystem in terms of functional components and how this exercise might apply to the ecosystems that each reader studies for those readers who are interested further conceptual development and teaching ecology using a systems approach jørgensen 2012 is a good source to start for the systems ecology class at suny esf dr hall used a compilation of literature including many of the works cited in this paper e g odum 1957 warren and doudoroff 1971 hall 1972 hall and day 1977 odum 1983 as well as lindeman 1942 5 conclusions our original intent for this paper was to describe a very successful but difficult teaching tool for systems thinking and eventually modeling at the suggestion of the editor of this journal we have written it up as a research report and recognize that the modeling approach used here simple functional relations with stream depth are simplified in order to be applied in a semester long course given the lack of sampling experience of most students we are pleased that the results are as good as they are we are also pleased to report that whole ecosystem studies new and exciting when the first author was a graduate student still have a lot to offer in terms of understanding ecology over the last several decades there has been an apparent decline in quantitative ecosystem ecology and an emergence of more defensible sub disciplines within ecology and academics in general as researchers become more specialized gaps in whole system understanding will emerge especially without encouragement of truly interdisciplinary research in academia and funding agencies with ever increasing human impacts and ability to monitor ecosystems it is difficult to conduct actionable science by only looking at a few independent and response variables identifying problems system boundaries developing management strategies and adapting them in a timely fashion can be done only if a comprehensive systems approach is utilized for example warming air temperatures will potentially lead to insufficient energy for fish reproduction which could ultimately affect the fishing industry however the initial impacts of warming air temperature cannot be fully understood without using a systems approach to study the problem our exercise taught students the process of modeling and studying a whole system the one weekend process of collecting data in a small stream allowed students to gain a whole ecosystem perspective and even to test hypotheses by integrating data from different components of the system using a systems approach can lead to many useful and unexpected research outcomes for example by sampling the entire ecosystem we had sufficient data to test allen s paradox even though that was not the initial goal of the systems ecology field trip another useful outcome is that we were able to examine the influence of various forcing functions on our measured ecosystem components we hope that this exercise will encourage other professors or high school teachers to undertake such studies with their own students whether or not the results are eventually

25337,we report energy stocks and flows as well as other ecosystem properties measured in little sandy creek in upstate new york as part of an intensive class project in a graduate level systems ecology course at the suny college of environmental science and forestry our study synthesizes information on little sandy creek both as a whole system and through examination of key individual trophic components we also test allen s paradox in little sandy creek whether there is enough biomass produced by the invertebrate community to support the energetic needs of the fish community students collected data in the field over the course of a weekend in september 2012 during the ensuing semester we synthesized all of these data often utilizing relatively simple quantitative models to generate a spatial synthesis populated with trophic levels for a one kilometer reach of stream we utilized two synthesizing procedures during our trophic flow analysis first we sampled organisms along a depth gradient and modeled trophic levels and size class with depth to give more precise estimates of biomass second we used models for the relation between production and also respiration energy requirements and organism size to estimate production and energy use of trophic levels and functional feeding groups we synthesized and extrapolated upon our data with a numerical model that simulated the stocks and flows in little sandy creek using abiotic forcing functions and functional responses derived from our field measurements the mean values indicate the benthic macroinvertebrate production 11 kj m 2 day 1 is insufficient to support the fish energy requirements 13 kj m 2 day 1 within our uncertainty estimates given an 80 assimilation efficiency for fish the macroinvertebrate production is enough to supply only 68 of the fish needs our primary hypothesis was supported students were able to thoroughly collect and organize data from little sandy creek in a single weekend further over the course of a semester students successfully analyzed their data we were then able to take that data and build a realistic model of the little sandy creek system based on our model outputs we fail to reject our secondary hypothesis that allen s paradox is present in little sandy creek keywords systems ecology allen s paradox ecosystem modeling trophic level stream ecosystem stocks and flows 1 introduction ecology as a discipline had been unified by eugene odum s textbook odum 1953 when one of us c hall took the course in 1963 in recent years there has been a compartmentalization of ecology into sub disciplines e g population ecology and community ecology that from our perspective has diluted the impact of the odum brother s eugene and howard teachings of systems thinking that ecology was once founded upon despite its continuation in some quarters there is a need to bring back systems thinking more generally to the field because of the increasing complexity scope and urgency of environmental issues specifically due to the proliferation of compartmentalized approaches to ecology and the death or retirement of most of the second generation of systems ecologists it is imperative that we formally document successful approaches to teaching systems ecology while there are a number of systems ecology textbooks available e g odum 1994 jørgensen 2012 in our opinion none of them capture the essence of what we perceive as a true systems ecology teaching experience we believe systems perspectives and ideas should first be introduced by having students study nature conceptually and quantitatively from a systems approach including physical and biotic elements and the interactions among them thus in our opinion modeling should be complementary to the conceptual and quantitative studies in the field with this in mind we present here the methods and results of our experience with developing such an approach including conceptualization field data collection and modeling in a graduate class called systems ecology the concepts and methodology described here were formalized over the span of 30 years as part of the systems ecology course taught at cornell university in ithaca n y and the state university of new york college of environmental science and forestry suny esf in syracuse ny the concepts taught in the systems ecology course are derived from the teachings and writings of howard odum see hall and day 1977 odum 1994 modified by sampling developments in stream ecology the objective of this class was to teach students how to understand measure synthesize and ultimately model general properties and principles of natural and human dominated systems not from books or equations but from nature herself the systems ecology course included a field trip wherein the students measured and analyzed different elements of the biotic physical and chemical characteristics of a stream ecosystem the field trip and successive analyses are based on odum s silver springs study odum 1957 and hall s stream ecosystem analysis hall 1972 the students were given a series of assignments which use their own data as a primary tool for learning a systems approach to ecology by building parameterizing and analyzing models over the years we have found that for our students the lessons taken from investigating and quantifying the stream system are broadly applicable to many other systems this experience has prepared our students very well for applying a systems approach to later careers in ecology resource management health and many other disciplines this publication is meant to give others an introduction to this teaching approach within the context of generating a scientific paper as suggested by the editor of this journal it is based on giving the summary and synthesis of data gathered principally on one weekend in 2012 although we compare these students results to the much more extensive database on little sandy creek of mead 2007 and that of other years as such it is one of the relatively few recent papers to summarize the complete physical and trophic energy structure and flow for any ecosystem but see gaichas et al 2009 energy in an ecosystem can be quantified as stocks e g biomass and flows e g trophic energy fluxes stocks known as state variables or endogenous variables are influenced by the dynamics of other internal stocks stocks and flows are also influenced by the forcing functions or exogenous variables external factors e g solar input that affect the ecosystem but are themselves not affected by the dynamics of the ecosystem in a single field trip we measured key stocks and flows for our ecosystem little sandy creek a small creek in upstate new york the exercise allowed us to trace energy flow from the sun through the various trophic levels in the stream community we found that a group of 15 25 highly motivated students could indeed quantify the essential features of a stream ecosystem in one demanding weekend we would not expect others using this paper as a guide for a class exercise would necessarily go to such detailed assessment as we did e g correcting organism density and metabolism for specific depths vs just using riffles and pools so that the sampling and calculations can be undertaken much more easily than presented here we hope to formalize and promulgate a very successful teaching experience with the anticipation that others might find it useful we have included considerable information and analyses here in an effort to address the entire ecosystem and used the data generated by the students to address a specific research question allen s paradox instructors and or students may find certain sections to be more relevant than others depending on the context of instruction nevertheless the information presented here provides an example of the extent types of data and analyses that can be generated in a graduate level systems ecology course given the fragmentation and non quantitative nature of much environmental education we hope this will help to make a systems perspective more accessible to ambitious teachers of ecology and environmental science once the general principles of systems are identified modeled and understood scientists as well as managers policy makers economists etc are better prepared to ask questions and solve problems objectively and quantitatively 1 1 streams as excellent laboratories for systems studies small streams are superb ecosystems for this exercise because they have clear boundaries banks bottom and water surface and are a manageable size additionally it is possible for a group of students to sample individual components and total ecosystem metabolism with modest equipment the biotic community of a stream can be classified into trophic levels by which energy captured by the primary producers notably benthic algae flows in the form of measureable food webs these ecological food webs reflect energy transformation among trophic levels odum 1994 we measured physical chemical and biotic properties of the little sandy creek ecosystem both as a whole system gestalt and by examining its principal sub systems 1 2 allen s paradox revisited allen 1951 studied the horokiwi stream in new zealand and found that the secondary production of the prey benthic invertebrates community was insufficient to support trout biomass and production in the same section of stream utilizing 40 150 the benthic invertebrate production even though macroinvertebrate communities remained present in the system over time while production did not appear sufficient to support the energy needs of the fish community the benthic invertebrate community persisted and therefore must not have all been consumed waters 1988 if organisms are to reproduce they must acquire a large enough net energy gain to overcome environmental stress procure food and mate all while maintaining a basic rate of maintenance metabolism for populations to persist enough individuals must acquire energy surpluses to compensate for the majority that do not reproduce hall et al 1992 huryn 1996 reassessed allen s paradox by analyzing the production budgets for a different stream sutton stream in new zealand huryn expanded the boundaries of his study to include terrestrial and hyporheic sources of invertebrate production and found that these sources were roughly equal to the trout s respiration requirements and perhaps enough surplus production occurred to support the continued abundance of invertebrates huryn 1996 allen s paradox has served as a troubling issue in ecology for some 60 years for systems that appear to be food limited in this paper we test the hypothesis that allen s paradox exists in little sandy creek by measuring and quantifying stocks e g biomass and flows e g respiration and production of invertebrates and fish as this was a simple class exercise constrained by equipment funding and sampling time we do not contribute any novel sampling techniques that might improve quantitative approaches to detecting allen s paradox in the field however by developing a size class and trophic level based respiration production model that can be used with a small amount of non destructive sampling techniques we believe we have made a small but noteworthy contribution to the methodology of the allen s paradox literature 1 3 site description the study site is a 975 m stretch of little sandy creek a tributary to lake ontario located in upstate new york fig 1 little sandy creek is known as a good fishing stream for migratory chinook salmon coho salmon and steelhead trout and provides particularly productive nursery habitat for these species the water level in little sandy creek fluctuates seasonally and is characterized by low water levels in early september on september 8 2012 the principal day of our study the area sampled had a mean width of 8 8 m a mean depth of 20 cm and a mean discharge of 0 49 m3 s 1 the average stream temperature for september 7 9 was 19 5 c the stream section that we studied emerges from dense mixed hardwood forest flows through a meadow and then below norton road re enters a heavily forested area little sandy creek is generally a clear stream with relatively clean and well oxygenated waters it contains a variety of substrate types ranging from silt to bedrock but most common are various sizes of stones and cobble it has a golden brown hue due to the growth of diatoms and other algae on the rock surfaces during our study the depth in our section varied from 1 to 102 centimeters with relatively well defined pools and riffles we considered pools to have a water depth greater than or equal to 0 40 m any depth less than 0 40 m was considered a riffle most of the area about 90 percent consists of relatively shallow riffles the stream is populated with a wide variety of invertebrates including the larvae of caddisflies stoneflies blackflies and mayflies and a variety of fish species including brown and rainbow trout juvenile silver coho and chinook salmon various minnow species suckers darters and a few centrarchids the benthic community consists of various species of bacteria diatomic algae macroinvertebrates arthropods and some fish that live on and within the substrate bott et al 1985 although the stream appears to have the characteristics of a biological system relatively untouched by human activities there is some treated sewage input approximately 5 km upstream and anglers frequent the creek seasonally of importance to its role in teaching the stream is clear and lovely and just the right size and we had excellent relations with the land owners 2 methods 2 1 overview we estimated biomass stocks and energy flows of little sandy creek using representative locations sampled with standard stream sampling gear and methods for each entity described below because the stream itself had considerable heterogeneity pools riffles and runs most of the samples were taken along gradients of depth and velocity from these data we established relations for biomass and metabolism subdivided by trophic level as a function of depth water velocity the principle determinants we developed a model using these relations along with extensive physical measurements to populate the entire one kilometer stream section with fish and invertebrate biomass and metabolism from this data we derived estimates of the stocks and flows of energy in the biotic community of the stream ecosystem and hence the production of invertebrates and energy requirements of fish to test allen s paradox we divided our systems ecology class into five groups physical stream metabolism benthic metabolism benthic invertebrates and fish each group was responsible for measuring stocks and flows for their respective component using conventional stream sampling techniques e g hall and moll 1975 hauer and hill 2006 hall 2012 the frequency and accuracy of our measurements were slightly compromised by an unexpected thunderstorm that occurred mid day on september 8th to compensate for this we took additional measurements the next morning on a relatively sunny september 9th in addition we used summary data from other studies conducted in little sandy creek to check for the general validity of our results this included data from mead 2007 as well as data from the 2011 and 2013 systems ecology classes we also measured the metabolism of representative species through oxygen consumption during incubations in various metabolic chambers we measured or estimated the principal abiotic physical dimensions sunlight and dissolved oxygen and biotic properties biomass respiration and production of aquatic macroinvertebrates fishes and the entire benthic community our characterization of the stream ecosystem was done in four steps first observation and systematic collection of data from the study site under the assumption that depth and its inverse relation with water velocity was the principal determinant of community structure for different organisms second we analyzed the collected data to derive functional relations with depth that characterized the component systems third we used these functional relations to populate stocks and flows in energy units for the one kilometer stretch of stream that was the focus of our research in a few cases as noted we had to eliminate some outliers we assume these to be due to student inexperience or equipment difficulties instead we use interpolations based on decades of field experience and common sense finally we simulated the behavior of the ecosystem over that day with a computer model thus we were able to do an entire systems analysis of a complete ecosystem in one semester including additional analysis and write up time while exploring a fundamental issue in ecology we have done more or less this same exercise for some 30 years on several ecosystem types always with at least moderate success details of all procedures follow 2 2 field data collection as a general rule we attempted to organize our sampling not so much by habitat type but by functional response such as biomass of a taxon as a function of depth this was done in order to interpolate our point samples necessary given the impossibility of sampling every square meter of the entire stream so that we could extrapolate our point data to the entire stream and to facilitate later modeling we also did this as a means of exposing the students to thinking in terms of deriving and using functional responses for their later modeling and professional lives 2 2 1 physical measurements we divided the study area of little sandy creek longitudinally into 39 transects each 25 m in length from upstream to downstream with norton road as the midpoint fig 1 the upstream sections transects 1 22 were classified as meadow and the downstream sections transects 23 39 were classified as forested each section had varied geomorphology table a in the appendix we categorized each transect as riffle or pool depending on depth fig 2 and table 4 in the middle of each transect we estimated the canopy cover over the banks and the center of the stream we then measured the width of the stream as well as the depth at 1 m intervals across the width at each transect we also measured the velocity of the stream at each transect point and for the entire length of both the meadow and the forested areas by following six neutrally buoyant objects lemons downstream we took measurements of solar flux photosynthetically active radiation par using a li cor li 190 quantum sensor μmol m 2 s 1 at five minute intervals from an unobstructed location in addition we took seven measurements of the solar intensity at each benthic chamber 2 2 2 metabolism of whole stream our objective here was to measure whole stream metabolism net ecosystem production respiration and gross primary production using the diel curve method summarized below and described in detail in hall and moll 1975 we achieved this by measuring the change in the concentration of dissolved oxygen do during the time taken for a unit volume of water to travel between sites as measured by the physical team i e the free water method the advantage of the diel curve method is that it does not use bottle incubation which might interfere with the natural processes one is trying to measure the disadvantage is that one has to correct for the diffusion of oxygen across the stream s surface which is likely to be an issue with a shallow turbulent stream such as little sandy creek we define net ecosystem production nep as the diffusion adjusted do change during the day we define respiration of the entire stream ecosystem as the diffusion adjusted do change measured at night and interpolated during the day we discarded positive do changes at night and inserted the average respiration value we estimate gross primary production gpp as nep minus respiration we sampled stream temperature and do using the winkler method hall and moll 1975 hall 2012 at transects 1 beginning of top meadow 22 norton road and 39 below the second forested area at three hour intervals over a 24 h period fundamentally a triplicate oxygen and temperature sample was taken at the top middle and bottom of our one km river stretch we sampled each location approximately one half hour apart this interval was determined by the time it took neutrally buoyant objects lemons to travel from one section to another thus in principle we are following a parcel of water as it flows through first the meadow and then the forested section of our ecosystem 2 2 3 metabolism of benthic community we set up eight benthic chambers in the streambed to measure metabolism of the benthic community we assume that the benthic community lives within the stream substrate and is comprised of invertebrates microbes and primary producers we did not attempt to quantify the respiration of sub communities within the benthic substrate therefore respiration was estimated as the average of negative do changes observed at night positive do changes recorded at night were disregarded and replaced with the average it is very difficult to gain an estimate of primary producer respiration in the benthos so we do not report any values for net primary productivity npp of the periphyton alone rather we measured net benthic primary productivity nbp as the do changes measured during the day the net change in oxygen from photosynthesis including that which compensates for respiration of the entire benthic community in the chambers we calculated gpp as the difference between nbp and benthic community respiration see fig b2 in appendix since there was insignificant metabolism of the water column organisms as determined by light and dark bottle studies we would expect the values measured by free water and benthic community techniques to be somewhat similar we installed the chambers in two riffles and two pools in both the meadow and the forest sections of our study area a week before the field trip on september 1 2012 when installing the chambers we removed the stream substrate layer by layer and then reconstructed the strata as they occurred in the stream within the chamber we submerged the chambers at the spot from which we dug out the substrate we measured depth from the top of the substrate to the surface of the stream making sure that each chamber had sufficient depth so that it would not breach the surface if water levels decreased we left the chambers open to the stream for one week which allowed the resident biota to recolonize and establish within each chamber before measurement for the chambers we used rubbermaid roughneck bins with dimensions of 48 by 35 cm width x 31 0 cm or 22 1 cm height fig a in the appendix we put the 22 1 cm tall bins in the riffles and the 31 0 cm tall bins in the pools to reduce the risk of the water level falling below the chamber on september 7th 2012 the night before measurements we sealed the chambers with plexiglas lids held in place by a series of clamps and foam rubber seals there was a small electric bilge pump installed on the inside of each lid to simulate stream water flow each lid also contained a circular hole which could be sealed by a removable rubber stopper which allowed us to take do measurements using a ysi 550 probe fig a in the appendix we took measurements of air temperature do of the stream and do inside the chamber approximately every hour for 24 h starting from 01 00 on september 7th on september 9th at 18 00 we flushed the forest chambers with stream water to avoid critically low oxygen concentrations and on september 9th from 10 00 13 30 a sunnier day we recorded additional measurements for all chambers at half hour intervals to get do response in the chambers at higher solar flux after the study period we removed the benthic chambers from the streambed and measured the volume of water present above the substrate and within the interstitial space table 4 2 2 4 stocks of benthic invertebrates and fish based on past experience we assumed that biomass of different taxa and sizes within taxa were principally a function of water depth or velocity as they were inversely related so we deliberately chose representative shallow riffles and deep pools as areas to sample table 4 we classified all organisms captured into trophic levels to examine energy flow pathways and to test allen s paradox and size class as respiration and production are a function of organism size brown et al in press we sampled aquatic macroinvertebrates quantitatively using a portable invertebrate box sampler pibs with an area of 0 1 m2 in duplicate at four sites at each site we recorded water depth cm took samples sorted the macroinvertebrate samples and recorded the dry weight biomass of each taxon dried at 60 c for 24 h in the laboratory see table 4 taxa were classified to genus where possible and assigned to a trophic level merritt et al 2008 table b in the appendix we determined the number biomass and trophic levels of each species within the fish community at five locations table 4 we used two fine meshed seines to block off each section and an electro shocker to stun and collect the fish we measured temperature length and average width and depth of the area sampled at each location sampling efficiency was assessed using duplicate samples additionally using the seber le cren equation seber and le cren 1967 we estimated the total biomass and abundance that were present table c in the appendix we identified fish to species and measured the length and weight for each fish caught werner 2004 2 2 5 other stocks we measured allochthonous input over a 24 h period at eight forested and four meadow locations tops of the benthic chamber rubbermaid bins dimensions of 60 7 cm length x 40 4 cm width were placed in the riparian zone approximately 1 m from the water line at a given location after 24 h all terrestrial material that had fallen on the bin tops was collected and stored in ziploc bags for transport back to the laboratory all material was dried at 60 c for at least 24 h weighed to obtain dry biomass g and converted to area g m 2 then to energy units mj the occurrence of top predators such as kingfishers and great blue herons were noted when observed but their biomass or metabolism per hour per square meter was trivial and hence ignored we did not directly measure the abundance of terrestrial predators viruses bacteria fungi etc but assume they are abundant if not weighty see odum 1957 likewise we did not quantify terrestrial invertebrate inputs although we measured leaf inputs or measure the meiofauna of the stream hyporheic zone plus upstream detrital or macroinvertebrate inputs into our study reach explicitly 2 2 6 energy flows of invertebrates and fish we measured the oxygen consumed mg o2 g 1 h 1 for small and large individuals of the dominant taxa stoneflies and caddisflies using the winkler method at 3 c 12 c and 20 c we used winkler bottles as incubation chambers and found that we could get detectable oxygen changes with several grams of insects in several hours we measured the oxygen consumption mg o2 g 1 h 1 of several characteristic species of fish brown trout salmo trutta fallfish semotilus corporalis northern hogsucker hypentelium nigricans rock bass ambloplites rupestris and yellow perch perca flavescens at the ambient stream temperature 20 c using the winkler method and winkler bottles or gallon jars depending on the size of the fish we also used the wisconsin bioenergetics model kitchell et al 1977 to calculate the size and temperature specific metabolism of all sampled fish 2 3 data analysis we adjusted sunlight data collected at the hill over the entire day to values at the water surface in the meadow and the forest i e corrected for shading by examining the relation between par measurements taken at each chamber relative to the open hill location i e estimating of available par that was transmitted to the stream surface estpar we measured the metabolism of the primary producers in the open water and in the benthic chambers directly with oxygen changes in the water and plotted the results as a function of sunlight and depth additionally we compared our metabolism results with the much more extensive record for the same stream in mead 2007 for higher trophic levels we took our biotic samples and derived the total number and biomass of each trophic level as a function of depth then populated the entire one kilometer stream by multiplying the relation between the number of individuals in size classes by trophic level to depth for the area of each depth of our section see table 1 this allowed us to derive values for the total biomass and metabolism of each trophic level for our entire one kilometer stream section 2 3 1 summary of conversion processes table 1 provides examples of the calculations used to convert number and biomass for macroinvertebrates and fish table 2 gives the standard conversion factors used in tables 1 3a and 3b tables 3a and 3b summarize the various conversions by which we went from raw data to kilojoules kj per square meter for each metabolic process in general we went from volume changes of dissolved oxygen such as measured with a winkler titration or oxygen meter to area values and then converted from dissolved oxygen changes to its equivalent in kj we derived daily values by summing hourly values in some cases these values were derived from functional relations 2 3 2 extrapolation to entire reach model construction we generated quantitative summaries of stocks and flows of the various trophic levels of little sandy creek for september 8 2012 first in tabular form then in functional relations with depth this was followed by multiplying the value for each depth by the area of that depth interval within the one kilometer section thus giving us an estimate for the entire reach of the stream these values were summarized in a quantitative odum flow diagram and in a fortran computer model see model code in appendix our computer model calculated stocks and flows in little sandy creek using depth as an abiotic forcing function the program read in depth values measured at 1 m increments across the stream every 25 m for the 1 km transect each grid cell had an area of 25 m2 we used functional responses derived from our field measurements of abundance with depth for each size class and trophic level to populate the stream the abundance estimates were multiplied by the average mass of size classes to obtain biomass estimates j m 2 respiration was modeled as a function of size class and trophic level and temperature which changed only 3 during the study productivity was modeled as a function of respiration eqs 16 19 humphreys 1979 see also brown et al in press we did not measure production as part of our initial data collection or collect data on the many variables normally used to calculate production therefore we used the humphreys equations which were derived from multiple data sets of various animals to estimate production stocks and flows for the 1 km transect 7000 m2 of wetted area were obtained by multiplying the model outputs by the area of each grid cell 25 m2 to convert stocks and flows to mean per m2 over the entire stretch to facilitate comparison with other studies the total stream estimate was divided by 7000 m2 the total invertebrate production was then compared to total fish respiration energy availability versus energy need to test whether allen s paradox existed on september 8 2012 in little sandy creek specific procedures for field data and model calculations follow listed as numbered steps in ascending order by trophic level or energy hierarchy for stocks then flows 2 3 3 sunlight we used two steps to obtain hourly estimates of par corrected for shading see tables d1 2 in the appendix to estimate the percent of sunlight transmission at each chamber we took the mean par measured at a benthic chamber over the course of the day and divided by mean par observed at the unshaded hill at corresponding times step 1 subsequently to estimate the amount of light reaching each benthic chamber at every hour of the day we multiplied the percent transmission calculated for each chamber by the observed values measured at the hill over the course of the day step 2 step 1 estimate percent transmission of sunlight at each benthic chamber 1 transbc mparbc mparhill where mpar is mean photosysnthetically active radiation

78 divided by the number of joules per kj 1000 the ratio of watts per μmol was obtained through light measurements taken simultaneously at little sandy creek using a pyranometer w m 2 and a quantum μmol m 2 s 1 light sensor 2 3 4 whole stream metabolism we calculated whole stream metabolism using the 2 station diel curve method described in hall and moll 1975 we adjusted our open water dissolved oxygen measurements for diffusion of oxygen from or to the atmosphere as a function of the o2 saturation deficit at the ambient water temperature of a measurement interval step 1 and calculated the diffused quantity of oxygen per volume of stream step 2 the average travel time between sites was roughly 30 min we calculated the rate of do change between sites based on travel time and then adjusted for an estimate of the oxygen that had been lost or gained by diffusion step 3 we converted the diffusion corrected rates of oxygen changes to kj per square meter table 3a and summed hourly values to get estimated daily production and respiration step 4 we took interpolated respiration ideally just before sunrise and just after sunset hall and moll 1975 and calculated daytime gross photosynthesis gpp from daytime nep measurements the sum of respiration and gpp values for each hour were adjusted for the measurement interval to obtain a daily total we then multiplied values by average stream depth to convert from volume to area step 4 step 1 calculate saturation values at water temperature of each measurement 3 s mg o2 l 1 14 652 0 41001 t 0 0079910 t2 0 000077774 t3 where s represents saturation value for oxygen in water and t represents temperature mead 2007 step 2 calculate the saturation deficit and change in oxygen per hour via diffusion 4 sat do s 5 dvol k 1 sat

the median depth between sample sites totgpp and totresp are the summed daily total gross photosynthesis and respiration respectively see fig 5a and b 2 3 5 benthic community metabolism we derived a rate of metabolic flow for each measurement interval at each benthic chamber and converted this rate from g o2 m 3 to kj m 2 metabolism was converted from g o2 to joules by multiplying by a conversion factor of 3 5 kcal g 1 o2 from hall and moll 1975 and by 4 184 kilojoules kcal 1 table 3a the conversion from volume to area is adapted from mead 2007 and hall et al 1979 table 3a this was done by multiplying by the volume of water between the substrate and the lid of the benthic chamber and dividing by the area of the chamber effectively this is the same as multiplying by height of water between the substrate and the lid of the benthic chamber we plotted data to test functional relations between benthic metabolism depth and sunlight metabolism was plotted as a function of sunlight estpar for each chamber fig b1 2 in the appendix we fit a michaelis menten regression for nbp as a function of solar intensity step 3 step 1 calculate the rate of change of do for each benthic chamber

the curve should be for values above the nighttime respiration value not above zero fig b1 and b5 in the appendix the michaelis menten gpp max parameter was fit in excel using the solver function to minimize sum of square residuals for michaelis menten functions ks is set to 200 w m 2 respiration is set to the average negative do change at night step 4 develop functional relations for primary production gppmax and respiration with depth we did not find statistically significant correlations with depth in the benthic chambers see figure b4 in appendix therefore in the model gpp and resp were set to averages of data measured in forest and riffle sections to extrapolate benthic community metabolism to the entire stream values reported per m2 were multiplied by area 3850 m2 in the forest and 3150 m2 in the meadow 2 3 6 stocks of benthic invertebrates and fish stocks biomass per square meter of benthic invertebrates and fish were collected quantitatively as a function of depth and expressed as grams and joules per square meter we subdivided mass measurements for each sample of benthic invertebrates and fish by trophic level and size class to tabulate field data we summed the mass of individuals within each size class and trophic level from a given sample site we plotted abundance and subsequent biomass with depth for each size class of each trophic level from these plots we derived linear functions with depth so that the number of individuals was modeled as a function of depth in the model we calculated mass of each size class within each trophic level by multiplying the number of individuals in each size class by the average mass of an individual of a size class in that trophic level step 1 for both field data and model results mass was converted from grams to joules per square meter by multiplying the estimated dry mass g of the sub sample by its energy density cal g 1 cummins and wuycheck 1971 an expansion factor to correct for sampling efficiency and sample area step 2 table 1 total trophic level biomass was determined by summing all biomass estimates for each size class step 3 for field data see table 1 for model results see table 7 steps 1 through 3 were done for each sample of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish step 1 calculate the mass for each size class 13 mass tl sc numtl sc indmasstl sc where mass tl sc is the total mass g of a size class sc in each trophic level tl numtl sc is the number of individuals in the size class within each trophic level in a sampled area and indmasstl sc is the midpoint mass g of the size class of that trophic level step 2 convert size class mass to energy per square meter 14 bm m2 tl sc mass tl sc edens expfact area where bm is biomass j m 2 mass tl sc is the mass of a size class g edens j g 1 is mean energy density of that particular trophic group area m2 is s area sampled expfact no units is an expansion factor which is equal to the inverse of the sampling efficiency table 1 energy density is calculated by converting from grams of dry weight to joules using the appropriate values cal g 1 from cummins and wuycheck 1971 multiplied by 4 184 j cal 1 tables 2 3a and 3b for benthic invertebrate samples the area of the pib sampler was approximately 0 1 m2 and we assumed 100 percent sampling efficiency pollard and kinney 1979 therefore our expansion factor for benthic macroinvertebrates was equal to 10 the area of the fish sample sites varied table 4 thus we used the seber le cren method seber and le cren 1967 to derive a mean expansion factor of 3 1 table c in appendix the fish biomass of each sample was multiplied by 0 2 wet to dry biomass conversion to correct for wet weight before converting to joules see table 1 step 3 calculate total trophic level biomass expressed in energy units 15 bm m2 tl bm m2 tl sc where bm m2 tl sc is the value for each individual size class within a trophic level derived in eq 14 and bm m2 tl is the summation of size classes within a trophic level 2 3 7 energy flows of benthic invertebrates and fish for benthic invertebrates and fish the rate of energy use by each trophic level was derived in the same fashion as biomass values with the following exception metabolism is very strongly related to organism size and the size of our organisms varied widely to gain more precise estimates of respiration for a given trophic level it was necessary to break our benthic invertebrate and fish data into size classes using size classes allowed us to quantify and model respiration to represent the frequency distribution of body sizes within each trophic level size specific metabolism was derived for individuals of each size class and trophic level based on field derived respiration relations with size eq 16 is the respiration equation used in the model for benthic invertebrates and fish in addition to our own field measurements fish respiration was calculated using the generalized wisconsin bioenergetics model kitchell et al 1977 to supplement our limited field data r rmax a rr s c where r is respiration in g o2 g 1 fish day 1 r max is maximum respiration a is an activity parameter to specify respiration rates above standard kitchell et al 1977 rr is an intermediate respiration calculation s is the specific dynamic action coefficient and c is consumption see table e in the appendix for specifics stream temperature is used in calculating both rmax and rr fish size mass is used to calculate rmax and c thus fish respiration will vary based on both the stream temperature and the fish size we used the little sandy creek stream temperature and the mass of our sampled fish in these calculations the determination of production is a very complex and time intensive process requiring far more information than we had fortunately we were able to implement humphreys 1979 general relation between respiration and production for both invertebrates and fish step 3 step 1 calculate respiration by size class and trophic level 16 resp tl sc g day 1 respfuncttl sc indmass tl sc numtl sc where respfuncttl sc is the respiration rate per gram body mass for a given size class sc and trophic level tl indmasstl sc is the midpoint mass of the size class numtl sc is the number of individuals in the size class within each trophic level in a sampled area for fish a conversion factor derived from the wisconsin bioenergetics model described above was used to set respfunct tl sc for each size class and trophic level for all invertebrates functional relations from incubated invertebrate samples were used we tested several fits in our sensitivity analysis ultimately we used the following in our model respfunct tl sc g m 2 g 1 day 1 0 039 indmass tl sc 0 0446 the wisconsin model and our field calculations were generally quite close except for the largest fish see fig 8 for data step 2 convert respiration values to energy used per square meter per unit time 17 resp tl sc j m 2 day 1 resptl

conversion factor for mass of oxygen to energy in joules see below or table 3b step 3 sum all respiration expressed as energy for each trophic level 18 resptl tot resp tl sc where resptl sc is the respiration rate for each individual size class within a trophic level per unit area derived in step 1 and resptl tot is the summation of respiration of size classes within a trophic level step 4 calculate production from respiration using humphreys equation 19 prod tl sc 10 log resp m2tl sc prodcons prodcons2 where prodtl sc is the production rate for each individual size class within a trophic level per unit area j m 2 day 1 log resptl sc is the log of the respiration derived in step 2 prodcons is a productivity constant from humphreys 1979 and prodcons2 is the second productivity constant from humphreys 1979 prodcons is 0 978 for invertebrates and 0 834 for fish prodcons2 is 0 06 for invertebrates and 0 429 for fish for our data set the humphreys 1979 equation finds that production is about 75 of respiration for invertebrates and about 12 for fish 3 results 3 1 overview we display modeled stocks e g biomass and flows e g energy movement through trophic levels in little sandy creek using an odum energy circuit diagram odum 1983 fig 3 the outputs indicate that during our study the little sandy creek ecosystem was primarily fueled by both the sun and internally derived production with a much smaller amount of energy coming from allochthonous material we found that similar to terrestrial systems stocks and flows of energy declined with each ascending trophic level note that all data are presented in their original form usually grams per square meter and then extrapolated to the entire one kilometer stream reach using functional relations with depth and units of joules this is important because there are many more shallow areas than deep locations in the study reach the result of model extrapolation and range of model uncertainty does not support the operation of allen s paradox in little sandy creek the data we collected on september 8 2012 imply that the benthic macroinvertebrate production appears to be sufficient to support the fish energy requirements fig 9 and table 7 details follow 3 2 sunlight the sunlight fluctuated throughout the 24 h period and the intensity was generally very low compared to a typical day in early september fig 4 we recorded that the hill site 100 transmission of available par received a total of 4640 kj m 2 day 1 the meadow section which had an area of 3150 m2 received about 63 of available par at the stream surface the forest section had an area of 3850 m2 and received about 28 of available par at the stream surface over the course of the day meadow transects received about 2900 kj m 2 day 1 or 9200 mj in total for the km reach while forested stream transects received about 1300 kj m 2 day 1 or 5000 mj in total fig 3 sunlight inputs did not vary significantly between riffles and pools 3 3 whole stream metabolism the two station or free water fw analysis indicates that gross photosynthesis gpp was higher in the meadow than in the forest in the meadow nep followed a bell shaped pattern gross photosynthesis peaked in the early afternoon fig 5d in the meadow the integrated respiration over 24 h was 46 kj m 2 day 1 and the integrated gross photosynthesis was 93 kj m 2 day 1 in the forest gpp of the stream was variable during daytime we observed a peak in the late morning fig 5h gpp fell to zero in the cloudy early afternoon then rose above zero briefly in the late afternoon in the forest the integrated respiration was 80 kj m 2 day 1 and the integrated gross photosynthesis was 31 kj m 2 day 1 the nep gpp minus respiration over 24 h was 47 kj m 2 day 1 3 2 g o2 m 2day 1 in the meadow and 49 kj m 2 day 1 3 3 g o2 m 2day 1 in the forest table 5 from the results of the two station analysis we estimated the respiration gpp and nep in for the wetted area meadow and forest sections of little sandy creek table 5 community respiration was 354 mj day 1 in the forest and 169 mj day 1 in the meadow 523 mj day 1 for all of little sandy creek gpp in the forest was 138 mj day 1 and at 339 mj day 1 in the meadow 477 mj day 1 for all of little sandy creek thus based on the two station analysis we estimate that the total nep in little sandy creek on the day of our study was 46 0 mj day 1 which is very close to zero 3 4 benthic community metabolism estimated daily metabolism for the benthic chambers are given in table 4 benthic metabolism was highly variable fig b1 and b2 in appendix standard deviation was calculated to be about 40 of our mean estimates for gpp and about 50 for our estimates of respiration production showed little relation to sunlight intensity above minimum levels across all chambers even on a cloudy day when our data were primarily collected figs b1 b2 and b5 the nbp and respiration inside of the benthic chambers had no significant correlation with depth after adjusting for outliers table 5 compares per square meter and stream section estimates of primary production between free water and benthic chamber analyses average gpp from the benthic chamber analysis was slightly higher though not significantly in the meadow than in the forest table 5 we plotted gpp max and respiration for each chamber versus depth of chambers step 4 and sunlight transmission see values in table 4 but there was no significant linear relation between gpp and depth or sunlight therefore the analysis of functional relations with depth and sunlight have been excluded from our results to the model benthic community on the day of september 8th 2012 we used averages from the meadow and forest chambers table 5 and extrapolated them to the entire stream yielding gpp of 119 mj day 1 and respiration of 130 mj day 1 3 5 benthic invertebrate and fish stocks biomass and abundance of macroinvertebrates differed between riffles and pools and was largely dependent on stream depth in general greater biomass and abundance for a given trophic level were found in riffles compared to pools table 4 fig 6 the number and biomass of invertebrates per square meter was much greater in shallower environments while the pattern of fish abundance with depth was variable table 4 however the larger fish and hence the largest total biomass were found exclusively in pools while smaller fish were found in all areas but were more abundant in shallower sample sites the taxa of biota sampled in little sandy creek and their trophic level designations are listed in table b in the appendix size class designations for invertebrates and fish are shown in table f in the appendix fish biomass in each location was largely dependent on the depth of the sample site fig 7 fish number was greatest in the pool riffle location transect 25 however fish in this location transect 25 were significantly smaller than fish sampled in pool locations transects 22 and 34 the total mass of fish in transect 25 was smaller than the total masses of transects 22 and 34 insectivores sampled in the pool riffle had the greatest abundance 288 fish piscivores were absent in riffle locations transects 33 and 20 mixotrophs were also absent from transect 20 and had the lowest overall biomass see table 4 for additional results 3 6 other stocks while our study did not address the issue of upstream inputs of detritus directly it does appear there is roughly twice as much respiration as photosynthesis this means that about half the energy that is running through the stream came from sources other than photosynthesis similar to what hall 1972 found for new hope creek specifically we measured averages of 30 open canopy to 50 closed canopy g m 2 day 1 530 880 kj m 2 day 1 of allochthonous material input fig 3 which is comparatively higher that other lotic systems although similar to one autumn value see table g in appendix we did not measure other inputs e g terrestrial invertebrates or the meiofauna found within the interbed of the stream 3 7 benthic invertebrate and fish energy flows for each trophic level invertebrate respiration and production were greater in riffles compared to pools table 6 insectivores demonstrated the greatest overall respiration 48 6 kilojoule m 2 day 1 in riffles as well as the greatest variation in respiration and production between riffles and pools average respiration was 1 16 kilojoule m 2 day 1 in pool habitats the per unit mass respiration of fish measured decreased with mass the range was 0 05 g g 1 day 1 for a 3 3 g fish to 0 001 g g 1 day 1 for a 108 5 g fish on a log log scale the respiration slope of the trendline of all the fish when calculated using the wisconsin bioenergetics model equations was slightly higher than the trend found for our field measurements fig 8 mixotrophs had the lowest overall respiration rates averaging 449 j m 2 day 1 with a minimum of 6 5 j m 2 day 1 insectivores had the highest overall respiration and the greatest range of respiration rates interestingly the two riffle transects 33 and 25 had the highest insectivore respiration 696 j m 2 day 1 and 3394 j m 2 day 1 respectively in contrast piscivorous fish had higher respiration rates in deeper waters than in the riffle as production is calculated using respiration similar trends were found see table 6 for additional results 3 8 synthesis and extrapolation to entire reach depths within our study reach of little sandy creek were skewed towards shallower depths i e riffles were much more abundant in the stream than pools since we defined abundance of organisms in trophic levels and size classes by depth our integration over the full one km area and the simulations resulted in greater biomass of trophic levels that were found more frequently in riffles and lower biomass of trophic levels that were generally found in pools this is one reason that our invertebrate production values are large relative to fish consumption for the entire stream section the respective biomass respiration and production of the trophic levels of the entire length of little sandy creek are detailed in table 7 stocks of benthic invertebrates e g biomass were much larger than stocks of fish production generally decreased with ascending trophic level table 7 the total respiration of invertebrates and fish in little sandy creek was estimated to be about 205 mj day 1 3 9 allen s paradox the calculations and the model results do not support the existence of allen s paradox in little sandy creek as noted above we found that shallow depths comprised the vast majority of the study reach with relatively few deep pools fig 2 when the relations between fish and invertebrate abundance with depth were extrapolated across the entire reach we found that modeled benthic invertebrate production was about the same as modeled insectivorous fish respiration table 7 and fig 9 overall in stream invertebrate production of 79 mj day 1 38 or 34 mj appears to be sufficient to support fish respiration needs of 93 mj day 1 60 or 25 mj within the uncertainty of the data and analysis given an 80 assimilation efficiency for fish the macroinvertebrate production is enough to supply 68 of the insectivorous fish needs however during model sensitivity tests we found that changing the type of function e g power versus log linear for invertebrate respiration versus individual mass fig 8 resulted in estimates of invertebrate production that were up to three times higher or three times lower than our final best estimate these uncertainties highlight the difficulty of quantifying allen s paradox 4 discussion this entire exercise and corresponding class exercises was meant to serve as an introduction to systems ecology and more generally quantitative environmental science as such we the students were really surprised at its effectiveness in preparing us for later quantitative life the preparation of a real manuscript was especially effective in teaching us how to do real quantitative science we cannot emphasize enough the difference between reading about models and generating one from one s own data this plus the uncertainty in our estimation of invertebrate and fish metabolism used to test allan s paradox highlight the importance of having the modelers gain an intimate understanding of how data is collected and the types of error associated with the methods used for this reason we believe that it is crucial that modelers participate directly in the planning and collection of data from field studies in addition we believe that the basic methods given here serve as a template for more comprehensive and rigorous studies of stream ecosystem energy flow should that be of research interest energy is the common denominator for all metabolic and ecological processes hall 1972 with standard conversions from published literature we converted our biomass respiration and production values to energy units which allowed us to compare between trophic levels and to test allen s paradox we built unit conversion tables tables 4 so that others can easily convert to energy units with standard stream ecology data these estimates may not be precise but we believe that the order of magnitude of differences among trophic level values makes our analysis robust enough for the conclusions we draw it was unrealistic to undertake enough sampling in a few days to utilize robust statistics with our data hence rather than report elaborate statistical analyses we examined the data we obtained in 2012 with data from other years and from mead 2007 the results indicate that the data for 2012 were generally within the range of values collected by other systems ecology classes figs 12 and 13 and table 8 and mead 2007 fig 10 these values were not sufficiently different to negate our conclusions using sensitivity analysis specific comparisons are given by taxon below further the methodologies used in this study are relatively simple and more robust methodologies exist to quantify stream ecosystem metabolism see huryn et al 2014 for example 4 1 sunlight we measured par at each benthic chamber periodically to obtain functional responses with photosynthesis because par was not measured at regular frequent intervals at the chambers we did not have a sunlight measurement for each benthic chamber reading instead we assumed sunlight in the stream was proportional to sunlight measured at the hill and a shading factor eq 1 was used to estimate sunlight the use of a single shading factor eliminated the possibility of characterizing shading at different times of the day to eliminate this source of uncertainty in future studies sunlight estimates at each chamber could be improved by setting up solar flux meters to take regular readings in the areas of the stream near the benthic chambers if monitoring equipment is limited then the benthic chamber team should be given a solarimeter and the solar flux measurements should be taken hourly at each chamber at the time do readings are being recorded 4 2 whole stream metabolism for the entire stream the integrated 24 h net benthic production nbp estimate from the benthic chamber analysis of 11 mj day 1 was lower than the net ecosystem production nep estimate from the free water analysis of 46 mj day 1 table 5 both net production estimates were close to zero which indicates that the stream used about the same amount of energy on the day of our study as it produced free water estimates for gpp and respiration were about 2 6 times greater than benthic chamber estimates fig 10 similarities in trends between the metabolism estimates from the meadow and the forest in conjunction with observed weather patterns indicate a general agreement between the free water and benthic chamber analyses despite this difference nep and nbp were generally above zero during the day in the morning and late afternoon where there was higher sunlight transmission the negative daytime nep and nbp values are indicative of the compounding effects of low light transmission due to tree cover and heavy clouds which limited photosynthetic activity on the day of our study low or negative nep is typical of partially shaded temperate stream ecosystems such patterns have been observed by hall 1972 bott et al 1997 mulholland et al 2001 and others according to hall 1972 and bunn and davies 2000 the primary control on gpp in many streams tends to be riparian zone vegetation where a closed tree canopy during the warm season tends to reduce gpp young and huryn 1999 this was consistent with our study as the gpp estimated in the meadow from the two station analysis 6 5 g o2 m 2 day 1 was greater than in the forest 2 25 g o2 m 2 day 1 the gpp estimates from the free water analysis for the meadow and the forest had a similar range to mead s 2007 findings for open canopy and closed canopy samples sites fig 10 however the meadow gpp was particularly high we observed some very high oxygen concentrations during the day do values were above 10 0 g o2 m 3 at site 2 between 12 30 and 18 30 which was more than 10 above oxygen saturation we are not sure why the do concentration was so high in the water column in the afternoon the heavy rains and wind and our use of a diffusion constant of 1 0 g m 2 h 1 at 100 saturation which has been found as an approximate value in other streams churchill et al 1962 hall 1972 have all contributed to the uncertainty of the free water analysis wind and heavy rain can create surface turbulence which reduces the laminar layer of the stream air interface leading to increases the rate of diffusion however for obvious practical reasons we were unable to quantify the influence of any of these physical forces on do concentrations in little sandy creek nonetheless the data from the free water analysis gives a rough representation of what occurred september 8 2012 4 3 benthic community metabolism the estimated nbp over the entire 24 h study period was negative the sunlight was barely sufficient to generate positive oxygen changes in both the free water and benthic chambers however it appears that at about 100 200 j m 2 s 1 210 420 μmol m 2 s 1 oxygen production did not increase with increasing sunlight fig b1 in appendix while there is a lot of scatter in the sunlight data collected by students the basic results are similar to those of more professional analyses of little sandy creek see mead 2007 the low amounts of sunlight and heavy rain received during our study helps to explain the very low levels of gpp benthic chambers are also known to reduce productivity due to insufficient water turbulence hall et al 1979 the effect of highly variable conditions with variable sun flecks especially in the shaded woods and probably somewhat inexperienced investigators are apparent in the widely scattered data figs b1 b2 and b5 in appendix we compared adjusted gpp data for the meadow and the forest from 2012 with mead s 2007 more abundant and presumably more sophisticatedly derived data fig 10 our mean adjusted gpp ranged from 0 96 g m 2 day 1 in forest chambers to 1 07 g m 2 day 1 the meadow chambers our estimates from the benthic chamber analysis were on the low end of values reported by mead 2007 who estimated gpp of about 1 g m 2 day 1 in shaded pools and 4 5 g m 2 day 1 in non shaded riffles in august and october the agreement between mead s 2007 benthic chamber data and our 2012 data is satisfying given the low level of sunlight that reached the stream on sept 9 2012 shown on fig 4 the gpp estimates from 2012 are close to what is typically observed in closed to semi closed canopy stream ecosystems at similar latitudes in an inter biome comparison of streams across the united states mulholland et al 2001 found gpp rates between 0 1 and 2 0 g m 2 day 1 in six closed and semi closed canopy streams roberts et al 2007 found gpp rates of about 1 g m 2day 1 in a forested reach of the walker branch in tennessee we suspect that there may have been faulty seals on certain chambers which would have reduced both positive nbp and negative respiration measurements of o2 change the benthic chambers were made of a pink or blue opaque plastic and the walls of the chambers were generally raised between 10 and 30 cm above the stream surface photosynthesis in the benthic chambers could have been reduced due to shading and ambient light reduction caused by the container walls hence it is likely that both respiration and production were underestimated by the benthic chamber analysis using clear chambers and better materials to seal the chamber lids and a more comprehensive sampling procedure could improve the accuracy of benthic chamber measurements nevertheless the general similarities between trends in the benthic chamber data free water data and values from the literature indicate that our findings were roughly representative of the activity of the benthic primary producers in little sandy creek the true primary productivity rates likely fall between the benthic metabolism and two station analysis estimates 4 4 benthic invertebrate and fish stocks benthic invertebrate biomass in lotic ecosystems can be highly variable both spatially and temporally merritt et al 2008 mead 2007 although cummins 1973 mentions that in temperate freshwater ecosystems biomass of aquatic macrobenthic animals is generally consistent we found for both our own samples and those summarized by mead 2007 that there was a general pattern of greater benthic invertebrate biomass in shallower faster water and less biomass at deeper locations we found the biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates in little sandy creek to be roughly comparable with similar stream ecosystems for example griffith et al 1994 found shredder detritivore biomass ranged from 1 19 g m 2 to 3 77 g m 2 in west virginia streams in comparison detritivore biomass in little sandy creek ranged from 0 1 g m 2 to 1 3 g m 2 the lower values found in little sandy creek might be explained by the limited temporal resolution e g approximately 24 h in which our data were collected thus not capturing seasonal biomass variation in little sandy creek further cummins et al 1966 quantified the biomass of macroinvertebrates in linesville creek a small woodland stream in pennsylvania and found predators to have the highest proportional biomass 40 9 while herbivores composed a smaller percentage 31 8 one might predict that little sandy creek trophic levels would be organized in a relatively similar manner e g proportional biomasses for specific trophic levels between systems given that both are found in similar geographic settings with forested riparian habitat however our results indicate that herbivores and detritivores dominate the benthic invertebrate biomass in little sandy creek comprising greater than 90 of the total community whereas predator insectivore biomass was less than 1 differences in trophic level biomass between little sandy creek and the community described by cummins et al 1966 suggest that different forcing functions and mechanisms across systems may be affecting how trophic levels are organized with the pib sampler we could not sample anything deeper than the top of the net frame approximately 0 5 m a quantitative sample of benthic invertebrates in the area of the frame must operate close to 100 percent sampling efficiency this means we did not account for benthic invertebrates inhabiting the deepest portions of the stream when we extrapolated these data into the depths included in our model we assumed that the trend of benthic invertebrate biomass would continue at deeper depths we found herbivores were the most abundant trophic level amongst benthic macroinvertebrates while herbivore detritivores e g filterers were the least abundant note that in previous years filtering benthic macroinvertebrates e g hydropsychidae dominated the invertebrate community contrary to the data collected in 2012 this may be related to the temporal variation in available suspended food particles present in little sandy creek where reduced litter fall limits filterer populations and or higher abundance of benthic algae support a greater number of herbivores e g scrapers we compared our results to those from the 2011 and 2013 systems ecology class and found that in 2012 a much greater number of benthic invertebrates were collected fig 11 see table h1 3 in the appendix for raw data generally benthic invertebrate biomass and abundance varied by depth across the three years analyzed our results indicated that open meadow riffles had the greatest total abundance fig 11 and table 8 however there was not an overall significant difference between habitat types fig 11 and table 8 invertebrates collected by students in 2011 2013 ranged from 0 1 g m 2 in open pools to 9 g m 2 in open riffles table 8 in september 2003 simulated benthic invertebrate biomass average 1 8 g m 2 see fig 13 on page 108 in mead 2007 this was smaller than the average of the 2011 2013 biomass 2 3 g m 2 but well within the range of our data note that the actual total invertebrate mass from 2013 is higher than reported here as mass was recorded for only select trophic levels it is possible that the 2012 benthic invertebrate community structure was an aberration compared to other years indicated by higher abundance values relative to 2011 and 2013 fig 11 and table 8 there were various factors that could have reduced the effectiveness of our fish measurements fish were collected with the use of an electro shocker in blocked off cross sections of the stream the seber le cren method used for analysis gives an expansion factor that corrects for these potential errors we have attempted to quantify how the inclusion of second pass data would have affected our results since we used a combination of two factors mass and abundance to determine whether our sample size had decreased from the first pass to the second we had several estimates of sampling efficiency see table c which we combined for expanding abundance and biomass from each location we found our fish density data 2 02 fish m 2 to be comparable with similar stream ecosystems for example angermeier and smogor 1995 found density was approximately 1 95 fish m 2 in jordan creek in virginia and density ranged from 0 1 to 3 2 fish m 2 in the sedgeunkedunk stream in maine gardner et al 2013 gardner et al 2013 additionally found average fish biomass ranged from approximately 1 0 g m 2 to 18 0 g m 2 in two streams in maine compared to gardner et al 2013 fish biomass in little sandy creek had a much larger range from 0 7 g m 2 to 29 8 g m 2 though the area weighted average 17 g m 2 was similar furthermore we compared our results to those from the systems ecology classes in 2011 and 2013 see table i1 5 for raw data fish abundance was similar for all size classes in all three years 2011 2013 with the exception of the small 2 1 30 g size class fig 12a c the abundance of fish of any given size in a location is strongly related to stream depth small fish are more abundant in shallower areas while the largest fish are found almost exclusively in deeper areas overall the largest number of fish caught in little sandy creek was in the 2 1 30 g range fish in this size class were found primarily in the middle depths between 0 35 0 65 m fig 12b relatively few fish were caught in any given year in the largest size class 100 1 g fig 12c given the relation between fish size and the depth of capture the total mass of fish caught in 2012 and 2013 increased with an increase in stream depth fig 13 4 5 benthic invertebrate and fish energy flows benthic invertebrate respiration estimates were conducted using several invertebrate taxa of different sizes to generate functional relations these simple measurements demonstrated what is well known in physiology that smaller individuals consumed more oxygen per gram of weight than larger individuals for example a 1 0 mg macroinvertebrate consumed approximately 35 μg o2 hr 1 which is in agreement with literature estimates summarized in mead s 2007 little sandy creek study while a 4 mg macroinvertebrate consumed oxygen at a slower rate approximately 4 5 μg o2 hr 1 we compared our in situ benthic invertebrate respiration values to those measured by rostgaard and jacobsen 2005 and found comparable respiration rates for example the respiration of stoneflies in little sandy creek at 20 c was measured at 4 57 mg o2 g 1 h 1 while rostgaard and jacobsen 2005 found a respiration rate across all taxa sampled 87 individuals at 20 c to be 4 89 mg o2 g 1 h 1 the general functional relations from our in situ measurements were subsequently used to estimate respiration of size classes of each trophic level for the benthic invertebrate community sampled in the stream and respiration rates were converted to generate production estimates as energy is consumed a proportion will be used to maintain metabolic functioning of the individual with the remaining energy generally utilized for growth and reproduction i e production humphreys 1979 demonstrated that a greater proportional production is observed as respiration increases up to an organism s temperature optimum in other words as the respiration of an individual increases the difference between respiration and production also increases due to a greater amount of total energy available for growth assuming food is unlimited we estimated fish respiration in the field using fish of varying sizes from different taxa these data were then used to generate functional relations however due to inappropriate container size along with questionable seals the respiration data were not successful for all of the species sampled thus we used the wisconsin bioenergetics model refer to equations in table e of the appendix as our primary method of calculating fish respiration rates per gram of fish and to generate functional relations to use in the little sandy creek system model we subsequently compared our field results to those from the wisconsin bioenergetics model output variability in fish respiration from 2 to 3400 j m 2day 1 see fig 8 and table 6 in little sandy creek was primarily a function of fish mass nonetheless it seems likely that fish species and the depth of measurement also caused small amounts of variability in fish respiration the constants in the wisconsin bioenergetics model equations vary by fish species thus contributing to some of the variability in respiration in addition respiration and production of aquatic animal populations can vary depending on activity environmental stress such as oxygen levels food availability and stream temperature warren and doudoroff 1971 the fish respiration rates we measured in the field were similar to the results produced by the wisconsin bioenergetics model for similar sized fish fig 8 our field results were also comparable to those in the literature for example beauchamp et al 1989 found that the respiration of juvenile sockeye salmon in babine lake canada was approximately 0 04 g g 1 day 1 see fig 4 in beauchamp et al 1989 in september slightly less than the maximum fish respiration we measured in the field 0 05 g g 1 day 1 further kitchell et al 1977 reported simulated yellow perch respiration rates ranging from approximately 1 mg o2 g 1 day 1 in early september to 7 5 mg o2 g 1 day 1 in late september by comparison our field measurements of fish respiration ranged from 0 24 mg o2 g 1 day 1 to 50 mg o2 g 1 day 1 fig 8 while there was a large range of respiration values in the modeled little sandy creek results due to fish of many sizes and types 2 3 163 mg o2 g 1fish day 1 respiration values found in the literature for similar ecosystems generally fall within this range for example the average respiration value for new hope creek was 0 0034 g o2 g 1fish day 1 hall 1972 the rate of oxygen use by the fish community of little sandy creek at location 2 transect 25 which had an average depth of 0 21m was 4 73 cal m 2 day 1 compared to 0 79 cal m 2day 1 in the upstream fish community of new hope creek which had an average depth of 0 28 m hall 1972 however hall 1972 did not report fish respiration as a function of mass so it is difficult to make a direct comparison 4 6 allen s paradox allen s paradox was famously shown to be operating in horokiwi stream new zealand allen 1951 harvey and marti 1993 huryn 1996 allen estimated that fish predation utilized 40 150 times the aquatic macroinvertebrate production allen 1951 williams et al 2003 a much clearer case for allen s paradox than we found benthic invertebrate production must be greater than or equal to fish respiration in order to support the presence of a fish community through time benke 1976 has attributed allen s paradox to inadequate sampling methods for the macroinvertebrate community especially macroinvertebrate secondary production this might also apply in little sandy creek especially due to our exclusion of the hyporheic community which stanford and ward 1993 suggest may be more important in some systems than conventionally sampled benthic invertebrate communities we hypothesized that allen s paradox would be extant in little sandy creek on september 8th 2012 the hypothesis was tested by modeling benthic invertebrate production and fish respiration considering the limitations of our analysis we conclude that allen s paradox was not observed in our study reach although the benthic invertebrate production and fish respiration are similar total benthic invertebrate production 78 mj day 1 uncertainty range 40 113 mj day1 is sufficient to support insectivorous fish respiration 93 mj day 1 uncertainty range 35 117 mj day1 the two outputs generated by the little sandy creek model are not significantly different after considering sensitivity tests and the error estimates of functions used in the extrapolation to the entire stream we can highlight several other important factors that contribute to uncertainty surrounding modeled allen s paradox outputs these factors include additional food sources for fish seasonal and inter annual variability in species abundance and size spatial heterogeneity in the stream such as depth substrate and physical forces benke et al 1988 although there is a large amount of uncertainty surrounding our results when we account for energy transfer between trophic levels there does appear to be enough invertebrate production to support the insectivorous fish respiration needs we did not measure additional potential food sources for fish such as terrestrial insects falling into the stream hyporheic macroinvertebrates or meiofauna huryn 1996 incorporated macroinvertebrate samples from the terrestrial and hyporheic zones into an analysis of allen s paradox in sutton stream in new zealand and found that primary consumer production was greater than that of secondary consumers e g fish thus a surplus of prey production was available to the fish community in sutton stream the link between hyporheic invertebrates to fish production is often overlooked likely due to hyporheic invertebrates being under represented in standard stream benthic sampling waters 1993 huryn 1996 waters 1993 conducted a literature review of allen s paradox and found that in certain streams during certain times of the year ample invertebrate production is present to support to fish energy demand mead s 2007 study in little sandy creek reported that invertebrate biomass and production were highest in september variables such as temperature stream community biomass and composition vary significantly throughout the year respiration rates of all organisms are tightly related to temperature which varies from 0 c to about 25 c in little sandy creek without further modeling and analysis it is difficult to assess how seasonal changes alters the balance of in stream fish respiration and invertebrate production collecting data on a quarterly or even biannual basis would allow students to more adequately address questions that vary on a temporal scale inter annual variability in trophic level abundance and biomass is likely to have affected the magnitude of allen s paradox between 2011 and 2013 fish abundance was not significantly different from 2011 to 2013 fig 12 in 2013 fish mass was higher than in 2012 fig 13 however invertebrate biomass and abundance was much lower table 8 fig 11 which suggests that allen s paradox was in operation in 2013 the 2011data are more ambiguous invertebrate samples from 2012 had high abundances relative to 2011 while total biomass was much lower fig 11 and table 8 this indicates that the 2012 community was comprised of smaller individuals which led to higher estimates of respiration and production given the similar abundance and mass of fish in 2011 and 2012 compared to the relatively low abundance and high biomass of benthic invertebrates in 2011 it is possible that allen s paradox was operating in september of 2011 from annual sampling of the stream by the suny esf systems ecology course plus additional studies from mead 2007 we know that fish and benthic invertebrates have inhabited little sandy creek at roughly similar levels over a long term period however it seems as though interannual invertebrate population changes may be large enough shift the balance of estimate invertebrate production and fish respiration we measured benthic invertebrate biomass and respiration over a very short period of time approximately 24 h and we used a somewhat crude and generalized approach to estimate production an equation from humphreys 1979 with a more robust dataset stronger statistical relations could be developed and the range of model uncertainty be reduced 4 7 a student s perspective what did the field trip and modeling the results teach us the systems ecology course began with an invitation to the students to hypothesize about the various explanations of ecosystem processes we learned that systems ecology was defined by odum 1964 as the structure and function of levels of organization beyond that of the individual and species specifically it is the idea that there is a set of elements connected and related in order to form a whole whose properties are not just those of the component elements but are properties of the whole itself peet 1992 as developing systems thinkers we learned to look for the connections between elements and think about how they impact ecosystem structure we were immersed in process of in class literature discussions hypothesis formation field sampling data analysis deep thinking when our hypotheses were not supported and modeling quantifying stocks and flows in little sandy creek and conceptualizing them in a flow diagram allowed us to learn how the stream operates over much of its length though we examined only individual components in discreet locations within the stream this allowed us to engage in systems thinking and enhance our understanding of little sandy creek specifically how each individual component of the stream contributes to the overall function of the ecosystem such as organic debris imported by rain storms as an energy input to detritivores and ultimately fish ultimately this iterative learning experience left us with humility for the aspects of the ecosystem we didn t immediately understand and or could not capture with our sampling techniques e g nutrient dynamics and a deeper knowledge of stream ecosystems and their complexity this class enlightened us to the utility of formally identifying system components and interactions with observation and modeling and imbued us with a fundamentally different view of the world by learning to look for connections between system components everywhere we go 4 8 teaching systems ecology we have found that students learn about systems thinking and modeling much more concretely when they observe measure and derive relations from a real specific ecosystem rather than abstractions from books or equations from our perspective models are simplifications of complex systems that ideally capture the most important behavior of interest more than twenty years of data have been recorded at little sandy creek which we have come to know as a thriving ecosystem driven by allochthonous energy inputs this has been a result of hard work borrowed equipment good land owner relations and overall extremely low cost of implementation with such copious data archived this systems ecology class can be seen as a mini long term ecological research project it allowed for an enormous amount of student involvement as well as support by many other volunteers the legacy of research on this stream facilitated the development of a state of the art benthic invertebrate model mead 2007 one future possibility is making the entire data set digitally available so that more studies can be performed on this creek in addition many students have indicated that experiencing or watching the use of quantitative methods including winklers stream morphology measurements with meter sticks and meter tapes solarimeters pib invertebrate samples electric fish sampling equipment and so on has equipped them well for later careers in ecology and environmental science then of course taking their field measurements and figuring out how to handle them in spreadsheets and computer modeling gave many a leg up for everything from field positions to environmental ngos to faculty positions our hope is that this paper will be useful as a resource for young scientists in training and teaching tool for early career professors one of the key components of the systems ecology course was in class discussion of papers in ecology the seminar style exercise forced students to be critical of what they read and to think in real time rather than training technicians the goal is to train thinkers this paper reflects the thought pathways dr hall encouraged students to use when thinking about ecosystems we encourage readers of this paper to think not just about how we applied technical approaches in field methods and data analysis but how we have defined the ecosystem in terms of functional components and how this exercise might apply to the ecosystems that each reader studies for those readers who are interested further conceptual development and teaching ecology using a systems approach jørgensen 2012 is a good source to start for the systems ecology class at suny esf dr hall used a compilation of literature including many of the works cited in this paper e g odum 1957 warren and doudoroff 1971 hall 1972 hall and day 1977 odum 1983 as well as lindeman 1942 5 conclusions our original intent for this paper was to describe a very successful but difficult teaching tool for systems thinking and eventually modeling at the suggestion of the editor of this journal we have written it up as a research report and recognize that the modeling approach used here simple functional relations with stream depth are simplified in order to be applied in a semester long course given the lack of sampling experience of most students we are pleased that the results are as good as they are we are also pleased to report that whole ecosystem studies new and exciting when the first author was a graduate student still have a lot to offer in terms of understanding ecology over the last several decades there has been an apparent decline in quantitative ecosystem ecology and an emergence of more defensible sub disciplines within ecology and academics in general as researchers become more specialized gaps in whole system understanding will emerge especially without encouragement of truly interdisciplinary research in academia and funding agencies with ever increasing human impacts and ability to monitor ecosystems it is difficult to conduct actionable science by only looking at a few independent and response variables identifying problems system boundaries developing management strategies and adapting them in a timely fashion can be done only if a comprehensive systems approach is utilized for example warming air temperatures will potentially lead to insufficient energy for fish reproduction which could ultimately affect the fishing industry however the initial impacts of warming air temperature cannot be fully understood without using a systems approach to study the problem our exercise taught students the process of modeling and studying a whole system the one weekend process of collecting data in a small stream allowed students to gain a whole ecosystem perspective and even to test hypotheses by integrating data from different components of the system using a systems approach can lead to many useful and unexpected research outcomes for example by sampling the entire ecosystem we had sufficient data to test allen s paradox even though that was not the initial goal of the systems ecology field trip another useful outcome is that we were able to examine the influence of various forcing functions on our measured ecosystem components we hope that this exercise will encourage other professors or high school teachers to undertake such studies with their own students whether or not the results are eventually

25338,the area of the beijing tianjin hebei jing jin ji region is about 2 25 of china land area but the energy consumption and carbon emission of jing jin ji region account for more than 10 of china s total consumption and emissions to reduce the region s energy consumption and carbon emission we studied energy flow process in this region the previous research on energy flow is concentrated on a single scale with little multi scale integration in this study based on framework of urban metabolism we used ecological network analysis method to study the region s energy metabolism and ecological relationship among nodes at two scales in 3 node and 13 node models of the agglomeration the integral direct indirect energy consumption in the 3 node model first increased then decreased from 2002 to 2010 consumption in the 13 node model first decreased then increased the direct and integral energy flows showed that hebei provided the most energy to beijing in the 3 node network in the 13 node network tangshan provided the most energy to the other 12 cities in terms of the ecological relationships among the nodes the 13 node model showed proportionally more competition relationships than the 3 node model the relationships among beijing tianjin and hebei were dominated by exploitation and control based on the analysis of flow and relationship the importance of multi scale model research is verified which serves different research objectives and helps researchers choose the appropriate scale model under different data acquisition precision and research depth keywords urban energy metabolism ecological network analysis multi scale analysis urban agglomeration jing jin ji 1 introduction as urbanization and industrialization progress urban agglomerations develop and become core areas for the economy and the environment china s beijing tianjin hebei jing jin ji urban agglomeration is one of the world s largest and has therefore attracted much attention from researchers and government managers however as the industrial structures of beijing tianjin and hebei are similar the potential for synergies was low and the region s ecological capacity was limited leading to high ecological and environmental costs and excessively high consumption of energy in 2013 energy consumption in the jing jin ji region was 44 27 106 tce tonnes coal equivalent and accounted for 10 4 of china s energy consumption however energy consumption analyses for urban agglomerations should account for more than just the total consumption they should also identify the provinces or cities that are most responsible for this total four cities together consumed more than half of this total 18 5 for baoding 16 7 for beijing 16 5 for tangshan and 12 5 for handan du et al 2016 this kind of analysis reveals the key locations of energy consumption so that government managers can focus on these locations in an effort to reduce energy consumption and pollutant emission once these key locations are known it becomes possible to trace the flows of energy among them and use a range of techniques to improve our understanding of these flows such an analysis can be conducted at a range of scales for a key agglomeration such as the jing jin ji region from an administrative perspective hebei is a province whereas beijing and tianjin are referred to as provincial scale municipalities because in importance they are equivalent to provinces for simplicity we will refer to beijing and tianjin as provinces hereafter in addition hebei contains several large cities and can thus be subdivided different insights will be obtained from analyzing energy flows at different scales in the present study we demonstrate the effects of scale by treating the jing jin ji region as a single node then separating it into three nodes beijing tianjin and hebei and 13 nodes beijing tianjin and 11 cities within hebei one advantage of this increasing resolution is that it allows us to trace more than just direct flows we can also account for indirect flows that pass through one or more intermediate nodes before arriving at the flow s final destination this approach permits a more comprehensive evaluation of the current status of an urban agglomeration making it possible to develop solutions that will optimize energy use and conservation research on energy flows through an urban agglomeration developed from older research on urban metabolism this research is based on a metaphor in which flows of resources and wastes among regions of the agglomeration can be considered analogous to the metabolic flows in a living organism the concept of an urban metabolism was proposed by wolman 1965 who proposed the concept as a way to analyze the material or energy flows within a single city until recently the boundary of the urban metabolic system remained restricted to a single city where the approach allowed researchers to trace the flows of resources and wastes within that city and between the city and its surrounding environment hashimoto and moriguchi 2004 liang and zhang 2011 liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 however in practice cities are open systems that frequently exchange materials and energy with other cities based on this recognition urban metabolic analysis has been extended to both networks of independent cities and to urban agglomerations and the boundaries include both the cities and the surrounding rural areas that provide food energy or other resources billen et al 2012 barles 2009 studied both the urban area of paris and its surroundings and found that the urban area depended strongly on resource inputs from areas outside the city and also emitted wastes to these areas nonetheless the overall metropolitan area which included rural areas was largely able to sustain itself billen et al 2012 studied 11 european cities including paris london and brussels to analyze the interaction between the cities and their surrounding areas from the perspectives of flows of energy food and water they found strong interdependence between a city and its surrounding areas poruschi 2013 also showed that extending the research boundary beyond that of the city to southeastern queensland australia and considering the external environment provided a more robust framework for economic and environmental analysis to support plans for sustainable regional development kennedy et al 2014 pointed out that the choice of system boundaries strongly influenced the results of such analyses other researchers have focused on urban agglomerations which represent groups of cities that are close together and that are strongly socially or economically connected this permits analyses both at the level of the overall agglomeration and at the level of individual cities baynes and bai 2012 studied direct energy consumption for the metropolitan area of melbourne australia zhang et al 2016a b studied embodied energy flows in the jing jin ji agglomeration marteleira et al 2014 studied water metabolism and recycling for the metropolitan area of lisbon portugal baker et al 2007 studied the transformations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the minneapolis st paul united states metropolitan area heinonen and junnila 2011 studied the carbon metabolism of helsinki and porvoo finland nixon and fulweiler 2012 studied the nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism of narragansett bay united states analyses can also focus on combinations of flows swaney et al 2012 pincetl et al 2014 wang and chen 2016 and environmental impacts gonzález et al 2013 moore et al 2013 garcia montiel et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a b furthermore the analysis can be spatially explicit for example lee et al 2009 combined an analysis of land use and cover types with resource consumption data to identify the resource utilization level of different land uses and several researchers have compared metropolitan areas heinonen and junnila 2011 kennedy et al 2011 rosado et al 2014 such studies can also be conducted at a range of scales for example some chinese scholars have studied metabolic processes at a provincial scale such as the social metabolism of liaoning province xu et al 2008 and the carbon metabolisms of jiangsu province liang and zhang 2011 and of hubei province yang et al 2015a therefore choosing an urban agglomeration as a case study to analyze the interaction among cities at a range of scales seems likely to provide important insights to perform such analyses it s first necessary to identify and quantify the flows of energy and materials input output analysis is commonly used to quantify the interactions among industries it is based on tracing the direct and indirect resource consumption or emission of wastes embodied in consumption processes leontief 1970 miller and blair 2009 to differentiate the impacts of the technologies used to produce primary and intermediate products multi regional input output tables can be established and used to analyze the resource flows among regions and among the sectors in a given region zhang et al 2013 this method is an effective way to trace industrial chains by quantifying the interactions among sectors caused by the resource consumption activities wiedmann 2009 wiedmann et al 2007 this method was first used to analyze the economic linkages among sectors in italy and the united states at a national scale polenske 1980 subsequently the method was extended to analyze virtual water and water footprints feng and hubacek 2015 feng et al 2012 2014 jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2012 zhang and anadon 2014 the impacts of global trade on biodiversity lenzen et al 2012 emission of wastes such as greenhouse gases yu et al 2013 carbon dioxide zhang and tang 2015 so2 prell et al 2014 fine particulate matter lin et al 2014 and total suspended particulate matter yang et al 2015b carbon emission tian et al 2014 material footprints wiedmann et al 2015 agricultural products kastner et al 2011 ecological footprints zhou and imura 2011 energy consumption liang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 and the ecological footprints of multiple materials galli et al 2012 however further insights could be gained from these flows of energy and materials for example it is necessary to study the functional attributes of the components of an urban agglomeration ecological network analysis when combined with multi regional input output analysis can provide important insights into the structural and functional attributes of whole systems or of specific sectors within a system zhang et al 2015a analyzed the energy consumption structure of 28 sectors in beijing from the carbon footprint perspective chen and chen 2015 compared analyses based on material flows input output analysis and ecological network analysis and showed that ecological network analysis provided the clearest insights into the interactions among sectors however each of these approaches provides complementary insights so combining them can produce a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems such as an urban agglomeration system at a regional scale zhang et al 2015b studied the energy metabolic processes of china s 30 provinces and zhang et al 2016c examined these processes for the sectors in single or multiple regions of the jing jin ji urban agglomeration to identify the key actors in different sectors in the present study we used urban metabolism theory to trace the energy flows at three scales in the jing jin ji agglomeration as a single node for the whole region as three nodes beijing tianjin and hebei and as 13 nodes individual cities within the agglomeration the results fill gaps in our data on this large and complex urban agglomeration and in contrast with previous research provided additional insights into the effects of scale on such analyses by abstracting these components of the overall agglomeration into networks we were able to use ecological network analysis to analyze the flows among the components of the system and define their functional and ecological relationships our goals were to provide insights at different network scales ranging from 1 to 13 nodes to identify the functional ecological attributes of the system components and identify the nodes with the highest energy consumption or flows by examining the system across multiple scales we obtained different perspectives on the flows thereby providing more comprehensive guidance for plans to reduce energy consumption and waste emission throughout the agglomeration 2 methods 2 1 the multi scale metabolic network model we choose the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration as a case study so we could establish a framework that included all key metabolic actors in the agglomeration across a range of scales fig 1 shows the resulting multi scale framework used in this paper we defined the scales of network model illustrated in fig 1 by defining the nodes used at each scale and the paths among the nodes in each network here nodes represent the three provincial scale cities beijing tianjin and hebei and 13 cities beijing tianjin and 11 cities in hebei the paths among these nodes represent the energy flows embodied in the exchanges of resources between pairs of nodes 2 2 data used we obtained the data used in this research from the 2003 2008 and 2010 china energy statistical yearbooks bureau of energy statistics of national bureau of statistics and from the china emission accounts and datasets web site http www ceads net we also obtained multi regional monetary input output tables for 2002 shi and zhang 2012 2007 liu et al 2012 and 2010 liu et al 2014 to standardize the data to account for the different kinds of energy that are used in the study area we used standard tonnes of coal equivalent tce coefficients to convert the different energy units into consistent tce units combining multi regional monetary input output tables with the energy consumption data for each sector for each scale of node agglomeration province or city lets us calculate the associated direct energy consumption coefficient for each sector zhang et al 2014 details of the equilibrium equations are provided in section 3 1 of zhang et al 2014 based on the calculations in that paper we obtained the following equation 1 ε e u ˆ h 1 where ε represents the direct energy coefficient matrix in which the element ε kp represents the k th energy consumption coefficient in sector p e represents the energy consumption matrix for flows that enter or leave the sectors in a given area u ˆ u q p n n where n represents the number of sectors in a given area p and q represent the p th sector and the q th sector respectively when p q uqp xp where xp is the total economic output of sector p when p q uqp 0 h represents the monetary value flow matrix we can then multiply the economic data xp by the corresponding energy coefficient to determine the direct energy flow among provinces or cities in this way the monetary input output table can be converted into a corresponding energy flow table this energy data is the basis for developing a network model of the system which can then be used to calculate the direct metabolic flows the indirect metabolic flows flows that pass through one or more intermediate nodes before reaching their final destination and the integral metabolic flows the sum of the direct and indirect flows 2 3 analysis of direct metabolic flows the direct metabolic flows represent flows between any two nodes when they exchange resources along a path of length 1 i e the flows do not pass through any intermediate nodes the flow from region i to region j is denoted fji and the flows from region j to region i is denoted fij we can define zi and yi as imports into node i from the external environment and the exports from node i to the external environment respectively ti represents the total metabolic flow received by one node from all other nodes and the external environment and this represents the direct consumption of metabolic energy by each node therefore 2 t i n p u t i j 1 n f i j z i 3 t o u t p u t j i 1 n f i j y j 4 t i t i n p u t i j 1 n f i j z i i 1 n f i j y j t o u t p u t j 2 4 analysis of integral metabolic flows integral metabolic flows represent the total of the direct and indirect flows through a node nondimensional input oriented flows from node j to node i g ij are defined as follows li et al 2012 5 g i j f i j t i from the direct flow intensity matrix g g ij the dimensionless integral flow intensity matrix n nij can be calculated using the following convergent power series fath and patten 1999 6 n n i j g 0 g 1 g 2 g 3 g l i g 1 where g 0 is a self feedback matrix that reflects flows that occur within each node g 1 is the energy flux matrix for flows with a path length of 1 between two nodes i e l 1 and because there are no intermediate nodes this represents direct flows g l reflects flows of length l l 2 with at least one intermediate nodes and therefore represents indirect flows between nodes and i represents the identity matrix n represents the nondimensional energy flux between nodes and we can multiply n by the diagonal of the energy input matrix ti from the local environment diag t to obtain the indirect energy transfer flow matrix y 7 y d i a g t n based on the integral flow and direct flow matrices the indirect flows among nodes through paths with a length of 2 or more can be calculated 8 i n d i r e c t y d i a g t f where f represents the direct flow matrix 2 5 utility analysis based on the results of the flow analysis a dimensionless direct utility intensity matrix d can then be computed in which matrix element dij represents the utility of the flows between node j and node i which can be expressed as follows 9 d i j f i j f j i t i from matrix d a dimensionless integral utility intensity matrix u can be computed from the following convergent power series 10 u u i j d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 d l i d 1 where uij represents the integral dimensionless value of dij which is calculated using a leontief inverse matrix fath and patten 1999 d 0 represents the self feedback of flows within each node d 1 represents the utility of the direct flows between any two nodes in the network along a path of length 1 and dl l 1 reflects the indirect flow utility along paths of length l i is the identity matrix we can designate the sign of the utility of any element in u as the relationship utility sign matrix sgn u with suij representing the sign of the utility of the flows from node j to node i from the perspective of node i if suij suji node i exploits node j by analogy with a natural ecosystem this means that node i benefits from the relationship receives more utility than it transfers to node j but node j suffers receives less utility than it transfers to node i if suij suji node i is controlled by node j if suij suji then node i competes with node j leading to negative impacts for both nodes whereas if suij suji the relationship between the two nodes represents mutualism in which both nodes benefit from their interaction if suij suji 0 0 neither node benefits nor suffers as a result of the relationship neutrality therefore there are five ecological relationships among the system s nodes exploitation control competition mutualism and neutrality to quantify the system s overall mutualism status we used a mutualism index m that summarizes the results of the set of all relationships among nodes this index is the ratio of the number of positive signs m to the number of negative signs m in the integral utility intensity matrix u 11 m m m where 12 m i 1 n j 1 n max sgn u i j 0 13 m i 1 n j 1 n min sgn u i j 0 where n equals the number of nodes in the network if m 1 positive signs are more numerous than negative signs which means that relationships with positive utility are more numerous than relationships with negative utility and that the system is predominantly mutualistic the higher the value of m the higher the degree of mutualism in the system in contrast if m 1 relationships with negative utility are more numerous and the system has a low degree of mutualism as network synergism based on the flows of utility can occur in all system models regardless of the size or complexity of the system the overall integral utility u of the system is always greater than 1 fath and patten 1999 we therefore dimensionalized u by pre multiplying it by the diagonalized throughflow vector diag t thereby producing the dimensional integral flow matrix y 14 y d i a g t u we then calculated the dimensional integral utility that is received by each node this integral utility received by each node si can be computed as follows 15 s i j 1 i 1 y i j j i n y i j where yij represents the elements of dimensional integral flow matrix y the integral utility that is created by each type of relationship can be calculated by summing up the integral utility values for all pairs of nodes that exhibit that relationship 3 results 3 1 the node characteristics at each scale our analysis of the node characteristics included the direct energy consumption and the integral energy consumption that results from adding indirect consumption 3 1 1 direct energy consumption the total direct energy consumption for the jing jin ji urban agglomeration increased continually from 2002 to 2010 2002 1 27 108 tce 2007 2 32 108 tce 2010 2 90 108 tce because this analysis provides insufficient resolution to identify possible reasons for the increasing trend we subdivided the agglomeration into three regions beijing tianjin and hebei fig 2 shows the changes within each region the direct energy consumption by hebei was much higher than those of beijing and tianjin in all years in 2002 hebei s direct consumption was 2 37 times that of beijing and 3 44 times that of tianjin in 2007 the gap between hebei and the other cities increased direct consumption in hebei was 3 78 and 4 83 times those in beijing and tianjin respectively and in 2010 the gap increased to 4 69 and 4 23 times respectively however all three regions showed continuous increases in direct energy consumption from 2002 to 2010 the increase was greatest for hebei which reached 2 12 times the 2002 value increasing the resolution provided additional insights fig 3 shows that at the 13 node scale the energy consumption of beijing tianjin tangshan shijiazhuang handan and baoding were greater than those of the other cities in 2002 beijing s consumption was the highest among the 13 cities reaching 3 14 107 tce which was 11 7 times that of hengshui which ranked last in 2007 handan s consumption was highest and the value for hengshui which was the smallest was only 8 4 that of handan the direct energy consumption of all the cities increased from 2002 to 2007 and the increase was fastest for chengde with the value in 2007 equal to 2 59 times that in 2002 beijing s consumption increased most slowly with the 2007 value equal to only 1 33 times that in 2002 in 2010 handan s consumption was still highest from 2007 to 2010 consumption increased for all cities but hengshui s consumption increased fastest to 13 2 times the 2007 value and it ranked second in 2010 compared with last in 2002 and 2007 beijing s consumption increased slowest by only 2 6 from 2007 to 2010 3 1 2 integral energy consumption fig 4 compares the integral energy consumption of beijing tianjin and hebei for each region the integral energy consumption first increased and then decreased the magnitude and rate of the change were greater for hebei than for beijing and tianjin in 2007 hebei s integral consumption was 5 20 times that in 2002 versus increases of only 1 60 times for beijing and 2 18 times for tianjin from 2007 to 2010 integral consumption decreased to 0 97 times the 2007 value for beijing versus 0 77 for tianjin and 0 36 for hebei hebei s integral consumption remained much higher than those of the other cities throughout the study period fig 5 shows the integral energy consumption of the 13 cities from 2002 to 2010 beijing s integral consumption first decreased then increased that of tianjin increased throughout the study period and the other cities all showed an initial increase then a decrease the difference in the trends for beijing and tianjin between the 3 node and 13 node networks is because the integral energy consumption was calculated based on a monetary input output matrix with 13 nodes derived from a matrix with 3 nodes division of the data followed by using ecological network analysis to account for the integral energy flows resulted in different trends at these two scales in 2002 integral consumption was highest for beijing at 2 47 times that of tianjin which ranked second in 2007 tangshan s integral consumption ranked first zhangjiakou which consumed the least energy had integral consumption equal to only 17 4 of that of tangshan in 2010 tianjin s integral consumption was the highest at 6 11 times that of hengshui which ranked lowest 3 2 the path characteristics at each scale the path characteristics include the direct energy flows based on the direct energy coefficient matrix and the integral energy flows along the paths 3 2 1 direct energy flows fig 6 shows the direct energy flows in the 3 node network in 2002 the flow from hebei to beijing was highest at 4 04 106 tce followed by the flows from hebei to tianjin and from beijing to hebei at 79 0 and 75 4 of the flow from hebei to beijing in 2007 the flows from hebei to beijing and tianjin were still highest and also increased greatly they were 2 24 and 2 40 times respectively the flows in 2002 the next highest flows were from tianjin to hebei and from beijing to hebei at 18 2 and 16 3 respectively of the flow from hebei to beijing in 2010 the flow from hebei to beijing was still highest and increased by 14 3 compared with that in 2007 the next highest flow was from hebei to tianjin which decreased from 2007 to 2010 reaching only 86 3 of the 2007 value but it was still higher than the flow from tianjin to beijing fig 7 shows the direct energy flows among the 13 cities in 2002 the direct energy flows among the 13 cities in 2007 and 2010 are shown in figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material the direct energy flows among the cities showed the trend of growth and the flow between tangshan and shijiazhuang was highest in all three years in 2002 the flow was highest from tangshan to shijiazhuang reaching 3 89 106 tce followed by the flow from tangshan to baoding at 69 0 of the flow from tangshan to shijiazhuang in 2007 the direct energy flows among the cities all increased but the highest flow was still from tangshan to shijiazhuang the flow reached 27 56 times that in 2002 the flow from tangshan to handan ranked second at 73 7 of the highest flow in 2010 all the flows increased again and the highest flow was again from tangshan to shijiazhuang it was 1 85 times that in 2007 3 2 2 integral energy flows fig 8 shows the integral energy flows in the 3 node network hebei provided the highest energy flows to beijing followed by the flows from hebei to tianjin in 2002 the flow from hebei to beijing was highest reaching 0 91 108 tce and the flows from beijing to hebei and from hebei to tianjin were only 82 8 and 67 4 of that from hebei to beijing in 2007 the flows from hebei to beijing and to tianjin were still highest and also increased greatly compared with those in 2002 they were 1 46 and 1 99 times respectively the corresponding flows next highest were the flows from tianjin to hebei and from beijing to hebei at 32 5 and 24 1 of the flows from hebei to beijing in 2010 the flow from hebei to beijing was still highest and increased by 33 7 compared with that in 2007 next highest was the flow from hebei to tianjin which decreased from 2007 to 2010 reaching only 90 5 of that in 2007 but it was still higher than the flow from tianjin to beijing fig 9 shows the integral energy flows among the 13 cities in 2002 the integral energy flows among the 13 cities in 2007 and 2010 are shown in figs s3 and s4 in supplementary material the flows were highest from shijiazhuang to tangshan with only one exception in 2002 the flow from beijing to tianjin was highest next highest were the flows from tangshan to shijiazhuang in 2002 the flow from beijing to tianjin was highest reaching 0 24 108 tce followed by the flow from tangshan to shijiazhuang at 88 5 of the flow from beijing to tianjin in 2007 the integral energy flows among all cities increased and the highest flow was from shijiazhuang to tangshan at 52 63 108 tce next highest was the flow from tangshan to shijiazhuang at 98 0 of the highest flow in 2010 all the flows increased again and the highest flow was shijiazhuang to tangshan at 2 44 times that in 2007 3 3 functional attributes 3 3 1 relationship analysis fig 10 shows the relationships among the cities in the 3 node model there were only three pairs of relationships in the 3 node network a competition relationship only existed between beijing and tianjin in 2007 and there was no mutualism relationship at any time control and exploitation relationships dominated the network in all three years the relationships exploitation between beijing and hebei and between tianjin and hebei were always control relationships and did not change during the study period this means that hebei provided resources for beijing and tianjin through integral energy flows in 2002 tianjin exploited energy from beijing whereas in 2010 tianjin provided energy to beijing this indicated that in 2010 beijing depended more on resources from tianjin and hebei than it did at the start of the study period the lack of change in the competition relationship between beijing and tianjin meant that beijing and tianjin both exploited energy from hebei and competed with each other fig 11 shows the metabolic relationships among the cities in the 13 node network in 2002 figs s5 and s6 in supplementary material show the metabolic relationships among the cities in the 13 node network in 2007 and 2010 the number of relationships among the 13 cities totaled 78 as in the 3 node network there were no mutualism relationships at any time and the relationships changed greatly from 2002 to 2010 in 2002 control and exploitation relationships dominated the network and accounted for 87 2 of all relationships beijing exploited energy from 9 other cities and tianjin exploited energy from 10 other cities in contrast hengshui was exploited by 9 cities in 2007 only one exploitation relationship existed between qinhuangdao and hengshui and the number of competition relationships reached 46 the others were control relationships and accounted for 39 7 of the total relationships the control relationships were mostly related to beijing and tianjin which both exploited energy from 11 other cities in hebei qinhuangdao was exploited by all 12 other cities in 2010 only one exploitation relationship existed between qinhuangdo and hengshui but the number of control relationships increased to 47 and accounted for 60 3 of the total relationships beijing and tianjin still exploited energy from all 11 other cities in hebei and qinhuangdao and hengshui were exploited by all other cities the number of competition relationships increased from 2002 to 2007 and then decreased there were only 10 pairs of competition relationships in 2002 and they were among hengshui and beijing tianjin and langfang in 2007 the number of competition relationships increased to 46 and accounted for 59 0 of the total relationships they were mostly among the 11 cities of hebei in 2010 the number of competition relationships decreased to 30 and they were mostly for tangshan shijiazhuang cangzhou handan and baoding 3 3 2 benefits analysis fig 12 shows the results of the benefits analysis the mutualism index of both the 3 node network and the 13 node network decreased from 2002 to 2007 then increased in 2007 it was only 1 25 in the 3 node network which means that the number of negative signs was higher than at any other time however it decreased to 0 36 in the 13 node network which means that negative utilities greatly outweighed positive utilities for the synergism index all values were greater than 0 throughout the study for both network scales and increased continuously from 2002 to 2010 this means that the whole system has experienced a net positive effect and that the beneficial effect is increasing over time synergism represents the benefits each region or city receives from being part of the network figs 13 and 14 show the degrees of synergism for the 3 node and 13 node network models respectively the benefits for beijing tianjin and hebei decreased slightly from 2002 to 2007 and then increased hebei showed the greatest magnitude and rate of increase in 2002 the benefits for hebei were 1 39 and 1 47 times those of beijing and tianjin respectively in 2007 the gap between hebei and the other cities increased to 1 51 times for beijing and 1 58 times for tianjin in 2010 the benefits for hebei increased again to 1 77 times for beijing and 1 82 times for tianjin in the 13 node model all cities except shijiazhuang handan baoding xingtai and hengshui showed a continuously increasing trend from 2002 to 2010 from 2002 to 2007 the benefits increased fastest for handan which reached 93 28 times its 2002 value beijing showed the slowest increase increasing to only 1 39 times its 2002 value from 2007 to 2010 the benefits increased more slowly the benefits for tianjin and langfang increased most to 1 43 and 1 42 times respectively the 2007 value the benefits for shijiazhuang and baoding became negative in 2007 with a much more negative net value for baoding in 2010 both increased again to positive net benefits in terms of the change in benefits from 2002 to 2010 shijiazhuang showed the greatest increase to 3 27 times the 2002 value whereas baoding had a lower value in 2010 than in 2002 at only 0 65 times the 2002 value the benefits for xingtai increased from 2002 to 2007 and then decreased the value in 2007 was 3 70 times that in 2002 whereas that in 2010 was only 0 82 times that in 2007 3 4 comparison of energy flow and relationship at two scales some laws of consistency and difference can be found by integrating multi scale findings the law of consistency reflects the complementarity of multi scale research the result of the 13 node model is the refinement of the results of the 3 node model in the 3 node model the integral energy flow from hebei to beijing was highest which accounted for about 30 of the total energy flow in the 3 node network in 2002 and 2007 and nearly 50 in 2010 the proportion of the integral energy flows from hebei to beijing decreased in the 13 node model which was about 13 in 2002 and declined to about 5 in 2007 and 2010 but the integral energy flow from hebei to beijing was still the largest energy flow in the network the reason for decline in proportion of flow from hebei to beijing was that the expansion of the network scale leaded to the decline in the advantages of some paths in the network furthermore the model further identified the main contributors to the integral energy flow from hebei to beijing tangshan shijiazhuang and handan accounting for 47 of the flow from hebei to beijing the relationships in the 3 node model were dominated by exploitation and control accounting for more than 67 of the total relationships exploitation and control relationship in 13 node model were still dominant in 2002 and 2010 accounting for more than 61 5 of the total relationships there were many pairs of competition relations between the 11 cities in hebei in the 13 node model which leads to a decrease in the proportion of exploitation and control relationship in 3 node model relationship results beijing and tianjin exploited energy from hebei in 13 node model relationship results beijing and tianjin exploited energy from most cities in hebei beijing showed a competitive relationship with langfang and hengshui and tianjin showed a competitive relationship with hengshui in 2002 there are some differences between the results of the 3 node and 13 node models in the 3 node model the integral energy flow from beijing to tianjin was smallest which accounted for about 19 of the average energy flow in 3 node network in the 13 node model the contribution of flow from beijing to tianjin to the total energy flows increased especially in 2002 the integral energy flow from beijing to tianjin was highest in 2007 and 2010 the integral energy flow from beijing to tianjin was about 2 5 times the minimum flow in addition the ecological relationship between beijing and tianjin was different in 3 node and 13 node networks in the 3 node network beijing exploited energy from tianjin in 2010 but in the 13 node network beijing showed a competitive relationship with tianjin because both beijing and tianjin exploited energy from 11 cities in hebei 4 discussion traditional analyses of direct and indirect energy flows through industrial sectors mostly concentrated on final consumption when zhou et al 2010 analyzed beijing s energy consumption they only accounted for the energy embodied in the direct exchanges of resources and did not consider the flows along paths with a length greater than 1 leung 2011 analyzed china s energy consumption from the perspective of final consumption and they found that the transportation sector consumed a large quantity of crude oil its consumption in 2007 accounted for 10 4 of the total crude oil consumption in china these analyses of the energy consumption structure were not comprehensive as they only assessed the direct consumption of physical energy and ignored the indirect energy consumption embodied in the exchanges of resources among sectors along paths with a length greater than 1 to specify the flows embodied in the economic exchanges among sectors chen 2011 introduced the concepts of systems ecology theory to describe the equilibrium relationships that are concealed in monetary input output tables from the perspective of integral consumption chen 2011 showed that in 2002 beijing obtained a large quantity of energy from other chinese provinces and that as in the present study beijing received more energy from hebei than from tianjin which can reflect the energy consumption more comprehensively these previous results agree with the present results and suggest that it is necessary to account for the integral energy consumption to provide adequate support for plans to save energy and reduce carbon emission input output analysis can effectively quantify integral energy consumption because it can quantify the indirect energy consumption that results from exchanges of intermediate products but input output analysis cannot effectively analyze ecological relationship among nodes integrating input output and ecological network analysis can not only explore direct indirect and integral energy flows but also explore the ecological relationship therefore this approach was applied in the present study to assess both the direct and indirect energy consumption thereby permitting a more comprehensive analysis to support ecological relationships analysis zheng et al 2017 at the same time based on the analysis of flow and relationship the importance of multi scale model research was verified which served different research objectives and helped researchers choose the appropriate scale model under different data acquisition precision and research depth china s central government has implemented plans designed to promote more efficient and integrated development of the jing jin ji urban agglomeration as a result of these plans the transfer of energy intensive industries out of beijing had begun by 2007 some enterprises retained their headquarters in beijing but moved their production facilities to hebei this decreased total energy consumption in beijing and contributed to large indirect energy flows from beijing to tianjin and hebei which helped to balance the flows of embodied energy among these regions for example the shougang group one of china s largest steel conglomerates was originally located in beijing but moved its production facilities to tangshan in hebei but left its research and development department in beijing this helped to reduce beijing s energy consumption which decreased by 5 4 between 2006 and 2007 beijing is china s largest technology and commodity trading and distribution center with technology and information contracts in 2010 that transferred 404 106 yuan from beijing to tianjin and 702 106 yuan from beijing to hebei in the future this may mean that beijing will provide more technology and information to tianjin and hebei through indirect flows resulting in a more balanced energy metabolism however some problems still exist as china s capital beijing strongly influences national policy and this may lead unbalanced opportunities for tianjin and hebei moving industries or companies to hebei will also move the associated environmental problems therefore hebei should pay attention to companies it receives and take measures to ensure that the resulting environmental burden remains acceptable in the future as hebei s industrial sectors consume large quantities of energy it will be necessary to control the energy consumption by these sectors for example it may be necessary to adjust the energy utilization structure of these sectors by using cleaner forms of energy to replace fossil fuels in the consumer sectors production technology should be improved to reduce losses of materials and energy and the associated waste production during production activities and thereby increase the resource and energy utilization efficiencies solving these and other problems in the agglomeration will require additional research at higher resolution e g at a sectoral level to identify the most problematic flows of energy so that efforts can be made to mitigate those flows 5 conclusions in this study we used the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration as a case study to illustrate the application of urban metabolism theory we used this approach to trace the complex flows of energy within the agglomeration at scales ranging from a single region to 3 node and 13 node networks we used multi regional monetary input output tables from 2002 2007 and 2010 combined with energy consumption data at urban or provincial levels to quantify the direct and indirect flows of energy to accomplish this we abstracted the components of the agglomeration into networks and applied ecological network analysis to determine the relationships among these components based on the quantified flows in the 3 node network hebei consumed 2 3 times the direct energy consumed by beijing and tianjin in the 13 node network the direct energy consumption in 2002 was highest for beijing at 11 60 times that of hengshui which consumed the least direct energy in 2007 and 2010 handan consumed the most direct energy the integral energy consumption of each node in the 3 node network increased from 2002 to 2007 and then decreased but in the 13 node network the consumption first decreased and then increased this difference resulted from our use of different direct energy flow matrices the direct and integral energy flows showed that hebei provided the most energy to beijing and tianjin in the 3 node network in the 13 node network tangshan provided the most energy to the other 12 cities in terms of the ecological relationships among the nodes the model with 13 nodes increased the proportion of competition relationships which mainly existed among the 11 cities within hebei province the relationships among beijing tianjin and hebei were dominated by exploitation and control in the 3 node network therefore the results showed both similarities and differences among the different scales the present study should be considered preliminary because it did not extend to the sectoral level which is the level at which it will be necessary to adjust the energy consumption structure of each city therefore in our future research we will try to divide the input output tables at the sectoral level thereby letting us propose industry specific suggestions for adjusting the industrial structure of each component of the agglomeration to improve its energy

25338,the area of the beijing tianjin hebei jing jin ji region is about 2 25 of china land area but the energy consumption and carbon emission of jing jin ji region account for more than 10 of china s total consumption and emissions to reduce the region s energy consumption and carbon emission we studied energy flow process in this region the previous research on energy flow is concentrated on a single scale with little multi scale integration in this study based on framework of urban metabolism we used ecological network analysis method to study the region s energy metabolism and ecological relationship among nodes at two scales in 3 node and 13 node models of the agglomeration the integral direct indirect energy consumption in the 3 node model first increased then decreased from 2002 to 2010 consumption in the 13 node model first decreased then increased the direct and integral energy flows showed that hebei provided the most energy to beijing in the 3 node network in the 13 node network tangshan provided the most energy to the other 12 cities in terms of the ecological relationships among the nodes the 13 node model showed proportionally more competition relationships than the 3 node model the relationships among beijing tianjin and hebei were dominated by exploitation and control based on the analysis of flow and relationship the importance of multi scale model research is verified which serves different research objectives and helps researchers choose the appropriate scale model under different data acquisition precision and research depth keywords urban energy metabolism ecological network analysis multi scale analysis urban agglomeration jing jin ji 1 introduction as urbanization and industrialization progress urban agglomerations develop and become core areas for the economy and the environment china s beijing tianjin hebei jing jin ji urban agglomeration is one of the world s largest and has therefore attracted much attention from researchers and government managers however as the industrial structures of beijing tianjin and hebei are similar the potential for synergies was low and the region s ecological capacity was limited leading to high ecological and environmental costs and excessively high consumption of energy in 2013 energy consumption in the jing jin ji region was 44 27 106 tce tonnes coal equivalent and accounted for 10 4 of china s energy consumption however energy consumption analyses for urban agglomerations should account for more than just the total consumption they should also identify the provinces or cities that are most responsible for this total four cities together consumed more than half of this total 18 5 for baoding 16 7 for beijing 16 5 for tangshan and 12 5 for handan du et al 2016 this kind of analysis reveals the key locations of energy consumption so that government managers can focus on these locations in an effort to reduce energy consumption and pollutant emission once these key locations are known it becomes possible to trace the flows of energy among them and use a range of techniques to improve our understanding of these flows such an analysis can be conducted at a range of scales for a key agglomeration such as the jing jin ji region from an administrative perspective hebei is a province whereas beijing and tianjin are referred to as provincial scale municipalities because in importance they are equivalent to provinces for simplicity we will refer to beijing and tianjin as provinces hereafter in addition hebei contains several large cities and can thus be subdivided different insights will be obtained from analyzing energy flows at different scales in the present study we demonstrate the effects of scale by treating the jing jin ji region as a single node then separating it into three nodes beijing tianjin and hebei and 13 nodes beijing tianjin and 11 cities within hebei one advantage of this increasing resolution is that it allows us to trace more than just direct flows we can also account for indirect flows that pass through one or more intermediate nodes before arriving at the flow s final destination this approach permits a more comprehensive evaluation of the current status of an urban agglomeration making it possible to develop solutions that will optimize energy use and conservation research on energy flows through an urban agglomeration developed from older research on urban metabolism this research is based on a metaphor in which flows of resources and wastes among regions of the agglomeration can be considered analogous to the metabolic flows in a living organism the concept of an urban metabolism was proposed by wolman 1965 who proposed the concept as a way to analyze the material or energy flows within a single city until recently the boundary of the urban metabolic system remained restricted to a single city where the approach allowed researchers to trace the flows of resources and wastes within that city and between the city and its surrounding environment hashimoto and moriguchi 2004 liang and zhang 2011 liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 however in practice cities are open systems that frequently exchange materials and energy with other cities based on this recognition urban metabolic analysis has been extended to both networks of independent cities and to urban agglomerations and the boundaries include both the cities and the surrounding rural areas that provide food energy or other resources billen et al 2012 barles 2009 studied both the urban area of paris and its surroundings and found that the urban area depended strongly on resource inputs from areas outside the city and also emitted wastes to these areas nonetheless the overall metropolitan area which included rural areas was largely able to sustain itself billen et al 2012 studied 11 european cities including paris london and brussels to analyze the interaction between the cities and their surrounding areas from the perspectives of flows of energy food and water they found strong interdependence between a city and its surrounding areas poruschi 2013 also showed that extending the research boundary beyond that of the city to southeastern queensland australia and considering the external environment provided a more robust framework for economic and environmental analysis to support plans for sustainable regional development kennedy et al 2014 pointed out that the choice of system boundaries strongly influenced the results of such analyses other researchers have focused on urban agglomerations which represent groups of cities that are close together and that are strongly socially or economically connected this permits analyses both at the level of the overall agglomeration and at the level of individual cities baynes and bai 2012 studied direct energy consumption for the metropolitan area of melbourne australia zhang et al 2016a b studied embodied energy flows in the jing jin ji agglomeration marteleira et al 2014 studied water metabolism and recycling for the metropolitan area of lisbon portugal baker et al 2007 studied the transformations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the minneapolis st paul united states metropolitan area heinonen and junnila 2011 studied the carbon metabolism of helsinki and porvoo finland nixon and fulweiler 2012 studied the nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism of narragansett bay united states analyses can also focus on combinations of flows swaney et al 2012 pincetl et al 2014 wang and chen 2016 and environmental impacts gonzález et al 2013 moore et al 2013 garcia montiel et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a b furthermore the analysis can be spatially explicit for example lee et al 2009 combined an analysis of land use and cover types with resource consumption data to identify the resource utilization level of different land uses and several researchers have compared metropolitan areas heinonen and junnila 2011 kennedy et al 2011 rosado et al 2014 such studies can also be conducted at a range of scales for example some chinese scholars have studied metabolic processes at a provincial scale such as the social metabolism of liaoning province xu et al 2008 and the carbon metabolisms of jiangsu province liang and zhang 2011 and of hubei province yang et al 2015a therefore choosing an urban agglomeration as a case study to analyze the interaction among cities at a range of scales seems likely to provide important insights to perform such analyses it s first necessary to identify and quantify the flows of energy and materials input output analysis is commonly used to quantify the interactions among industries it is based on tracing the direct and indirect resource consumption or emission of wastes embodied in consumption processes leontief 1970 miller and blair 2009 to differentiate the impacts of the technologies used to produce primary and intermediate products multi regional input output tables can be established and used to analyze the resource flows among regions and among the sectors in a given region zhang et al 2013 this method is an effective way to trace industrial chains by quantifying the interactions among sectors caused by the resource consumption activities wiedmann 2009 wiedmann et al 2007 this method was first used to analyze the economic linkages among sectors in italy and the united states at a national scale polenske 1980 subsequently the method was extended to analyze virtual water and water footprints feng and hubacek 2015 feng et al 2012 2014 jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2012 zhang and anadon 2014 the impacts of global trade on biodiversity lenzen et al 2012 emission of wastes such as greenhouse gases yu et al 2013 carbon dioxide zhang and tang 2015 so2 prell et al 2014 fine particulate matter lin et al 2014 and total suspended particulate matter yang et al 2015b carbon emission tian et al 2014 material footprints wiedmann et al 2015 agricultural products kastner et al 2011 ecological footprints zhou and imura 2011 energy consumption liang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 and the ecological footprints of multiple materials galli et al 2012 however further insights could be gained from these flows of energy and materials for example it is necessary to study the functional attributes of the components of an urban agglomeration ecological network analysis when combined with multi regional input output analysis can provide important insights into the structural and functional attributes of whole systems or of specific sectors within a system zhang et al 2015a analyzed the energy consumption structure of 28 sectors in beijing from the carbon footprint perspective chen and chen 2015 compared analyses based on material flows input output analysis and ecological network analysis and showed that ecological network analysis provided the clearest insights into the interactions among sectors however each of these approaches provides complementary insights so combining them can produce a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems such as an urban agglomeration system at a regional scale zhang et al 2015b studied the energy metabolic processes of china s 30 provinces and zhang et al 2016c examined these processes for the sectors in single or multiple regions of the jing jin ji urban agglomeration to identify the key actors in different sectors in the present study we used urban metabolism theory to trace the energy flows at three scales in the jing jin ji agglomeration as a single node for the whole region as three nodes beijing tianjin and hebei and as 13 nodes individual cities within the agglomeration the results fill gaps in our data on this large and complex urban agglomeration and in contrast with previous research provided additional insights into the effects of scale on such analyses by abstracting these components of the overall agglomeration into networks we were able to use ecological network analysis to analyze the flows among the components of the system and define their functional and ecological relationships our goals were to provide insights at different network scales ranging from 1 to 13 nodes to identify the functional ecological attributes of the system components and identify the nodes with the highest energy consumption or flows by examining the system across multiple scales we obtained different perspectives on the flows thereby providing more comprehensive guidance for plans to reduce energy consumption and waste emission throughout the agglomeration 2 methods 2 1 the multi scale metabolic network model we choose the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration as a case study so we could establish a framework that included all key metabolic actors in the agglomeration across a range of scales fig 1 shows the resulting multi scale framework used in this paper we defined the scales of network model illustrated in fig 1 by defining the nodes used at each scale and the paths among the nodes in each network here nodes represent the three provincial scale cities beijing tianjin and hebei and 13 cities beijing tianjin and 11 cities in hebei the paths among these nodes represent the energy flows embodied in the exchanges of resources between pairs of nodes 2 2 data used we obtained the data used in this research from the 2003 2008 and 2010 china energy statistical yearbooks bureau of energy statistics of national bureau of statistics and from the china emission accounts and datasets web site http www ceads net we also obtained multi regional monetary input output tables for 2002 shi and zhang 2012 2007 liu et al 2012 and 2010 liu et al 2014 to standardize the data to account for the different kinds of energy that are used in the study area we used standard tonnes of coal equivalent tce coefficients to convert the different energy units into consistent tce units combining multi regional monetary input output tables with the energy consumption data for each sector for each scale of node agglomeration province or city lets us calculate the associated direct energy consumption coefficient for each sector zhang et al 2014 details of the equilibrium equations are provided in section 3 1 of zhang et al 2014 based on the calculations in that paper we obtained the following equation 1 ε e u ˆ h 1 where ε represents the direct energy coefficient matrix in which the element ε kp represents the k th energy consumption coefficient in sector p e represents the energy consumption matrix for flows that enter or leave the sectors in a given area u ˆ u q p n n where n represents the number of sectors in a given area p and q represent the p th sector and the q th sector respectively when p q uqp xp where xp is the total economic output of sector p when p q uqp 0 h represents the monetary value flow matrix we can then multiply the economic data xp by the corresponding energy coefficient to determine the direct energy flow among provinces or cities in this way the monetary input output table can be converted into a corresponding energy flow table this energy data is the basis for developing a network model of the system which can then be used to calculate the direct metabolic flows the indirect metabolic flows flows that pass through one or more intermediate nodes before reaching their final destination and the integral metabolic flows the sum of the direct and indirect flows 2 3 analysis of direct metabolic flows the direct metabolic flows represent flows between any two nodes when they exchange resources along a path of length 1 i e the flows do not pass through any intermediate nodes the flow from region i to region j is denoted fji and the flows from region j to region i is denoted fij we can define zi and yi as imports into node i from the external environment and the exports from node i to the external environment respectively ti represents the total metabolic flow received by one node from all other nodes and the external environment and this represents the direct consumption of metabolic energy by each node therefore 2 t i n p u t i j 1 n f i j z i 3 t o u t p u t j i 1 n f i j y j 4 t i t i n p u t i j 1 n f i j z i i 1 n f i j y j t o u t p u t j 2 4 analysis of integral metabolic flows integral metabolic flows represent the total of the direct and indirect flows through a node nondimensional input oriented flows from node j to node i g ij are defined as follows li et al 2012 5 g i j f i j t i from the direct flow intensity matrix g g ij the dimensionless integral flow intensity matrix n nij can be calculated using the following convergent power series fath and patten 1999 6 n n i j g 0 g 1 g 2 g 3 g l i g 1 where g 0 is a self feedback matrix that reflects flows that occur within each node g 1 is the energy flux matrix for flows with a path length of 1 between two nodes i e l 1 and because there are no intermediate nodes this represents direct flows g l reflects flows of length l l 2 with at least one intermediate nodes and therefore represents indirect flows between nodes and i represents the identity matrix n represents the nondimensional energy flux between nodes and we can multiply n by the diagonal of the energy input matrix ti from the local environment diag t to obtain the indirect energy transfer flow matrix y 7 y d i a g t n based on the integral flow and direct flow matrices the indirect flows among nodes through paths with a length of 2 or more can be calculated 8 i n d i r e c t y d i a g t f where f represents the direct flow matrix 2 5 utility analysis based on the results of the flow analysis a dimensionless direct utility intensity matrix d can then be computed in which matrix element dij represents the utility of the flows between node j and node i which can be expressed as follows 9 d i j f i j f j i t i from matrix d a dimensionless integral utility intensity matrix u can be computed from the following convergent power series 10 u u i j d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 d l i d 1 where uij represents the integral dimensionless value of dij which is calculated using a leontief inverse matrix fath and patten 1999 d 0 represents the self feedback of flows within each node d 1 represents the utility of the direct flows between any two nodes in the network along a path of length 1 and dl l 1 reflects the indirect flow utility along paths of length l i is the identity matrix we can designate the sign of the utility of any element in u as the relationship utility sign matrix sgn u with suij representing the sign of the utility of the flows from node j to node i from the perspective of node i if suij suji node i exploits node j by analogy with a natural ecosystem this means that node i benefits from the relationship receives more utility than it transfers to node j but node j suffers receives less utility than it transfers to node i if suij suji node i is controlled by node j if suij suji then node i competes with node j leading to negative impacts for both nodes whereas if suij suji the relationship between the two nodes represents mutualism in which both nodes benefit from their interaction if suij suji 0 0 neither node benefits nor suffers as a result of the relationship neutrality therefore there are five ecological relationships among the system s nodes exploitation control competition mutualism and neutrality to quantify the system s overall mutualism status we used a mutualism index m that summarizes the results of the set of all relationships among nodes this index is the ratio of the number of positive signs m to the number of negative signs m in the integral utility intensity matrix u 11 m m m where 12 m i 1 n j 1 n max sgn u i j 0 13 m i 1 n j 1 n min sgn u i j 0 where n equals the number of nodes in the network if m 1 positive signs are more numerous than negative signs which means that relationships with positive utility are more numerous than relationships with negative utility and that the system is predominantly mutualistic the higher the value of m the higher the degree of mutualism in the system in contrast if m 1 relationships with negative utility are more numerous and the system has a low degree of mutualism as network synergism based on the flows of utility can occur in all system models regardless of the size or complexity of the system the overall integral utility u of the system is always greater than 1 fath and patten 1999 we therefore dimensionalized u by pre multiplying it by the diagonalized throughflow vector diag t thereby producing the dimensional integral flow matrix y 14 y d i a g t u we then calculated the dimensional integral utility that is received by each node this integral utility received by each node si can be computed as follows 15 s i j 1 i 1 y i j j i n y i j where yij represents the elements of dimensional integral flow matrix y the integral utility that is created by each type of relationship can be calculated by summing up the integral utility values for all pairs of nodes that exhibit that relationship 3 results 3 1 the node characteristics at each scale our analysis of the node characteristics included the direct energy consumption and the integral energy consumption that results from adding indirect consumption 3 1 1 direct energy consumption the total direct energy consumption for the jing jin ji urban agglomeration increased continually from 2002 to 2010 2002 1 27 108 tce 2007 2 32 108 tce 2010 2 90 108 tce because this analysis provides insufficient resolution to identify possible reasons for the increasing trend we subdivided the agglomeration into three regions beijing tianjin and hebei fig 2 shows the changes within each region the direct energy consumption by hebei was much higher than those of beijing and tianjin in all years in 2002 hebei s direct consumption was 2 37 times that of beijing and 3 44 times that of tianjin in 2007 the gap between hebei and the other cities increased direct consumption in hebei was 3 78 and 4 83 times those in beijing and tianjin respectively and in 2010 the gap increased to 4 69 and 4 23 times respectively however all three regions showed continuous increases in direct energy consumption from 2002 to 2010 the increase was greatest for hebei which reached 2 12 times the 2002 value increasing the resolution provided additional insights fig 3 shows that at the 13 node scale the energy consumption of beijing tianjin tangshan shijiazhuang handan and baoding were greater than those of the other cities in 2002 beijing s consumption was the highest among the 13 cities reaching 3 14 107 tce which was 11 7 times that of hengshui which ranked last in 2007 handan s consumption was highest and the value for hengshui which was the smallest was only 8 4 that of handan the direct energy consumption of all the cities increased from 2002 to 2007 and the increase was fastest for chengde with the value in 2007 equal to 2 59 times that in 2002 beijing s consumption increased most slowly with the 2007 value equal to only 1 33 times that in 2002 in 2010 handan s consumption was still highest from 2007 to 2010 consumption increased for all cities but hengshui s consumption increased fastest to 13 2 times the 2007 value and it ranked second in 2010 compared with last in 2002 and 2007 beijing s consumption increased slowest by only 2 6 from 2007 to 2010 3 1 2 integral energy consumption fig 4 compares the integral energy consumption of beijing tianjin and hebei for each region the integral energy consumption first increased and then decreased the magnitude and rate of the change were greater for hebei than for beijing and tianjin in 2007 hebei s integral consumption was 5 20 times that in 2002 versus increases of only 1 60 times for beijing and 2 18 times for tianjin from 2007 to 2010 integral consumption decreased to 0 97 times the 2007 value for beijing versus 0 77 for tianjin and 0 36 for hebei hebei s integral consumption remained much higher than those of the other cities throughout the study period fig 5 shows the integral energy consumption of the 13 cities from 2002 to 2010 beijing s integral consumption first decreased then increased that of tianjin increased throughout the study period and the other cities all showed an initial increase then a decrease the difference in the trends for beijing and tianjin between the 3 node and 13 node networks is because the integral energy consumption was calculated based on a monetary input output matrix with 13 nodes derived from a matrix with 3 nodes division of the data followed by using ecological network analysis to account for the integral energy flows resulted in different trends at these two scales in 2002 integral consumption was highest for beijing at 2 47 times that of tianjin which ranked second in 2007 tangshan s integral consumption ranked first zhangjiakou which consumed the least energy had integral consumption equal to only 17 4 of that of tangshan in 2010 tianjin s integral consumption was the highest at 6 11 times that of hengshui which ranked lowest 3 2 the path characteristics at each scale the path characteristics include the direct energy flows based on the direct energy coefficient matrix and the integral energy flows along the paths 3 2 1 direct energy flows fig 6 shows the direct energy flows in the 3 node network in 2002 the flow from hebei to beijing was highest at 4 04 106 tce followed by the flows from hebei to tianjin and from beijing to hebei at 79 0 and 75 4 of the flow from hebei to beijing in 2007 the flows from hebei to beijing and tianjin were still highest and also increased greatly they were 2 24 and 2 40 times respectively the flows in 2002 the next highest flows were from tianjin to hebei and from beijing to hebei at 18 2 and 16 3 respectively of the flow from hebei to beijing in 2010 the flow from hebei to beijing was still highest and increased by 14 3 compared with that in 2007 the next highest flow was from hebei to tianjin which decreased from 2007 to 2010 reaching only 86 3 of the 2007 value but it was still higher than the flow from tianjin to beijing fig 7 shows the direct energy flows among the 13 cities in 2002 the direct energy flows among the 13 cities in 2007 and 2010 are shown in figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material the direct energy flows among the cities showed the trend of growth and the flow between tangshan and shijiazhuang was highest in all three years in 2002 the flow was highest from tangshan to shijiazhuang reaching 3 89 106 tce followed by the flow from tangshan to baoding at 69 0 of the flow from tangshan to shijiazhuang in 2007 the direct energy flows among the cities all increased but the highest flow was still from tangshan to shijiazhuang the flow reached 27 56 times that in 2002 the flow from tangshan to handan ranked second at 73 7 of the highest flow in 2010 all the flows increased again and the highest flow was again from tangshan to shijiazhuang it was 1 85 times that in 2007 3 2 2 integral energy flows fig 8 shows the integral energy flows in the 3 node network hebei provided the highest energy flows to beijing followed by the flows from hebei to tianjin in 2002 the flow from hebei to beijing was highest reaching 0 91 108 tce and the flows from beijing to hebei and from hebei to tianjin were only 82 8 and 67 4 of that from hebei to beijing in 2007 the flows from hebei to beijing and to tianjin were still highest and also increased greatly compared with those in 2002 they were 1 46 and 1 99 times respectively the corresponding flows next highest were the flows from tianjin to hebei and from beijing to hebei at 32 5 and 24 1 of the flows from hebei to beijing in 2010 the flow from hebei to beijing was still highest and increased by 33 7 compared with that in 2007 next highest was the flow from hebei to tianjin which decreased from 2007 to 2010 reaching only 90 5 of that in 2007 but it was still higher than the flow from tianjin to beijing fig 9 shows the integral energy flows among the 13 cities in 2002 the integral energy flows among the 13 cities in 2007 and 2010 are shown in figs s3 and s4 in supplementary material the flows were highest from shijiazhuang to tangshan with only one exception in 2002 the flow from beijing to tianjin was highest next highest were the flows from tangshan to shijiazhuang in 2002 the flow from beijing to tianjin was highest reaching 0 24 108 tce followed by the flow from tangshan to shijiazhuang at 88 5 of the flow from beijing to tianjin in 2007 the integral energy flows among all cities increased and the highest flow was from shijiazhuang to tangshan at 52 63 108 tce next highest was the flow from tangshan to shijiazhuang at 98 0 of the highest flow in 2010 all the flows increased again and the highest flow was shijiazhuang to tangshan at 2 44 times that in 2007 3 3 functional attributes 3 3 1 relationship analysis fig 10 shows the relationships among the cities in the 3 node model there were only three pairs of relationships in the 3 node network a competition relationship only existed between beijing and tianjin in 2007 and there was no mutualism relationship at any time control and exploitation relationships dominated the network in all three years the relationships exploitation between beijing and hebei and between tianjin and hebei were always control relationships and did not change during the study period this means that hebei provided resources for beijing and tianjin through integral energy flows in 2002 tianjin exploited energy from beijing whereas in 2010 tianjin provided energy to beijing this indicated that in 2010 beijing depended more on resources from tianjin and hebei than it did at the start of the study period the lack of change in the competition relationship between beijing and tianjin meant that beijing and tianjin both exploited energy from hebei and competed with each other fig 11 shows the metabolic relationships among the cities in the 13 node network in 2002 figs s5 and s6 in supplementary material show the metabolic relationships among the cities in the 13 node network in 2007 and 2010 the number of relationships among the 13 cities totaled 78 as in the 3 node network there were no mutualism relationships at any time and the relationships changed greatly from 2002 to 2010 in 2002 control and exploitation relationships dominated the network and accounted for 87 2 of all relationships beijing exploited energy from 9 other cities and tianjin exploited energy from 10 other cities in contrast hengshui was exploited by 9 cities in 2007 only one exploitation relationship existed between qinhuangdao and hengshui and the number of competition relationships reached 46 the others were control relationships and accounted for 39 7 of the total relationships the control relationships were mostly related to beijing and tianjin which both exploited energy from 11 other cities in hebei qinhuangdao was exploited by all 12 other cities in 2010 only one exploitation relationship existed between qinhuangdo and hengshui but the number of control relationships increased to 47 and accounted for 60 3 of the total relationships beijing and tianjin still exploited energy from all 11 other cities in hebei and qinhuangdao and hengshui were exploited by all other cities the number of competition relationships increased from 2002 to 2007 and then decreased there were only 10 pairs of competition relationships in 2002 and they were among hengshui and beijing tianjin and langfang in 2007 the number of competition relationships increased to 46 and accounted for 59 0 of the total relationships they were mostly among the 11 cities of hebei in 2010 the number of competition relationships decreased to 30 and they were mostly for tangshan shijiazhuang cangzhou handan and baoding 3 3 2 benefits analysis fig 12 shows the results of the benefits analysis the mutualism index of both the 3 node network and the 13 node network decreased from 2002 to 2007 then increased in 2007 it was only 1 25 in the 3 node network which means that the number of negative signs was higher than at any other time however it decreased to 0 36 in the 13 node network which means that negative utilities greatly outweighed positive utilities for the synergism index all values were greater than 0 throughout the study for both network scales and increased continuously from 2002 to 2010 this means that the whole system has experienced a net positive effect and that the beneficial effect is increasing over time synergism represents the benefits each region or city receives from being part of the network figs 13 and 14 show the degrees of synergism for the 3 node and 13 node network models respectively the benefits for beijing tianjin and hebei decreased slightly from 2002 to 2007 and then increased hebei showed the greatest magnitude and rate of increase in 2002 the benefits for hebei were 1 39 and 1 47 times those of beijing and tianjin respectively in 2007 the gap between hebei and the other cities increased to 1 51 times for beijing and 1 58 times for tianjin in 2010 the benefits for hebei increased again to 1 77 times for beijing and 1 82 times for tianjin in the 13 node model all cities except shijiazhuang handan baoding xingtai and hengshui showed a continuously increasing trend from 2002 to 2010 from 2002 to 2007 the benefits increased fastest for handan which reached 93 28 times its 2002 value beijing showed the slowest increase increasing to only 1 39 times its 2002 value from 2007 to 2010 the benefits increased more slowly the benefits for tianjin and langfang increased most to 1 43 and 1 42 times respectively the 2007 value the benefits for shijiazhuang and baoding became negative in 2007 with a much more negative net value for baoding in 2010 both increased again to positive net benefits in terms of the change in benefits from 2002 to 2010 shijiazhuang showed the greatest increase to 3 27 times the 2002 value whereas baoding had a lower value in 2010 than in 2002 at only 0 65 times the 2002 value the benefits for xingtai increased from 2002 to 2007 and then decreased the value in 2007 was 3 70 times that in 2002 whereas that in 2010 was only 0 82 times that in 2007 3 4 comparison of energy flow and relationship at two scales some laws of consistency and difference can be found by integrating multi scale findings the law of consistency reflects the complementarity of multi scale research the result of the 13 node model is the refinement of the results of the 3 node model in the 3 node model the integral energy flow from hebei to beijing was highest which accounted for about 30 of the total energy flow in the 3 node network in 2002 and 2007 and nearly 50 in 2010 the proportion of the integral energy flows from hebei to beijing decreased in the 13 node model which was about 13 in 2002 and declined to about 5 in 2007 and 2010 but the integral energy flow from hebei to beijing was still the largest energy flow in the network the reason for decline in proportion of flow from hebei to beijing was that the expansion of the network scale leaded to the decline in the advantages of some paths in the network furthermore the model further identified the main contributors to the integral energy flow from hebei to beijing tangshan shijiazhuang and handan accounting for 47 of the flow from hebei to beijing the relationships in the 3 node model were dominated by exploitation and control accounting for more than 67 of the total relationships exploitation and control relationship in 13 node model were still dominant in 2002 and 2010 accounting for more than 61 5 of the total relationships there were many pairs of competition relations between the 11 cities in hebei in the 13 node model which leads to a decrease in the proportion of exploitation and control relationship in 3 node model relationship results beijing and tianjin exploited energy from hebei in 13 node model relationship results beijing and tianjin exploited energy from most cities in hebei beijing showed a competitive relationship with langfang and hengshui and tianjin showed a competitive relationship with hengshui in 2002 there are some differences between the results of the 3 node and 13 node models in the 3 node model the integral energy flow from beijing to tianjin was smallest which accounted for about 19 of the average energy flow in 3 node network in the 13 node model the contribution of flow from beijing to tianjin to the total energy flows increased especially in 2002 the integral energy flow from beijing to tianjin was highest in 2007 and 2010 the integral energy flow from beijing to tianjin was about 2 5 times the minimum flow in addition the ecological relationship between beijing and tianjin was different in 3 node and 13 node networks in the 3 node network beijing exploited energy from tianjin in 2010 but in the 13 node network beijing showed a competitive relationship with tianjin because both beijing and tianjin exploited energy from 11 cities in hebei 4 discussion traditional analyses of direct and indirect energy flows through industrial sectors mostly concentrated on final consumption when zhou et al 2010 analyzed beijing s energy consumption they only accounted for the energy embodied in the direct exchanges of resources and did not consider the flows along paths with a length greater than 1 leung 2011 analyzed china s energy consumption from the perspective of final consumption and they found that the transportation sector consumed a large quantity of crude oil its consumption in 2007 accounted for 10 4 of the total crude oil consumption in china these analyses of the energy consumption structure were not comprehensive as they only assessed the direct consumption of physical energy and ignored the indirect energy consumption embodied in the exchanges of resources among sectors along paths with a length greater than 1 to specify the flows embodied in the economic exchanges among sectors chen 2011 introduced the concepts of systems ecology theory to describe the equilibrium relationships that are concealed in monetary input output tables from the perspective of integral consumption chen 2011 showed that in 2002 beijing obtained a large quantity of energy from other chinese provinces and that as in the present study beijing received more energy from hebei than from tianjin which can reflect the energy consumption more comprehensively these previous results agree with the present results and suggest that it is necessary to account for the integral energy consumption to provide adequate support for plans to save energy and reduce carbon emission input output analysis can effectively quantify integral energy consumption because it can quantify the indirect energy consumption that results from exchanges of intermediate products but input output analysis cannot effectively analyze ecological relationship among nodes integrating input output and ecological network analysis can not only explore direct indirect and integral energy flows but also explore the ecological relationship therefore this approach was applied in the present study to assess both the direct and indirect energy consumption thereby permitting a more comprehensive analysis to support ecological relationships analysis zheng et al 2017 at the same time based on the analysis of flow and relationship the importance of multi scale model research was verified which served different research objectives and helped researchers choose the appropriate scale model under different data acquisition precision and research depth china s central government has implemented plans designed to promote more efficient and integrated development of the jing jin ji urban agglomeration as a result of these plans the transfer of energy intensive industries out of beijing had begun by 2007 some enterprises retained their headquarters in beijing but moved their production facilities to hebei this decreased total energy consumption in beijing and contributed to large indirect energy flows from beijing to tianjin and hebei which helped to balance the flows of embodied energy among these regions for example the shougang group one of china s largest steel conglomerates was originally located in beijing but moved its production facilities to tangshan in hebei but left its research and development department in beijing this helped to reduce beijing s energy consumption which decreased by 5 4 between 2006 and 2007 beijing is china s largest technology and commodity trading and distribution center with technology and information contracts in 2010 that transferred 404 106 yuan from beijing to tianjin and 702 106 yuan from beijing to hebei in the future this may mean that beijing will provide more technology and information to tianjin and hebei through indirect flows resulting in a more balanced energy metabolism however some problems still exist as china s capital beijing strongly influences national policy and this may lead unbalanced opportunities for tianjin and hebei moving industries or companies to hebei will also move the associated environmental problems therefore hebei should pay attention to companies it receives and take measures to ensure that the resulting environmental burden remains acceptable in the future as hebei s industrial sectors consume large quantities of energy it will be necessary to control the energy consumption by these sectors for example it may be necessary to adjust the energy utilization structure of these sectors by using cleaner forms of energy to replace fossil fuels in the consumer sectors production technology should be improved to reduce losses of materials and energy and the associated waste production during production activities and thereby increase the resource and energy utilization efficiencies solving these and other problems in the agglomeration will require additional research at higher resolution e g at a sectoral level to identify the most problematic flows of energy so that efforts can be made to mitigate those flows 5 conclusions in this study we used the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration as a case study to illustrate the application of urban metabolism theory we used this approach to trace the complex flows of energy within the agglomeration at scales ranging from a single region to 3 node and 13 node networks we used multi regional monetary input output tables from 2002 2007 and 2010 combined with energy consumption data at urban or provincial levels to quantify the direct and indirect flows of energy to accomplish this we abstracted the components of the agglomeration into networks and applied ecological network analysis to determine the relationships among these components based on the quantified flows in the 3 node network hebei consumed 2 3 times the direct energy consumed by beijing and tianjin in the 13 node network the direct energy consumption in 2002 was highest for beijing at 11 60 times that of hengshui which consumed the least direct energy in 2007 and 2010 handan consumed the most direct energy the integral energy consumption of each node in the 3 node network increased from 2002 to 2007 and then decreased but in the 13 node network the consumption first decreased and then increased this difference resulted from our use of different direct energy flow matrices the direct and integral energy flows showed that hebei provided the most energy to beijing and tianjin in the 3 node network in the 13 node network tangshan provided the most energy to the other 12 cities in terms of the ecological relationships among the nodes the model with 13 nodes increased the proportion of competition relationships which mainly existed among the 11 cities within hebei province the relationships among beijing tianjin and hebei were dominated by exploitation and control in the 3 node network therefore the results showed both similarities and differences among the different scales the present study should be considered preliminary because it did not extend to the sectoral level which is the level at which it will be necessary to adjust the energy consumption structure of each city therefore in our future research we will try to divide the input output tables at the sectoral level thereby letting us propose industry specific suggestions for adjusting the industrial structure of each component of the agglomeration to improve its energy

25339,a process based model was developed to simulate the dynamics of grapevine growth within and over years the model was designed so that it could be used in a later stage to incorporate damage mechanisms of grape diseases and to analyse their effects on growth and yield over consecutive seasons the development stage is modelled according to temperature the within season dynamics includes 1 the production of assimilates from photosynthesis 2 the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk during the vegetative phase of the crop cycle 3 the partitioning of assimilates towards leaves stems grapes roots and trunk 4 the accumulation of assimilates in roots and trunk after maturity and 5 leaf senescence winter and within season pruning are also included the model was parameterised for vitis labrusca using literature and experimental data the model was tested with data collected from a 5 year old vineyard of v labrusca cv niagara rosada and evaluated by comparing outputs with data from the literature the model satisfactorily reproduced the general dynamics of plant growth within year and over successive seasons simulation over 20 years indicated that biomass of leaf stem grape and trunk at grapevine maturity increased according to a sigmoid dynamics while a near linear increase in roots dry biomass was simulated keywords crop growth model grapevine perennials polyetic processes simulation modelling 1 introduction crop growth simulation models developed over the last decades have allowed major advances in better understanding the processes at play in integrating in a formal and quantitative way the knowledge acquired in identifying knowledge gaps in guiding research and inform policies and in improving crop management decisions jones et al 2017 savary et al 2006 the bulk of these efforts have been invested on annual crops jones et al 2017 penning de vries et al 1989 whereas perennial crops or tree species have been considered in a more limited way burkhart and tomé 2012 goldschmidt and lakso 2005 landsberg 1986 le roux et al 2001 the main additional processes to consider in the case of perennial crops as compared to annual crops are polyetic processes that is processes involved over years or over crop cycles zadoks and schein 1979 such processes involve the storage of reserves and the consecutive use of these reserves which depend on the balance between source and demand kozlowski 1992 in the case of grapevine several crop growth models have been developed with varying broad objectives e g better understanding of processes and knowledge synthesis bindi et al 1997a gutierrez et al 1985 nendel and kersebaum 2004 optimization of pruning according to yield and quality lakso and poni 2005 improvement of water management valdés gómez et al 2009 or decision making for crop management cola et al 2014 the dynamics over successive years was simulated by the model developed by nendel and kersebaum 2004 but the dynamics of reserves was not explicitly simulated by the model conversely the model developed by gutierrez et al 1985 and expanded to account for nitrogen dynamics wermelinger et al 1991 explicitly simulates the reserves dynamics but does not simulate crop growth over years crop growth models that incorporate damage mechanisms associated to injuries from pests diseases insects and weeds have been developed in order to analyse the effects of pests on the physiological processes of crop growth and yield build up seven damage mechanisms have been identified including e g light stealing photosynthesis reduction and senescence acceleration which capture the range of mechanisms through which physiological processes are impaired by pests boote et al 1983 rabbinge and rijsdijk 1981 rabbinge and vereyken 1980 the damage mechanisms are generic because they can be applied to the range of pests which are damaging crops and because they operate in the same way for perennial and annual crops savary and willocquet 2014 in the case of perennial crops the effects of injuries from pests may further translate into polyetic processes because they affect crop physiology damage mechanisms may affect the reserves dynamics therefore impacting crop growth processes occurring during the next crop cycle this impact is designated as secondary loss zadoks and schein 1979 i e loss impacting the crop in later years secondary losses have been documented for a few pests affecting perennials e g in the case of coffee diseases cerda et al 2017 a disease such as grapevine rust rarely causes primary loss loss occurring during the crop cycle because infection mainly occurs after harvest primiano et al 2017 it may be hypothesized that the disease causes secondary losses because reserve accumulation after crop maturity may be affected by the disease leading to a reduced growth at the beginning of the next year when reserves are used to start the growth nogueira júnior et al 2017 several models including damage mechanisms have been developed on annual crops such as wheat rossing 1991 willocquet et al 2008 rice pinnschmidt et al 1995 willocquet et al 2004 and potato johnson 1992 van oijen 1992 very few models have been developed in order to analyze the effects of diseases or pests in the case of perennial crops rodríguez et al 2013 to our knowledge no crop growth model for grapevine that includes damage mechanisms for diseases or pests has been developed yet the objective of this work was to develop a simple generic and parameter sparse crop growth model for grapevine which incorporates key physiological processes that occur during a crop cycle and between successive crop cycles and that can be potentially affected by grapevine pests and diseases here we test the performance of the model in reproducing the growth and development of healthy grapevine plants as a precondition for future simulations of pest and disease effects on grapevine the model is applied to the american grapevine vitis labrusca the model was designed in order to be as robust as possible and so that it could be used in the future to analyze the effects of diseases on the physiology and yield of grapevine over successive growing seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 general approach the model described here is designed to incorporate in a later stage damage mechanisms caused by diseases and address primary and secondary losses the objective of the model implies three important specifications 1 the model needs to include processes which are affected by diseases through damage mechanisms 2 the model needs to incorporate polyetic processes in order to simulate crop growth over years and 3 the model needs to simulate in a satisfactory way the growth in the absence of diseases or insect pests that is the attainable growth an additional criterion 4 is that the model is to be as simple as possible i e to include processes according to the specific objective of the model in order to fulfill the first criterion the model was designed so as to include all processes affected by diseases the damage mechanisms described by boote et al 1983 rabbinge and rijsdijk 1981 and rabbinge and vereyken 1980 represent the starting conceptual and methodological stepping stones for the model development the model genecrop savary and willocquet 2014 was recently developed as a generic crop growth model which allows considering damage mechanisms for annual crops and was used as a baseline model for the present analysis the second criterion was fulfilled by incorporating in the model processes which are important for between season dynamics i e the dynamics of reserves in the trunk and in roots in order to fulfill the third and fourth criteria the following approach was used which is derived from willocquet et al 2008 2004 2002 2000 yield loss is the difference between the attainable yield and the actual yield the attainable yield is influenced by determining factors such as radiation and temperature which determine the potential yield and by limiting factors such as water and nutrients rabbinge et al 1989 van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 zadoks and schein 1979 the attainable yield is in turn a reflection of the production situation where a crop is grown i e the socio economic and bio physical environment where agricultural production takes place rabbinge et al 1989 savary et al 2017 since the ultimate objective of the model is not to analyze the effects of limiting factors on crop growth processes such as water and nutrient cycles in the soil were not considered explicitly instead the processes involved in the attainable growth and yield are reflected according to production situation drivers i e drivers that determine the attainable growth these drivers include drivers which determine the potential growth van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 zadoks and schein 1979 such as temperature and radiation as well as drivers which reflect the effects of limiting factors on growth water and nutrients represent the main limiting factors they affect mainly the efficiency of photosynthesis and the acceleration of leaf senescence munne bosch and alegre 2004 sinclair and horie 1989 parameters of the model that represent photosynthesis efficiency and leaf senescence were used as proxies to reflect the effects of limiting factors on growth this allowed accounting for the effects of limiting factors on the attainable growth in a simple way 2 2 overall structure of the genecrop p model and associated hypotheses we developed genecrop p as a simple agrophysiological model for a perennial crop the structure of genecrop p is derived from genecrop savary and willocquet 2014 fig 1 a which is a simple generic crop growth simulation model for annual crops the system modelled in genecrop p is one plant and the model time step is 1 day as in genecrop genecrop p simulates within season crop development crop phenology and crop biomass dynamics whereby the increase in organ biomass originates from a pool of assimilates which is produced from photosynthesis genecrop p further considers between season dynamics and an additional process leading to the increase in assimilated biomass the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk reserves fig 1b the model simulates the plant scale dynamics of the development stage dvs the dry biomass of different organs the leaf area la as well as the leaf area index lai the overall structure of the simulation model genecrop p developed for grapevine is displayed in fig 1c the model considers five plant organs fruits stems roots trunk and leaves the flow of carbohydrates to these different organs as well as the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk the model state variables rates driving functions and parameters are listed in table 1 the development stage of grapevine is scaled from 0 to 4 as follows lorenz et al 1995 bud break dvs 0 flowering dvs 1 maturity dvs 2 leaf fall dvs 3 and dormancy dvs 4 bud break begins after the dormancy period this stage corresponds to the beginning of the active growth phase of the grapevine plant the operational definition of bud break is when 50 of green shoots tips are clearly visible flowering starts after the end of the vegetative period i e 40 60 days after bud break depending on the temperature the flowering development stage is operationally defined as the stage when more than 50 of inflorescences have at least 10 of the flower hoods dropped lorenz et al 1995 maturity occurs when berries begin to brighten in colour the operational definition for maturity is when 100 of berries are ripe for harvest leaf senescence begins after harvest and ends when all leaves have fallen the operational definition of leaf fall is when 100 of leaves are dropped dormancy is the stage with no visible growth however the metabolism of grapevine does not stop completely during dormancy keller 2010 the operational definition for dormancy is the period between leaf fall and bud break plant dvs increases according to the sum of daily temperature stemp above the temperature threshold for grapevine development fig 2 the rate of increase of stemp is dtemp which is computed at each time step 1 day as 1 dtemp tmin tmax 2 tbase where tmin and tmax are the daily minimum and maximum temperatures respectively dvs is computed over successive thresholds of temperature sums as 2 dvs t 0 if stemp t tbud 3 dvs t stemp t tbud tflow tbud if tbud stemp t tflow 4 dvs t 1 stemp t tflow tmat tflow if tflow stemp t tmat 5 dvs t 2 stemp t tmat tfall tmat if tmat stemp t tfall 6 dvs t 3 if stemp t tfall where tbud tflow tmat and tfall are the sums of temperature required to reach the successive development stages of bud break flowering maturity and leaf fall respectively simulations start on august 1 which approximately corresponds to winter pruning and artificial induction of bud break by application of hydrogen cyanamide in southern brazil at the beginning of each year august 1 stemp is re set to zero in order to initiate a new sum of temperature to be computed over the new crop cycle the biomass of assimilates that are produced by photosynthesis is proportional to the radiation intercepted by the canopy monteith 1977 which is a function of lai according to beeŕs law monsi and saeki 1953 the daily rate of growth rg from photosynthesis for an individual plant is computed as 7 rg rad rue 1 e k lai density where rad is the daily global radiation rue is the radiation use efficiency density is the number of grapevine plants per square meter and k is a dimensionless light extinction coefficient fig 3 a the leaf area index is calculated as 8 lai t la t density the leaf area la of a plant is defined by the equation 9 la t sla t leafb t where sla is the specific leaf area and leafb is the leaf dry biomass during the vegetative phase i e from bud break to flowering when lai is still low the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk reserves provides the main source of plant growth fig 3b reallocation from roots ral and trunk tral is defined by the equations 10 ral t rral rootb t 11 tral t trral trunkb t where rral and trral are the relative rates of roots and trunk assimilates reallocation respectively the pool of assimilates originating from photosynthesis and assimilate reallocation is partitioned towards the different organs the rates of growth of the different organs are written as 12 partleaf t pool t cpl t 13 partstem t pool t cps t 14 partfruit t pool t cpf t 15 partroot t pool t cpr t 16 parttrunk t pool t cpt t where cpl t cps t cpf t cpr t and cpt t are partitioning coefficients to leaves stems fruits roots and trunk respectively which depend on the development stage dvs the rate of change of the pool of assimilates is therefore written as 17 pool t pool t 1 rg t 1 r reallocation t 1 r partitioning t 1 δt where r reallocation corresponds to ral tral and r partitioning corresponds to the sum of the rates of partitioning partleaf partstem partfruit partroot and parttrunk leaf senescence is represented by a rate of loss of leaf dry biomass rsen and occurs between maturity dvs 2 and leaf fall dvs 3 rsen is proportional to a relative rate of leaf senescence rrsen which depends on the development stage and on the dry biomass of leaves leafb 18 rsen t rrsen t leafb t several pruning operations are usually performed during the growing season of a grapevine plant the rates of leaf rlp and stem rsp dry biomass removal by pruning are included in the model as outflows from leafb and stemb according to 19 rlp t rrlsp t leafb t 20 rsp t rrlsp t stemb t where rrlsp is the relative rate of leaf and stem dry biomass removal by pruning winter pruning corresponds to the removal of stems and is reflected in the model as 21 rsp stemb if dvs 4 fruit harvest is included in the model as an outflow from fruitb at maturity dvs 2 the rate of fruit dry biomass removal by harvest rharv is equal to fruitb rharv is equal to zero at all other times the detailed model structure is displayed in appendix a 2 3 experimental measurements measurements were conducted in 2014 and 2015 on a vineyard planted in 2010 with cv niagara rosada at the university of sao paulo 22 24 30 s 47 38 30 w grapevine plants were grown at 2 m 1 m spacing in a vertical trellis training system plants were drip irrigated daily for 30 min from the bud break to leaf fall fertilisation was performed three times within the growing season i one month before winter pruning 150 g urea 600 g single superphosphate 160 g potassium chloride and 20 kg manure per plant ii at bud break 120 g urea and 160 g potassium chloride per plant and at berry pea size stage 120 g urea and 160 g potassium chloride per plant fungicide sprays were performed once a week with one of the following fungicides in alternation strobilurins dithio carbamates acylalanines and triazoles to control the major diseases of grapevine solar radiation and air temperature were measured with a weather station campbell scientific cr100 located 150 m from the experimental vineyard sensor outputs were monitored with a campbell scientific cr800x data logger weather data were collected every 15 min in both years observations were made weekly on 60 plants in order to assess the development stage from bud break until leaf fall and to count the number of leaves per stem from harvest until leaf fall the weekly average of leaf number over the sampled plants was computed and denoted nl finally the yield fresh fruit biomass was measured in both years on 60 plants in 2015 the fresh and dry biomass of 100 grape clusters harvested at random from 60 plants were weighted and a linear regression was established between dry biomass as the dependent variable y and fresh biomass as the independent variable x this relationship was used to estimate the fruit dry biomass per plant based on the fresh fruit biomass furthermore the dry biomass of leaves and stems were measured in three plants at harvest and the dry biomass of trunks and roots were measured in three plants at leaf fall plant organs were dried at 65 c for one week prior to measuring their dry biomass finally the total leaf area of three plants was measured with a portable area meter li cor 3100 at harvest 2 4 model parameterisation the parameters k rue sla tbase and the sum of temperatures to reach the development stages bud beak flowering and maturity were obtained from the literature table 2 the relative rates of reallocation rral and rrtral were calculated from the decrease of roots and trunk dry biomass measured in vitis labrusca cv concord bates et al 2002 the coefficients of partitioning fig 4 were obtained from nendel and kersebaum 2004 plant density was set to 0 5 corresponding to an inter row distance of 2 m and an intra row distance of 1 m such a density is commonly used in brazilian experimental and commercial vineyards tfall and rrsen were estimated from measurements made in 2014 in the experimental vineyard described in section 2 3 tfall was estimated from the estimations made on development stage and from the daily mean temperature data recorded the number of leaves per stem nl counted weekly from maturity to leaf fall was used to calculate rrsen 22 rrsen t nl t 1 nl t nl t 1 δt the relative rate of pruning rrlsp was determined on the basis of practices generally performed on cv niagara rosada in brazil embrapa 2003 in the beginning of the crop cycle 30 days after winter pruning half of the shoots are removed by a sprouting pruning rrlsp was therefore set to 0 5 at this date at 70 and 100 days after the winter pruning pruning of top and lateral shoots is usually performed rrlsp was set to 0 4 and 0 3 respectively according to current pruning practices embrapa 2003 2 5 model evaluation in a first stage the model was evaluated by comparing the simulated dynamics to data measured in the experimental vineyard see section 2 3 grape growth was simulated for 2014 and 2015 using the daily temperature and radiation derived from the measurements made with the campbell equipment see section 2 3 simulated dvs leaf area and dry organs biomass were visually compared to the observed mean and 95 confidence interval values measured in the experimental vineyard see section 2 3 in 2015 simulated and observed yields were also compared in 2014 this comparison was possible because the parameters determined from the experimental vineyard in 2014 rrsen and tfall relate to processes occurring after maturity and therefore did not influence the yield conversely the comparison between observed and simulated dvs 3 leaf fall in 2014 was not possible because the observed value of dvs 3 in 2014 was used to estimate tfall in a second stage simulations were performed over 20 years to simulate the dynamics of dry biomass and leaf area in order to assess the behaviour of the system over successive years values of rad tmin and tmax were set to 18 mj m 2 day 1 17 c and 30 c respectively which correspond to the annual average over 2011 2015 in the experimental vineyard 3 results 3 1 comparison of simulated and observed dynamics simulated and observed dvs were close in 2014 and 2015 fig 5 in 2014 the differences between simulated and actual dvs were 3 4 and 9 days for bud break flowering and maturity respectively fig 5 in 2015 actual and simulated dvs were similar to those observed in 2014 the maximum difference between simulated and actual dvs 18 days was observed for dvs 3 leaf fall in 2015 the linear relationship of fruit dry biomass and fruit fresh weight r2 0 97 from measurements made in 2015 in the experimental vineyard was 23 fruit dry biomass g 1 25 0 16 fruit fresh biomass g eq 23 allows comparing simulated dry biomass and observed yields simulated dry biomass of leaf stem and trunk and total leaf area were within the 95 confidence interval of mean observed values in 2015 table 3 however this was not the case for root dry biomass which was overestimated by 155 g and for fruit dry biomass which was overestimated by 95 g and 96 g in 2014 and 2015 respectively table 3 3 2 dynamics over successive years simulation of the development stages predicted occurrence of bud break flowering maturity and leaf fall at 14 38 140 and 240 days respectively fig 6 these dates correspond to august 14 september 7 december 18 and march 28 a short vegetative period three weeks and a half was followed by a reproductive stage and by a post harvest stage which lasted each more than three months simulated dynamics of biomass of organs for a 5 year old grapevine are displayed in fig 7 simulated leaf dry biomass increased from bud break dvs 0 to maturity dvs 2 with a general sigmoid curve in which three abrupt declines occurred at the dates of pruning fig 7a maximum leaf dry biomass was 350 g at maturity and then declined because of physiological leaf senescence according to a negative exponential until the end of leaf fall fig 7a the dynamics of leaf area was close to that of dry biomass of leaves fig 7b with a maximum value of 5 m2 per grapevine plant the dynamics of the dry biomass of stems was similar to that of the dry biomass of leaves until maturity fig 7a after maturity the dry biomass of stems continued to increase but tapered off as dvs increased from 2 to 3 this decline in growth of the biomass of stems is associated to the decline in lai which reduces the rate of growth and to the decrease in partitioning towards stems fig 4 the maximum value of stem dry biomass was 520 g the fruit dry biomass increased according to an exponential shape and reached a maximum value of 550 gplant 1 at maturity fig 7a the root and trunk dry biomass decreased from bud break to flowering due to the reallocation of assimilates from these organs during the vegetative stage this biomass then marginally increased until maturity and then strongly from maturity to leaf fall as the partitioning of assimilates towards roots and trunk increased fig 4 the dry biomass of roots was larger than the dry biomass of trunk and final values reached were 1049 g and 868 g for roots and trunk respectively the dynamics of dry biomass of trunk and root over two successive years 3 and 4 year old grapevine is displayed in fig 8 this pattern indicates the progressive increase of biomass over years in spite of the decrease during the vegetative stage when assimilates are reallocated for the growth of stems and leaves simulation of grapevine dry biomass over 20 years indicates a near linear increase in organs dry biomass and leaf area at maturity during the first 6 years followed by an increase which becomes lower over years fig 9 the curves of leaf area fig 9a stem fig 9b fruit fig 9c and trunk fig 9d dry biomass then turned asymptotic years 7 20 the root dry biomass increased nearly linearly over the 20 years of simulation fig 9d at the end of the simulation period 20 years the estimated values of leaf area and of the biomasses of leaves stems fruits trunk and roots were 8 m2 per plant and 544 655 728 1473 and 3597 g per plant respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model features the model described here fulfills the criteria which were outlined to design the model 1 it includes processes which are affected by injuries and therefore is suitable to be used in further analyses which address yield losses caused by grape diseases 2 it simulates the dynamics of growth over years 3 it allows simulating in a satisfactory way the attainable growth and yield over successive growing seasons and 4 it includes as few variables and parameters as possible an important feature of this model is that it does not include processes important in the attainable growth of a crop e g the nutrient or water dynamics instead production situation drivers such as rue and rrsen are used as proxies to reflect attainable growth at pre set levels of growth limiting factors willocquet et al 2008 2004 2002 2000 in future analyses with this model the values attached to these parameters need to be carefully determined in order to consider a range of production situations on the basis of experimental measurements 4 2 model evaluation the comparison of simulated and observed dvs fig 5 indicates that the model accounts for the phenology of cv niagara rosada reasonably well for bud break flowering and maturity the differences between the duration of observed and simulated bud break flowering and maturity were 2 6 and 2 days respectively the simulated period for leaf fall was however over estimated the temperature threshold for leaf fall was determined with data from our experimental vineyard in 2014 new calculations for temperature threshold of leaf fall would be useful to improve the modelling of the leaf fall development stage the simulated dates for bud break flowering and maturity development stages fig 6 were august 18 september 12 and december 11 in 2014 and august 17 september 11 and december 4 in 2015 which corresponded well to the dates commonly observed for cv niagara rosada in brazil scarpare et al 2012 the development stage periods in grapevines cv niagara rosada observed from 2004 to 2008 were 16 44 and 138 days for bud break flowering and maturity respectively scarpare et al 2012 the simulated periods of these development stages were also closely related to the observed periods of development stages for cv isabel another vitis labrusca cultivar commonly cultivated in brazil roberto et al 2004 the simulated period of dormancy occurs between march and july which is the typical dormancy period for cv niagara rosada maia and camargo 2012 the simulated values for the biomass of roots were higher than the biomass of roots measured in the experimental vineyard table 3 the mismatch between these values may be caused by an experimental underestimation or by an overestimation by the model of the root dry biomass samples of perennial root systems commonly underestimate the actual size or weight of roots herralde et al 2010 there are only a few quantitative studies for grapevine roots in the vineyard the dry biomass of roots estimated for 3 year old cv concord vitis labrusca ranged from 290 g at bud break to 605 g at leaf fall bates et al 2002 the dry biomass of roots was below 350 g at the end of flowering in a 3 year old vitis vinifera cvs pinot noir and merlot vineyard zapata et al 2001 the above ranges of root dry biomass were comparable to the simulated dry biomass of roots at maturity on 3 and 4 year old plants which were 125 g and 273 g respectively fig 9 the lack of quantitative data from root biomass is in part due to inadequate methods and to the human effort needed to assess belowground processes herralde et al 2010 in the genecrop p model the dry biomass of roots increases almost linearly over the simulation period 20 years which can lead to an overestimation of simulated dry biomass of roots the model does not account for root senescence or decay which has been observed for young 3 year old grapevine plants zapata et al 2001 the hypothesized additional effect of root senescence and decay is illustrated in fig 9d additional experimental data would be needed to test this hypothesis and improve the modelling of root dynamics the dry biomass of fruits simulated for a 7 year old plant was 590 g which is close to the average yield 513 g dry biomass of fruit per plant observed in cv niagara rosada grafted on different rootstocks in experimental vineyards in brazil pedro et al 2007 terra et al 2003 the yield of grapevine plants is highly variable as it depends on numerous factors including cultivar training system and shoot pruning intensity in brazil a sprouting pruning is performed in cv niagara rosada in order to limit canopy density to 8 stems per plant as a consequence the maximum number of clusters per plant is about 16 by contrast grapevines with high density canopies can develop up to 60 shoots per plant and up to 80 clusters per plant cola et al 2014 the simulated lai values 2 2 m2 m 2 for 5 year old plants was similar to observed lai 1 8 m2 m 2 in our experimental vineyard maximum values of lai can vary importantly and ranges from 1 to 8 m2 m 2 depending on grapevine cultivar and training system pedro et al 2007 sánchez de miguel et al 2010 genecrop p estimated a lai of 4 la 8 m2 at maturity for 20 year old plants simulated dry biomass of stems and trunk were also close to observed data in our experimental vineyard the dry biomass of stems highly depends on the training and pruning systems a dry biomass of stems of 1000 g was observed in cv concord pruned to 40 stems per plant bates et al 2002 this value which corresponds to 25 g stem 1 is similar to the value simulated by genecrop p 22 5 g stem 1 4 3 processes modelled within and over seasons a decrease in dry biomass of roots and trunk takes place in the beginning of the grapevine cycle every year as a result of the process of assimilate reallocation as shown by bates et al 2002 around 40 of trunk and roots biomass is reallocated from bud break to flowering the dynamics of fruits dry biomass over 20 years showed a large near linear increase of fruit yield over the first six years followed by a yield increase which becomes marginal as plants are ageing this pattern is in agreement with a continuous increase in yield which was observed over the first five years in brazilian vineyards planted with cv niagara rosada terra et al 2003 in washington state full production of grapevine cv concord v labrusca can also be reached from the fifth year after planting aegerter and folwell 1996 the yield of 5 year old niagara rosada was 3 6 kg plant 1 in a brazilian vineyard terra et al 2003 which conforms very well the simulated value of 3 0 kg plant 1 by genecrop p genecrop p represents the processes involved in photosynthesis in a simple way using monteith s framework this framework is widely used in annual crop growth models such as rice wheat ritchie and otter 1985 savary and willocquet 2014 willocquet et al 2008 2000 potato johnson 1992 and maize mollier et al 2008 most perennial crop growth models however use different and often complex approaches for photosynthesis modelling for a review see le roux et al 2001 there are few crop growth models of trees using monteith s framework to model photosynthesis and biomass production some examples include the individual tree growth models proposed by west 1993 and the model for the structural growth of young scots pine crowns kellomäki and strandman 1995 the model developed by bindi et al 1997b for grapevine also used a modification of monteith s framework and the value of rue used in genecrop p was derived from their work implementing monteith s framework implies only few parameters and daily inputs we chose to use a simple robust approach which may be sufficient to simulate the dynamics and production of dry biomass of grapevine the outputs of genecrop p were in reasonable agreement with the literature and with data collected in our experimental vineyard 4 4 model genericity the model described here allows the simulation of the dynamics of grape biomass not only within a crop cycle but also over successive crop cycles a robust simulation of the bud break date is critical to all successive dvs and can be modelled according to thermal sum accumulation after vernalisation in temperate areas nendel 2010 in the case of v labrusca in southern brazil bud break is artificially induced by application of hydrogen cyanamide the sum of temperature from hydrogen cyanamide application to bud break therefore allows a good representation of the date of bud break under such conditions the processes incorporated into the model in order to simulate these within and between cycle dynamics should represent a robust basis to address the effects of diseases on the physiology and yield formation of grape over years diseases in grapes can result in substantial losses in production wilcox et al 2015 some polycyclic diseases such as powdery and downy mildew can cause important yield reductions within a season other polyclyclic diseases such as asian rust phakopsora euvitis reduce yield in the next season phakopsora euvitis generally occurs after harvest and causes early defoliation as a consequence the assimilate reserves in the trunk and roots are reduced which negatively impact the early stages of growth during the following season nogueira júnior et al 2017 genecrop p coupled with damage mechanisms caused by grape diseases could help estimating such polyetic damage caused by diseases that mainly develop after harvest the current model structure may also represent a sound basis to simulate the dynamics of perennial species and particularly could be used in order to analyze and model the dynamics of fruit trees acknowledgments the authors acknowledge são paulo research

25339,a process based model was developed to simulate the dynamics of grapevine growth within and over years the model was designed so that it could be used in a later stage to incorporate damage mechanisms of grape diseases and to analyse their effects on growth and yield over consecutive seasons the development stage is modelled according to temperature the within season dynamics includes 1 the production of assimilates from photosynthesis 2 the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk during the vegetative phase of the crop cycle 3 the partitioning of assimilates towards leaves stems grapes roots and trunk 4 the accumulation of assimilates in roots and trunk after maturity and 5 leaf senescence winter and within season pruning are also included the model was parameterised for vitis labrusca using literature and experimental data the model was tested with data collected from a 5 year old vineyard of v labrusca cv niagara rosada and evaluated by comparing outputs with data from the literature the model satisfactorily reproduced the general dynamics of plant growth within year and over successive seasons simulation over 20 years indicated that biomass of leaf stem grape and trunk at grapevine maturity increased according to a sigmoid dynamics while a near linear increase in roots dry biomass was simulated keywords crop growth model grapevine perennials polyetic processes simulation modelling 1 introduction crop growth simulation models developed over the last decades have allowed major advances in better understanding the processes at play in integrating in a formal and quantitative way the knowledge acquired in identifying knowledge gaps in guiding research and inform policies and in improving crop management decisions jones et al 2017 savary et al 2006 the bulk of these efforts have been invested on annual crops jones et al 2017 penning de vries et al 1989 whereas perennial crops or tree species have been considered in a more limited way burkhart and tomé 2012 goldschmidt and lakso 2005 landsberg 1986 le roux et al 2001 the main additional processes to consider in the case of perennial crops as compared to annual crops are polyetic processes that is processes involved over years or over crop cycles zadoks and schein 1979 such processes involve the storage of reserves and the consecutive use of these reserves which depend on the balance between source and demand kozlowski 1992 in the case of grapevine several crop growth models have been developed with varying broad objectives e g better understanding of processes and knowledge synthesis bindi et al 1997a gutierrez et al 1985 nendel and kersebaum 2004 optimization of pruning according to yield and quality lakso and poni 2005 improvement of water management valdés gómez et al 2009 or decision making for crop management cola et al 2014 the dynamics over successive years was simulated by the model developed by nendel and kersebaum 2004 but the dynamics of reserves was not explicitly simulated by the model conversely the model developed by gutierrez et al 1985 and expanded to account for nitrogen dynamics wermelinger et al 1991 explicitly simulates the reserves dynamics but does not simulate crop growth over years crop growth models that incorporate damage mechanisms associated to injuries from pests diseases insects and weeds have been developed in order to analyse the effects of pests on the physiological processes of crop growth and yield build up seven damage mechanisms have been identified including e g light stealing photosynthesis reduction and senescence acceleration which capture the range of mechanisms through which physiological processes are impaired by pests boote et al 1983 rabbinge and rijsdijk 1981 rabbinge and vereyken 1980 the damage mechanisms are generic because they can be applied to the range of pests which are damaging crops and because they operate in the same way for perennial and annual crops savary and willocquet 2014 in the case of perennial crops the effects of injuries from pests may further translate into polyetic processes because they affect crop physiology damage mechanisms may affect the reserves dynamics therefore impacting crop growth processes occurring during the next crop cycle this impact is designated as secondary loss zadoks and schein 1979 i e loss impacting the crop in later years secondary losses have been documented for a few pests affecting perennials e g in the case of coffee diseases cerda et al 2017 a disease such as grapevine rust rarely causes primary loss loss occurring during the crop cycle because infection mainly occurs after harvest primiano et al 2017 it may be hypothesized that the disease causes secondary losses because reserve accumulation after crop maturity may be affected by the disease leading to a reduced growth at the beginning of the next year when reserves are used to start the growth nogueira júnior et al 2017 several models including damage mechanisms have been developed on annual crops such as wheat rossing 1991 willocquet et al 2008 rice pinnschmidt et al 1995 willocquet et al 2004 and potato johnson 1992 van oijen 1992 very few models have been developed in order to analyze the effects of diseases or pests in the case of perennial crops rodríguez et al 2013 to our knowledge no crop growth model for grapevine that includes damage mechanisms for diseases or pests has been developed yet the objective of this work was to develop a simple generic and parameter sparse crop growth model for grapevine which incorporates key physiological processes that occur during a crop cycle and between successive crop cycles and that can be potentially affected by grapevine pests and diseases here we test the performance of the model in reproducing the growth and development of healthy grapevine plants as a precondition for future simulations of pest and disease effects on grapevine the model is applied to the american grapevine vitis labrusca the model was designed in order to be as robust as possible and so that it could be used in the future to analyze the effects of diseases on the physiology and yield of grapevine over successive growing seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 general approach the model described here is designed to incorporate in a later stage damage mechanisms caused by diseases and address primary and secondary losses the objective of the model implies three important specifications 1 the model needs to include processes which are affected by diseases through damage mechanisms 2 the model needs to incorporate polyetic processes in order to simulate crop growth over years and 3 the model needs to simulate in a satisfactory way the growth in the absence of diseases or insect pests that is the attainable growth an additional criterion 4 is that the model is to be as simple as possible i e to include processes according to the specific objective of the model in order to fulfill the first criterion the model was designed so as to include all processes affected by diseases the damage mechanisms described by boote et al 1983 rabbinge and rijsdijk 1981 and rabbinge and vereyken 1980 represent the starting conceptual and methodological stepping stones for the model development the model genecrop savary and willocquet 2014 was recently developed as a generic crop growth model which allows considering damage mechanisms for annual crops and was used as a baseline model for the present analysis the second criterion was fulfilled by incorporating in the model processes which are important for between season dynamics i e the dynamics of reserves in the trunk and in roots in order to fulfill the third and fourth criteria the following approach was used which is derived from willocquet et al 2008 2004 2002 2000 yield loss is the difference between the attainable yield and the actual yield the attainable yield is influenced by determining factors such as radiation and temperature which determine the potential yield and by limiting factors such as water and nutrients rabbinge et al 1989 van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 zadoks and schein 1979 the attainable yield is in turn a reflection of the production situation where a crop is grown i e the socio economic and bio physical environment where agricultural production takes place rabbinge et al 1989 savary et al 2017 since the ultimate objective of the model is not to analyze the effects of limiting factors on crop growth processes such as water and nutrient cycles in the soil were not considered explicitly instead the processes involved in the attainable growth and yield are reflected according to production situation drivers i e drivers that determine the attainable growth these drivers include drivers which determine the potential growth van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 zadoks and schein 1979 such as temperature and radiation as well as drivers which reflect the effects of limiting factors on growth water and nutrients represent the main limiting factors they affect mainly the efficiency of photosynthesis and the acceleration of leaf senescence munne bosch and alegre 2004 sinclair and horie 1989 parameters of the model that represent photosynthesis efficiency and leaf senescence were used as proxies to reflect the effects of limiting factors on growth this allowed accounting for the effects of limiting factors on the attainable growth in a simple way 2 2 overall structure of the genecrop p model and associated hypotheses we developed genecrop p as a simple agrophysiological model for a perennial crop the structure of genecrop p is derived from genecrop savary and willocquet 2014 fig 1 a which is a simple generic crop growth simulation model for annual crops the system modelled in genecrop p is one plant and the model time step is 1 day as in genecrop genecrop p simulates within season crop development crop phenology and crop biomass dynamics whereby the increase in organ biomass originates from a pool of assimilates which is produced from photosynthesis genecrop p further considers between season dynamics and an additional process leading to the increase in assimilated biomass the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk reserves fig 1b the model simulates the plant scale dynamics of the development stage dvs the dry biomass of different organs the leaf area la as well as the leaf area index lai the overall structure of the simulation model genecrop p developed for grapevine is displayed in fig 1c the model considers five plant organs fruits stems roots trunk and leaves the flow of carbohydrates to these different organs as well as the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk the model state variables rates driving functions and parameters are listed in table 1 the development stage of grapevine is scaled from 0 to 4 as follows lorenz et al 1995 bud break dvs 0 flowering dvs 1 maturity dvs 2 leaf fall dvs 3 and dormancy dvs 4 bud break begins after the dormancy period this stage corresponds to the beginning of the active growth phase of the grapevine plant the operational definition of bud break is when 50 of green shoots tips are clearly visible flowering starts after the end of the vegetative period i e 40 60 days after bud break depending on the temperature the flowering development stage is operationally defined as the stage when more than 50 of inflorescences have at least 10 of the flower hoods dropped lorenz et al 1995 maturity occurs when berries begin to brighten in colour the operational definition for maturity is when 100 of berries are ripe for harvest leaf senescence begins after harvest and ends when all leaves have fallen the operational definition of leaf fall is when 100 of leaves are dropped dormancy is the stage with no visible growth however the metabolism of grapevine does not stop completely during dormancy keller 2010 the operational definition for dormancy is the period between leaf fall and bud break plant dvs increases according to the sum of daily temperature stemp above the temperature threshold for grapevine development fig 2 the rate of increase of stemp is dtemp which is computed at each time step 1 day as 1 dtemp tmin tmax 2 tbase where tmin and tmax are the daily minimum and maximum temperatures respectively dvs is computed over successive thresholds of temperature sums as 2 dvs t 0 if stemp t tbud 3 dvs t stemp t tbud tflow tbud if tbud stemp t tflow 4 dvs t 1 stemp t tflow tmat tflow if tflow stemp t tmat 5 dvs t 2 stemp t tmat tfall tmat if tmat stemp t tfall 6 dvs t 3 if stemp t tfall where tbud tflow tmat and tfall are the sums of temperature required to reach the successive development stages of bud break flowering maturity and leaf fall respectively simulations start on august 1 which approximately corresponds to winter pruning and artificial induction of bud break by application of hydrogen cyanamide in southern brazil at the beginning of each year august 1 stemp is re set to zero in order to initiate a new sum of temperature to be computed over the new crop cycle the biomass of assimilates that are produced by photosynthesis is proportional to the radiation intercepted by the canopy monteith 1977 which is a function of lai according to beeŕs law monsi and saeki 1953 the daily rate of growth rg from photosynthesis for an individual plant is computed as 7 rg rad rue 1 e k lai density where rad is the daily global radiation rue is the radiation use efficiency density is the number of grapevine plants per square meter and k is a dimensionless light extinction coefficient fig 3 a the leaf area index is calculated as 8 lai t la t density the leaf area la of a plant is defined by the equation 9 la t sla t leafb t where sla is the specific leaf area and leafb is the leaf dry biomass during the vegetative phase i e from bud break to flowering when lai is still low the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk reserves provides the main source of plant growth fig 3b reallocation from roots ral and trunk tral is defined by the equations 10 ral t rral rootb t 11 tral t trral trunkb t where rral and trral are the relative rates of roots and trunk assimilates reallocation respectively the pool of assimilates originating from photosynthesis and assimilate reallocation is partitioned towards the different organs the rates of growth of the different organs are written as 12 partleaf t pool t cpl t 13 partstem t pool t cps t 14 partfruit t pool t cpf t 15 partroot t pool t cpr t 16 parttrunk t pool t cpt t where cpl t cps t cpf t cpr t and cpt t are partitioning coefficients to leaves stems fruits roots and trunk respectively which depend on the development stage dvs the rate of change of the pool of assimilates is therefore written as 17 pool t pool t 1 rg t 1 r reallocation t 1 r partitioning t 1 δt where r reallocation corresponds to ral tral and r partitioning corresponds to the sum of the rates of partitioning partleaf partstem partfruit partroot and parttrunk leaf senescence is represented by a rate of loss of leaf dry biomass rsen and occurs between maturity dvs 2 and leaf fall dvs 3 rsen is proportional to a relative rate of leaf senescence rrsen which depends on the development stage and on the dry biomass of leaves leafb 18 rsen t rrsen t leafb t several pruning operations are usually performed during the growing season of a grapevine plant the rates of leaf rlp and stem rsp dry biomass removal by pruning are included in the model as outflows from leafb and stemb according to 19 rlp t rrlsp t leafb t 20 rsp t rrlsp t stemb t where rrlsp is the relative rate of leaf and stem dry biomass removal by pruning winter pruning corresponds to the removal of stems and is reflected in the model as 21 rsp stemb if dvs 4 fruit harvest is included in the model as an outflow from fruitb at maturity dvs 2 the rate of fruit dry biomass removal by harvest rharv is equal to fruitb rharv is equal to zero at all other times the detailed model structure is displayed in appendix a 2 3 experimental measurements measurements were conducted in 2014 and 2015 on a vineyard planted in 2010 with cv niagara rosada at the university of sao paulo 22 24 30 s 47 38 30 w grapevine plants were grown at 2 m 1 m spacing in a vertical trellis training system plants were drip irrigated daily for 30 min from the bud break to leaf fall fertilisation was performed three times within the growing season i one month before winter pruning 150 g urea 600 g single superphosphate 160 g potassium chloride and 20 kg manure per plant ii at bud break 120 g urea and 160 g potassium chloride per plant and at berry pea size stage 120 g urea and 160 g potassium chloride per plant fungicide sprays were performed once a week with one of the following fungicides in alternation strobilurins dithio carbamates acylalanines and triazoles to control the major diseases of grapevine solar radiation and air temperature were measured with a weather station campbell scientific cr100 located 150 m from the experimental vineyard sensor outputs were monitored with a campbell scientific cr800x data logger weather data were collected every 15 min in both years observations were made weekly on 60 plants in order to assess the development stage from bud break until leaf fall and to count the number of leaves per stem from harvest until leaf fall the weekly average of leaf number over the sampled plants was computed and denoted nl finally the yield fresh fruit biomass was measured in both years on 60 plants in 2015 the fresh and dry biomass of 100 grape clusters harvested at random from 60 plants were weighted and a linear regression was established between dry biomass as the dependent variable y and fresh biomass as the independent variable x this relationship was used to estimate the fruit dry biomass per plant based on the fresh fruit biomass furthermore the dry biomass of leaves and stems were measured in three plants at harvest and the dry biomass of trunks and roots were measured in three plants at leaf fall plant organs were dried at 65 c for one week prior to measuring their dry biomass finally the total leaf area of three plants was measured with a portable area meter li cor 3100 at harvest 2 4 model parameterisation the parameters k rue sla tbase and the sum of temperatures to reach the development stages bud beak flowering and maturity were obtained from the literature table 2 the relative rates of reallocation rral and rrtral were calculated from the decrease of roots and trunk dry biomass measured in vitis labrusca cv concord bates et al 2002 the coefficients of partitioning fig 4 were obtained from nendel and kersebaum 2004 plant density was set to 0 5 corresponding to an inter row distance of 2 m and an intra row distance of 1 m such a density is commonly used in brazilian experimental and commercial vineyards tfall and rrsen were estimated from measurements made in 2014 in the experimental vineyard described in section 2 3 tfall was estimated from the estimations made on development stage and from the daily mean temperature data recorded the number of leaves per stem nl counted weekly from maturity to leaf fall was used to calculate rrsen 22 rrsen t nl t 1 nl t nl t 1 δt the relative rate of pruning rrlsp was determined on the basis of practices generally performed on cv niagara rosada in brazil embrapa 2003 in the beginning of the crop cycle 30 days after winter pruning half of the shoots are removed by a sprouting pruning rrlsp was therefore set to 0 5 at this date at 70 and 100 days after the winter pruning pruning of top and lateral shoots is usually performed rrlsp was set to 0 4 and 0 3 respectively according to current pruning practices embrapa 2003 2 5 model evaluation in a first stage the model was evaluated by comparing the simulated dynamics to data measured in the experimental vineyard see section 2 3 grape growth was simulated for 2014 and 2015 using the daily temperature and radiation derived from the measurements made with the campbell equipment see section 2 3 simulated dvs leaf area and dry organs biomass were visually compared to the observed mean and 95 confidence interval values measured in the experimental vineyard see section 2 3 in 2015 simulated and observed yields were also compared in 2014 this comparison was possible because the parameters determined from the experimental vineyard in 2014 rrsen and tfall relate to processes occurring after maturity and therefore did not influence the yield conversely the comparison between observed and simulated dvs 3 leaf fall in 2014 was not possible because the observed value of dvs 3 in 2014 was used to estimate tfall in a second stage simulations were performed over 20 years to simulate the dynamics of dry biomass and leaf area in order to assess the behaviour of the system over successive years values of rad tmin and tmax were set to 18 mj m 2 day 1 17 c and 30 c respectively which correspond to the annual average over 2011 2015 in the experimental vineyard 3 results 3 1 comparison of simulated and observed dynamics simulated and observed dvs were close in 2014 and 2015 fig 5 in 2014 the differences between simulated and actual dvs were 3 4 and 9 days for bud break flowering and maturity respectively fig 5 in 2015 actual and simulated dvs were similar to those observed in 2014 the maximum difference between simulated and actual dvs 18 days was observed for dvs 3 leaf fall in 2015 the linear relationship of fruit dry biomass and fruit fresh weight r2 0 97 from measurements made in 2015 in the experimental vineyard was 23 fruit dry biomass g 1 25 0 16 fruit fresh biomass g eq 23 allows comparing simulated dry biomass and observed yields simulated dry biomass of leaf stem and trunk and total leaf area were within the 95 confidence interval of mean observed values in 2015 table 3 however this was not the case for root dry biomass which was overestimated by 155 g and for fruit dry biomass which was overestimated by 95 g and 96 g in 2014 and 2015 respectively table 3 3 2 dynamics over successive years simulation of the development stages predicted occurrence of bud break flowering maturity and leaf fall at 14 38 140 and 240 days respectively fig 6 these dates correspond to august 14 september 7 december 18 and march 28 a short vegetative period three weeks and a half was followed by a reproductive stage and by a post harvest stage which lasted each more than three months simulated dynamics of biomass of organs for a 5 year old grapevine are displayed in fig 7 simulated leaf dry biomass increased from bud break dvs 0 to maturity dvs 2 with a general sigmoid curve in which three abrupt declines occurred at the dates of pruning fig 7a maximum leaf dry biomass was 350 g at maturity and then declined because of physiological leaf senescence according to a negative exponential until the end of leaf fall fig 7a the dynamics of leaf area was close to that of dry biomass of leaves fig 7b with a maximum value of 5 m2 per grapevine plant the dynamics of the dry biomass of stems was similar to that of the dry biomass of leaves until maturity fig 7a after maturity the dry biomass of stems continued to increase but tapered off as dvs increased from 2 to 3 this decline in growth of the biomass of stems is associated to the decline in lai which reduces the rate of growth and to the decrease in partitioning towards stems fig 4 the maximum value of stem dry biomass was 520 g the fruit dry biomass increased according to an exponential shape and reached a maximum value of 550 gplant 1 at maturity fig 7a the root and trunk dry biomass decreased from bud break to flowering due to the reallocation of assimilates from these organs during the vegetative stage this biomass then marginally increased until maturity and then strongly from maturity to leaf fall as the partitioning of assimilates towards roots and trunk increased fig 4 the dry biomass of roots was larger than the dry biomass of trunk and final values reached were 1049 g and 868 g for roots and trunk respectively the dynamics of dry biomass of trunk and root over two successive years 3 and 4 year old grapevine is displayed in fig 8 this pattern indicates the progressive increase of biomass over years in spite of the decrease during the vegetative stage when assimilates are reallocated for the growth of stems and leaves simulation of grapevine dry biomass over 20 years indicates a near linear increase in organs dry biomass and leaf area at maturity during the first 6 years followed by an increase which becomes lower over years fig 9 the curves of leaf area fig 9a stem fig 9b fruit fig 9c and trunk fig 9d dry biomass then turned asymptotic years 7 20 the root dry biomass increased nearly linearly over the 20 years of simulation fig 9d at the end of the simulation period 20 years the estimated values of leaf area and of the biomasses of leaves stems fruits trunk and roots were 8 m2 per plant and 544 655 728 1473 and 3597 g per plant respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model features the model described here fulfills the criteria which were outlined to design the model 1 it includes processes which are affected by injuries and therefore is suitable to be used in further analyses which address yield losses caused by grape diseases 2 it simulates the dynamics of growth over years 3 it allows simulating in a satisfactory way the attainable growth and yield over successive growing seasons and 4 it includes as few variables and parameters as possible an important feature of this model is that it does not include processes important in the attainable growth of a crop e g the nutrient or water dynamics instead production situation drivers such as rue and rrsen are used as proxies to reflect attainable growth at pre set levels of growth limiting factors willocquet et al 2008 2004 2002 2000 in future analyses with this model the values attached to these parameters need to be carefully determined in order to consider a range of production situations on the basis of experimental measurements 4 2 model evaluation the comparison of simulated and observed dvs fig 5 indicates that the model accounts for the phenology of cv niagara rosada reasonably well for bud break flowering and maturity the differences between the duration of observed and simulated bud break flowering and maturity were 2 6 and 2 days respectively the simulated period for leaf fall was however over estimated the temperature threshold for leaf fall was determined with data from our experimental vineyard in 2014 new calculations for temperature threshold of leaf fall would be useful to improve the modelling of the leaf fall development stage the simulated dates for bud break flowering and maturity development stages fig 6 were august 18 september 12 and december 11 in 2014 and august 17 september 11 and december 4 in 2015 which corresponded well to the dates commonly observed for cv niagara rosada in brazil scarpare et al 2012 the development stage periods in grapevines cv niagara rosada observed from 2004 to 2008 were 16 44 and 138 days for bud break flowering and maturity respectively scarpare et al 2012 the simulated periods of these development stages were also closely related to the observed periods of development stages for cv isabel another vitis labrusca cultivar commonly cultivated in brazil roberto et al 2004 the simulated period of dormancy occurs between march and july which is the typical dormancy period for cv niagara rosada maia and camargo 2012 the simulated values for the biomass of roots were higher than the biomass of roots measured in the experimental vineyard table 3 the mismatch between these values may be caused by an experimental underestimation or by an overestimation by the model of the root dry biomass samples of perennial root systems commonly underestimate the actual size or weight of roots herralde et al 2010 there are only a few quantitative studies for grapevine roots in the vineyard the dry biomass of roots estimated for 3 year old cv concord vitis labrusca ranged from 290 g at bud break to 605 g at leaf fall bates et al 2002 the dry biomass of roots was below 350 g at the end of flowering in a 3 year old vitis vinifera cvs pinot noir and merlot vineyard zapata et al 2001 the above ranges of root dry biomass were comparable to the simulated dry biomass of roots at maturity on 3 and 4 year old plants which were 125 g and 273 g respectively fig 9 the lack of quantitative data from root biomass is in part due to inadequate methods and to the human effort needed to assess belowground processes herralde et al 2010 in the genecrop p model the dry biomass of roots increases almost linearly over the simulation period 20 years which can lead to an overestimation of simulated dry biomass of roots the model does not account for root senescence or decay which has been observed for young 3 year old grapevine plants zapata et al 2001 the hypothesized additional effect of root senescence and decay is illustrated in fig 9d additional experimental data would be needed to test this hypothesis and improve the modelling of root dynamics the dry biomass of fruits simulated for a 7 year old plant was 590 g which is close to the average yield 513 g dry biomass of fruit per plant observed in cv niagara rosada grafted on different rootstocks in experimental vineyards in brazil pedro et al 2007 terra et al 2003 the yield of grapevine plants is highly variable as it depends on numerous factors including cultivar training system and shoot pruning intensity in brazil a sprouting pruning is performed in cv niagara rosada in order to limit canopy density to 8 stems per plant as a consequence the maximum number of clusters per plant is about 16 by contrast grapevines with high density canopies can develop up to 60 shoots per plant and up to 80 clusters per plant cola et al 2014 the simulated lai values 2 2 m2 m 2 for 5 year old plants was similar to observed lai 1 8 m2 m 2 in our experimental vineyard maximum values of lai can vary importantly and ranges from 1 to 8 m2 m 2 depending on grapevine cultivar and training system pedro et al 2007 sánchez de miguel et al 2010 genecrop p estimated a lai of 4 la 8 m2 at maturity for 20 year old plants simulated dry biomass of stems and trunk were also close to observed data in our experimental vineyard the dry biomass of stems highly depends on the training and pruning systems a dry biomass of stems of 1000 g was observed in cv concord pruned to 40 stems per plant bates et al 2002 this value which corresponds to 25 g stem 1 is similar to the value simulated by genecrop p 22 5 g stem 1 4 3 processes modelled within and over seasons a decrease in dry biomass of roots and trunk takes place in the beginning of the grapevine cycle every year as a result of the process of assimilate reallocation as shown by bates et al 2002 around 40 of trunk and roots biomass is reallocated from bud break to flowering the dynamics of fruits dry biomass over 20 years showed a large near linear increase of fruit yield over the first six years followed by a yield increase which becomes marginal as plants are ageing this pattern is in agreement with a continuous increase in yield which was observed over the first five years in brazilian vineyards planted with cv niagara rosada terra et al 2003 in washington state full production of grapevine cv concord v labrusca can also be reached from the fifth year after planting aegerter and folwell 1996 the yield of 5 year old niagara rosada was 3 6 kg plant 1 in a brazilian vineyard terra et al 2003 which conforms very well the simulated value of 3 0 kg plant 1 by genecrop p genecrop p represents the processes involved in photosynthesis in a simple way using monteith s framework this framework is widely used in annual crop growth models such as rice wheat ritchie and otter 1985 savary and willocquet 2014 willocquet et al 2008 2000 potato johnson 1992 and maize mollier et al 2008 most perennial crop growth models however use different and often complex approaches for photosynthesis modelling for a review see le roux et al 2001 there are few crop growth models of trees using monteith s framework to model photosynthesis and biomass production some examples include the individual tree growth models proposed by west 1993 and the model for the structural growth of young scots pine crowns kellomäki and strandman 1995 the model developed by bindi et al 1997b for grapevine also used a modification of monteith s framework and the value of rue used in genecrop p was derived from their work implementing monteith s framework implies only few parameters and daily inputs we chose to use a simple robust approach which may be sufficient to simulate the dynamics and production of dry biomass of grapevine the outputs of genecrop p were in reasonable agreement with the literature and with data collected in our experimental vineyard 4 4 model genericity the model described here allows the simulation of the dynamics of grape biomass not only within a crop cycle but also over successive crop cycles a robust simulation of the bud break date is critical to all successive dvs and can be modelled according to thermal sum accumulation after vernalisation in temperate areas nendel 2010 in the case of v labrusca in southern brazil bud break is artificially induced by application of hydrogen cyanamide the sum of temperature from hydrogen cyanamide application to bud break therefore allows a good representation of the date of bud break under such conditions the processes incorporated into the model in order to simulate these within and between cycle dynamics should represent a robust basis to address the effects of diseases on the physiology and yield formation of grape over years diseases in grapes can result in substantial losses in production wilcox et al 2015 some polycyclic diseases such as powdery and downy mildew can cause important yield reductions within a season other polyclyclic diseases such as asian rust phakopsora euvitis reduce yield in the next season phakopsora euvitis generally occurs after harvest and causes early defoliation as a consequence the assimilate reserves in the trunk and roots are reduced which negatively impact the early stages of growth during the following season nogueira júnior et al 2017 genecrop p coupled with damage mechanisms caused by grape diseases could help estimating such polyetic damage caused by diseases that mainly develop after harvest the current model structure may also represent a sound basis to simulate the dynamics of perennial species and particularly could be used in order to analyze and model the dynamics of fruit trees acknowledgments the authors acknowledge são paulo research
