healthy and efficient quality cultivation keywords water and fertilizer regulation panax notoginseng microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen soil enzyme activity physiological growth saponin content data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil microorganisms are the driving force behind the transformation and cycling of plant nutrients such as soil carbon and nitrogen play a vital role in regulating soil ecosystem function soil microbial biomass smb is the most active and fastest absorbing nutrient in the soil while microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen are the main sources of soil carbon and nitrogen reflecting the efficiency of carbon and nitrogen utilization by soil microorganisms and further reflecting the adequate nutrient status and biological activity of soil raiesi et al 2015 ren et al 2019 soil microbial biomass carbon smbc are the active component of soil organic matter and an important source and reservoir in the soil nitrogen nutrient cycle process further reflecting the soil s adequate nutrient status and biological activity in the soil tillage layer microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen accounted for 3 and 5 of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen respectively van veen et al 1984 soil enzymes are proteins with catalytic activity secreted or released by microorganisms fine roots and soil animals they participate in critical ecological processes such as organic matter decomposition soil microbial energy and nutrient acquisition and material cycling and energy flow in soil ecosystems and are sensitive indicators of soil quality evaluation water and fertilizer regulation is essential for the soil microcosm physiological growth and yield quality different water fertilizer combination treatments and irrigation treatments were applied to the crop and there were significant increases in catalase sucrase polyphenol oxidase soil respiration intensity and fertilizer utilization efficiency in the soil with increasing irrigation amounts chen et al 2017 li et al 2022 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2022 proposed that the relative abundance of fusarium was the highest when the soil moisture content was 10 20 when soil moisture content was 30 the relative abundance of fusarium significantly decreased but the relative abundance of trichoderma increased when the soil moisture content was 40 the relative abundance of fusarium and ammonium nitrogen content increased while the relative abundance of trichoderma and nitrate nitrogen content decreased yang et al 2018 discovered that the appropriate water and fertilizer ratios increased soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen soil translocase urease activities and yield quality with the highest microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen at low water and low fertilizer seedling and maturity stages the highest microbial biomass carbon at high water and high fertilizer tiller and elongation stages and the highest microbial nitrogen at medium water fertilizer an excessive water fertilizer ratio decreased enzyme activity but phosphatase activity increased with rising water fertilizer ratios irrigation with organic fertilizers affected the regulation of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and microbial diversity increasing in soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen adequate irrigation with organic fertilizers or organic inorganic fertilizers increases the species and numbers of nitrogen fixing bacteria gamma deformation bacteria and alpha deformation bacteria in the soil liu et al 2015 by studying the effect of drip irrigation with high medium and low water with organic fertilizer on panax notoginseng yield and saponin content yield and saponin content tended to increase and then decreased with decreasing water or increasing organic fertilizer li et al 2021 compared with conventional application of n and k fertilizers panax notoginseng reduced n and increased k then root rot rate decreased by 36 4 46 1 and survival rate root biomass and yield and pns content increased by 17 9 18 3 5 7 32 9 27 8 57 1 and 5 10 ou et al 2020 the highest accumulation of ginsenoside r1 r1 ginsenoside rg1 rg1 ginsenoside re re and ginsenoside rd rd were found in medium water and high fertilization and the highest content of ginsenoside rb1 rb1 was found in low water and high fertilization liu et al 2021 therefore proper water and fertilizer regulation is beneficial to increase soil microbial biomass carbon nitrogen and enzyme activities which are very effective in enhancing crop quality most of the current researches on the efficient use and regulation of water and fertilizer focused on farmlands soil water heat air and salinity regulation water and fertilizer transport patterns crop physiological growth water and fertilizer utilization and its yield and quality improvement in dryland gou et al 2021 panax notoginseng was a traditional chinese medicine of great medicinal value with the characteristic of being a warm shady and humid perennial most studies on panax notoginseng focused on reducing continuous cropping obstacles pesticide and fertilizer residues heavy metal accumulation pest and disease control allelopathy effect and soil conditioner control panax notoginseng growers use adequate irrigation and excessive application of pesticides and fertilizers to increase yields for pursuing maximum economic benefits the phenomenon of unsynchronized irrigation and fertilization and single factor consideration of irrigation and fertilization was common this unreasonable situation of irrigation and fertilization has led to many problems such as soil consolidation a decline in aeration and organic matter nutrient loss agricultural surface pollution low water and fertilizer utilization and a decline in yield and quality few studies have been reported on water and fertilizer regulation of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity and saponin content of panax notoginseng inter root soils this study was conducted for three consecutive years from 2018 to 2021 in lu xi county hong he prefecture yunnan province using 3 year old panax notoginseng as the study object three irrigation levels four fertilizer levels and one control treatment were set up for the field experiment elucidation of the effects of different water and fertilizer regulations on the soil microbial

enzyme activity physiological growth and saponin content of panax notoginseng the entropy weight approach in conjunction with the modified topsis method was used to conduct a complete investigation of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponins in panax notoginseng regulated by varied water and fertilizers the greater the relative proximity c value the greater the proximity of the soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponin content of panax notoginseng to the optimal water and fertilizer regulation scheme this indicated that the water and fertilizer regulation scheme was more favorable to the increase of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity yield and saponin content of panax notoginseng soil table 5 shows that the relative proximity of the same level of fertilizer was w3 w1 and w2 in descending order whereas the relative proximity of the same level of irrigation was f4 f3

consequently on a comprehensive basis the w3f4 treatment was more beneficial to improve the quality yield of panax notoginseng 4 discussion water and fertilizer are two indispensable and major factors for crop growth which promote and restrict each other the effects of water and fertilizer on plants are not completely independent and a reasonable combination of water and fertilizer can play a good interactive coupling role in regulating the soil micro environment and improving the efficiency of crop water and fertilizer utilization which in turn can increase crop yields gutiérrez boem and thomas 1962 mei et al 2019 mohammad and zuraiqi 2002 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2009 in this study an optimal water and fertilizer regulation treatment was proposed to improve crop quality and optimal growth condition of panax notoginseng seasonal differences in soil microbial biomass carbon were significant between soil use types and seasonal variations in the eastern himalaya with peaks occurring in the rainy season and lows in winter lepcha et al 2020 in this study soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen of panax notoginseng were highest during the flowering period rainy season and lowest during the rooting period dry season the major reason is the different dry and wet seasons in the study area which are rainy in summer and dry in winter and spring the high soil temperature and humidity abundant rainfall moist air and low evaporation in summer are suitable for the growth reproduction and decomposition of soil microorganisms the increase in soil microbial content promote the conversion and accumulation of content of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen in mediterranean agroecosystems are lowest in summer and highest in autumn li et al 2014 the reason is the different climate types in these two regions with hot and dry summers and warm and rainy mediterranean winters in contrast to the rainy summers and dry winters and springs in this study site different results have been obtained from previous studies on the effect of different water fertilizers on soil microbial biomass it has been suggested that fertilizer application increases soil microbial biomass but excessive fertilizer application decreases soil microbial biomass carbon masto et al 2006 and it has also been shown that fertilizer reduces microbial biomass by about 15 treseder 2010 bargali et al 2018 show that a moderate increase in nitrogen fertilizer application is beneficial to increase soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content the results of this experimental study similarly show that water and fertilizer regulation can increase soil microbial carbon and nitrogen this is attributed to the fact that water and fertilizer regulation can improve the soil ecological environment which can improve the microbial utilization of carbon sources in the soil and nitrogen sequestration in the soil providing a good living environment for soil microorganisms and significantly increasing the number of soil microorganisms increased application of organic fertilizer along with increased water irrigation can significantly increase the microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content showing a positive effect in this paper we used compound organic fertilizer and the mechanism by which specific element in the fertilizer such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium affects microbial carbon and nitrogen needs to be further explored and studied enzymes are key soil components that catalyze and break down nutrient turnover and transformation and soil enzyme activity is used as one of the indicators of soil health ashraf et al 2020 kotroczo et al 2014 appropriate water management and water fertilizer ratios help to improve soil enzyme activity dick 1984 zhang et al 2015a b increased fertilizer application at the same irrigation level promoted an increase in soil enzyme activity gao et al 2021 the increase in irrigation increased soil sucrase activity presumably because the increase in soil moisture accelerated the mobility of the reactants which could provide a good reaction environment for the enzymatic reaction and consequently sucrase activity was increased bandyopadhyay et al 2010 wei et al 2009 showed that under low fertilizer conditions reducing soil water content was beneficial to increase soil urease activity while under high fertilizer conditions the highest soil urease activity was found at 70 80 relative soil water content this is consistent with the results of this experiment soil enzyme activity is related to the amount of water and fertilizer application and suitable water and fertilizer ratios can improve soil urease and convertase activities some investigations also pointed out that increased water significantly increased the activity of soil alkaline peptidase and dehydrogenase while acid phosphatase activity in topsoil increased more significantly and within the appropriate range appropriate fertilization along with increased irrigation amount maximized enzyme activity wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 fertilizer application can increase the enzyme activity and increasing the fertilizer application and suitable irrigation amount maximized the phosphatase activity in the soil jiao et al 2011 rout et al 2017 similar to the results of previous experiments appropriate water and fertilizer management can increase phosphatase activity and the results of this experiment showed that phosphatase activity increased with the increase of water and fertilizer ratios in this study the activities of soil urease sucrase acid phosphatase and catalase increased and then decreased as the growth stages of panax notoginseng changed the order from flowering fruiting seedling and rooting stages ranged from maximum to minimum this indicatest a clear seasonal pattern of soil enzyme activity consistent with the results of soil sucrase activity showing summer autumn spring winter and seasonal dynamics of urease activity showing summer spring autumn winter soil enzyme activity was highest in summer and lowest in winter pei et al 2018 soil peroxidase phosphatase and urease activities peaked during the growth of the reed community and reached a trough during the shoot colonization and leaf dispersal stages zhu et al 2017 in this investigation the flowering stage of panax notoginseng was summer and peak growth period while the rooting stage was winter and sprouting period therefore the soil enzyme activity of panax notoginseng was greatest in the flowering stage and lowest rooting stage which was due to abundant rainfall humid air and suitable soil temperature and moisture in summer which accelerated the proliferation of soil microorganisms and promoted the increase of soil enzyme activity panax notoginseng plants are in the rapid growth stage at both seedling and flowering stages water and fertilizer regulation is closely related to the accumulation of metabolites in medicinal plants li et al 2018 the effect of different treatments on saponin content in crops has also been studied more all favoring the enhancement of saponin content in crop roots li et al 2021 gomez caravaca et al 2014 in this study it was found that at the same fertilization level the content of rg1 re increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation water and w2 w3 w1 the content of r1 rb1 and rd gradually decreased with increasing irrigation water indicating that different saponin contents have different sensitivity to soil moisture li et al 2015 in the study of saponin content on the whole w2 and w3 treatments were more favorable for the increase of various saponin contents of panax notoginseng and the accumulation of saponins irrigation has a greater effect on saponin content indicating that saponin content is more sensitive to moisture suitable soil moisture not only increased antioxidant enzyme activity but also resulted in more stable gene expression of key enzymes of the saponin synthesis pathway shi et al 2010 in this study soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen acid phosphatase catalase and urease were found to be the main factors inhibiting the increase of re positively correlated with r1 and promoting r1 microbial biomass nitrogen sucrase acid phosphatase catalase and urease are negatively correlated with rb1 and had an inhibitory effect on rb1 both appropriate water and fertilizer ratios favored the increase of saponin content in panax notoginseng roots cun et al 2020 wei et al 2019 in this experiment soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponins in panax notoginseng were evaluated at the same level the w3f4 treatment was ranked first and the w1f1 and ck treatments were ranked last which showed that the w3f4 treatment achieved a good water fertilizer coupling effect on the growth environment and quality of panax notoginseng while the w1f1 treatment limited the accumulation of panax notoginseng saponins however this experiment was conducted for a short period and to study the changes of soil biological environment under different water fertilizer coupling we should do a long term positioning experiment and combine it with multi stage sampling analysis for in depth study 5 conclusion in summary appropriate irrigation and fertilizer regulation is an effective way to improve the quality of the soil environment of panax notoginseng and increase the content and yield of panax notoginseng saponins w3f4 had the largest soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content with the largest differences in the flowering and rooting stages at 0 26 mg kg 1 and 20 67 mg kg 1 respectively w3f4 had the highest urease sucrase acid phosphatase and catalase activities which were 1 95 1 69 2 32 and 1 47 times higher than the ck treatment respectively w3f2 had the highest ginsenoside rg1 content at 52 2 mg g 1 while ck had the lowest at 18 65 mg g 1 w3f2 also had the highest ginsenoside rb1 level at 57 10 mg g 1 the comprehensive evaluation of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponin content of panax notoginseng by topsis ranked w3f4 first in this study w3f4 treatment significantly increased the soil microbial biomass carbon nitrogen content and enzyme activity compared with other treatments and according to the comprehensive evaluation w3f4 treatment was most beneficial to increase the saponin content the ratio of fertilizer application to water consumption in a reasonable fertility period can improve water use efficiency and increase crop yield by promoting water with fertilizer therefore w3f4 treatment is recommended as a method to improve the soil

data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil microorganisms are the driving force behind the transformation and cycling of plant nutrients such as soil carbon and nitrogen play a vital role in regulating soil ecosystem function soil microbial biomass smb is the most active and fastest absorbing nutrient in the soil while microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen are the main sources of soil carbon and nitrogen reflecting the efficiency of carbon and nitrogen utilization by soil microorganisms and further reflecting the adequate nutrient status and biological activity of soil raiesi et al 2015 ren et al 2019 soil microbial biomass carbon smbc are the active component of soil organic matter and an important source and reservoir in the soil nitrogen nutrient cycle process further reflecting the soil s adequate nutrient status and biological activity in the soil tillage layer microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen accounted for 3 and 5 of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen respectively van veen et al 1984 soil enzymes are proteins with catalytic activity secreted or released by microorganisms fine roots and soil animals they participate in critical ecological processes such as organic matter decomposition soil microbial energy and nutrient acquisition and material cycling and energy flow in soil ecosystems and are sensitive indicators of soil quality evaluation water and fertilizer regulation is essential for the soil microcosm physiological growth and yield quality different water fertilizer combination treatments and irrigation treatments were applied to the crop and there were significant increases in catalase sucrase polyphenol oxidase soil respiration intensity and fertilizer utilization efficiency in the soil with increasing irrigation amounts chen et al 2017 li et al 2022 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2022 proposed that the relative abundance of fusarium was the highest when the soil moisture content was 10 20 when soil moisture content was 30 the relative abundance of fusarium significantly decreased but the relative abundance of trichoderma increased when the soil moisture content was 40 the relative abundance of fusarium and ammonium nitrogen content increased while the relative abundance of trichoderma and nitrate nitrogen content decreased yang et al 2018 discovered that the appropriate water and fertilizer ratios increased soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen soil translocase urease activities and yield quality with the highest microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen at low water and low fertilizer seedling and maturity stages the highest microbial biomass carbon at high water and high fertilizer tiller and elongation stages and the highest microbial nitrogen at medium water fertilizer an excessive water fertilizer ratio decreased enzyme activity but phosphatase activity increased with rising water fertilizer ratios irrigation with organic fertilizers affected the regulation of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and microbial diversity increasing in soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen adequate irrigation with organic fertilizers or organic inorganic fertilizers increases the species and numbers of nitrogen fixing bacteria gamma deformation bacteria and alpha deformation bacteria in the soil liu et al 2015 by studying the effect of drip irrigation with high medium and low water with organic fertilizer on panax notoginseng yield and saponin content yield and saponin content tended to increase and then decreased with decreasing water or increasing organic fertilizer li et al 2021 compared with conventional application of n and k fertilizers panax notoginseng reduced n and increased k then root rot rate decreased by 36 4 46 1 and

re and ginsenoside rd rd were found in medium water and high fertilization and the highest content of ginsenoside rb1 rb1 was found in low water and high fertilization liu et al 2021 therefore proper water and fertilizer regulation is beneficial to increase soil microbial biomass carbon nitrogen and enzyme activities which are very effective in enhancing crop quality most of the current researches on the efficient use and regulation of water and fertilizer focused on farmlands soil water heat air and salinity regulation water and fertilizer transport patterns crop physiological growth water and fertilizer utilization and its yield and quality improvement in dryland gou et al 2021 panax notoginseng was a traditional chinese medicine of great medicinal value with the characteristic of being a warm shady and humid perennial most studies on panax notoginseng focused on reducing continuous cropping obstacles pesticide and fertilizer residues heavy metal accumulation pest and disease control allelopathy effect and soil conditioner control panax notoginseng growers use adequate irrigation and excessive application of pesticides and fertilizers to increase yields for pursuing maximum economic benefits the phenomenon of unsynchronized irrigation and fertilization and single factor consideration of irrigation and fertilization was common this unreasonable situation of irrigation and fertilization has led to many problems such as soil consolidation a decline in aeration and organic matter nutrient loss agricultural surface pollution low water and fertilizer utilization and a decline in yield and quality few studies have been reported on water and fertilizer regulation of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity and saponin content of panax notoginseng inter

fertilizer regulating treatments were effective in promoting the increase of panax notoginseng yield transpiration rate urease and microbial biomass carbon had an inhibitory effect on the increase of re content r1 had an inhibitory influence on rg1 content rise whilst rg1 had a facilitative effect on re content increase 3 5 comprehensive evaluation of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponin content of panax notoginseng the entropy weight approach in conjunction with the modified topsis method was used to conduct a complete investigation of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponins in panax notoginseng regulated by varied water and fertilizers the greater the relative proximity c value the greater the proximity of the soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponin content of panax notoginseng to the optimal water and fertilizer regulation scheme this indicated that the water and fertilizer regulation scheme was more favorable to the increase of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity yield and saponin content of panax notoginseng soil table 5 shows that the relative proximity of the same level of fertilizer was w3 w1 and w2 in descending order whereas the relative proximity of the same level of irrigation was f4 f3 f2 and f1 in descending order in descending order the relative proximity of the 13 water and fertilizer control schemes was w3f4 w3f3 w3f2 w1f4 w2f4 w1f3 w2f3 w2f1 w2f2 w1f2 w2f1 w1f1 and ck consequently on a comprehensive basis the w3f4 treatment was more beneficial to improve the quality yield of panax notoginseng 4 discussion water and fertilizer are two indispensable and major factors for crop growth which promote and restrict each other the effects of water and fertilizer on plants are not completely independent and a reasonable combination of water and fertilizer can play a good interactive coupling role in regulating the soil micro environment and improving the efficiency of crop water and fertilizer utilization which in turn can increase crop yields gutiérrez boem and thomas 1962 mei et al 2019 mohammad and zuraiqi 2002 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2009 in this study an optimal water and fertilizer regulation treatment was proposed to improve crop quality and optimal growth condition of panax notoginseng seasonal differences in soil microbial biomass carbon were significant between soil use types and seasonal variations in the eastern himalaya with peaks occurring in the rainy season and lows in winter lepcha et al 2020 in this study soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen of panax notoginseng were highest during the flowering period rainy season and lowest during the rooting period dry season the major reason is the different dry and wet seasons in the study area which are rainy in summer and dry in winter and spring the high soil temperature and humidity abundant rainfall moist air and low evaporation in summer are suitable for the growth reproduction and decomposition of soil microorganisms the increase in soil microbial content promote the conversion and accumulation of content of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen in mediterranean agroecosystems are lowest in summer and highest in autumn li et al 2014 the reason is the different climate types in these two regions with hot and dry summers and warm and rainy mediterranean winters in contrast to the rainy summers and dry winters and springs in this study site different results have been obtained from previous studies on the effect of different water fertilizers on soil microbial biomass it has been suggested that fertilizer application increases soil microbial biomass but excessive fertilizer application decreases soil microbial biomass carbon masto et al 2006 and it has also been shown that fertilizer reduces microbial biomass by about 15 treseder 2010 bargali et al 2018 show that a moderate increase in nitrogen fertilizer application is beneficial to increase soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content the results of this experimental study similarly show that water and fertilizer regulation can increase soil microbial carbon and nitrogen this is attributed to the fact that water and fertilizer regulation can improve the soil ecological environment which can improve the microbial utilization of carbon sources in the soil and nitrogen sequestration in the soil providing a good living environment for soil microorganisms and significantly increasing the number of soil microorganisms increased application of organic fertilizer along with increased water irrigation can significantly increase the microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content showing a positive effect in this paper we used compound organic fertilizer and the mechanism by which specific element in the fertilizer such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium affects microbial carbon and nitrogen needs to be further explored and studied enzymes are key soil components that catalyze and break down nutrient turnover and transformation and soil enzyme activity is used as one of the indicators of soil health ashraf et al 2020 kotroczo et al 2014 appropriate water management and water fertilizer ratios help to improve soil enzyme activity dick 1984 zhang et al 2015a b increased fertilizer application at the same irrigation level promoted an increase in soil enzyme activity gao et al 2021 the increase in irrigation increased soil sucrase activity presumably because the increase in soil moisture accelerated the mobility of the reactants which could provide a good reaction environment for the enzymatic reaction and consequently sucrase activity was increased bandyopadhyay et al 2010 wei et al 2009 showed that under low fertilizer conditions reducing soil water content was beneficial to increase soil urease activity while under high fertilizer conditions the highest soil urease activity was found at 70 80 relative soil water content this is consistent with the results of this experiment soil enzyme activity is related to the amount of water and fertilizer application and suitable water and fertilizer ratios can improve soil urease and convertase activities some investigations also pointed out that increased water significantly increased the activity of soil alkaline peptidase and dehydrogenase while acid phosphatase activity in topsoil increased more significantly and within the appropriate range appropriate fertilization along with increased irrigation amount maximized enzyme activity wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 fertilizer application can increase the enzyme activity and increasing the fertilizer application and suitable irrigation amount maximized the phosphatase activity in the soil jiao et al 2011 rout et al 2017 similar to the results of previous experiments appropriate water and fertilizer management can increase phosphatase activity and the results of this experiment showed that phosphatase activity increased with the increase of water and fertilizer ratios in this study the activities of soil urease sucrase acid phosphatase and catalase increased and then decreased as the growth stages of panax notoginseng changed the order from flowering fruiting seedling and rooting stages ranged from maximum to minimum this indicatest a clear seasonal pattern of soil enzyme activity consistent with the results of soil sucrase activity showing summer autumn spring winter and seasonal dynamics of urease activity showing summer spring autumn winter soil enzyme activity was highest in summer and lowest in winter pei et al 2018 soil peroxidase phosphatase and urease activities peaked during the growth of the reed community and reached a trough during the shoot colonization and leaf dispersal stages zhu et al 2017 in this investigation the flowering stage of panax notoginseng was summer and peak growth period while the rooting stage was winter and sprouting period therefore the soil enzyme activity of panax notoginseng was greatest in the flowering stage and lowest rooting stage which was due to abundant rainfall humid air and suitable soil temperature and moisture in summer which accelerated the proliferation of soil microorganisms and promoted the increase of soil enzyme activity panax notoginseng plants are in the rapid growth stage at both seedling and flowering stages water and fertilizer regulation is closely related to the accumulation of metabolites in medicinal plants li et al 2018 the effect of different treatments on saponin content in crops has also been studied more all favoring the enhancement of saponin content in crop roots li et al 2021 gomez caravaca et al 2014 in this study it was found that at the same fertilization level the content of rg1 re increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation water and w2 w3 w1 the content of r1 rb1 and rd gradually decreased with increasing irrigation water indicating that different saponin contents have different sensitivity to soil moisture li et al 2015 in the study of saponin content on the whole w2 and w3 treatments were more favorable for the increase of various saponin contents of panax notoginseng and the accumulation of saponins irrigation has a greater effect on saponin content indicating that saponin content is more sensitive to moisture suitable soil moisture not only increased antioxidant enzyme activity but also resulted in more stable gene expression of key enzymes of the saponin synthesis pathway shi et al 2010 in this study soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen acid phosphatase catalase and urease were found to be the main factors inhibiting the increase of re positively correlated with r1 and promoting r1 microbial biomass nitrogen sucrase acid phosphatase catalase and urease are negatively correlated with rb1 and had an inhibitory effect on rb1 both appropriate water and fertilizer ratios favored the increase of saponin content in panax notoginseng roots cun et al 2020 wei et al 2019 in this experiment soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponins in panax notoginseng were evaluated at the same level the w3f4 treatment was ranked first and the w1f1 and ck treatments were ranked last which showed that the w3f4 treatment achieved a good water fertilizer coupling effect on the growth environment and quality of panax notoginseng while the w1f1 treatment limited the accumulation of panax notoginseng saponins however this experiment was conducted for a short period and to study the changes of soil biological environment under different water fertilizer coupling we should do a long term positioning experiment and combine it with multi stage sampling analysis for in depth study 5 conclusion in summary appropriate irrigation and fertilizer regulation is an effective way to improve the quality of the soil environment of panax notoginseng and increase the content and yield of panax notoginseng saponins w3f4 had the largest soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content with the largest differences in the flowering and rooting stages at 0 26 mg kg 1 and 20 67 mg kg 1 respectively w3f4 had the highest urease sucrase acid phosphatase and catalase activities which were 1 95 1 69 2 32 and 1 47 times higher than the ck treatment respectively w3f2 had the highest ginsenoside rg1 content at 52 2 mg g 1 while ck had the lowest at 18 65 mg g 1 w3f2 also had the highest ginsenoside rb1 level at 57 10 mg g 1 the comprehensive evaluation of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen enzyme activity physiological growth and saponin content of panax notoginseng by topsis ranked w3f4 first in this study w3f4 treatment significantly increased the soil microbial biomass carbon nitrogen content and enzyme activity compared with other treatments and according to the comprehensive evaluation w3f4 treatment was most beneficial to increase the saponin content the ratio of fertilizer application to water consumption in a reasonable fertility period can improve water use efficiency and increase crop yield by promoting water with fertilizer therefore w3f4 treatment is recommended as a method to improve the soil microbial environment of panax notoginseng improve physiological growth enhance yield quality and promote efficient and fine cultivation foundation items national natural science foundation of china

9076,the modeling of irrigation in land surface models are generally based on two soil moisture parameters smthreshold and smtarget at which irrigation automatically starts and stops respectively typically both parameters are usually set to optimal values allowing to fill the soil water reservoir with just the estimated right amount and to avoid crop water excess at all times the point is that agricultural practices greatly vary according to many factors climatological crop soil technical human etc to fill the gap we propose a new calibration method of smthreshold and smtarget to represent the irrigation water use in any optimal deficit or even over irrigation regime the approach is tested using the dual crop coefficient fao 56 model implemented at the field scale over an 8100 ha irrigation district in northeastern spain where the irrigation water use is precisely monitored at the district scale both irrigation parameters are first retrieved at monthly scale from the irrigation observations of year 2019 the irrigation simulated by the fao 56 model is then evaluated against observations at district and weekly scale over 5 years 2017 2021 separately the performance of the newly calibrated irrigation module is also assessed by comparing it against three other modules with varying configurations including default estimates for smthreshold and smtarget the proposed irrigation module obtains systematically the best performance for each of the 5 years with an overall correlation coefficient of 0 95 0 02 and root mean square error of 0 27 0 07 hm3 week 0 64 0 17 mm day unlike the three irrigation modules used as benchmark the new irrigation module is able to reproduce the farmers practices throughout the year and especially to simulate the actual water use in the deficit and excess irrigation regimes occurring in the study area in spring and summer respectively keywords irrigation module irrigation amounts data assimilation water balance model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation water use represents more than 70 of the mobilized freshwater at global scale foley et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012 and the demand for irrigation water is still rising puy et al 2021 wada et al 2013 2011 despite the important pressure of agriculture on water resources information on the amount of irrigated water is often unavailable therefore monitoring and quantifying irrigation over large areas is critical for an efficient management and allocation of water resources as well as to understand the biogeophysical impacts of irrigation on water cycle and climate haddeland et al 2006 krakauer et al 2020 puma and cook 2010 thiery et al 2020 2017 even though significant efforts have been made to develop irrigation retrieval methods the dynamics of irrigation practices is hard to monitor due to the unavailability of consistent irrigation data and the reluctance of farmers and managers to share such data foster et al 2020 massari et al 2021 moreover irrigation practices are greatly heterogeneous because of the diversity of water needs mainly driven by crop types climate and soil conditions water availability and local agreements various irrigation systems e g flood sprinkler and drip that often coexist within the same irrigated district and farmers conceptions of irrigation massari et al 2021 in fact the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation practices and their inter and intra annual variabilities make the representation of the irrigation water use at all scales challenging in recent decades important efforts have been made to model irrigation processes especially within large scale land surface e g haddeland et al 2006 ozdogan et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012 lawrence et al 2019 and hydrological e g hanasaki et al 2008 2018 wada et al 2014 jägermeyr et al 2015 models assessing the irrigation effects on climate and associated feedbacks on land water cycle from regional to global scales has received a particular interest pokhrel et al 2016 some authors have evaluated the impact of irrigation on the partitioning of energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes de rosnay et al 2003 haddeland et al 2006 leng et al 2013 and its associated cooling effect thiery et al 2020 2017 on the depletion of groundwater recharge leng et al 2014 scanlon et al 2006 on the decrease in streamflow haddeland et al 2006 tang et al 2007 and on changes in precipitation patterns guimberteau et al 2012 puma and cook 2010 in general all the above authors highlighted the crucial need to realistically account for irrigation in future climatic and hydrological projections leng et al 2015 thiery et al 2017 wada et al 2013 at the crop field scale the most widely used approach relies on the formalism of the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 in this case irrigations are simulated according to the simulated crop water requirements similarly to most irrigation schemes in large scale land surface models allen et al 1998 suggested that an optimal irrigation is applied before or at the moment when the readily available soil water raw is depleted with a water amount smaller than or equal to the root zone depletion to fulfill the soil water storage capacity raw is the amount of water that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering from water stress it is hence estimated as the difference between the soil moisture at field capacity smfc and the critical soil moisture at the onset of crop water stress smcritical in practice fao 56 model automatically simulates irrigation when the simulated root zone soil moisture reaches smcritical with the amount of water needed to make the simulated soil moisture reach smfc the current irrigation modules of large scale land surface models follow the same strategy to simulate irrigation according to the simulated crop water requirement where smthreshold is set to smcritical and the target soil moisture smtarget to smfc e g haddeland et al 2006 for instance ozdogan et al 2010 implemented an irrigation scheme in the noah land surface model chen et al 1996 irrigation is triggered when the soil moisture availability falls below a user defined smthreshold set to 50 of smfc which is defined according to discussions with local experts in nebraska and california in the united states followed by trial and error in ozdogan et al 2010 the irrigation water is supplied as precipitation to mimic sprinkler systems consistent with the technique used in the studied regions i e nebraska and california however the same irrigation module is also used in other regions where irrigation practices are different for example modanesi et al 2022 recently implemented this module in germany and italy with smthreshold empirically set to 45 in italy to avoid large overestimations in irrigation amounts using the default threshold value of 50 the latter calibration strategy i e by setting sm threshold to a prescribed value as in ozdogan et al 2010 was evaluated by comparing the 1 km resolution simulations with the observations available in several small 0 4 ha fields and two 290 and 760 ha irrigation districts another example is given by the community land model clm oleson et al 2013 which also includes an irrigation scheme based on ozdogan et al 2010 in clm smtarget is set to a weighted sum of smcritical and the soil moisture at saturation the weighting parameter firrig was determined empirically as 0 7 to approximately match the global irrigation water use estimated in year 2000 according to shiklomanov 2000 note that the most recent version of clm clm5 lawrence et al 2019 updated the irrigation triggering by improving the representation of smcritical with an explicit water transport through the vegetation and a more physical root water uptake however the principle in this module remains identical to the classical approach based on a target soil moisture level as in ozdogan et al 2010 another recent irrigation module proposed in the isba land surface model druel et al 2022 adopts a predefined irrigation triggering based on the soil moisture index and a fixed water amount per irrigation event this strategy implies an a priori knowledge of the irrigation practices over the area leng et al 2013 2014 suggested that calibrating the irrigation module at global scale may not be suitable for regional studies due to unreasonable simulations compared against census data therefore they calibrated firrig at the level of administrative units counties and water resource regions in the united states by comparing simulated annual irrigation amounts against census data of the year 2000 these studies found a very large spatial variability in firrig ranging between 0 2 and 1 leng et al 2014 also proved that a calibration at a finer scale counties versus water resource regions is more suitable for studying highly localized phenomena such as groundwater pumping leng et al 2015 extended this approach to the entire world by calibrating firrig at national and sub national scales against the global inventory developed by siebert et al 2010 however the reference data from this global inventory were estimated based on the optimal demand for crop growth which is probably not a realistic scenario given the variety of irrigation practices and the fact that it is rather difficult for farmers to follow the exact crop water requirement in the same vein puy et al 2021 compared the annual irrigation estimates provided at country scale worldwide by eight different global models and showed large discrepancies using uniform smthreshold and smtarget parameters actually means that these schemes largely ignore the spatial variability and temporal dynamics of irrigation practices moreover irrigation estimates are usually validated against annual data from census and surveys at administrative to country scales e g aquastat 2016 which are generally unreliable due to bureaucratic and political constraints puy et al 2021 therefore most of existing irrigation modules have been calibrated using biased reference data and have not been validated against actual irrigation water use at temporal scales finer than annual in an attempt to address the diversity of irrigation practices and the lack of reliable census data felfelani et al 2018 constrained the spatio temporal variability of smtarget by assimilating in clm a satellite surface soil moisture product smap this approach provided promising improvements in irrigation simulations at large scale however there are still some shortcomings to overcome such as i the spatial resolution of satellite soil moisture products 36 km for smap is not suitable for monitoring the crop water status at the scale of agricultural practices and ii discrepancies between the top soil moisture detected by remote sensing and that of the root zone which is where smthreshold and smtarget apply to trigger a simulated irrigation event and refill the root zone soil water reservoir although land surface models have become increasingly accurate in the representation of biophysical processes they remain still limited with respect to represent the human related processes like irrigation in this vein the above literature review thus clearly highlights the lack of calibration and validation studies of irrigation modules at the spatial and temporal scales of the management of irrigation water and using reliable irrigation observations to fill the gap the objective of this study is to evaluate different irrigation modules at the weekly scale over an irrigation district where the water withdrawal is precisely measured to accomplish this we develop and test a new calibration method of smthreshold and smtarget parameters we rely on the fao 56 formalism to model the crop water budget at the field scale as it is widely used by the agricultural community however the tested irrigation modules could be easily implemented in more physically based land surface models the study focuses on an irrigation district in northeastern spain algerri balaguer covered by 8100 ha of crops mainly maize barley wheat and fruit trees irrigated by sprinkler and drip systems the study area has the particularity of accounting with real time measurements of irrigation water use at the district scale the availability of these data is of great interest to assess the performance of irrigation modules at the scale of the agricultural water management as well as to quantify the actual water use efficiency to ensure a better management the main originality of our work is to demonstrate the capability of the irrigation modeling and calibration strategy to retrieve the overall irrigation regime through the retrieval of smthreshold and smtarget at the spatially integrated district scale 2 study area and data the present study was performed for the period from april 2017 to december 2021 over the algerri balaguer irrigation district section 2 1 in northeastern spain catalonia the data used are composed of the time series of observed irrigation water withdrawals for the district and the input data to the dual crop coefficient fao 56 model are a vegetation index derived from sentinel 2 satellite data on clear sky days acquired over algerri balaguer a land cover map information on soil texture from the global map database soilgrids poggio et al 2021 and times series of meteorological data collected by two stations included in the study area a detailed description of the dataset is presented below 2 1 algerri balaguer district the algerri balaguer irrigation district is located north of lleida in the ebro basin lleida has a semi arid continental mediterranean climate typical of the ebro valley with a mean annual air temperature rainfall and number of rain days of 16 c 340 mm and 60 respectively the irrigation district covers about 8100 ha of cropped lands the main crop types 85 being maize barley wheat fruit trees and alfalfa more than 50 of the district is cultivated by double crops with winter cereals mainly barley and maize in summer irrigation is applied over about 75 of the area either using sprinkler systematically for annual crops or drip systematically for fruit trees systems the rest 25 is a rainfed dryland area covered by winter cereals barley an overview of algerri balaguer district is presented in fig 1 2 2 irrigation data the algerri balaguer district is fed with the pyrenees water which is transported and stored by an extensive irrigation network built within the ebro basin milano et al 2013 the water is pumped in the noguera ribagorçana river and transported by gravity through the irrigation canals of algerri balaguer to be stored in upstream reservoirs and then used for irrigation in the downstream crops the pumped water is measured in real time by the automatic hydrological information system saih of the ebro basin the pumped water data are aggregated at weekly scale shown in fig 2 in order to dampen the potential time lag of several days between the water pumping and actual application of irrigation water at field level in this study the irrigation water use observations are derived from the pumped water volume reduced by 5 8 considering losses by evaporation and leaks during the transfer from the river and reservoir to the fields the losses were estimated for the year 2021 from the annual water withdrawn from the river and the data provided by water counters distributed in the district and sporadically collected by the algerri balaguer district agency this estimation was only available for the year 2021 2 3 sentinel 2 ndvi sentinel 2 s2 is a wide swath high resolution multispectral imaging mission with a global 5 day revisit frequency consisting of two satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b launched in june 2015 and march 2017 respectively and managed by the european space agency esa the study period from april 2017 to december 2021 is defined to ensure the availability of satellite images throughout the entire period with similar frequency the multispectral instrument msi on board both s2 platforms samples 13 spectral bands from which only the red band 4 and near infrared band 8 data at 10 m spatial resolution are used in this study to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the s2 derived ndvi is used to monitor the state and phenology of crops we used the level 2a orthorectified atmospherically corrected surface reflectances first the cloud mask band qa60 is applied in order to remove pixels contaminated by opaque clouds a second cloud masking is applied from the cirrus band band 10 if more than 25 of pixels inside a given field were removed by the cloud masking procedure then all pixels inside this field were removed in order to avoid cloud contamination conversely if less than 25 of pixels inside a given field were affected by clouds then the s2 ndvi data were aggregated at the field scale by averaging the ndvi pixels falling inside the plots delineated by the land cover map of each year from 2017 to 2021 separately finally the field scale ndvi data are interpolated at the daily scale by using a piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method fritsch and carlson 1980 2 4 land cover map a detailed land cover map is obtained from the geographic information system for agricultural parcels sigpac and the single agricultural declaration dun document sigpac is a public registry of an administrative nature that contains information on the fields at 1 5000 scale and 25 cm spatial resolution and dun is a yearly mandatory declaration about the agricultural exploitation that each farmer of an agricultural productive area must provide annual sigpac and dun products are extracted from https analisi transparenciacatalunya cat the products provide the crop type of each plot land and whether it is irrigated or not dryland since the sigpac database is produced on a yearly basis there is no information about the presence of double crops although they should be included for estimating the total water use therefore we added to the original sigpac database a new class double crops such a classification is based on the detection of a second peak in the annual s2 ndvi time series note that the plots smaller than 100 m2 after subtracting a buffer of 10 m are removed to avoid plots whose pixels are all affected by border effects taking into account the 10 m spatial resolution of ndvi data 2 5 soil data soil properties are obtained from the global isric international soil reference and information centre soilgrids data set v2 0 updated from its previous version hengl et al 2017 poggio et al 2021 soilgrids has a spatial resolution of 250 m and provides soil texture information that is the clay sand and silt contents and their uncertainty at different depths the clay and sand percentages of the 0 5 5 15 15 30 30 60 and 60 100 cm layers are linearly averaged to estimate their effective values over the 1 m deep soil profile soil information for deeper layers is not used given that they are more uncertain the estimated uncertainty in clay and sand percentages is estimated to be less than 3 in the 1 m soil profile over the algerri balaguer district finally the 250 m resolution and 0 1 m deep sand and clay percentages are averaged at the plot scale using the sigpac annual maps as for ndvi data 2 6 meteorological data the meteorological data are obtained from 4 stations algerri alfarras albesa and vallfogona de balaguer located in algerri balaguer district and belonging to the catalan meteorological network data are available at https ruralcat gencat cat web guest agrometeo estacions both stations provide daily air temperature air humidity wind speed solar radiation reference evapotranspiration and precipitation there is very little difference between simultaneous measurements at the 4 stations not shown so that the meteorological variables are considered to be uniform over the irrigation district and set to the mean of individual measurements 3 methodology irrigation modules are traditionally constrained to estimate irrigation in an optimal scenario not being able to estimate actual irrigation in the case of excess or deficit irrigation in reality irrigation practices are likely to change along the year according to the crop development and the atmospheric demand e g irrigation more frequent and intense during summer and the opposite in winter so it is rather difficult for farmers to follow the exact crop water requirement therefore farmers often overestimate and or underestimate irrigation throughout the agricultural season to fill this gap in irrigation modules we propose to invert irrigation parameters smthreshold and smtarget in time in order to reproduce the dynamics of irrigation practices along the year detailed in section 3 3 in this study we take advantage of the fao 56 model allen et al 1998 to implement different irrigation modules including the classical one originally used by the fao 56 model the performance of the different irrigation modules is evaluated to estimate the actual irrigation water use at weekly and district scale the overall approach for testing the irrigation modules is 1 the fao 56 model is implemented at the field scale over the entire algerri balaguer area 2 both irrigation parameters smthreshold and smtarget are inverted at district month scale from the assimilation of 2019 irrigation observations into the fao 56 model 3 both retrieved parameters are used as input to the fao 56 model which is run over 5 separate years from 2017 to 2020 and 4 the irrigations simulated at district scale are compared with observations at weekly scale and the impact of the temporal variability of smthreshold and smtarget is assessed each step is detailed in the following sections the overall methodology is summarized in the schematic diagram of fig 4 3 1 fao 56 dual crop coefficient model the fao 56 dual crop coefficient model fao 2kc allen et al 1998 is a water balance model to simulate the crop evapotranspiration et the fao 2kc model is driven by 1 meteorological forcing variables to calculate reference evapotranspiration et0 and 2 the water supply from precipitation and irrigation to simulate the soil water availability for soil evaporation and plant transpiration according to the fao 2kc formalism the daily water balance is expressed as 1 dr t dr t 1 et t p t i t dp t cr t ro t where dr is the root zone depletion p the precipitation i the irrigation dp the deep percolation cr the capillarity rise and ro the surface runoff every term is expressed in mm for the day t and t 1 for dr the ro and cr term are neglected due to fairly flat surfaces and a water table deeper than 2 m in the study area the algerri balaguer district is equipped with 2 m deep drains to prevent any rise of the water table dp is estimated as the rest of the eq 1 et is estimated by multiplying et0 by two separate crop coefficients for transpiration and evaporation as follows 2 et ks kcb ke et 0 where kcb is the basal crop transpiration ks 0 1 the water stress coefficient that reduces the potential transpiration t kcb et0 and ke the evaporation coefficient that is also regulated by an evaporation factor kr et0 is calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 at daily scale and kcb is estimated from a linear relationship with fraction of vegetation cover fc as 3 kcb fc t kslope crop koffset crop with kslopecrop and koffsetcrop being two parameters depending on crop type and whose values are obtained from literature and presented in table 1 fct at day t is estimated from daily ndvi as in eq 3 but using the parameters fslopecrop and foffsetcrop reported in table 1 fig 3 illustrates the time series of mean kcb in 2021 for the main crop types over algerri balaguer district ks is calculated based on daily computation of the water balance for the root zone layer zr m as follows 4 k s taw d r taw raw taw d r taw 1 p where dr mm is calculated from the daily water balance according to the eq 1 taw mm is the total available soil water in the root zone and p is the fraction of taw that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering from water stress determining raw p taw according to allen et al 1998 p is a crop specific parameter that controls the water depth threshold below which irrigation should be triggered to avoid crop water stress by keeping dr smaller than raw ks 1 taw is estimated as the difference between smfc and the water content at wilting point smwp by the daily crop rooting depth zr as 5 taw 1000 sm fc sm wp zr the soil parameters smfc and smwp are estimated using the clay and sand contents from soilgrids data and following the pedotransfer function proposed by román dobarco et al 2019 in algerri balaguer district smwp and smfc are quite homogeneous with values of 0 207 0 006 and 0 330 0 005 m3m 3 respectively the rooting depth zr is assumed to vary between a minimum value zrmin maintained during the initial crop growth stage and set to 0 1 m for annual crops and a maximum value zrmax reached at the maximum ndvi per plot in the agricultural season zr is thus expressed as 6 zr t zr min fc t zr max zr min the kr soil evaporation reduction coefficient is simulated by the surface depletion water in the surface evaporable layer and according to merlin et al 2016 to take into account its dependence to soil texture the texture based method for kr has been derived and evaluated over a variety of sites and clay sand contents lehmann et al 2018 merlin et al 2016 and recently implemented into the fao 2kc model by amazirh et al 2021 as 7 k r 0 5 0 5 cos π ssm sm saturation p where ssm is the actual surface soil moisture smsaturation is the soil moisture at saturation and p is a semi empirical parameter depending on the depth of soil moisture estimates and soil properties texture amazirh et al 2021 merlin et al 2016 as ssm is not explicitly estimated in the fao 2kc model it is derived from the surface soil water depletion de the total evaporable water tew and the soil evaporation layer depth ze in m as 8 ssm 0 5 sm wp tew de 1000 ze 3 2 irrigation module the fao 2kc model can be used to simulate irrigation by assuming that irrigation events occur at the onset of the crop water stress in practice the simulated irrigation is automatically triggered on the day when raw is depleted i e dr raw and the irrigation dose is estimated as the water amount necessary to fulfill the water storage capacity and to get back up to the field capacity soil moisture equal to smfc therefore the fao 2kc model classically simulates irrigation events in an optimal scenario along the season in order to maintain crop under unstressed conditions without generating surplus water we can thus define the i dose parameter as the irrigation water volume in mm applied per irrigation event over a given field an irrigation event is triggered simulated for each field when the simulated root zone soil moisture reaches smthreshold the root zone soil moisture is simulated from the modeled soil water budget that includes the plant transpiration soil evaporation and deep percolation terms which depend on the root zone water depletion eq 1 controlled mainly by the crop transpiration therefore i dose mm can be represented in a generic form as the difference between the soil moisture at which irrigation automatically starts smthreshold and stops smtarget as 9 idose 1000 sm target sm threshold zr in the case of fao 2kc model smthreshold is usually set to the critical soil moisture at the onset of crop water stress smcritical while smtarget is usually set to the soil moisture at field capacity smfc however in reality smthreshold and smtarget can differ significantly from smcritical and smfc respectively this notably occurs in deficit smthreshold smcritical and excess smtarget smfc irrigation case respectively note that in the fao 2kc model smcritical is related to the fraction p raw taw threshold below which crop is under water stress based on this expression we can express a threshold for triggering irrigation in a generic form herein p trigger as the ratio between dr and taw unitless which means the fraction of water depleted in relation to the water storage capacity therefore p trigger can be related to the smthreshold used by several irrigation schemes see section 1 as the complement of the normalized smthreshold 10 ptrigger 1 sm threshold sm wp sm fc sm wp therefore we can distinguish two key parameters controlling irrigation the threshold for triggering irrigation p trigger and the irrigation dose applied by irrigation event i dose note that both parameters allow representing not only an optimal irrigation regime satisfying the crops requirement but also under irrigation regimes implying crop water stress with a p trigger lower than the value defined in allen et al 1998 and over irrigation regimes implying deep percolation with an i dose resulting in a root zone soil moisture value exceeding the smfc both irrigation parameters are used in this study to define and test four different irrigation modules which are summarized in table 2 and described below 3 2 1 avoiding stress and fulfilling the water storage capacity classical fao 2kc or def fill irrigation module the p trigger in the fao 2kc model by default is the crop tolerance to stress parameter fraction p proposed by allen et al 1998 it is about 0 4 0 6 for most of crops crop specific and corrected by meteorological conditions the i dose is estimated as the water depth to fulfill the water storage capacity raw making the dr equal to 0 therefore this approach does not allow producing water excess as it simulates the optimal amount of water when it is necessary note that after a significant rainfall event no irrigation is needed to supply the crop water needs 3 2 2 no a priori assumption on p trigger and irrigation dose var ret irrigation module both irrigation parameters p trigger and i dose are retrieved at the monthly time scale from irrigation observations at the district scale such a strategy is expected to provide robust estimates under all optimal deficit and over irrigation regimes 3 2 3 no a priori assumption on p trigger and fulfilling the water storage capacity var fill irrigation module similarly to var ret this irrigation module used as input the p trigger retrieved at monthly scale from observations however i dose is estimated by fulfilling the water storage capacity as in the classical fao 56 irrigation module this strategy is adopted in order to evaluate whether fulfilling the water storage reservoir would be adequate to reproduce irrigation for all the year 3 2 4 p trigger set to its summer value and fulfilling the water storage capacity fix fill irrigation module irrigation is triggered by setting the p trigger to its value retrieved during summer july august september when irrigation water use is the most intense the i dose is estimated by fulfilling the water storage capacity as in the classical fao 56 irrigation module this strategy is adopted in order to evaluate whether a p trigger representative of the most intense irrigation period would be adequate to reproduce irrigation for all the year 3 3 inverting irrigation parameters in this study both irrigation parameters p trigger and i dose are inverted from observed irrigations over algerri balaguer district the retrieval method is based on a particle filter pf assimilation approach to estimate jointly irrigations and the parameters controlling irrigation throughout the year for this purpose observed irrigations cumulated over a weekly basis are assimilated into the fao 2kc model by land cover classes both aspects of the retrieval method are detailed below 3 3 1 particle filter assimilation method the pf approach vrugt et al 2013 is used to retrieve p trigger and i dose on a weekly basis by assimilating into the fao 2kc the observed irrigations over algerri balaguer district the model state consists of water depletions simulated for both surface and root zone layers from daily water balance at the end of the assimilation period 7 days the pf based assimilation requires an accurate statistical representation of observation and model errors in this study random uncertainties in irrigation observations are represented by a standard deviation equal to 10 of their absolute values moreover since irrigation during winter in algerri balaguer district is usually zero the minimum observation error is set to 0 1 hm3 equivalent to a mean water depth over the district of about 0 24 mm day to avoid degeneracy and sample impoverishment problems typical of noise free dynamical systems gordon et al 1993 moradkhani et al 2005 in order to represent the modelling uncertainty the most sensitive parameters of fao 2kc model are perturbed according to a normal distribution with a varying standard deviation equal to 10 of their corresponding values based on the comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the fao 2kc model by laluet et al 2022 four main parameters are selected the maximum rooting depth zrmax slope and offset of the linear relationship between kcb and ndvi as well as the maximum possible kcb kcbmax in addition the surface and root zone depletions including initial states are perturbed by 10 of their values without considering spatial or temporal autocorrelation initial values of surface and root zone depletions on the first day of the simulation period set to the 1st january of a given year are sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 40 of taw by assuming that the depleted water never exceeds 40 of taw in winter this is supported by spin up fao 2kc simulations which show that for each of the 5 studied years 2017 2021 the depletions simulated at the end of the year are systematically below 40 even if no irrigation is simulated in november and december the parameters to be estimated p trigger and i dose are also sampled from a uniform distribution with a sampling size set to 300 particles considering all the possible values over the irrigation district specifically p trigger is bounded between 0 01 and 0 90 meaning that irrigation is triggered when the root zone depletion reaches 1 and 90 of taw respectively similarly i dose is bounded between 0 no irrigation and 20 mm which is the maximum range of irrigation amount per event that can be found in the district according to the irrigation systems drip or sprinkler as irrigation practices are likely to change along the year both irrigation parameters are reinitialized to the initial uniform distribution every 4 weeks in that case the irrigation parameters are time varying and inverted for a window of 4 weeks the duration 4 weeks of the assimilation period is a compromise between the temporal dynamics of the parameters which may change during the agricultural season and the number of available observations a time series of four weekly observations in our case note that this strategy helps to minimize the degeneracy problem that is more pronounced with longer periods abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 to fully avoid degeneracy the particles are resampled when the so called effective sample size neff has decreased below the predefined threshold of one third of the initial particle size number moradkhani et al 2005 van leeuwen et al 2019 the assimilation approach is performed 4 times by considering a moving window starting on january 1 8 15 and 22 respectively since the 1 month assimilation periods overlap between the four assimilation runs the parameters estimated from the four runs are averaged on a weekly basis this is done in order to smooth out the parameter dynamics at the validation weekly scale 3 3 2 implementation of fao 2kc by crop type in order to minimize the computational cost of running fao 2kc hundreds of times i e number of particles size on each of the 3000 crop fields in algerri balaguer using a pf the inversion process is carried out by implementing fao 2kc over the five main crop types only those five land cover classes are double cropping mainly barley followed by maize winter cereals mainly barley summer cereals mainly maize fruit trees mainly peaches nectarines pears and apples and forages mainly alfalfa by simulating irrigation over the 3000 crop fields from the classical approach the five main land cover classes account for 94 of the total simulated irrigation over the district fig 5 fao 2kc is therefore implemented by land cover class by considering that the area covered by each class is relatively uniform in terms of soil properties this is verified by soidgrids data and the small standard deviation in smwp and smfc less than 0 006 m3m 3 and vegetation state for that fao 2kc inputs like ndvi and soil properties are first averaged by land cover class in order to build a dataset by land cover type the model is then run to simulate the irrigation depths mm for each of the five classes separately and the irrigation simulated per class is finally aggregated at the district scale by considering their respective areas within algerri balaguer district the remaining 6 of irrigation water consumed by the rest of land cover classes is represented by the average behavior in water consumption of the main five classes 3 4 calibration validation strategy the calibration process is carried out by implementing the fao 2kc model as described above for 2019 and illustrated in fig 4 since it is the only year without missing data in both observed irrigations and s2 ndvi once the time varying parameters are calibrated in 2019 they are used to implement the four irrigation modules def fill fix fill var fill and var ret for each of the 5 years between 2017 and 2021 separately unlike the calibration process where fao 2kc is implemented at land cover level over the five main crop types the fao 2kc model is run over all the 3000 crop fields for validation and intercomparison purposes including all land cover classes the irrigation estimates from the four irrigation modules are evaluated against observations in order to assess how the parameters p trigger and i dose impact the performance of fao 2kc to reproduce at the irrigation district scale the actual irrigation practices along the season 4 results and discussion 4 1 retrieving irrigation parameters the model parameters representing farmers irrigation practices over the algerri balaguer district are retrieved for the year 2019 from the approach described in section 3 3 fig 6 shows the evolution of the retrieved p trigger and i dose as well as a comparison between simulated and observed irrigations at district scale on a weekly basis a good agreement is obtained with a bias root mean square difference rmsd and correlation coefficient r between simulated and observed irrigation of 0 038 hm3 0 154 hm3 and 0 991 respectively in fact all observations fall within the estimated standard deviation of ensemble simulations although the observed irrigations are well estimated by inverting both irrigation parameters p trigger and i dose simultaneously i dose is estimated with an overall high uncertainty the temporal mean of the weekly temporal standard deviation is 4 1 mm such an uncertainty represents 45 of the temporal mean of retrieved i dose 9 1 mm and is even larger than the standard deviation 2 4 mm evaluated in time during 2019 of the weekly retrieved i dose in contrast p trigger is better retrieved with a much smaller relative uncertainty 25 moreover the higher uncertainty in retrieved p trigger during march is likely due to a compensation effect with the retrieved i dose whose uncertainty is reduced during the same period for the above reasons insignificant temporal variations of retrieved i dose and possible compensation effects between retrieved p trigger and i dose a choice is made to set the i dose to a constant value which is estimated as the mean of the weekly i dose retrieved throughout the year in practice the assimilation approach is implemented a second time to retrieve p trigger parameter in time weekly scale uniquely in that case i dose is considered constant equal to 9 mm with an uncertainty of 4 mm which are obtained from respectively the temporal mean of the retrieved i dose and the temporal mean of the standard deviation at the weekly scale during 2019 irrigation estimates from the assimilation approach using a fixed i dose fig 7 are even more accurate than using a time varying i dose with a bias rmsd and r between simulated and observed irrigation of 0 016 0 084 hm3 and 0 998 respectively as shown in fig 7 the time varying p trigger estimates show a progressive evolution representing the main two periods of irrigation throughout the year from january to mid june until the end of spring and from mid july to september summer in the first period p trigger is well constrained with a small uncertainty lower than 0 1 and a slight decrease from 0 70 in january to 0 60 at mid june representing the gradual increase in irrigation water use in the district according to the quite homogeneous smwp 0 207 m3m 3 and smfc 0 330 m3m 3 values in algerri balaguer the gradual increase in p trigger represents a slight increase in smthreshold from 0 244 to 0 256 m3m 3 in contrast the p trigger retrieved during summer is very low with values ranging from 0 05 to 0 1 depletion is always lower than 10 of taw and uncertainties around 0 04 the second irrigation period is thus characterized by an intense and frequent use of water keeping the soil water content close to or even above smfc indeed smthreshold is quite stable and close to smfc in summer with a value around 0 32 m3m 3 between both periods mid june to early july an abrupt change of p trigger values is visible in fig 7 in fact irrigation practices over the district completely change at that time from a slight irrigation water use to an intense and frequent irrigation during summer after summer from october irrigations are significantly diminished and thus the retrieved p trigger increases note that the uncertainty in p trigger is relatively large at that time because the fao 2kc stops the irrigation season when a decrease of 40 of maximum ndvi by field is detected consequently when the irrigation season over annual crops is finished there is not enough information to constraint p trigger which regains its original distribution i e uniform distribution between 0 01 and 0 90 in summary p trigger is accurately retrieved from irrigation observations by setting i dose to a constant therefore the estimated time varying p trigger and the constant i dose fixed to 9 mm are used in our proposed approach var ret to simulate irrigations over each crop field 4 2 comparing the four irrigation modules the performance of the fao 2kc model using the var ret irrigation module is evaluated for the five years 2017 2021 separately to do so the simulated irrigations from var ret are compared against irrigation observations and results are also compared against those obtained using three different simplified configurations var fill fix fill and def fill where smthreshold and i dose are set to different values as summarized in table 2 the irrigation time series simulated by fao 2kc using the four irrigation modules are illustrated in fig 8 for each year separately the historical mean and standard deviation of observed irrigations from 2010 2021 are also shown in 2019 the calibration year var ret is able to reproduce observed irrigations with a good precision throughout the year for instance the absence of irrigation from january to mid february is well simulated similarly the first irrigations in the district are adequately captured once the p trigger threshold 0 78 in mid february is reached from the beginning of the irrigation season until may actual irrigations increase progressively mainly because of the development of winter cereals covering about 60 of algerri balaguer district also represented in the double cropping class in fig 5 in june irrigations slightly decrease due to changes from winter to summer cereals at that time senescent and initial stages of both agricultural seasons coexist in the district in july and august irrigations are very large mainly because of the development of maize and its associated water requirement which covers about 60 of the surface area of the district represented in summer cereals and double cropping classes in fig 5 in september actual irrigations decrease once the senescent period of different crops particularly maize starts this decrease is kept until the end of the irrigation season late october from when the absence of irrigations is shown until the end of the year all of the variations in irrigation water use described above are well represented by simulations from var ret module in contrast the other three irrigation modules are not capable to simulate adequately the dynamics of irrigations along the year for instance the absence of irrigations in january february are not well represented by the modules that use a constant p trigger def fill and fix fill def fill simulates the first irrigations late january while fix fill simulates them from the beginning of the year because a small water depletion 10 of taw is sufficient to trigger irrigations thus def fill and fix fill simulate irrigations earlier since their fixed p trigger values 0 5 and 0 1 respectively are smaller than the time varying p trigger used in var ret in this period conversely var fill is able to reproduce the absence of irrigations in this period in february may period the three modules that apply an irrigation dose to fulfill the soil water reservoir def fill fix fill and var fill overestimates irrigations with different dynamics between them given their different p trigger values in july august period these three modules are not capable to reproduce the high irrigation applied in the district hence underestimating the actual irrigation amounts at the end of the irrigation season the three modules are roughly able to reproduce the decrease in irrigation water supply for the other years the first actual irrigations start later than in 2019 i e from march to april however var ret is still able to reproduce actual irrigations at the beginning of irrigation season for each year as described above for the calibration year the other three irrigation modules are not capable to estimate adequately the first irrigations of the year while the fix fill systematically overestimates irrigation from the beginning of the year def fill and var fill are able to correctly simulate the absence of irrigation during the first months however def fill and var fill largely overestimate the first simulated irrigation because of important amounts of water are needed to fulfill the soil water storage after it was progressively depleted during the absence of irrigations as it is clearly visible for 2017 and 2021 from the beginning of the irrigation season until may with exception of 2020 actual irrigations increase to reach a peak related to the fully developed winter cereals during the same period in 2020 weekly irrigations are much lower than for the other years varying between 0 no irrigation and 0 8 hm3 this is primarily because of large rainfall were observed in 2020 especially during april and may with a cumulated rainfall of 155 mm which is much larger than the rainfalls observed in 2017 2019 and 2021 i e 59 60 and 45 mm respectively similarly in 2018 var ret simulates smaller irrigation amounts until may due to rainfall of 158 mm in april may period however the agreement of simulations with observations in this period cannot be verified due to gaps in irrigation data nevertheless it should be noted that var ret is flexible enough to simulate accurately the irrigation water use during periods with completely different rainfall regimes than the one under which it was calibrated therefore the proposed approach controlled by a time varying threshold and a fixed i dose that regulates irrigations allows to obtain estimations closer to the observations along the year this is also valid when actual irrigations are very different among years during the summer months particularly july and august the var ret configuration is capable to reproduce the large amounts of irrigation water use with an estimated rmsd of 0 48 0 15 hm3 and a bias of 0 11 0 34 hm3 however the configurations that fill the water reservoir are not as accurate with a rmsd ranging from 0 74 0 27 to 1 16 0 27 hm3 and bias from 0 62 0 31 to 1 05 0 29 hm3 for var fill and def fill modules respectively this means that an irrigation dose of 9 mm and a p trigger value of 0 05 is suitable to reproduce the over irrigation regime practiced in algerri balaguer district during summer unlike the other configurations that does not allow the fao 2kc model to over irrigate the latter is observed for all years except for 2017 that present irrigation volumes very large from late june to mid september even above the historical mean plus a standard deviation in turn var ret reproduces volumes similar to the historical irrigation amounts 2010 2021 note that the larger irrigation observations during the summer 2017 are not attributable to any process represented by the fao 2kc as the development of crops et0 and rainfall in summer are relatively similar for all the five years 2017 2021 fig 9 illustrates the overall statistics of the comparison between simulated and observed irrigations for the four irrigation modules for each year separately in the taylor diagram the standard deviation std and centered root mean square difference rmsd are normalized by the standard deviation of observations of each year separately such a normalization allows presenting the statistics of all years in a single graph and to be compared against a reference point representing a perfect simulation with r of 1 rmsd of 0 and normalized std of 1 i e the same as that of observations 0 86 0 12 hm3 the diagram highlights the best performance obtained for the new approach var ret with statistics systematically closer to the reference point for each year for instance var ret systematically presents for all years the highest r of 0 95 0 02 the lowest centered rmsd of 0 27 0 07 hm3 and the std closest to that of observations 0 81 0 06 hm3 equivalent to a normalized std of 0 95 0 12 on the right of fig 9 the bias in simulated irrigation is plotted against the rmsd the best performance with a minimum bias is also systematically for each year obtained for var ret the new approach presents much better results than the classical irrigation modules even in 2017 when all approaches significantly underestimate irrigations with a bias ranging between 0 17 hm3 and 0 41 hm3 and large rmsd between 0 45 and 0 96 hm3 in addition to larger actual irrigation in 2017 this underestimation may be partially influenced by a lower irrigated area reported in the 2017 land cover map 8 less than the other years with exception of 2017 the var ret obtained a consistent rmsd around 0 24 0 03 hm3 and a bias around 0 02 0 01 hm3 4 3 discussions the strategy of using a time varying p trigger and a fixed i dose thus appears to be effective in improving the representation of irrigation practices along the year conversely the classical approaches using fixed p trigger and fulfilling the water storage capacity show the worst performances in fact def fill and fix fill modules present an overall r of 0 74 0 14 and 0 79 0 08 respectively and rmsd of 0 62 0 21 and 0 55 0 14 hm3 respectively this classical irrigation scheme can be significantly improved when using a time varying p trigger and keeping the classical i dose var fill with an overall r of 0 86 0 12 and rmsd of 0 45 0 20 hm3 it should be noted that the irrigation regime is not known a priori it is estimated from the difference between the observed irrigation and the optimal irrigation the classical approach def fill simulates the optimal irrigation that is the minimum water use no water loss by deep percolation that satisfies the crops requirement no crop water stress a deficit irrigation regime is hence evidenced by an observed irrigation lower than the optimal irrigation generally in april may while an over irrigation regime is evidenced by an observed irrigation larger than the optimal irrigation systematically in july august such a comparison between observed and optimal irrigation def fill is observed in fig 8 for example in terms of annual irrigations in 2019 the only year with no lack of data the annual irrigation in optimal conditions def fill is simulated at 35 4 hm3 while actual irrigations is 44 8 hm3 the over irrigation is mainly concentrated during summer when actual irrigations in july august amount to 21 3 hm3 while the optimal volume satisfying the crops requirement during this period is estimated to 11 4 hm3 moreover it is evidenced a deficit irrigation regime in spring when actual irrigation in april may is 7 9 hm3 while the optimal would be 9 4 hm3 for the five years 2017 2021 the under irrigation in april may is estimated to 0 22 0 07 hm3 week while the over irrigation in july august is estimated to 1 05 0 29 hm3 week the algerri balaguer irrigation district is thus under a deficit irrigation regime in spring and an over irrigation regime in summer this can be explained by a misinterpretation of irrigation water needs by farmers who underestimate the water needs for winter cereals and overestimate them for maize which are the main crops in the district covering about 60 of the total agricultural area therefore considering a fixed p trigger along the year is shown to be unreliable as it does not fit with the conception of local and traditional farmers for instance var fill using a time varying p trigger provides a much better agreement with observations than using a fixed p trigger as def fill and fix fill however the assumption of fulfilling the water reservoir may be unreliable for periods under important over irrigation regimes therefore the def fill fix fill and var fill modules are not suitable for irrigation district under deficit and over irrigation regimes similar results to those obtained by def fill and fix fill i e underestimating irrigation in summer and overestimating irrigation during the rest of the year were also retrieved by dari et al 2020 2022 from january 2016 to september 2017 over the same area algerri balaguer district using a soil moisture based approach the latter approach was proposed by brocca et al 2018 to estimate irrigation by inverting the water balance equation from the dynamics of coarse resolution satellite surface soil moisture products e g smap smos ascat amsr 2 it has been evaluated using irrigation data at multiple scales and different satellite products dari et al 2022 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 dari et al 2020 implemented two main improvements to estimate irrigation amounts at district scale i exploiting high resolution 1 km satellite soil moisture data and ii adopting the fao 2kc et formulation to adequately reproduce the crop et over irrigated areas they obtained a r of 0 76 over algerri balaguer that is very close to that obtained in the present study for def fill 0 74 and fix fill 0 79 then dari et al 2022 evaluated the impact of different sources of et in the same soil moisture based approach and found that the et from the fao 2kc model showed the best performance although et process is critical in determining the soil water dynamics siebert and döll 2010 using reliable et estimates at field scale is insufficient to invert irrigations accurately since different irrigation practices may lead to similar et especially in over irrigation regime note that the parameters involved in the estimation of et may vary according to the formulations of et and of soil water transfers note however that the impact of physical parameters is limited in the case of over irrigation when the et is controlled by the evaporative demand and not by the soil water availability to illustrate this point brombacher et al 2022 recently proposed an irrigation retrieval approach based on the difference in remotely sensed et between irrigated and natural dry land vegetation cover the authors implemented the method in the ebro basin and evaluated the results on three plots close to the algerri balaguer district the retrieved monthly water use strongly underestimated the actual water use in algerri balaguer a fixed i dose is used for the var ret module consistent with the relatively large uncertainty in the monthly retrieved i dose see fig 5 note that the i dose is actually spatially and temporally variable due to diverse irrigation systems and practices within the area the i dose parameter is thus an effective value that represents the mean water amount applied per irrigation event over the district beyond the issue of non representation of i dose variabilities the strength of the proposed approach is to represent with good accuracy the overall trend of irrigation practices through the effective values of p trigger and i dose at the scale of the irrigation district the pf assimilation method is thus a powerful tool that allows i taking into account the uncertainties of the model by means of input parameters errors ii incorporating prior information on the distribution of different variables iii estimating various parameters at the same time and iv giving a realistic representation of the retrieved parameters and improving model s simulations however the major drawback is certainly the computational cost algorithms too computationally demanding can be impractical and even prohibitive for cases with a large data set in this study however we successfully reduced the computational cost by implementing the fao56 model over the five main land covers only instead of the 3000 crop fields present in algerri balaguer this was possible because i the five main crop types account for 94 of the total simulated irrigation over the district ii the area covered by each class is relatively uniform in terms of soil properties and iii vegetation states are also relatively uniform due to similar growing cycles per land cover class another limitation of the proposed approach is the need for irrigation water use observations to calibrate smthreshold and i dose which are most often unavailable in this study we show that the irrigation module var ret is capable of simulating irrigation accurately in all regimes from deficit to excess irrigation however further studies should investigate alternative calibration approaches of the irrigation parameters without relying on in situ irrigation data especially the assimilation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration soil moisture data could provide relevant information on irrigation practices kumar et al 2015 felfelani et al 2018 abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 olivera guerra et al 2020 nie et al 2022 kwon et al 2022 the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data will foster the detection of irrigation events and of their impact on the actual crop water budget 5 conclusion to date the irrigation modules of land surface models have not yet been evaluated under different e g deficit or excess irrigation regimes although agricultural practices greatly vary according to many climatological crop types soil conditions human etc factors such irrigation modules are generally based on two parameters smthreshold and smtarget at which irrigation automatically starts and stops respectively with an irrigation dose i dose being a function of smthreshold and smtarget in this study we develop a new method to represent via smthreshold and i dose the temporally varying irrigation water use of an irrigation district in any optimal deficit or even over irrigation regime to do that we implement the fao 56 dual crop coefficient fao 2kc model over the 8100 ha algerri balaguer irrigation district and the temporal dynamics of the irrigation parameters smthreshold and i dose are retrieved from the irrigation observations in 2019 results are evaluated against irrigation observations over 5 years from 2017 to 2021 based on this work the following conclusions can be drawn inverting smthreshold variable at monthly scale with a fixed i dose produces more accurate irrigation estimates than inverting both irrigation parameters smthreshold and i dose at monthly scale the seasonal evolution of the monthly retrieved smthreshold informs about the irrigation regime of both yearly irrigation periods in the district a slight irrigation water use from winter to spring and an over irrigation period during summer with a smthreshold very close to smfc the main difference between these two periods is due to a misinterpretation by farmers of the irrigation water needs of the main crops in the district 60 this results in a slight underestimation of the water needs for winter cereals leading to a deficit irrigation regime and a significant overestimation for maize leading to an excess irrigation regime the new irrigation scheme var ret obtains systematically the best performance for each of the 5 years 2017 2021 compared to the other three tested modules with an overall r of 0 95 0 02 and a rmsd of 0 27 0 07 hm3 equivalent to a mean water depth over the district of 0 64 0 17 mm day especially the monthly retrieved smthreshold improves significantly the performance of the classical fao 56 irrigation module using a fixed smthreshold along the year moreover setting i dose to the amount needed to fill the root zone soil reservoir does not allow reproducing irrigation volumes under over irrigation regimes as occurring in summer in the algerri balaguer district regardless of the variabilities of i dose at the field scale due to diverse irrigation systems and practices the strength of the proposed approach is to represent with good accuracy the overall trend of irrigation practices through the effective values of smthreshold and i dose at the integrated scale of the irrigation district given the strong consistency in terms of formalism and parameterization of the new irrigation module with existing modules based on smthreshold and smtarget parameters the proposed approach can be implemented in a wide variety of land surface and hydrological models nevertheless the calibration method of smthreshold and i dose relies on irrigation water use measurements which are rarely available worldwide another related issue is the assumption that the model parameters smthreshold and i dose are uniform within the irrigation district meaning that the same effective value is applied to different crop types and irrigation systems within the study area in algerri balaguer maize largely dominates the water consumption of irrigation water in summer so that the variability of smthreshold is attributed to maize irrigation practices however irrigation practices may differ significantly over other areas with different crop types and irrigation systems which would result in heterogeneous irrigation parameters within the district therefore next studies should address both issues requiring spatially distributed information on irrigation by retrieving smthreshold and i dose in both time and space this could be achieved

9076,the modeling of irrigation in land surface models are generally based on two soil moisture parameters smthreshold and smtarget at which irrigation automatically starts and stops respectively typically both parameters are usually set to optimal values allowing to fill the soil water reservoir with just the estimated right amount and to avoid crop water excess at all times the point is that agricultural practices greatly vary according to many factors climatological crop soil technical human etc to fill the gap we propose a new calibration method of smthreshold and smtarget to represent the irrigation water use in any optimal deficit or even over irrigation regime the approach is tested using the dual crop coefficient fao 56 model implemented at the field scale over an 8100 ha irrigation district in northeastern spain where the irrigation water use is precisely monitored at the district scale both irrigation parameters are first retrieved at monthly scale from the irrigation observations of year 2019 the irrigation simulated by the fao 56 model is then evaluated against observations at district and weekly scale over 5 years 2017 2021 separately the performance of the newly calibrated irrigation module is also assessed by comparing it against three other modules with varying configurations including default estimates for smthreshold and smtarget the proposed irrigation module obtains systematically the best performance for each of the 5 years with an overall correlation coefficient of 0 95 0 02 and root mean square error of 0 27 0 07 hm3 week 0 64 0 17 mm day unlike the three irrigation modules used as benchmark the new irrigation module is able to reproduce the farmers practices throughout the year and especially to simulate the actual water use in the deficit and excess irrigation regimes occurring in the study area in spring and summer respectively keywords irrigation module irrigation amounts data assimilation water balance model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation water use represents more than 70 of the mobilized freshwater at global scale foley et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012 and the demand for irrigation water is still rising puy et al 2021 wada et al 2013 2011 despite the important pressure of agriculture on water resources information on the amount of irrigated water is often unavailable therefore monitoring and quantifying irrigation over large areas is critical for an efficient management and allocation of water resources as well as to understand the biogeophysical impacts of irrigation on water cycle and climate haddeland et al 2006 krakauer et al 2020 puma and cook 2010 thiery et al 2020 2017 even though significant efforts have been made to develop irrigation retrieval methods the dynamics of irrigation practices is hard to monitor due to the unavailability of consistent irrigation data and the reluctance of farmers and managers to share such data foster et al 2020 massari et al 2021 moreover irrigation practices are greatly heterogeneous because of the diversity of water needs mainly driven by crop types climate and soil conditions water availability and local agreements various irrigation systems e g flood sprinkler and drip that often coexist within the same irrigated district and farmers conceptions of irrigation massari et al 2021 in fact the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation practices and their inter and intra annual variabilities make the representation of the irrigation water use at all scales challenging in recent decades important efforts have been made to model irrigation processes especially within large scale land surface e g haddeland et al 2006 ozdogan et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012 lawrence et al 2019 and hydrological e g hanasaki et al 2008 2018 wada et al 2014 jägermeyr et al 2015 models assessing the irrigation effects on climate and associated feedbacks on land water cycle from regional to global scales has received a particular interest pokhrel et al 2016 some authors have evaluated the impact of irrigation on the partitioning of energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes de rosnay et al 2003 haddeland et al 2006 leng et al 2013 and its associated cooling effect thiery et al 2020 2017 on the depletion of groundwater recharge leng et al 2014 scanlon et al 2006 on the decrease in streamflow haddeland et al 2006 tang et al 2007 and on changes in precipitation patterns guimberteau et al 2012 puma and cook 2010 in general all the above authors highlighted the crucial need to realistically account for irrigation in future climatic and hydrological projections leng et al 2015 thiery et al 2017 wada et al 2013 at the crop field scale the most widely used approach relies on the formalism of the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 in this case irrigations are simulated according to the simulated crop water requirements similarly to most irrigation schemes in large scale land surface models allen et al 1998 suggested that an optimal irrigation is applied before or at the moment when the readily available soil water raw is depleted with a water amount smaller than or equal to the root zone depletion to fulfill the soil water storage capacity raw is the amount of water that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering from water stress it is hence estimated as the difference between the soil moisture at field capacity smfc and the critical soil moisture at the onset of crop water stress smcritical in practice fao 56 model automatically simulates irrigation when the simulated root zone soil moisture reaches smcritical with the amount of water needed to make the simulated soil moisture reach smfc the current irrigation modules of large scale land surface models follow the same strategy to simulate irrigation according to the simulated crop water requirement where smthreshold is set to smcritical and the target soil moisture smtarget to smfc e g haddeland et al 2006 for instance ozdogan et al 2010 implemented an irrigation scheme in the noah land surface model chen et al 1996 irrigation is triggered when the soil moisture availability falls below a user defined smthreshold set to 50 of smfc which is defined according to discussions with local experts in nebraska and california in the united states followed by trial and error in ozdogan et al 2010 the irrigation water is supplied as precipitation to mimic sprinkler systems consistent with the technique used in the studied regions i e nebraska and california however the same irrigation module is also used in other regions where irrigation practices are different for example modanesi et al 2022 recently implemented this module in germany and italy with smthreshold empirically set to 45 in italy to avoid large overestimations in irrigation amounts using the default threshold value of 50 the latter calibration strategy i e by setting sm threshold to a prescribed value as in ozdogan et al 2010 was evaluated by comparing the 1 km resolution simulations with the observations available in several small 0 4 ha fields and two 290 and 760 ha irrigation districts another example is given by the community land model clm oleson et al 2013 which also includes an irrigation scheme based on ozdogan et al 2010 in clm smtarget is set to a weighted sum of smcritical and the soil moisture at saturation the weighting parameter firrig was determined empirically as 0 7 to approximately match the global irrigation water use estimated in year 2000 according to shiklomanov 2000 note that the most recent version of clm clm5 lawrence et al 2019 updated the irrigation triggering by improving the representation of smcritical with an explicit water transport through the vegetation and a more physical root water uptake however the principle in this module remains identical to the classical approach based on a target soil moisture level as in ozdogan et al 2010 another recent irrigation module proposed in the isba land surface model druel et al 2022 adopts a predefined irrigation triggering based on the soil moisture index and a fixed water amount per irrigation event this strategy implies an a priori knowledge of the irrigation practices over the area leng et al 2013 2014 suggested that calibrating the irrigation module at global scale may not be suitable for regional studies due to unreasonable simulations compared against census data therefore they calibrated firrig at the level of administrative units counties and water resource regions in the united states by comparing simulated annual irrigation amounts against census data of the year 2000 these studies found a very large spatial variability in firrig ranging between 0 2 and 1 leng et al 2014 also proved that a calibration at a finer scale counties versus water resource regions is more suitable for studying highly localized phenomena such as groundwater pumping leng et al 2015 extended this approach to the entire world by calibrating firrig at national and sub national scales against the global inventory developed by siebert et al 2010 however the reference data from this global inventory were estimated based on the optimal demand for crop growth which is probably not a realistic scenario given the variety of irrigation practices and the fact that it is rather difficult for farmers to follow the exact crop water requirement in the same vein puy et al 2021 compared the annual irrigation estimates provided at country scale worldwide by eight different global models and showed large discrepancies using uniform smthreshold and smtarget parameters actually means that these schemes largely ignore the spatial variability and temporal dynamics of irrigation practices moreover irrigation estimates are usually validated against annual data from census and surveys at administrative to country scales e g aquastat 2016 which are generally unreliable due to bureaucratic and political constraints puy et al 2021 therefore most of existing irrigation modules have been calibrated using biased reference data and have not been validated against actual irrigation water use at temporal scales finer than annual in an attempt to address the diversity of irrigation practices and the lack of reliable census data felfelani et al 2018 constrained the spatio temporal variability of smtarget by assimilating in clm a satellite surface soil moisture product smap this approach provided promising improvements in irrigation simulations at large scale however there are still some shortcomings to overcome such as i the spatial resolution of satellite soil moisture products 36 km for smap is not suitable for monitoring the crop water status at the scale of agricultural practices and ii discrepancies between the top soil moisture detected by remote sensing and that of the root zone which is where smthreshold and smtarget apply to trigger a simulated irrigation event and refill the root zone soil water reservoir although land surface models have become increasingly accurate in the representation of biophysical processes they remain still limited with respect to represent the human related processes like irrigation in this vein the above literature review thus clearly highlights the lack of calibration and validation studies of irrigation modules at the spatial and temporal scales of the management of irrigation water and using reliable irrigation observations to fill the gap the objective of this study is to evaluate different irrigation modules at the weekly scale over an irrigation district where the water withdrawal is precisely measured to accomplish this we develop and test a new calibration method of smthreshold and smtarget parameters we rely on the fao 56 formalism to model the crop water budget at the field scale as it is widely used by the agricultural community however the tested irrigation modules could be easily implemented in more physically based land surface models the study focuses on an irrigation district in northeastern spain algerri balaguer covered by 8100 ha of crops mainly maize barley wheat and fruit trees irrigated by sprinkler and drip systems the study area has the particularity of accounting with real time measurements of irrigation water use at the district scale the availability of these data is of great interest to assess the performance of irrigation modules at the scale of the agricultural water management as well as to quantify the actual water use efficiency to ensure a better management the main originality of our work is to demonstrate the capability of the irrigation modeling and calibration strategy to retrieve the overall irrigation regime through the retrieval of smthreshold and smtarget at the spatially integrated district scale 2 study area and data the present study was performed for the period from april 2017 to december 2021 over the algerri balaguer irrigation district section 2 1 in northeastern spain catalonia the data used are composed of the time series of observed irrigation water withdrawals for the district and the input data to the dual crop coefficient fao 56 model are a vegetation index derived from sentinel 2 satellite data on clear sky days acquired over algerri balaguer a land cover map information on soil texture from the global map database soilgrids poggio et al 2021 and times series of meteorological data collected by two stations included in the study area a detailed description of the dataset is presented below 2 1 algerri balaguer district the algerri balaguer irrigation district is located north of lleida in the ebro basin lleida has a semi arid continental mediterranean climate typical of the ebro valley with a mean annual air temperature rainfall and number of rain days of 16 c 340 mm and 60 respectively the irrigation district covers about 8100 ha of cropped lands the main crop types 85 being maize barley wheat fruit trees and alfalfa more than 50 of the district is cultivated by double crops with winter cereals mainly barley and maize in summer irrigation is applied over about 75 of the area either using sprinkler systematically for annual crops or drip systematically for fruit trees systems the rest 25 is a rainfed dryland area covered by winter cereals barley an overview of algerri balaguer district is presented in fig 1 2 2 irrigation data the algerri balaguer district is fed with the pyrenees water which is transported and stored by an extensive irrigation network built within the ebro basin milano et al 2013 the water is pumped in the noguera ribagorçana river and transported by gravity through the irrigation canals of algerri balaguer to be stored in upstream reservoirs and then used for irrigation in the downstream crops the pumped water is measured in real time by the automatic hydrological information system saih of the ebro basin the pumped water data are aggregated at weekly scale shown in fig 2 in order to dampen the potential time lag of several days between the water pumping and actual application of irrigation water at field level in this study the irrigation water use observations are derived from the pumped water volume reduced by 5 8 considering losses by evaporation and leaks during the transfer from the river and reservoir to the fields the losses were estimated for the year 2021 from the annual water withdrawn from the river and the data provided by water counters distributed in the district and sporadically collected by the algerri balaguer district agency this estimation was only available for the year 2021 2 3 sentinel 2 ndvi sentinel 2 s2 is a wide swath high resolution multispectral imaging mission with a global 5 day revisit frequency consisting of two satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b launched in june 2015 and march 2017 respectively and managed by the european space agency esa the study period from april 2017 to december 2021 is defined to ensure the availability of satellite images throughout the entire period with similar frequency the multispectral instrument msi on board both s2 platforms samples 13 spectral bands from which only the red band 4 and near infrared band 8 data at 10 m spatial resolution are used in this study to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the s2 derived ndvi is used to monitor the state and phenology of crops we used the level 2a orthorectified atmospherically corrected surface reflectances first the cloud mask band qa60 is applied in order to remove pixels contaminated by opaque clouds a second cloud masking is applied from the cirrus band band 10 if more than 25 of pixels inside a given field were removed by the cloud masking procedure then all pixels inside this field were removed in order to avoid cloud contamination conversely if less than 25 of pixels inside a given field were affected by clouds then the s2 ndvi data were aggregated at the field scale by averaging the ndvi pixels falling inside the plots delineated by the land cover map of each year from 2017 to 2021 separately finally the field scale ndvi data are interpolated at the daily scale by using a piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method fritsch and carlson 1980 2 4 land cover map a detailed land cover map is obtained from the geographic information system for agricultural parcels sigpac and the single agricultural declaration dun document sigpac is a public registry of an administrative nature that contains information on the fields at 1 5000 scale and 25 cm spatial resolution and dun is a yearly mandatory declaration about the agricultural exploitation that each farmer of an agricultural productive area must provide annual sigpac and dun products are extracted from https analisi transparenciacatalunya cat the products provide the crop type of each plot land and whether it is irrigated or not dryland since the sigpac database is produced on a yearly basis there is no information about the presence of double crops although they should be included for estimating the total water use therefore we added to the original sigpac database a new class double crops such a classification is based on the detection of a second peak in the annual s2 ndvi time series note that the plots smaller than 100 m2 after subtracting a buffer of 10 m are removed to avoid plots whose pixels are all affected by border effects taking into account the 10 m spatial resolution of ndvi data 2 5 soil data soil properties are obtained from the global isric international soil reference and information centre soilgrids data set v2 0 updated from its previous version hengl et al 2017 poggio et al 2021 soilgrids has a spatial resolution of 250 m and provides soil texture information that is the clay sand and silt contents and their uncertainty at different depths the clay and sand percentages of the 0 5 5 15 15 30 30 60 and 60 100 cm layers are linearly averaged to estimate their effective values over the 1 m deep soil profile soil information for deeper layers is not used given that they are more uncertain the estimated uncertainty in clay and sand percentages is estimated to be less than 3 in the 1 m soil profile over the algerri balaguer district finally the 250 m resolution and 0 1 m deep sand and clay percentages are averaged at the plot scale using the sigpac annual maps as for ndvi data 2 6 meteorological data the meteorological data are obtained from 4 stations algerri alfarras albesa and vallfogona de balaguer located in algerri balaguer district and belonging to the catalan meteorological network data are available at https ruralcat gencat cat web guest agrometeo estacions both stations provide daily air temperature air humidity wind speed solar radiation reference evapotranspiration and precipitation there is very little difference between simultaneous measurements at the 4 stations not shown so that the meteorological variables are considered to be uniform over the irrigation district and set to the mean of individual measurements 3 methodology irrigation modules are traditionally constrained to estimate irrigation in an optimal scenario not being able to estimate actual irrigation in the case of excess or deficit irrigation in reality irrigation practices are likely to change along the year according to the crop development and the atmospheric demand e g irrigation more frequent and intense during summer and the opposite in winter so it is rather difficult for farmers to follow the exact crop water requirement therefore farmers often overestimate and or underestimate irrigation throughout the agricultural season to fill this gap in irrigation modules we propose to invert irrigation parameters smthreshold and smtarget in time in order to reproduce the dynamics of irrigation practices along the year detailed in section 3 3 in this study we take advantage of the fao 56 model allen et al 1998 to implement different irrigation modules including the classical one originally used by the fao 56 model the performance of the different irrigation modules is evaluated to estimate the actual irrigation water use at weekly and district scale the overall approach for testing the irrigation modules is 1 the fao 56 model is implemented at the field scale over the entire algerri balaguer area 2 both irrigation parameters smthreshold and smtarget are inverted at district month scale from the assimilation of 2019 irrigation observations into the fao 56 model 3 both retrieved parameters are used as input to the fao 56 model which is run over 5 separate years from 2017 to 2020 and 4 the irrigations simulated at district scale are compared with observations at weekly scale and the impact of the temporal variability of smthreshold and smtarget is assessed each step is detailed in the following sections the overall methodology is summarized in the schematic diagram of fig 4 3 1 fao 56 dual crop coefficient model the fao 56 dual crop coefficient model fao 2kc allen et al 1998 is a water balance model to simulate the crop evapotranspiration et the fao 2kc model is driven by 1 meteorological forcing variables to calculate reference evapotranspiration et0 and 2 the water supply from precipitation and irrigation to simulate the soil water availability for soil evaporation and plant transpiration according to the fao 2kc formalism the daily water balance is expressed as 1 dr t dr t 1 et t p t i t dp t cr t ro t where dr is the root zone depletion p the precipitation i the irrigation dp the deep percolation cr the capillarity rise and ro the surface runoff every term is expressed in mm for the day t and t 1 for dr the ro and cr term are neglected due to fairly flat surfaces and a water table deeper than 2 m in the study area the algerri balaguer district is equipped with 2 m deep drains to prevent any rise of the water table dp is estimated as the rest of the eq 1 et is estimated by multiplying et0 by two separate crop coefficients for transpiration and evaporation as follows 2 et ks kcb ke et 0 where kcb is the basal crop transpiration ks 0 1 the water stress coefficient that reduces the potential transpiration t kcb et0 and ke the evaporation coefficient that is also regulated by an evaporation factor kr et0 is calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 at daily scale and kcb is estimated from a linear relationship with fraction of vegetation cover fc as 3 kcb fc t kslope crop koffset crop with kslopecrop and koffsetcrop being two parameters depending on crop type and whose values are obtained from literature and presented in table 1 fct at day t is estimated from daily ndvi as in eq 3 but using the parameters fslopecrop and foffsetcrop reported in table 1 fig 3 illustrates the time series of mean kcb in 2021 for the main crop types over algerri balaguer district ks is calculated based on daily computation of the water balance for the root zone layer zr m as follows 4 k s taw d r taw raw taw d r taw 1 p where dr mm is calculated from the daily water balance according to the eq 1 taw mm is the total available soil water in the root zone and p is the fraction of taw that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering from water stress determining raw p taw according to allen et al 1998 p is a crop specific parameter that controls the water depth threshold below which irrigation should be triggered to avoid crop water stress by keeping dr smaller than raw ks 1 taw is estimated as the difference between smfc and the water content at wilting point smwp by the daily crop rooting depth zr as 5 taw 1000 sm fc sm wp zr the soil parameters smfc and smwp are estimated using the clay and sand contents from soilgrids data and following the pedotransfer function proposed by román dobarco et al 2019 in algerri balaguer district smwp and smfc are quite homogeneous with values of 0 207 0 006 and 0 330 0 005 m3m 3 respectively the rooting depth zr is assumed to vary between a minimum value zrmin maintained during the initial crop growth stage and set to 0 1 m for annual crops and a maximum value zrmax reached at the maximum ndvi per plot in the agricultural season zr is thus expressed as 6 zr t zr min fc t zr max zr min the kr soil evaporation reduction coefficient is simulated by the surface depletion water in the surface evaporable layer and according to merlin et al 2016 to take into account its dependence to soil texture the texture based method for kr has been derived and evaluated over a variety of sites and clay sand contents lehmann et al 2018 merlin et al 2016 and recently implemented into the fao 2kc model by amazirh et al 2021 as 7 k r 0 5 0 5 cos π ssm sm saturation p where ssm is the actual surface soil moisture smsaturation is the soil moisture at saturation and p is a semi empirical parameter depending on the depth of soil moisture estimates and soil properties texture amazirh et al 2021 merlin et al 2016 as ssm is not explicitly estimated in the fao 2kc model it is derived from the surface soil water depletion de the total evaporable water tew and the soil evaporation layer depth ze in m as 8 ssm 0 5 sm wp tew de 1000 ze 3 2 irrigation module the fao 2kc model can be used to simulate irrigation by assuming that irrigation events occur at the onset of the crop water stress in practice the simulated irrigation is automatically triggered on the day when raw is depleted i e dr raw and the irrigation dose is estimated as the water amount necessary to fulfill the water storage capacity and to get back up to the field capacity soil moisture equal to smfc therefore the fao 2kc model classically simulates irrigation events in an optimal scenario along the season in order to maintain crop under unstressed conditions without generating surplus water we can thus define the i dose parameter as the irrigation water volume in mm applied per irrigation event over a given field an irrigation event is triggered simulated for each field when the simulated root zone soil moisture reaches smthreshold the root zone soil moisture is simulated from the modeled soil water budget that includes the plant transpiration soil evaporation and deep percolation terms which depend on the root zone water depletion eq 1 controlled mainly by the crop transpiration therefore i dose mm can be represented in a generic form as the difference between the soil moisture at which irrigation automatically starts smthreshold and stops smtarget as 9 idose 1000 sm target sm threshold zr in the case of fao 2kc model smthreshold is usually set to the critical soil moisture at the onset of crop water stress smcritical while smtarget is usually set to the soil moisture at field capacity smfc however in reality smthreshold and smtarget can differ significantly from smcritical and smfc respectively this notably occurs in deficit smthreshold smcritical and excess smtarget smfc irrigation case respectively note that in the fao 2kc model smcritical is related to the fraction p raw taw threshold below which crop is under water stress based on this expression we can express a threshold for triggering irrigation in a generic form herein p trigger as the ratio between dr and taw unitless which means the fraction of water depleted in relation to the water storage capacity therefore p trigger can be related to the smthreshold used by several irrigation schemes see section 1 as the complement of the normalized smthreshold 10 ptrigger 1 sm threshold sm wp sm fc sm wp therefore we can distinguish two key parameters controlling irrigation the threshold for triggering irrigation p trigger and the irrigation dose applied by irrigation event i dose note that both parameters allow representing not only an optimal irrigation regime satisfying the crops requirement but also under irrigation regimes implying crop water stress with a p trigger lower than the value defined in allen et al 1998 and over irrigation regimes implying deep percolation with an i dose resulting in a root zone soil moisture value exceeding the smfc both irrigation parameters are used in this study to define and test four different irrigation modules which are summarized in table 2 and described below 3 2 1 avoiding stress and fulfilling the water storage capacity classical fao 2kc or def fill irrigation module the p trigger in the fao 2kc model by default is the crop tolerance to stress parameter fraction p proposed by allen et al 1998 it is about 0 4 0 6 for most of crops crop specific and corrected by meteorological conditions the i dose is estimated as the water depth to fulfill the water storage capacity raw making the dr equal to 0 therefore this approach does not allow producing water excess as it simulates the optimal amount of water when it is necessary note that after a significant rainfall event no irrigation is needed to supply the crop water needs 3 2 2 no a priori assumption on p trigger and irrigation dose var ret irrigation module both irrigation parameters p trigger and i dose are retrieved at the monthly time scale from irrigation observations at the district scale such a strategy is expected to provide robust estimates under all optimal deficit and over irrigation regimes 3 2 3 no a priori assumption on p trigger and fulfilling the water storage capacity var fill irrigation module similarly to var ret this irrigation module used as input the p trigger retrieved at monthly scale from observations however i dose is estimated by fulfilling the water storage capacity as in the classical fao 56 irrigation module this strategy is adopted in order to evaluate whether fulfilling the water storage reservoir would be adequate to reproduce irrigation for all the year 3 2 4 p trigger set to its summer value and fulfilling the water storage capacity fix fill irrigation module irrigation is triggered by setting the p trigger to its value retrieved during summer july august september when irrigation water use is the most intense the i dose is estimated by fulfilling the water storage capacity as in the classical fao 56 irrigation module this strategy is adopted in order to evaluate whether a p trigger representative of the most intense irrigation period would be adequate to reproduce irrigation for all the year 3 3 inverting irrigation parameters in this study both irrigation parameters p trigger and i dose are inverted from observed irrigations over algerri balaguer district the retrieval method is based on a particle filter pf assimilation approach to estimate jointly irrigations and the parameters controlling irrigation throughout the year for this purpose observed irrigations cumulated over a weekly basis are assimilated into the fao 2kc model by land cover classes both aspects of the retrieval method are detailed below 3 3 1 particle filter assimilation method the pf approach vrugt et al 2013 is used to retrieve p trigger and i dose on a weekly basis by assimilating into the fao 2kc the observed irrigations over algerri balaguer district the model state consists of water depletions simulated for both surface and root zone layers from daily water balance at the end of the assimilation period 7 days the pf based assimilation requires an accurate statistical representation of observation and model errors in this study random uncertainties in irrigation observations are represented by a standard deviation equal to 10 of their absolute values moreover since irrigation during winter in algerri balaguer district is usually zero the minimum observation error is set to 0 1 hm3 equivalent to a mean water depth over the district of about 0 24 mm day to avoid degeneracy and sample impoverishment problems typical of noise free dynamical systems gordon et al 1993 moradkhani et al 2005 in order to represent the modelling uncertainty the most sensitive parameters of fao 2kc model are perturbed according to a normal distribution with a varying standard deviation equal to 10 of their corresponding values based on the comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the fao 2kc model by laluet et al 2022 four main parameters are selected the maximum rooting depth zrmax slope and offset of the linear relationship between kcb and ndvi as well as the maximum possible kcb kcbmax in addition the surface and root zone depletions including initial states are perturbed by 10 of their values without considering spatial or temporal autocorrelation initial values of surface and root zone depletions on the first day of the simulation period set to the 1st january of a given year are sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 40 of taw by assuming that the depleted water never exceeds 40 of taw in winter this is supported by spin up fao 2kc simulations which show that for each of the 5 studied years 2017 2021 the depletions simulated at the end of the year are systematically below 40 even if no irrigation is simulated in november and december the parameters to be estimated p trigger and i dose are also sampled from a uniform distribution with a sampling size set to 300 particles considering all the possible values over the irrigation district specifically p trigger is bounded between 0 01 and 0 90 meaning that irrigation is triggered when the root zone depletion reaches 1 and 90 of taw respectively similarly i dose is bounded between 0 no irrigation and 20 mm which is the maximum range of irrigation amount per event that can be found in the district according to the irrigation systems drip or sprinkler as irrigation practices are likely to change along the year both irrigation parameters are reinitialized to the initial uniform distribution every 4 weeks in that case the irrigation parameters are time varying and inverted for a window of 4 weeks the duration 4 weeks of the assimilation period is a compromise between the temporal dynamics of the parameters which may change during the agricultural season and the number of available observations a time series of four weekly observations in our case note that this strategy helps to minimize the degeneracy problem that is more pronounced with longer periods abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 to fully avoid degeneracy the particles are resampled when the so called effective sample size neff has decreased below the predefined threshold of one third of the initial particle size number moradkhani et al 2005 van leeuwen et al 2019 the assimilation approach is performed 4 times by considering a moving window starting on january 1 8 15 and 22 respectively since the 1 month assimilation periods overlap between the four assimilation runs the parameters estimated from the four runs are averaged on a weekly basis this is done in order to smooth out the parameter dynamics at the validation weekly scale 3 3 2 implementation of fao 2kc by crop type in order to minimize the computational cost of running fao 2kc hundreds of times i e number of particles size on each of the 3000 crop fields in algerri balaguer using a pf the inversion process is carried out by implementing fao 2kc over the five main crop types only those five land cover classes are double cropping mainly barley followed by maize winter cereals mainly barley summer cereals mainly maize fruit trees mainly peaches nectarines pears and apples and forages mainly alfalfa by simulating irrigation over the 3000 crop fields from the classical approach the five main land cover classes account for 94 of the total simulated irrigation over the district fig 5 fao 2kc is therefore implemented by land cover class by considering that the area covered by each class is relatively uniform in terms of soil properties this is verified by soidgrids data and the small standard deviation in smwp and smfc less than 0 006 m3m 3 and vegetation state for that fao 2kc inputs like ndvi and soil properties are first averaged by land cover class in order to build a dataset by land cover type the model is then run to simulate the irrigation depths mm for each of the five classes separately and the irrigation simulated per class is finally aggregated at the district scale by considering their respective areas within algerri balaguer district the remaining 6 of irrigation water consumed by the rest of land cover classes is represented by the average behavior in water consumption of the main five classes 3 4 calibration validation strategy the calibration process is carried out by implementing the fao 2kc model as described above for 2019 and illustrated in fig 4 since it is the only year without missing data in both observed irrigations and s2 ndvi once the time varying parameters are calibrated in 2019 they are used to implement the four irrigation modules def fill fix fill var fill and var ret for each of the 5 years between 2017 and 2021 separately unlike the calibration process where fao 2kc is implemented at land cover level over the five main crop types the fao 2kc model is run over all the 3000 crop fields for validation and intercomparison purposes including all land cover classes the irrigation estimates from the four irrigation modules are evaluated against observations in order to assess how the parameters p trigger and i dose impact the performance of fao 2kc to reproduce at the irrigation district scale the actual irrigation practices along the season 4 results and discussion 4 1 retrieving irrigation parameters the model parameters representing farmers irrigation practices over the algerri balaguer district are retrieved for the year 2019 from the approach described in section 3 3 fig 6 shows the evolution of the retrieved p trigger and i dose as well as a comparison between simulated and observed irrigations at district scale on a weekly basis a good agreement is obtained with a bias root mean square difference rmsd and correlation coefficient r between simulated and observed irrigation of 0 038 hm3 0 154 hm3 and 0 991 respectively in fact all observations fall within the estimated standard deviation of ensemble simulations although the observed irrigations are well estimated by inverting both irrigation parameters p trigger and i dose simultaneously i dose is estimated with an overall high uncertainty the temporal mean of the weekly temporal standard deviation is 4 1 mm such an uncertainty represents 45 of the temporal mean of retrieved i dose 9 1 mm and is even larger than the standard deviation 2 4 mm evaluated in time during 2019 of the weekly retrieved i dose in contrast p trigger is better retrieved with a much smaller relative uncertainty 25 moreover the higher uncertainty in retrieved p trigger during march is likely due to a compensation effect with the retrieved i dose whose uncertainty is reduced during the same period for the above reasons insignificant temporal variations of retrieved i dose and possible compensation effects between retrieved p trigger and i dose a choice is made to set the i dose to a constant value which is estimated as the mean of the weekly i dose retrieved throughout the year in practice the assimilation approach is implemented a second time to retrieve p trigger parameter in time weekly scale uniquely in that case i dose is considered constant equal to 9 mm with an uncertainty of 4 mm which are obtained from respectively the temporal mean of the retrieved i dose and the temporal mean of the standard deviation at the weekly scale during 2019 irrigation estimates from the assimilation approach using a fixed i dose fig 7 are even more accurate than using a time varying i dose with a bias rmsd and r between simulated and observed irrigation of 0 016 0 084 hm3 and 0 998 respectively as shown in fig 7 the time varying p trigger estimates show a progressive evolution representing the main two periods of irrigation throughout the year from january to mid june until the end of spring and from mid july to september summer in the first period p trigger is well constrained with a small uncertainty lower than 0 1 and a slight decrease from 0 70 in january to 0 60 at mid june representing the gradual increase in irrigation water use in the district according to the quite homogeneous smwp 0 207 m3m 3 and smfc 0 330 m3m 3 values in algerri balaguer the gradual increase in p trigger represents a slight increase in smthreshold from 0 244 to 0 256 m3m 3 in contrast the p trigger retrieved during summer is very low with values ranging from 0 05 to 0 1 depletion is always lower than 10 of taw and uncertainties around 0 04 the second irrigation period is thus characterized by an intense and frequent use of water keeping the soil water content close to or even above smfc indeed smthreshold is quite stable and close to smfc in summer with a value around 0 32 m3m 3 between both periods mid june to early july an abrupt change of p trigger values is visible in fig 7 in fact irrigation practices over the district completely change at that time from a slight irrigation water use to an intense and frequent irrigation during summer after summer from october irrigations are significantly diminished and thus the retrieved p trigger increases note that the uncertainty in p trigger is relatively large at that time because the fao 2kc stops the irrigation season when a decrease of 40 of maximum ndvi by field is detected consequently when the irrigation season over annual crops is finished there is not enough information to constraint p trigger which regains its original distribution i e uniform distribution between 0 01 and 0 90 in summary p trigger is accurately retrieved from irrigation observations by setting i dose to a constant therefore the estimated time varying p trigger and the constant i dose fixed to 9 mm are used in our proposed approach var ret to simulate irrigations over each crop field 4 2 comparing the four irrigation modules the performance of the fao 2kc model using the var ret irrigation module is evaluated for the five years 2017 2021 separately to do so the simulated irrigations from var ret are compared against irrigation observations and results are also compared against those obtained using three different simplified configurations var fill fix fill and def fill where smthreshold and i dose are set to different values as summarized in table 2 the irrigation time series simulated by fao 2kc using the four irrigation modules are illustrated in fig 8 for each year separately the historical mean and standard deviation of observed irrigations from 2010 2021 are also shown in 2019 the calibration year var ret is able to reproduce observed irrigations with a good precision throughout the year for instance the absence of irrigation from january to mid february is well simulated similarly the first irrigations in the district are adequately captured once the p trigger threshold 0 78 in mid february is reached from the beginning of the irrigation season until may actual irrigations increase progressively mainly because of the development of winter cereals covering about 60 of algerri balaguer district also represented in the double cropping class in fig 5 in june irrigations slightly decrease due to changes from winter to summer cereals at that time senescent and initial stages of both agricultural seasons coexist in the district in july and august irrigations are very large mainly because of the development of maize and its associated water requirement which covers about 60 of the surface area of the district represented in summer cereals and double cropping classes in fig 5 in september actual irrigations decrease once the senescent period of different crops particularly maize starts this decrease is kept until the end of the irrigation season late october from when the absence of irrigations is shown until the end of the year all of the variations in irrigation water use described above are well represented by simulations from var ret module in contrast the other three irrigation modules are not capable to simulate adequately the dynamics of irrigations along the year for instance the absence of irrigations in january february are not well represented by the modules that use a constant p trigger def fill and fix fill def fill simulates the first irrigations late january while fix fill simulates them from the beginning of the year because a small water depletion 10 of taw is sufficient to trigger irrigations thus def fill and fix fill simulate irrigations earlier since their fixed p trigger values 0 5 and 0 1 respectively are smaller than the time varying p trigger used in var ret in this period conversely var fill is able to reproduce the absence of irrigations in this period in february may period the three modules that apply an irrigation dose to fulfill the soil water reservoir def fill fix fill and var fill overestimates irrigations with different dynamics between them given their different p trigger values in july august period these three modules are not capable to reproduce the high irrigation applied in the district hence underestimating the actual irrigation amounts at the end of the irrigation season the three modules are roughly able to reproduce the decrease in irrigation water supply for the other years the first actual irrigations start later than in 2019 i e from march to april however var ret is still able to reproduce actual irrigations at the beginning of irrigation season for each year as described above for the calibration year the other three irrigation modules are not capable to estimate adequately the first irrigations of the year while the fix fill systematically overestimates irrigation from the beginning of the year def fill and var fill are able to correctly simulate the absence of irrigation during the first months however def fill and var fill largely overestimate the first simulated irrigation because of important amounts of water are needed to fulfill the soil water storage after it was progressively depleted during the absence of irrigations as it is clearly visible for 2017 and 2021 from the beginning of the irrigation season until may with exception of 2020 actual irrigations increase to reach a peak related to the fully developed winter cereals during the same period in 2020 weekly irrigations are much lower than for the other years varying between 0 no irrigation and 0 8 hm3 this is primarily because of large rainfall were observed in 2020 especially during april and may with a cumulated rainfall of 155 mm which is much larger than the rainfalls observed in 2017 2019 and 2021 i e 59 60 and 45 mm respectively similarly in 2018 var ret simulates smaller irrigation amounts until may due to rainfall of 158 mm in april may period however the agreement of simulations with observations in this period cannot be verified due to gaps in irrigation data nevertheless it should be noted that var ret is flexible enough to simulate accurately the irrigation water use during periods with completely different rainfall regimes than the one under which it was calibrated therefore the proposed approach controlled by a time varying threshold and a fixed i dose that regulates irrigations allows to obtain estimations closer to the observations along the year this is also valid when actual irrigations are very different among years during the summer months particularly july and august the var ret configuration is capable to reproduce the large amounts of irrigation water use with an estimated rmsd of 0 48 0 15 hm3 and a bias of 0 11 0 34 hm3 however the configurations that fill the water reservoir are not as accurate with a rmsd ranging from 0 74 0 27 to 1 16 0 27 hm3 and bias from 0 62 0 31 to 1 05 0 29 hm3 for var fill and def fill modules respectively this means that an irrigation dose of 9 mm and a p trigger value of 0 05 is suitable to reproduce the over irrigation regime practiced in algerri balaguer district during summer unlike the other configurations that does not allow the fao 2kc model to over irrigate the latter is observed for all years except for 2017 that present irrigation volumes very large from late june to mid september even above the historical mean plus a standard deviation in turn var ret reproduces volumes similar to the historical irrigation amounts 2010 2021 note that the larger irrigation observations during the summer 2017 are not attributable to any process represented by the fao 2kc as the development of crops et0 and rainfall in summer are relatively similar for all the five years 2017 2021 fig 9 illustrates the overall statistics of the comparison between simulated and observed irrigations for the four irrigation modules for each year separately in the taylor diagram the standard deviation std and centered root mean square difference rmsd are normalized by the standard deviation of observations of each year separately such a normalization allows presenting the statistics of all years in a single graph and to be compared against a reference point representing a perfect simulation with r of 1 rmsd of 0 and normalized std of 1 i e the same as that of observations 0 86 0 12 hm3 the diagram highlights the best performance obtained for the new approach var ret with statistics systematically closer to the reference point for each year for instance var ret systematically presents for all years the highest r of 0 95 0 02 the lowest centered rmsd of 0 27 0 07 hm3 and the std closest to that of observations 0 81 0 06 hm3 equivalent to a normalized std of 0 95 0 12 on the right of fig 9 the bias in simulated irrigation is plotted against the rmsd the best performance with a minimum bias is also systematically for each year obtained for var ret the new approach presents much better results than the classical irrigation modules even in 2017 when all approaches significantly underestimate irrigations with a bias ranging between 0 17 hm3 and 0 41 hm3 and large rmsd between 0 45 and 0 96 hm3 in addition to larger actual irrigation in 2017 this underestimation may be partially influenced by a lower irrigated area reported in the 2017 land cover map 8 less than the other years with exception of 2017 the var ret obtained a consistent rmsd around 0 24 0 03 hm3 and a bias around 0 02 0 01 hm3 4 3 discussions the strategy of using a time varying p trigger and a fixed i dose thus appears to be effective in improving the representation of irrigation practices along the year conversely the classical approaches using fixed p trigger and fulfilling the water storage capacity show the worst performances in fact def fill and fix fill modules present an overall r of 0 74 0 14 and 0 79 0 08 respectively and rmsd of 0 62 0 21 and 0 55 0 14 hm3 respectively this classical irrigation scheme can be significantly improved when using a time varying p trigger and keeping the classical i dose var fill with an overall r of 0 86 0 12 and rmsd of 0 45 0 20 hm3 it should be noted that the irrigation regime is not known a priori it is estimated from the difference between the observed irrigation and the optimal irrigation the classical approach def fill simulates the optimal irrigation that is the minimum water use no water loss by deep percolation that satisfies the crops requirement no crop water stress a deficit irrigation regime is hence evidenced by an observed irrigation lower than the optimal irrigation generally in april may while an over irrigation regime is evidenced by an observed irrigation larger than the optimal irrigation systematically in july august such a comparison between observed and optimal irrigation def fill is observed in fig 8 for example in terms of annual irrigations in 2019 the only year with no lack of data the annual irrigation in optimal conditions def fill is simulated at 35 4 hm3 while actual irrigations is 44 8 hm3 the over irrigation is mainly concentrated during summer when actual irrigations in july august amount to 21 3 hm3 while the optimal volume satisfying the crops requirement during this period is estimated to 11 4 hm3 moreover it is evidenced a deficit irrigation regime in spring when actual irrigation in april may is 7 9 hm3 while the optimal would be 9 4 hm3 for the five years 2017 2021 the under irrigation in april may is estimated to 0 22 0 07 hm3 week while the over irrigation in july august is estimated to 1 05 0 29 hm3 week the algerri balaguer irrigation district is thus under a deficit irrigation regime in spring and an over irrigation regime in summer this can be explained by a misinterpretation of irrigation water needs by farmers who underestimate the water needs for winter cereals and overestimate them for maize which are the main crops in the district covering about 60 of the total agricultural area therefore considering a fixed p trigger along the year is shown to be unreliable as it does not fit with the conception of local and traditional farmers for instance var fill using a time varying p trigger provides a much better agreement with observations than using a fixed p trigger as def fill and fix fill however the assumption of fulfilling the water reservoir may be unreliable for periods under important over irrigation regimes therefore the def fill fix fill and var fill modules are not suitable for irrigation district under deficit and over irrigation regimes similar results to those obtained by def fill and fix fill i e underestimating irrigation in summer and overestimating irrigation during the rest of the year were also retrieved by dari et al 2020 2022 from january 2016 to september 2017 over the same area algerri balaguer district using a soil moisture based approach the latter approach was proposed by brocca et al 2018 to estimate irrigation by inverting the water balance equation from the dynamics of coarse resolution satellite surface soil moisture products e g smap smos ascat amsr 2 it has been evaluated using irrigation data at multiple scales and different satellite products dari et al 2022 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 dari et al 2020 implemented two main improvements to estimate irrigation amounts at district scale i exploiting high resolution 1 km satellite soil moisture data and ii adopting the fao 2kc et formulation to adequately reproduce the crop et over irrigated areas they obtained a r of 0 76 over algerri balaguer that is very close to that obtained in the present study for def fill 0 74 and fix fill 0 79 then dari et al 2022 evaluated the impact of different sources of et in the same soil moisture based approach and found that the et from the fao 2kc model showed the best performance although et process is critical in determining the soil water dynamics siebert and döll 2010 using reliable et estimates at field scale is insufficient to invert irrigations accurately since different irrigation practices may lead to similar et especially in over irrigation regime note that the parameters involved in the estimation of et may vary according to the formulations of et and of soil water transfers note however that the impact of physical parameters is limited in the case of over irrigation when the et is controlled by the evaporative demand and not by the soil water availability to illustrate this point brombacher et al 2022 recently proposed an irrigation retrieval approach based on the difference in remotely sensed et between irrigated and natural dry land vegetation cover the authors implemented the method in the ebro basin and evaluated the results on three plots close to the algerri balaguer district the retrieved monthly water use strongly underestimated the actual water use in algerri balaguer a fixed i dose is used for the var ret module consistent with the relatively large uncertainty in the monthly retrieved i dose see fig 5 note that the i dose is actually spatially and temporally variable due to diverse irrigation systems and practices within the area the i dose parameter is thus an effective value that represents the mean water amount applied per irrigation event over the district beyond the issue of non representation of i dose variabilities the strength of the proposed approach is to represent with good accuracy the overall trend of irrigation practices through the effective values of p trigger and i dose at the scale of the irrigation district the pf assimilation method is thus a powerful tool that allows i taking into account the uncertainties of the model by means of input parameters errors ii incorporating prior information on the distribution of different variables iii estimating various parameters at the same time and iv giving a realistic representation of the retrieved parameters and improving model s simulations however the major drawback is certainly the computational cost algorithms too computationally demanding can be impractical and even prohibitive for cases with a large data set in this study however we successfully reduced the computational cost by implementing the fao56 model over the five main land covers only instead of the 3000 crop fields present in algerri balaguer this was possible because i the five main crop types account for 94 of the total simulated irrigation over the district ii the area covered by each class is relatively uniform in terms of soil properties and iii vegetation states are also relatively uniform due to similar growing cycles per land cover class another limitation of the proposed approach is the need for irrigation water use observations to calibrate smthreshold and i dose which are most often unavailable in this study we show that the irrigation module var ret is capable of simulating irrigation accurately in all regimes from deficit to excess irrigation however further studies should investigate alternative calibration approaches of the irrigation parameters without relying on in situ irrigation data especially the assimilation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration soil moisture data could provide relevant information on irrigation practices kumar et al 2015 felfelani et al 2018 abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 olivera guerra et al 2020 nie et al 2022 kwon et al 2022 the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data will foster the detection of irrigation events and of their impact on the actual crop water budget 5 conclusion to date the irrigation modules of land surface models have not yet been evaluated under different e g deficit or excess irrigation regimes although agricultural practices greatly vary according to many climatological crop types soil conditions human etc factors such irrigation modules are generally based on two parameters smthreshold and smtarget at which irrigation automatically starts and stops respectively with an irrigation dose i dose being a function of smthreshold and smtarget in this study we develop a new method to represent via smthreshold and i dose the temporally varying irrigation water use of an irrigation district in any optimal deficit or even over irrigation regime to do that we implement the fao 56 dual crop coefficient fao 2kc model over the 8100 ha algerri balaguer irrigation district and the temporal dynamics of the irrigation parameters smthreshold and i dose are retrieved from the irrigation observations in 2019 results are evaluated against irrigation observations over 5 years from 2017 to 2021 based on this work the following conclusions can be drawn inverting smthreshold variable at monthly scale with a fixed i dose produces more accurate irrigation estimates than inverting both irrigation parameters smthreshold and i dose at monthly scale the seasonal evolution of the monthly retrieved smthreshold informs about the irrigation regime of both yearly irrigation periods in the district a slight irrigation water use from winter to spring and an over irrigation period during summer with a smthreshold very close to smfc the main difference between these two periods is due to a misinterpretation by farmers of the irrigation water needs of the main crops in the district 60 this results in a slight underestimation of the water needs for winter cereals leading to a deficit irrigation regime and a significant overestimation for maize leading to an excess irrigation regime the new irrigation scheme var ret obtains systematically the best performance for each of the 5 years 2017 2021 compared to the other three tested modules with an overall r of 0 95 0 02 and a rmsd of 0 27 0 07 hm3 equivalent to a mean water depth over the district of 0 64 0 17 mm day especially the monthly retrieved smthreshold improves significantly the performance of the classical fao 56 irrigation module using a fixed smthreshold along the year moreover setting i dose to the amount needed to fill the root zone soil reservoir does not allow reproducing irrigation volumes under over irrigation regimes as occurring in summer in the algerri balaguer district regardless of the variabilities of i dose at the field scale due to diverse irrigation systems and practices the strength of the proposed approach is to represent with good accuracy the overall trend of irrigation practices through the effective values of smthreshold and i dose at the integrated scale of the irrigation district given the strong consistency in terms of formalism and parameterization of the new irrigation module with existing modules based on smthreshold and smtarget parameters the proposed approach can be implemented in a wide variety of land surface and hydrological models nevertheless the calibration method of smthreshold and i dose relies on irrigation water use measurements which are rarely available worldwide another related issue is the assumption that the model parameters smthreshold and i dose are uniform within the irrigation district meaning that the same effective value is applied to different crop types and irrigation systems within the study area in algerri balaguer maize largely dominates the water consumption of irrigation water in summer so that the variability of smthreshold is attributed to maize irrigation practices however irrigation practices may differ significantly over other areas with different crop types and irrigation systems which would result in heterogeneous irrigation parameters within the district therefore next studies should address both issues requiring spatially distributed information on irrigation by retrieving smthreshold and i dose in both time and space this could be achieved by assimilating remotely sensed evapotranspiration and soil moisture data abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 felfelani et al 2018 kumar et al 2015 kwon et al 2022 nie et al 2022 the use of remote sensing

9077,drought is considered to be one of the most serious natural disasters in china which can result in enormous damage to nature and socio economy compared to traditional ground based monitoring techniques remote sensing can effectively compensate for spatial discontinuities at ground stations the use of remote sensing technology for drought monitoring has irreplaceable advantages the applicability of the trmm3b43 dataset for precipitation was firstly verified in the wei river basin and the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation were analyzed based on the trmm3b43 modis ndvi and modis lst datasets the spatiotemporal variations of drought were secondly investigated by calculating the precipitation condition index pci vegetation condition index vci and temporal

finally the agricultural drought calculated by the sdci was evaluated against drought area disaster area and crop failure area to verify the applicability of the sdci for agricultural drought disaster assessment in the wei river basin the results showed that the sdci determined by fce has better correlations with crop yield r2 0 45 than the other methods the sdci values exhibited a w shape from 2003 to 2010 during the growing seasons and agricultural drought showed an increasing trend after 2013 the drought prone areas shifted from north to south with the degree of drought firstly decreasing and then increasing in addition the sdci has better correlations with the disaster area r2 0 35 than the drought area r2 0 16 at the municipal level the sdci could well assess agricultural drought the results demonstrated that the sdci can effectively monitor and assess drought impacts on agriculture and may provide helpful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention keywords

between 1950 and 2016 zhang et al 2019 the development of drought monitoring and assessment methods has attracted the interest of many researchers as drought events become more frequent and severe on a global scale hu et al 2019 drought indices can effectively monitor drought based on in situ observations based on water supply and demand palmer 1965 came up with a drought index the palmer drought index pdsi which means that the local area is considered as dry when its water supply is less than its demand and wet otherwise the pdsi considers not only the current water supply and demand but also the impact of previous wet and dry conditions and their duration on the current drought conditions to address regional differences in parameters and improve the portability and spatial comparability

changes in precipitation but also the evolution of water resources over a period the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 which considered both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in determining drought as an extension of the widely used spi beguería et al 2014 the above three drought indicators are currently the

the yellow river is a climate sensitive area in china where drought disasters frequently occurred due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in spatial and temporal domain zhu et al 2017 agricultural land accounts for about 60 of the total basin area and drought causes more than 50 of the total agricultural losses yuan et al 2016 ding et al 2019 therefore the comprehensive study on

et al 2020 guo et al 2020 in addition yang et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019 developed a multivariate standardized drought index based on precipitation meteorology runoff hydrology and soil moisture agriculture information for drought monitoring and risk assessments therefore the assessment of agricultural drought based on multi source remote sensing data in the wei river basin a major grain producing area of northwest china has great scientific significance for agricultural drought disaster prevention and agricultural water management in this study the scaled drought condition index sdci was firstly developed for agricultural drought assessment which is calculated based on precipitation condition index pci vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci using trmm and modis dataset then crop yield was employed as the reference of drought impact for evaluating the applicability of the sdci with four kinds of weight determination methods during the growing seasons from 2000 to 2016 finally the drought area disaster area and crop failure area were used to validate the accuracy of the sdci for assessing drought disaster the main objectives are as follows 1 to verify the applicability of trmm data in the wei river basin 2 to identify the spatiotemporal pattern of droughts condition based on pci vci and tci 3 to determine the optimal weights for the sdci using four optimization methods 4 to investigate and evaluate agricultural drought calculated by the sdci 5 to validate the sdci against agricultural crop production including drought area

september gao et al 2012 the average annual precipitation in the wrb is 572 mm and the evaporation from the water surface is 660 1200 mm decreasing from east to west and from north to south the average annual temperature is in the range of 7 8 13 5 c and the average temperature increases from west to east the annual sunshine hours range from 1900 to 2600 h decreasing precipitation and runoff have led to an imbalance between water supply and demand huang et al 2014 2017b liu et al 2018 resulting in frequent drought disasters in the wrb yang et al 2018 the wrb has a resident population of 40 92 106 a crop sown area of 38 53 105 hectares a crop production of 15 69 105 tons and a regional gdp of 20 74 107 yuan in 2019 compared with floods wind hail and other meteorological disasters drought areas and crop failure areas of crops by drought accounted for about 68 of the total drought areas and crop failure areas of crops with 10 92 105 hectares and 12 93 104 hectares in 2017 respectively which are reported by national cryosphere desert data center the wrb is a relatively developed area in northwest china and one of the important grain cotton and oil producing areas and industrial production bases in china therefore the stable and high yield of agriculture in this region is of great importance to the food security of western china and even the whole country 2 2 data description the datasets used in this study are divided into two categories 1 input datasets used for establishing sdci including trmm ndvi and lst data and 2 datasets used for validating the sdci including crop yield sown area drought area disaster area and crop failure area details of these datasets are shown in table 1 2 2 1 meteorological gauging data the meteorological data were obtained from the monthly rainfall data of 13 meteorological stations of the national meteorological science data center from 2000 to 2016 http www nmic cn the location of the 13 meteorological stations were shown in fig 1 a 2 2 2 trmm data the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm dataset is used from the trmm satellite jointly developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and japan s national space development agency nasda https daac gsfc nasa gov datasets the trmm 3b43 dataset was selected with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 from 2000 to 2016 and is given as the monthly interval the dataset records the rate of precipitation given in mm h which need to be multiplied by the total number of hours in the corresponding month to obtain monthly precipitation data in mm at present trmm data was widely used in the field of drought assessment in various countries zhao and yatagai 2014 sahoo et al 2015 cruz roa et al 2017 guo et al 2019 however there were few analysis of the applicability of the trmm dataset in the wrb therefore rainfall from the selected 13 in situ stations was compared with trmm 3b43 at the corresponding grid from 2000 to 2016 for accuracy verification at annual and monthly time scales in the following analysis 2 2 3 modis data the modis terra products used in the study are modis 11a2 land surface temperature lst and modis 13a2 normalized differential vegetation index ndvi were downloaded from https modis gsfc nasa gov both with a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal interval of 8 day and 16 day respectively monthly tci and vci were calculated using lst and ndvi from 2000 to 2016 the numbers h26v05 and h27v05 cover the study area 2 2 4 land cover data the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure of china offers land cover data http www geodata cn there are two main categories of the dataset the dataset covers 6 primary types of forest grassland farmland settlement wetlands and water bodies desert and 25 secondary types the secondary type of farmland is divided into paddy field irrigable land and dryland the study used the land cover dataset for 2005 with a spatial resolution of 100 100 m and the land cover of the wei river basin is shown in fig 1 b 2 2 5 crop yield data the wrb covers gansu province ningxia hui autonomous region and shaanxi province gansu province includes tianshui pingliang qingyang and dingxi cities ningxia hui autonomous region includes guyuan and wuzhong cities shaanxi province includes xi an tongchuan baoji xianyang weinan yan an and yulin cities among them the data of crop yield cy for gansu province shaanxi province and ningxia hui autonomous region are provided by gansu statistical yearbook shaanxi statistical yearbook and ningxia statistical yearbook during the period 2000 2016 respectively the yield per hectare of shaanxi province during the period 2001 2016 was also obtained from shaanxi statistical yearbook the statistical yearbook of three province were downloaded from national bureau of statistics https data stats gov cn 2 2 6 drought disaster data winter wheat corn sorghum soybean and rice are the main crop types in the wrb due to the proportion of corn being greater than that of winter wheat in the wrb therefore corn was selected as typical crop for the applicability analysis of drought indices in addition the corn s growing period june september was determined as growing season in this study due to the availability of data the sown area includes gansu provinces and shaanxi provinces and excludes ningxia hui autonomous region from 2001 to 2016 the drought area disaster area and crop failure area are statistical data of summer and autumn crops caused by drought and it is impossible to distinguish the impact of drought on the two types of crops therefore the data of drought disaster could verify the applicability of the sdci in the study area to a certain extent the sources of all disaster data are consistent with that of crop yield data details regarding these datasets are listed in table 2 2 2 7 agricultural modernization the total agricultural machinery power refers to total mechanical power of machinery used in agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery including machinery for ploughing irrigation and drainage harvesting transport plant protection and so on the consumption of chemical fertilizers in agriculture refers to the quantity of chemical fertilizers applied in agriculture in a year including nitrogenous fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer and compound fertilizer the consumption of chemical fertilizers is calculated in terms of amount of effective components by means of converting the gross weight of the respective fertilizers into weight containing effective component such as nitrogen content in nitrogenous fertilizer phosphorous pentoxide contents in phosphate fertilizer and potassium oxide contents in potash fertilizer the data of total power of agricultural machinery and consumption of chemical fertilizers in agricultural of shaanxi province during the period 2000 2016 were obtained from shaanxi statistical yearbook 2 3 methods 2 3 1 calculations of drought indices 2 3 1 1 the precipitation condition index previous studies have shown that ndvi does not respond immediately after precipitation and agricultural drought generally has a lag time of 3 months potop et al 2015 wu et al 2016 huang et al 2015 proved that the lag time in summer is approximately 3 months in the wrb therefore the cumulative precipitation for previous three months is used to characterize the precipitation condition for the current month for instance the amount of precipitation in june is the sum of precipitation in april may and june furthermore the monthly pci is calculated by the following equation p ci pci j pci min pci max pci min where pci min and pci max are the minimum and maximum values of pci at each grid in i month pci j represents the precipitation in i month during the period 2000 2016 2 3 1 2 the vegetation condition index in recent years normalized differential vegetation index ndvi is not only used to reflect the growth of vegetation but also used to assess drought events by many scholars park et al 2016 gazol et al 2018 chu et al 2019 however the growing seasons of crops in different regions are in respective stages with different water conditions therefore the dry wet condition of crops cannot be explained only by the values of ndvi kogan 1995b proposed the vegetation condition index and its calculation formula is as follows vci j ndvi j ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvi j is the smoothed monthly ndvi ndvi max and ndvi min represent maximum and minimum ndvi respectively calculated by multiyear smoothed monthly ndvi series for each pixel during the period 2000 2016 2 3 1 3 the temperature condition index the land surface temperature lst is strongly associated with drought and the temperature rise is the initial indication of the crops being treated with moisture stress and drought the increase of temperature and the closure of leaf stomata can reduce the water loss caused by transpiration reduce the surface latent heat flux increase the surface sensible heat flux and then cause the increase of temperature based on this principle kogan 1995a proposed the temperature condition index tci and its calculation formula is as follows tci j lst max lst j lst max lst min where lst j is the smoothed monthly lst lst max and lst min represent maximum and minimum lst respectively calculated by multiyear smoothed monthly lst series for each pixel during the period 2000 2016 2 3 1 4 the scaled drought condition index rhee et al 2010 proposed an agricultural drought index scaled drought condition index sdci based on vi lst and trmm that can assess drought conditions well in both dry and humid areas and its calculation formula is as follows sdci α vci β tci γ pci where α β and γ are the weights of monthly vci tci and pci respectively and α β γ 1 table 3 shows the drought classification by the pci tci vci and sdci 2 3 2 determination of optimal weight 2 3 2 1 analytic hierarchy process analytic hierarchy process ahp was proposed by saaty 1990 which is a kind of decision analysis method that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the scoring judgment matrix of the relative importance of the two indicators which are then aggregated the weights of each factor are finally calculated hoque et al 2020 zarei et al 2021 2 3 2 2 entropy method entropy method is an objective method for determining weights which could be used to quantify the amount of useful information in a given data when the value of the evaluation object varies significantly its entropy value is smaller indicating that these data provide a large amount of useful information and the evaluation object should be given a higher weight meng 1989 qiu 2002 guo et al 2021 2 3 2 3 criteria importance through intercriteria correlation criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic was developed by diakoulaki et al 1995 the critic method is a comprehensive measure of the objective weight of the indicators based on the comparative strength of the evaluation indicators and the conflict between them jahan et al 2012 chang et al 2020 2 3 2 4 fuzzy comprehensive evaluation zadeh 1965 introduced fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce which transformed qualitative evaluation into quantitative evaluation based on the affiliation theory of fuzzy mathematics the method could better solve the issues of fuzzy and difficult to quantify and is suitable for various non deterministic problems wu et al 2018 he et al 2021 3 results and analysis 3 1 applicability of the trmm dataset in the wrb in order to evaluate the applicability of the trmm dataset in the wrb the comparison between the temporal and spatial distribution of trmm3b43 and rainfall data from 13 meteorological stations in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2 a and b that the r2 between rainfall from 13 meteorological stations and trmm3b43 were 0 83 and 0 65 at the monthly time scale and annual time scale respectively it proved that the trmm3b43 dataset had well applicability in the wrb on both monthly and annual time scales moreover a comparison of the spatial distribution of the trmm3b43 dataset and 13 meteorological stations based on average annual precipitation was illustrated in fig 2 c it was shown that the spatial distribution of the two kinds of datasets was substantially consistent the annual precipitation was incremented from the north to the south increasing from the west to the east the trmm3b43 dataset in the wrb showed an annual precipitation of 300 764 mm while the rainfall from meteorological stations was from 386 7 to 840 9 mm in general the precipitation from the trmm3b43 dataset could well reflect the spatial distribution of rainfall in the wrb although its value was slightly lower than that of meteorological stations the variations of annual precipitation and annual precipitation anomaly percentage based on the trmm3b43 dataset during the period 2000 2016 in the wrb were shown in fig 3 the average annual precipitation from 2000 to 2016 was 545 06 mm the maximum value was 767 34 mm in 2003 higher than 40 78 of the average the minimum precipitation reached 385 32 mm in 2016 lower than 29 31 of the average besides the annual precipitation anomaly percentage was 17 7 and 16 51 in 2013 and 2011 respectively and the annual precipitation anomaly percentage was 14 62 and 10 4 in 2008 and 2004 respectively this indicated that the temporal variation of precipitation in the wrb was unstable which is particularly prone to drought disasters 3 2 variations of drought identified by multiple indices 3 2 1 drought variation based on the pci based on trmm3b43 precipitation data the pci was calculated in the wrb for the period 2000 2016 fig 4 the red and blue boxes indicate the negative and positive values of the percentage of precipitation anomalies respectively except for the year 2003 all the mean values of pci pci mean were less than 0 5 which meant that the wrb occurred different degrees of drought during the period 2000 2016 the distributions of the pci value for the years 2000 2005 and 2012 were relatively dispersed while those for the years 2001 2004 and 2015 were relatively concentrated the spatial distribution of the pci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 was presented in fig 5 before the year 2010 the drought in the north of the wrb was heavier than that in the south except in the years 2002 and 2007 after the year 2010 on the contrary the drought in the south was heavier than that in the north except the year 2003 drought events with varying degrees often occurred in the central region of the basin 3 2 2 drought variation based on the vci temporal variations and spatial distributions of the vci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it can be concluded from fig 6 the frequency of exceptional drought based on the vci was 27 59 and 1 93 in the years 2000 and 2001 respectively in all other years the frequency of exceptional droughts was less than 0 1 which could assume that no extreme drought events occurred in other years the trend of the frequency of extreme drought based on the vci was similarly to that for exceptional drought 26 95 and 21 71 in the years 2000 and 2001 respectively in all other years the frequency of extreme droughts was almost less than 1 the percentages of severe drought and moderate drought generally showed a trend of fluctuating downward it can be seen from fig 7 that the drought in the wrb identified by the vci was more severe in the northern part in the years 2000 and 2001 and began to be mitigated in the year 2002 which was the positive effect of the national policy of returning farmland to the forest grass implemented around the year 1999 and ecological restoration projects have been carried out in the wrb such as returning farmland to forests closing mountains for forest cultivation and protecting natural secondary forests the implementation of these ecological restoration projects had caused sloping farmland dry hilly gully region and low to medium cover grassland which were originally covered by sparse crops or grass to be replaced by forest or grassland the average vci value in the wrb was relatively low with about 0 2 in the year 2000 as the period of tree growth was still short the ecological restoration projects had not yet completely established then the measures began to bear fruit and the overall situation of vegetation cover improved with an average vci value of 0 3 in the year 2001 in the years 2002 and 2003 the drought was relatively severe in the central region in the years 2005 2008 the northern region experienced severe drought which was more severe than that in other regions after the year 2009 the severity of the drought had been mitigated across the basin a moderate drought occurred in the year 2013 in the south eastern region which had been alleviated in the years 2014 and 2015 however a moderate drought returned to hit the south eastern and central western regions 3 2 3 drought variation based on the tci the drought frequency based on the tci at monthly interval in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 was illustrated in fig 8 in china a year is divided into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february next year in terms of multi year average seasonal drought frequency moderate drought and above winter had the highest frequency of drought 47 74 followed by summer 34 11 autumn 33 21 and spring 32 58 in spring the frequency of moderate drought severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought all showed a downward trend with 2 10 y 3 2 10 y 4 3 10 y and 14 6 10 y respectively in summer the frequency of severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought all showed a downward trend while moderate drought showed a slight upward trend 0 7 10 y as for exceptional drought the frequency of occurrence was relatively high before the year 2005 and began to decline from the year 2006 in autumn the frequency of severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought all showed a downward trend while moderate drought showed a slightly upward trend 0 9 10 y in winter the frequencies of exceptional drought and extreme drought showed an upward trend while severe drought and moderate drought showed a downward trend the spatial distributions of frequency of seasonal drought based on the tci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 9 the frequency of spring drought was below 40 in most of the wrb while that in the surrounding areas such as the north south east and west was relatively high ranging between 40 and 60 in summer half of the wrb had a drought frequency of less than 40 mainly in the central and western regions while most of the southern and northern regions contributed a drought frequency between 40 and 60 the frequency of droughts in autumn was the opposite of that in summer with relatively low frequency in the south and north and relatively high frequency in the central wrb the frequency of drought was relatively high in winter compared to other seasons the frequency of winter drought in the northern midwestern and southern margins was below 40 while that in the most region of the wrb especially for the western south central regions was between 40 60 3 3 agricultural drought assessment by using the sdci 3 3 1 comparisons between crop yield and the sdcis under different weights to determine the suitable weights for the sdci in the wrb four different methods were used to obtain the weighting results using tci vci and pci data as inputs for june september from 2000 to 2016 the optimal weights were shown in table 4 in terms of these four results the difference between the weights of the vci and tci was relatively small the weights of the pci were relatively larger than those of the tci and vci except for the ahp and fce methods to better assess the performance of sdcis the coefficient of determination r2 between the sdci and cy calculated under different weighting methods during the growing season from 2000 to 2016 was illustrated in fig 10 in terms of cy dataset the lack of data for ningxia hui autonomous region in 2000 may have some influence on the results in fig 10 the r2 between fce sdci and cy was the highest with 0 45 while the r2 for entropy sdci were the lowest with 0 14 therefore the weights of fce were selected for the following sdci calculation and analysis 3 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of the sdci based on the calculation of the pci vci and tci with the weights of fce the agricultural drought in the wrb for the period 2000 2016 was assessed by the sdci fig 11 showed the temporal variation of agricultural drought at annual and monthly scale as can be seen from fig 11 a the variation of cy generally followed the changes in the sdci value the sdci values exhibited a w fluctuation from 2003 to 2010 during the growing seasons the vci showed a slightly upward trend while pci demonstrated the opposite trend the tci also presented a w shape and there was a turning point in the year of 2007 the changing trend of the sdci was similar to that of the tci showing a w shape which indicated that the sdci comprehensively considers the drought situation on the basis of fully considering all factors and the influence of temperature in this region was greater than that of precipitation after 2008 the cy increased as the average of sdci increased and decreased as the average of sdci decreased however for the same value of sdci there were some differences in the cy for instance the sdci values for 2008 and 2009 were almost identical with 0 45 and 0 46 respectively while cy were 10 83 million tons and 9 94 million tons respectively a difference of 0 89 million tons was mainly due to the difference in their sown areas of 125 16 thousand hectares in addition the sdci value for 2002 was 0 37 with a moderate drought occurred and cy was 7 9 million tons while the sdci value for 2003 was 0 59 with no drought happened and cy was only 7 45 million tons it also maybe on account of sown areas of 2205 35 thousand hectares in 2002 and 2115 99 thousand hectares in 2003 a reduction of 89 36 thousand hectares in the sown areas temporal variation of the sdci at the monthly scale was presented in fig 11 b the sdci values of the four months all showed an upward trend of fluctuation in different degrees indicating that the drought degree of the wrb had decreased the r2 between monthly sdci and cy had the highest value in july with 0 32 followed by june with 0 3 the lowest value in august with 0 07 therefore throughout the whole growing season the beginning month of sown had a great influence on the cy the spatial distributions of the growing seasons sdci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 12 it can be seen that droughts events occurred in most parts of the basin before 2002 and the severity of the drought reduced after 2003 a severe drought occurred in the northern part of the basin until 2008 after which it showed weakening and a shift from the northern to the southern part of the basin most areas of the basin experienced drought events in 2016 3 3 3 utility of sdci in drought disaster monitoring to better demonstrate the utility of the sdci to assess agricultural drought in the wrb the sdci was also analyzed in comparison with the drought area disaster area and crop failure area areas where crop yield have been reduced by more than 10 30 80 due to drought are defined as drought area disaster area and crop failure area respectively the year of 2003 with extremely high precipitation was excluded from this analysis the drought area and sdci values of gansu province and shaanxi province were compared and analyzed the results were shown in fig 13 a limited by data availability r2 between the sdci and the drought area was 0 16 which did not show a good agreement whereas the trends were consistent in some years for example the sdci value first increased and then decreased from 2011 to 2014 while the cy value first decreased and then increased in general the sdci values were less correlated with the drought area and in turn the r2 between sdci values and the disaster area were selected for the following analysis the r2 between the sdci and the drought area at municipal scale of gansu province and shaanxi province in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were presented in fig 13 b the highest correlation coefficient is contributed by qingyang 0 71 followed by yan an 0 41 except for xi an 0 08 xianyang 0 07 weinan 0 06 baoji 0 04 in the south and yulin 0 1 in the north of the wrb the r2 of other regions were generally between 0 2 and 0 4 the results proved that the sdci performed well in monitoring agricultural drought conditions in the western and central regions of the basin comparative analysis of the disaster area and the sdci values in gansu province and the results were shown in fig 13 c the r2 between the sdci and areas affected was 0 35 from 2009 2016 the trend of changes in sdci values and the disaster area remained largely consistent the results showed that the sdci values could well reflect the disaster area of the basin the r2 between the sdci values and the disaster area by each region in gansu province were shown in fig 13 d it can be seen that the highest r2 was produced by qingyang 0 79 followed by pingliang 0 44 tianshui 0 41 and dingxi 0 32 the drylands of qingyang tianshui pingliang and dingxi accounted for 20 48 11 6 11 2 and 8 86 of the total area of each region respectively which indicated that the sdci index could well reflect the disaster area the average of sdci across shaanxi province was calculated and then compared with the crop failure area from 2000 to 2016 which was shown in fig 13 e a linear correlation between crop failure areas and the sdci values was detected with a r2 of 0 06 it can be seen that crop failure area reached a maximum of 10 93 105 hectares in 2010 according to news reports in the winter of 2009 and early 2010 a drought occurred in weinan of shaanxi province with 70 consecutive days of no precipitation and relative soil humidity in most fields fell below 50 which was extremely harmful to summer crop growth therefore the value of crop failure area in 2010 relatively higher was due to summer drought suffered by weinan rather than autumn drought comparative analysis of crop failure areas and the sdci values in shaanxi province and the results were shown in fig 13 f although weinan produced the highest r2 between crop failure area and the sdci value r2 0 39 the crop failure area was heavily influenced by the summer drought in addition the second highest r2 was 0 28 from tongchuan therefore an analysis comparing the sdci index with the drought area disaster area and crop failure area showed that the sdci can provide a good response not only to crop yield but also to the extent of agricultural disasters 4 discussion 4 1 determination of weights for variables in drought index the determination of the weight for each variable in drought index is very important for the accuracy of drought monitoring guo et al 2019 zhang and jia 2013 proposed the microwave integrated drought index midi which is combined of pci smci and tci the weight is determined based on experimental weights huang et al 2015 built an integrated drought index combined runoff soil moisture and precipitation using entropy method in the yellow river basin an integrated drought condition index idci was developed by integrating spei 3 smci and vci by principal component analysis to determine the weights in inner mongolia china shen et al 2019 in this study four different methods were used to determine the weight and the weight determined by comparison with crop yield not only makes up for the limitations of a single method but also better reflects the agricultural drought rather than meteorological drought 4 2 suitability of the sdci for indicating agricultural drought the sdci was based on precipitation temperature and vegetation data including the impact of temperature changing rate a lag time of agricultural drought responding to meteorological drought 3 months comprehensive information regarding vegetation growth cao et al 2022 which is suitable for identification and monitoring of agricultural drought the wrb is characterized as decreasing precipitation and increasing average air temperature at monthly scale huang et al 2016 the sdci value showed a small inflection point in the year of 2007 which was consistent with the change of temperature while precipitation did not change significantly indicating that the impact of temperature on sdci was greater than precipitation the finding is consistent with previous studies confirming that the influence of temperature on vegetation was greater than precipitation liu and menzel 2016 furthermore the growing season of corn is from june to september which is consistent with the conclusion proposed by dai et al 2022 that pet and temperature are main influencing factor of drought propagation in summer the sdci value showed in a w shape from 2003 to 2010 and it demonstrated that the wrb presented a transition from wet to dry and then from dry to wet which is consistent with the results of midi based on precipitation anomaly percentage runoff anomaly percentage standardized precipitation index with 6 month aggregation time step and modified palmer drought severity index chang et al 2016 the frequency of droughts was generally greater in the north than that in the south and higher in the west than that in the east based on the sdci which is consistent with the finding of yang et al 2018 based on a nonlinear multi variate drought index nmdi 4 3 the influence of agricultural modernization affecting agricultural drought agricultural modernization can effectively alleviate the impact of drought on people s life it is essential to consider agricultural modernization factors for assessing the agricultural drought qin et al 2015 yang et al 2018 to reduce the impact of agricultural drought improving breeding apply chemical fertilizers increase the use of machinery and supplement farmland irrigation can be implemented in agricultural production wu et al 2020 in order to better show the impact of agricultural modernization total agricultural machinery power consumption of chemical fertilizers and yield per hectare of shaanxi province during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 14 as observed in fig 14 the value of total agricultural machinery power firstly increased and then began to decrease at the year of 2015 the total agricultural machinery power is divided into three stages fluctuating upward 2003 2009 stable forward 2010 2014 beginning to decline after 2015 yang et al 2020 during the eleventh five year plan and the twelfth five year plan government vigorously promoted rural social and economic construction raised the overall agricultural production capacity and accelerated the process of agricultural modernization the total power of agricultural machinery only declined in 2016 mainly because the insured amount of small agricultural machinery decreased i e small tractors small tractors towing farm machinery according to the statistics data from nation bureau of statistics the temporal variation of consumption of chemical fertilizers showed firstly upward and then downward trend and the turning point at the year of 2013 in 2012 the people s government of shaanxi province issued a three year action to prevent and control water pollution in the wrb to reduce unreasonable fertilization and agricultural non point source pollution shaanxi provincial people s government 2012 furthermore the people s government of shaanxi province issued a notice on a three year action plan 2015 2017 to consolidate and improve the prevention and control of water pollution in the wrb shaanxi provincial people s government 2015 it is expected to reduce agricultural non point source pollution and other problems in the basin the yield per hectare displayed an upward trend of fluctuation in 2004 the value increased greatly because of the change of corn planting varieties in guanzhong plain lei et al 2012 before 2004 the corn planted in the west of guanzhong plain was a single hybrid with high quality and high yield at the year of 2004 the single hybrids with high yield and multi resistance was planted the value in the year of 2007 was lower maybe due to the rapid reduction of planting area therefore it can be reasonably concluded that the variations of agricultural drought were caused by both climate change and human activities huang et al 2015 in the case of the sdci combining three factors the impact of human activities may account for a certain proportion zhang et al 2019 the impact of human activities and climate change on agricultural drought can be further considered separately in the future 5 conclusions in this study the sdci was used by determining variable weights based on three remote sensing components pci vci and tci to assess the agricultural drought in the wei river basin of china from 2000 to 2016 the performance of sdci was evaluated based on crop yield compared with four kinds of weights determination methods and then drought area disaster area and crop failure area were used to validate the results of the agricultural drought assessment the main conclusions are summarized as follows a comparison of precipitation from trmm3b43 and meteorological gauging stations showed that the trmm3b43 could accurately characterize the precipitation across the wrb at annual and monthly scales whereas the precipitation was underestimated based on the trmm3b43 dataset the maximum precipitation reached 767 34 mm in 2003 and the minimum reached 385 32 mm in 2016 the precipitation in the south of the wrb was greater than that in the north while that in the east was greater than the west the arid area of the wrb shifted from the north to the south based on the pci analysis and the arid area showed a decreasing trend after 2008 the drought frequency and arid area both showed a decreasing trend indicated by the vci and the arid area similarly shifted from the north to the south the drought frequency showed a downward trend at the seasonal scale calculated by the tci the sdci correlates well with crop yield based on fce with the r2 of 0 45 the temporal variation of the sdci value showed a w fluctuation from 2003 to 2010 comparing with the drought area disaster area and crop failure area it indicated that the sdci provides a good assessment of the severity of agricultural drought in the wei river

9077,drought is considered to be one of the most serious natural disasters in china which can result in enormous damage to nature and socio economy compared to traditional ground based monitoring techniques remote sensing can effectively compensate for spatial discontinuities at ground stations the use of remote sensing technology for drought monitoring has irreplaceable advantages the applicability of the trmm3b43 dataset for precipitation was firstly verified in the wei river basin and the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation were analyzed based on the trmm3b43 modis ndvi and modis lst datasets the spatiotemporal variations of drought were secondly investigated by calculating the precipitation condition index pci vegetation condition index vci and temporal condition index tci crop yield was employed as the reference of drought impact for evaluating the applicability of the scaled drought condition index sdci based on the combination of the pci vci and vci by four kinds of weight determination methods i e analytic hierarchy process ahp entropy method criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce finally the agricultural drought calculated by the sdci was evaluated against drought area disaster area and crop failure area to verify the applicability of the sdci for agricultural drought disaster assessment in the wei river basin the results showed that the sdci determined by fce has better correlations with crop yield r2 0 45 than the other methods the sdci values exhibited a w shape from 2003 to 2010 during the growing seasons and agricultural drought showed an increasing trend after 2013 the drought prone areas shifted from north to south with the degree of drought firstly decreasing and then increasing in addition the sdci has better correlations with the disaster area r2 0 35 than the drought area r2 0 16 at the municipal level the sdci could well assess agricultural drought the results demonstrated that the sdci can effectively monitor and assess drought impacts on agriculture and may provide helpful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention keywords

and recurrent natural disaster that occurs almost everywhere in the world making it one of the most devastating natural disasters schubert et al 2016 yao et al 2018 drought deeply affects the ecological and socio economic sectors zhong et al 2019 drought and extreme heat are responsible for 9 10 of the decline in national cereal production lesk et al 2016 the drought negatively affected different sectors of the netherlands resulting in an estimated damage of 450 2080 million euros in the summer of 2018 sjoukje et al 2020 according to data issued by the bulletin of food and drought disaster in china china s annual drought losses due to agricultural disasters are 16 302 billion kilograms accounting for more than 60 of all kinds of natural disasters that caused grain losses between 1950 and 2016 zhang et al 2019 the development of drought monitoring and assessment methods has attracted the interest of many researchers as drought events become more frequent and severe on a global scale hu et al 2019 drought indices can effectively monitor drought based on in situ observations based on water supply and demand palmer 1965 came up with a drought index the palmer drought index pdsi which means that the local area is considered as dry when its water supply is less than its demand and wet otherwise the pdsi considers not only the current water supply and demand but also the impact of previous wet and dry conditions and their duration on the current drought conditions to address regional differences in parameters and improve the portability and spatial comparability of the pdsi wells et al 2004 proposed an adaptive pdsi self calibrating pdsi scpdsi that can be automatically corrected for the local climate mckee et al 1993 proposed the standardized precipitation index spi which is a cumulative probability function derived from successive time series of precipitation at a time scale and allowed for comparisons over multiple time scales reflecting not only changes in precipitation but also the evolution of water resources over a period the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 which considered both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in determining drought as an extension of the widely used spi beguería et al 2014 the above three drought indicators are currently the most widely used indicators to assess drought events trenberth et al 2014 chen and sun 2015 wang et al 2016 ground based observations or interpolated grids were widely used to monitor and investigate drought in the past hayes et al 1999 sheffield et al 2012 the dataset based on observation could not effective in capturing drought related characteristics in agriculture at a regional scale at present remote sensing technology has the advantages of wide coverage strong data continuity objectivity and timeliness making it the most promising technology in drought monitoring a series of indices have been developed which overcome the shortcoming of spatial monitoring ability of in situ indices sur et al 2015 park et al 2017 xu et al 2018 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kogan 1995a land surface temperature lst kogan 1995a vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995b temperature condition index tci kogan 1995a soil moisture condition index smci zhang and jia 2013 and other related indices based on remote sensing data have been widely used to monitor and assess agricultural drought worldwide with the increase of remote sensing satellites the quality of remote sensing data is constantly improving providing a rich source of information for drought monitoring using multi source remote sensing data aghakouchak et al 2015 kalisa et al 2020 factors contributing to drought include the regional climate precipitation temperature and local surface characteristics land cover vegetation community barker et al 2015 van loon and laaha 2015 relying on single factor based drought index cannot accurately monitor and evaluate drought events therefore various combination drought indices are proposed to monitor drought conditions by combining a single remote sensing drought indices based on the tci pci and smci indices zhang and jia 2013 proposed the microwave integrated drought index midi which is used to monitor short term droughts especially meteorological droughts in north china sánchez et al 2016 developed the soil moisture agricultural drought index smadi combines smos ssm and modis derived lst while including the 8 days lagged response of modis ndvi for the whole iberian peninsula zuo et al 2019 structured the combined deficit index cdi based on precipitation and ndvi from the two sources of data under dryland to assess the agricultural drought in northeast china the vegetation supply water index vswi based on ndvi and lst was aimed at capturing changes in soil moisture in crops to determine whether the crop was experiencing drought even if crops were not significantly dry chen et al 2020a fazi et al 2020 liu et al 2020 analyzed drought using a combination of pci vci smci and tci and found that mcdi 1 and mcdi 9 were suitable for meteorological drought monitoring and agricultural drought monitoring respectively in shandong of china wu et al 2021 proposed univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index usmei and bivariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index bsmei based on evapotranspiration and soil moisture to reflect water stress for winter wheat in the north china plain the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river is a climate sensitive area in china where drought disasters frequently occurred due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in spatial and temporal domain zhu et al 2017 agricultural land accounts for about 60 of the total basin area and drought causes more than 50 of the total agricultural losses yuan et al 2016 ding et al 2019 therefore the comprehensive study on the evolution characteristics of drought in the wei river basin is of great significance to the sustainable development of social economy at present the researches in the wei river basin involve meteorological drought assessment huang et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 hydrological drought monitoring lai et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020 and its response to meteorological drought huang et al 2017 fang et al 2020 guo et al 2020 in addition yang et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019 developed a multivariate standardized drought index based on precipitation meteorology runoff hydrology and soil moisture agriculture information for drought monitoring and risk assessments therefore the assessment of agricultural drought based on multi source remote sensing data in the wei river basin a major grain producing area of northwest china has great scientific significance for agricultural drought disaster prevention and agricultural water management in this study the scaled drought condition index sdci was firstly developed for agricultural drought assessment which is calculated based on precipitation condition index pci vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci using trmm and modis dataset then crop yield was employed as the reference of drought impact for evaluating the applicability of the sdci with four kinds of weight determination methods during the growing seasons from 2000 to 2016 finally the drought area disaster area and crop failure area were used to validate the accuracy of the sdci for assessing drought disaster the main objectives are as follows 1 to verify the applicability of trmm data in the wei river basin 2 to identify the spatiotemporal pattern of droughts condition based on pci vci and tci 3 to determine the optimal weights for the sdci using four optimization methods 4 to investigate and evaluate agricultural drought calculated by the sdci 5 to validate the sdci against agricultural crop production including drought area disaster area and crop failure area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river originating from niaoshu mountain in weiyuan county of gansu province flowing across gansu province ningxia hui autonomous region and shaanxi province and merging into the yellow river at tongguan shaanxi province in the lower reaches fig 1 a the wei river basin wrb locates between latitude 33 50 n and 37 18 n and longitude 104 e and 110 20 e with a total length of 818 km and a total area of 1 348 105 km2 for the development of the new silk road under the belt and road initiative the wrb is located in an important position as well as an important grain production base in china li et al 2015 2017b zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 the wrb is a temperate continental monsoon climate with hot summers and cold winters precipitation is concentrated in the summer months with more than 60 of the annual average precipitation occurring from july to september gao et al 2012 the average annual precipitation in the wrb is 572 mm and the evaporation from the water surface is 660 1200 mm decreasing from east to west and from north to south the average annual temperature is in the range of 7 8 13 5 c and the average temperature increases from west to east the annual sunshine hours range from 1900 to 2600 h decreasing precipitation and runoff have led to an imbalance between water supply and demand huang et al 2014 2017b liu et al 2018 resulting in frequent drought disasters in the wrb yang et al 2018 the wrb has a resident population of 40 92 106 a crop sown area of 38 53 105 hectares a crop production of 15 69 105 tons and a regional gdp of 20 74 107 yuan in 2019 compared with floods wind hail and other meteorological disasters drought areas and crop failure areas of crops by drought accounted for about 68 of the total drought areas and crop failure areas of crops with 10 92 105 hectares and 12 93 104 hectares in 2017 respectively which are reported by national cryosphere desert data center the wrb is a relatively developed area in northwest china and one of the important grain cotton and oil producing areas and industrial production bases in china therefore the stable and high yield of agriculture in this region is of great importance to the food security of western china and even the whole country 2 2 data description the datasets used in this study are divided into two categories 1 input datasets used for establishing sdci including trmm ndvi and lst data and 2 datasets used for validating the sdci including crop yield sown area drought area disaster area and crop failure area details of these datasets are shown in table 1 2 2 1 meteorological gauging data the meteorological data were obtained from the monthly rainfall data of 13 meteorological stations of the national meteorological science data center from 2000 to 2016 http www nmic cn the location of the 13 meteorological stations were shown in fig 1 a 2 2 2 trmm data the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm dataset is used from the trmm satellite jointly developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and japan s national space development agency nasda https daac gsfc nasa gov datasets the trmm 3b43 dataset was selected with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 from 2000 to 2016 and is given as the monthly interval the dataset records the rate of precipitation given in mm h which need to be multiplied by the total number of hours in the corresponding month to obtain monthly precipitation data in mm at present trmm data was widely used in the field of drought assessment in various countries zhao and yatagai 2014 sahoo et al 2015 cruz roa et al 2017 guo et al 2019 however there were few analysis of the applicability of the trmm dataset in the wrb therefore rainfall from the selected 13 in situ stations was compared with trmm 3b43 at the corresponding grid from 2000 to 2016 for accuracy verification at annual and monthly time scales in the following analysis 2 2 3 modis data the modis terra products used in the study are modis 11a2 land surface temperature lst and modis 13a2 normalized differential vegetation index ndvi were downloaded from https modis gsfc nasa gov both with a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal interval of 8 day and 16 day respectively monthly tci and vci were calculated using lst and ndvi from 2000 to 2016 the numbers h26v05 and h27v05 cover the study area 2 2 4 land cover data the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure of china offers land cover data http www geodata cn there are two main categories of the dataset the dataset covers 6 primary types of forest grassland farmland settlement wetlands and water bodies desert and 25 secondary types the secondary type of farmland is divided into paddy field irrigable land and dryland the study used the land cover dataset for 2005 with a spatial resolution of 100 100 m and the land cover of the wei river basin is shown in fig 1 b 2 2 5 crop yield data the wrb covers gansu province ningxia hui autonomous region and shaanxi province gansu province includes tianshui pingliang qingyang and dingxi cities ningxia hui autonomous region includes guyuan and wuzhong cities shaanxi province includes xi an tongchuan baoji xianyang weinan yan an and yulin cities among them the data of crop yield cy for gansu province shaanxi province and ningxia hui autonomous region are provided by gansu statistical yearbook shaanxi statistical yearbook and ningxia statistical yearbook during the period 2000 2016 respectively the yield per hectare of shaanxi province during the period 2001 2016 was also obtained from shaanxi statistical yearbook the statistical yearbook of three province were downloaded from national bureau of statistics https data stats gov cn 2 2 6 drought disaster data winter wheat corn sorghum soybean and rice are the main crop types in the wrb due to the proportion of corn being greater than that of winter wheat in the wrb therefore corn was selected as typical crop for the applicability analysis of drought indices in addition the corn s growing period june september was determined as growing season in this study due to the availability of data the sown area includes gansu provinces and shaanxi provinces and excludes ningxia hui autonomous region from 2001 to 2016 the drought area disaster area and crop failure area are statistical data of summer and autumn crops caused by drought and it is impossible to distinguish the impact of drought on the two types of crops therefore the data of drought disaster could verify the applicability of the sdci in the study area to a certain extent the sources of all disaster data are consistent with that of crop yield data details regarding these datasets are listed in table 2 2 2 7 agricultural modernization the total agricultural machinery power refers to total mechanical power of machinery used in agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery including machinery for ploughing irrigation and drainage harvesting transport plant protection and so on the consumption of chemical fertilizers in agriculture refers to the quantity of chemical fertilizers applied in agriculture in a year including nitrogenous fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer and compound fertilizer the consumption of chemical fertilizers is calculated in terms of amount of effective components by means of converting the gross weight of the respective fertilizers into weight containing effective component such as nitrogen content in nitrogenous fertilizer phosphorous pentoxide contents in phosphate fertilizer and potassium oxide contents in potash fertilizer the data of total power of agricultural machinery and consumption of chemical fertilizers in agricultural of shaanxi province during the period 2000 2016 were obtained from shaanxi statistical yearbook 2 3 methods 2 3 1 calculations of drought indices 2 3 1 1 the precipitation condition index previous studies have shown that ndvi does not respond immediately after precipitation and agricultural drought generally has a lag time of 3 months potop et al 2015 wu et al 2016 huang et al 2015 proved that the lag time in summer is approximately 3 months in the wrb therefore the cumulative precipitation for previous three months is used to characterize the precipitation condition for the current month for instance the amount of precipitation in june is the sum of precipitation in april may and june furthermore the monthly pci is calculated by the following equation p ci pci j pci min pci max pci min where pci min and pci max are the minimum and maximum values of pci at each grid in i month pci j represents the precipitation in i month during the period 2000 2016 2 3 1 2 the vegetation condition index in recent years normalized differential vegetation index ndvi is not only used to reflect the growth of vegetation but also used to assess drought events by many scholars park et al 2016 gazol et al 2018 chu et al 2019 however the growing seasons of crops in different regions are in respective stages with different water conditions therefore the dry wet condition of crops cannot be explained only by the values of ndvi kogan 1995b proposed the vegetation condition index and its calculation formula is as follows vci j ndvi j ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvi j is the smoothed monthly ndvi ndvi max and ndvi min represent maximum and minimum ndvi respectively calculated by multiyear smoothed monthly ndvi series for each pixel during the period 2000 2016 2 3 1 3 the temperature condition index the land surface temperature lst is strongly associated with drought and the temperature rise is the initial indication of the crops being treated with moisture stress and drought the increase of temperature and the closure of leaf stomata can reduce the water loss caused by transpiration reduce the surface latent heat flux increase the surface sensible heat flux and then cause the increase of temperature based on this principle kogan 1995a proposed the temperature condition index tci and its calculation formula is as follows tci j lst max lst j lst max lst min where lst j is the smoothed monthly lst lst max and lst min represent maximum and minimum lst respectively calculated by multiyear smoothed monthly lst series for each pixel during the period 2000 2016 2 3 1 4 the scaled drought condition index rhee et al 2010 proposed an agricultural drought index scaled drought condition index sdci based on vi lst and trmm that can assess drought conditions well in both dry and humid areas and its calculation formula is as follows sdci α vci β tci γ pci where α β and γ are the weights of monthly vci tci and pci respectively and α β γ 1 table 3 shows the drought classification by the pci tci vci and sdci 2 3 2 determination of optimal weight 2 3 2 1 analytic hierarchy process analytic hierarchy process ahp was proposed by saaty 1990 which is a kind of decision analysis method that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the scoring judgment matrix of the relative importance of the two indicators which are then aggregated the weights of each factor are finally calculated hoque et al 2020 zarei et al 2021 2 3 2 2 entropy method entropy method is an objective method for determining weights which could be used to quantify the amount of useful information in a given data when the value of the evaluation object varies significantly its entropy value is smaller indicating that these data provide a large amount of useful information and the evaluation object should be given a higher weight meng 1989 qiu 2002 guo et al 2021 2 3 2 3 criteria importance through intercriteria correlation criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic was developed by diakoulaki et al 1995 the critic method is a comprehensive measure of the objective weight of the indicators based on the comparative strength of the evaluation indicators and the conflict between them jahan et al 2012 chang et al 2020 2 3 2 4 fuzzy comprehensive evaluation zadeh 1965 introduced fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce which transformed qualitative evaluation into quantitative evaluation based on the affiliation theory of fuzzy mathematics the method could better solve the issues of fuzzy and difficult to quantify and is suitable for various non deterministic problems wu et al 2018 he et al 2021 3 results and analysis 3 1 applicability of the trmm dataset in the wrb in order to evaluate the applicability of the trmm dataset in the wrb the comparison between the temporal and spatial distribution of trmm3b43 and rainfall data from 13 meteorological stations in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2 a and b that the r2 between rainfall from 13 meteorological stations and trmm3b43 were 0 83 and 0 65 at the monthly time scale and annual time scale respectively it proved that the trmm3b43 dataset had well applicability in the wrb on both monthly and annual time scales moreover a comparison of the spatial distribution of the trmm3b43 dataset and 13 meteorological stations based on average annual precipitation was illustrated in fig 2 c it was shown that the spatial distribution of the two kinds of datasets was substantially consistent the annual precipitation was incremented from the north to the south increasing from the west to the east the trmm3b43 dataset in the wrb showed an annual precipitation of 300 764 mm while the rainfall from meteorological stations was from 386 7 to 840 9 mm in general the precipitation from the trmm3b43 dataset could well reflect the spatial distribution of rainfall in the wrb although its value was slightly lower than that of meteorological stations the variations of annual precipitation and annual precipitation anomaly percentage based on the trmm3b43 dataset during the period 2000 2016 in the wrb were shown in fig 3 the average annual precipitation from 2000 to 2016 was 545 06 mm the maximum value was 767 34 mm in 2003 higher than 40 78 of the average the minimum precipitation reached 385 32 mm in 2016 lower than 29 31 of the average besides the annual precipitation anomaly percentage was 17 7 and 16 51 in 2013 and 2011 respectively and the annual precipitation anomaly percentage was 14 62 and 10 4 in 2008 and 2004 respectively this indicated that the temporal variation of precipitation in the wrb was unstable which is particularly prone to drought disasters 3 2 variations of drought identified by multiple indices 3 2 1 drought variation based on the pci based on trmm3b43 precipitation data the pci was calculated in the wrb for the period 2000 2016 fig 4 the red and blue boxes indicate the negative and positive values of the percentage of precipitation anomalies respectively except for the year 2003 all the mean values of pci pci mean were less than 0 5 which meant that the wrb occurred different degrees of drought during the period 2000 2016 the distributions of the pci value for the years 2000 2005 and 2012 were relatively dispersed while those for the years 2001 2004 and 2015 were relatively concentrated the spatial distribution of the pci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 was presented in fig 5 before the year 2010 the drought in the north of the wrb was heavier than that in the south except in the years 2002 and 2007 after the year 2010 on the contrary the drought in the south was heavier than that in the north except the year 2003 drought events with varying degrees often occurred in the central region of the basin 3 2 2 drought variation based on the vci temporal variations and spatial distributions of the vci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it can be concluded from fig 6 the frequency of exceptional drought based on the vci was 27 59 and 1 93 in the years 2000 and 2001 respectively in all other years the frequency of exceptional droughts was less than 0 1 which could assume that no extreme drought events occurred in other years the trend of the frequency of extreme drought based on the vci was similarly to that for exceptional drought 26 95 and 21 71 in the years 2000 and 2001 respectively in all other years the frequency of extreme droughts was almost less than 1 the percentages of severe drought and moderate drought generally showed a trend of fluctuating downward it can be seen from fig 7 that the drought in the wrb identified by the vci was more severe in the northern part in the years 2000 and 2001 and began to be mitigated in the year 2002 which was the positive effect of the national policy of returning farmland to the forest grass implemented around the year 1999 and ecological restoration projects have been carried out in the wrb such as returning farmland to forests closing mountains for forest cultivation and protecting natural secondary forests the implementation of these ecological restoration projects had caused sloping farmland dry hilly gully region and low to medium cover grassland which were originally covered by sparse crops or grass to be replaced by forest or grassland the average vci value in the wrb was relatively low with about 0 2 in the year 2000 as the period of tree growth was still short the ecological restoration projects had not yet completely established then the measures began to bear fruit and the overall situation of vegetation cover improved with an average vci value of 0 3 in the year 2001 in the years 2002 and 2003 the drought was relatively severe in the central region in the years 2005 2008 the northern region experienced severe drought which was more severe than that in other regions after the year 2009 the severity of the drought had been mitigated across the basin a moderate drought occurred in the year 2013 in the south eastern region which had been alleviated in the years 2014 and 2015 however a moderate drought returned to hit the south eastern and central western regions 3 2 3 drought variation based on the tci the drought frequency based on the tci at monthly interval in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 was illustrated in fig 8 in china a year is divided into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february next year in terms of multi year average seasonal drought frequency moderate drought and above winter had the highest frequency of drought 47 74 followed by summer 34 11 autumn 33 21 and spring 32 58 in spring the frequency of moderate drought severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought all showed a downward trend with 2 10 y 3 2 10 y 4 3 10 y and 14 6 10 y respectively in summer the frequency of severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought all showed a downward trend while moderate drought showed a slight upward trend 0 7 10 y as for exceptional drought the frequency of occurrence was relatively high before the year 2005 and began to decline from the year 2006 in autumn the frequency of severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought all showed a downward trend while moderate drought showed a slightly upward trend 0 9 10 y in winter the frequencies of exceptional drought and extreme drought showed an upward trend while severe drought and moderate drought showed a downward trend the spatial distributions of frequency of seasonal drought based on the tci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 9 the frequency of spring drought was below 40 in most of the wrb while that in the surrounding areas such as the north south east and west was relatively high ranging between 40 and 60 in summer half of the wrb had a drought frequency of less than 40 mainly in the central and western regions while most of the southern and northern regions contributed a drought frequency between 40 and 60 the frequency of droughts in autumn was the opposite of that in summer with relatively low frequency in the south and north and relatively high frequency in the central wrb the frequency of drought was relatively high in winter compared to other seasons the frequency of winter drought in the northern midwestern and southern margins was below 40 while that in the most region of the wrb especially for the western south central regions was between 40 60 3 3 agricultural drought assessment by using the sdci 3 3 1 comparisons between crop yield and the sdcis under different weights to determine the suitable weights for the sdci in the wrb four different methods were used to obtain the weighting results using tci vci and pci data as inputs for june september from 2000 to 2016 the optimal weights were shown in table 4 in terms of these four results the difference between the weights of the vci and tci was relatively small the weights of the pci were relatively larger than those of the tci and vci except for the ahp and fce methods to better assess the performance of sdcis the coefficient of determination r2 between the sdci and cy calculated under different weighting methods during the growing season from 2000 to 2016 was illustrated in fig 10 in terms of cy dataset the lack of data for ningxia hui autonomous region in 2000 may have some influence on the results in fig 10 the r2 between fce sdci and cy was the highest with 0 45 while the r2 for entropy sdci were the lowest with 0 14 therefore the weights of fce were selected for the following sdci calculation and analysis 3 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of the sdci based on the calculation of the pci vci and tci with the weights of fce the agricultural drought in the wrb for the period 2000 2016 was assessed by the sdci fig 11 showed the temporal variation of agricultural drought at annual and monthly scale as can be seen from fig 11 a the variation of cy generally followed the changes in the sdci value the sdci values exhibited a w fluctuation from 2003 to 2010 during the growing seasons the vci showed a slightly upward trend while pci demonstrated the opposite trend the tci also presented a w shape and there was a turning point in the year of 2007 the changing trend of the sdci was similar to that of the tci showing a w shape which indicated that the sdci comprehensively considers the drought situation on the basis of fully considering all factors and the influence of temperature in this region was greater than that of precipitation after 2008 the cy increased as the average of sdci increased and decreased as the average of sdci decreased however for the same value of sdci there were some differences in the cy for instance the sdci values for 2008 and 2009 were almost identical with 0 45 and 0 46 respectively while cy were 10 83 million tons and 9 94 million tons respectively a difference of 0 89 million tons was mainly due to the difference in their sown areas of 125 16 thousand hectares in addition the sdci value for 2002 was 0 37 with a moderate drought occurred and cy was 7 9 million tons while the sdci value for 2003 was 0 59 with no drought happened and cy was only 7 45 million tons it also maybe on account of sown areas of 2205 35 thousand hectares in 2002 and 2115 99 thousand hectares in 2003 a reduction of 89 36 thousand hectares in the sown areas temporal variation of the sdci at the monthly scale was presented in fig 11 b the sdci values of the four months all showed an upward trend of fluctuation in different degrees indicating that the drought degree of the wrb had decreased the r2 between monthly sdci and cy had the highest value in july with 0 32 followed by june with 0 3 the lowest value in august with 0 07 therefore throughout the whole growing season the beginning month of sown had a great influence on the cy the spatial distributions of the growing seasons sdci in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 12 it can be seen that droughts events occurred in most parts of the basin before 2002 and the severity of the drought reduced after 2003 a severe drought occurred in the northern part of the basin until 2008 after which it showed weakening and a shift from the northern to the southern part of the basin most areas of the basin experienced drought events in 2016 3 3 3 utility of sdci in drought disaster monitoring to better demonstrate the utility of the sdci to assess agricultural drought in the wrb the sdci was also analyzed in comparison with the drought area disaster area and crop failure area areas where crop yield have been reduced by more than 10 30 80 due to drought are defined as drought area disaster area and crop failure area respectively the year of 2003 with extremely high precipitation was excluded from this analysis the drought area and sdci values of gansu province and shaanxi province were compared and analyzed the results were shown in fig 13 a limited by data availability r2 between the sdci and the drought area was 0 16 which did not show a good agreement whereas the trends were consistent in some years for example the sdci value first increased and then decreased from 2011 to 2014 while the cy value first decreased and then increased in general the sdci values were less correlated with the drought area and in turn the r2 between sdci values and the disaster area were selected for the following analysis the r2 between the sdci and the drought area at municipal scale of gansu province and shaanxi province in the wrb during the period 2000 2016 were presented in fig 13 b the highest correlation coefficient is contributed by qingyang 0 71 followed by yan an 0 41 except for xi an 0 08 xianyang 0 07 weinan 0 06 baoji 0 04 in the south and yulin 0 1 in the north of the wrb the r2 of other regions were generally between 0 2 and 0 4 the results proved that the sdci performed well in monitoring agricultural drought conditions in the western and central regions of the basin comparative analysis of the disaster area and the sdci values in gansu province and the results were shown in fig 13 c the r2 between the sdci and areas affected was 0 35 from 2009 2016 the trend of changes in sdci values and the disaster area remained largely consistent the results showed that the sdci values could well reflect the disaster area of the basin the r2 between the sdci values and the disaster area by each region in gansu province were shown in fig 13 d it can be seen that the highest r2 was produced by qingyang 0 79 followed by pingliang 0 44 tianshui 0 41 and dingxi 0 32 the drylands of qingyang tianshui pingliang and dingxi accounted for 20 48 11 6 11 2 and 8 86 of the total area of each region respectively which indicated that the sdci index could well reflect the disaster area the average of sdci across shaanxi province was calculated and then compared with the crop failure area from 2000 to 2016 which was shown in fig 13 e a linear correlation between crop failure areas and the sdci values was detected with a r2 of 0 06 it can be seen that crop failure area reached a maximum of 10 93 105 hectares in 2010 according to news reports in the winter of 2009 and early 2010 a drought occurred in weinan of shaanxi province with 70 consecutive days of no precipitation and relative soil humidity in most fields fell below 50 which was extremely harmful to summer crop growth therefore the value of crop failure area in 2010 relatively higher was due to summer drought suffered by weinan rather than autumn drought comparative analysis of crop failure areas and the sdci values in shaanxi province and the results were shown in fig 13 f although weinan produced the highest r2 between crop failure area and the sdci value r2 0 39 the crop failure area was heavily influenced by the summer drought in addition the second highest r2 was 0 28 from tongchuan therefore an analysis comparing the sdci index with the drought area disaster area and crop failure area showed that the sdci can provide a good response not only to crop yield but also to the extent of agricultural disasters 4 discussion 4 1 determination of weights for variables in drought index the determination of the weight for each variable in drought index is very important for the accuracy of drought monitoring guo et al 2019 zhang and jia 2013 proposed the microwave integrated drought index midi which is combined of pci smci and tci the weight is determined based on experimental weights huang et al 2015 built an integrated drought index combined runoff soil moisture and precipitation using entropy method in the yellow river basin an integrated drought condition index idci was developed by integrating spei 3 smci and vci by principal component analysis to determine the weights in inner mongolia china shen et al 2019 in this study four different methods were used to determine the weight and the weight determined by comparison with crop yield not only makes up for the limitations of a single method but also better reflects the agricultural drought rather than meteorological drought 4 2 suitability of the sdci for indicating agricultural drought the sdci was based on precipitation temperature and vegetation data including the impact of temperature changing rate a lag time of agricultural drought responding to meteorological drought 3 months comprehensive information regarding vegetation growth cao et al 2022 which is suitable for identification and monitoring of agricultural drought the wrb is characterized as decreasing precipitation and increasing average air temperature at monthly scale huang et al 2016 the sdci value showed a small inflection point in the year of 2007 which was consistent with the change of temperature while precipitation did not change significantly indicating that the impact of temperature on sdci was greater than precipitation the finding is consistent with previous studies confirming that the influence of temperature on vegetation was greater than precipitation liu and menzel 2016 furthermore the growing season of corn is from june to september which is consistent with the conclusion proposed by dai et al 2022 that pet and temperature are main influencing factor of drought propagation in summer the sdci value showed in a w shape from 2003 to 2010 and it demonstrated that the wrb presented a transition from wet to dry and then from dry to wet which is consistent with the results of midi based on precipitation anomaly percentage runoff anomaly percentage standardized precipitation index with 6 month aggregation time step and modified palmer drought severity index chang et al 2016 the frequency of droughts was generally greater in the north than that in the south and higher in the west than that in the east based on the sdci which is consistent with the finding of yang et al 2018 based on a nonlinear multi variate drought index nmdi 4 3 the influence of agricultural modernization affecting agricultural drought agricultural modernization can effectively alleviate the impact of drought on people s life it is essential to consider agricultural modernization factors for assessing the agricultural drought qin et al 2015 yang et al 2018 to reduce the impact of agricultural drought improving breeding apply chemical fertilizers increase the use of machinery and supplement farmland irrigation can be implemented in agricultural production wu et al 2020 in order to better show the impact of agricultural modernization total agricultural machinery power consumption of chemical fertilizers and yield per hectare of shaanxi province during the period 2000 2016 were shown in fig 14 as observed in fig 14 the value of total agricultural machinery power firstly increased and then began to decrease at the year of 2015 the total agricultural machinery power is divided into three stages fluctuating upward 2003 2009 stable forward 2010 2014 beginning to decline after 2015 yang et al 2020 during the eleventh five year plan and the twelfth five year plan government vigorously promoted rural social and economic construction raised the overall agricultural production capacity and accelerated the process of agricultural modernization the total power of agricultural machinery only declined in 2016 mainly because the insured amount of small agricultural machinery decreased i e small tractors small tractors towing farm machinery according to the statistics data from nation bureau of statistics the temporal variation of consumption of chemical fertilizers showed firstly upward and then downward trend and the turning point at the year of 2013 in 2012 the people s government of shaanxi province issued a three year action to prevent and control water pollution in the wrb to reduce unreasonable fertilization and agricultural non point source pollution shaanxi provincial people s government 2012 furthermore the people s government of shaanxi province issued a notice on a three year action plan 2015 2017 to consolidate and improve the prevention and control of water pollution in the wrb shaanxi provincial people s government 2015 it is expected to reduce agricultural non point source pollution and other problems in the basin the yield per hectare displayed an upward trend of fluctuation in 2004 the value increased greatly because of the change of corn planting varieties in guanzhong plain lei et al 2012 before 2004 the corn planted in the west of guanzhong plain was a single hybrid with high quality and high yield at the year of 2004 the single hybrids with high yield and multi resistance was planted the value in the year of 2007 was lower maybe due to the rapid reduction of planting area therefore it can be reasonably concluded that the variations of agricultural drought were caused by both climate change and human activities huang et al 2015 in the case of the sdci combining three factors the impact of human activities may account for a certain proportion zhang et al 2019 the impact of human activities and climate change on agricultural drought can be further considered separately in the future 5 conclusions in this study the sdci was used by determining variable weights based on three remote sensing components pci vci and tci to assess the agricultural drought in the wei river basin of china from 2000 to 2016 the performance of sdci was evaluated based on crop yield compared with four kinds of weights determination methods and then drought area disaster area and crop failure area were used to validate the results of the agricultural drought assessment the main conclusions are summarized as follows a comparison of precipitation from trmm3b43 and meteorological gauging stations showed that the trmm3b43 could accurately characterize the precipitation across the wrb at annual and monthly scales whereas the precipitation was underestimated based on the trmm3b43 dataset the maximum precipitation reached 767 34 mm in 2003 and the minimum reached 385 32 mm in 2016 the precipitation in the south of the wrb was greater than that in the north while that in the east was greater than the west the arid area of the wrb shifted from the north to the south based on the pci analysis and the arid area showed a decreasing trend after 2008 the drought frequency and arid area both showed a decreasing trend indicated by the vci and the arid area similarly shifted from the north to the south the drought frequency showed a downward trend at the seasonal scale calculated by the tci the sdci correlates well with crop yield based on fce with the r2 of 0 45 the temporal variation of the sdci value showed a w fluctuation from 2003 to 2010 comparing with the drought area disaster area and crop failure area it indicated that the sdci provides a good assessment of the severity of agricultural drought in the wei river basin of china in conclusion the sdci is applicable to the evaluation of agricultural drought in the wei river basin of china and provides strong support for agricultural disaster prevention disaster

climate conditions in this study soil physical and chemical variables and plots characteristics were used through linear mixed and random forest based modeling to evaluate the determinants of actual evapotranspiration eta and crop water productivity cwp in rice in the kou valley irrigated scheme in burkina faso multi temporal landsat images were used within the python module for the surface energy balance algorithm for land model to calculate rice eta and cwp during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014 results showed noticeable spatial variations in pysebal derived eta and cwp in farmers fields during the study period the distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet dpsi plot elevation sand and silt contents soil total nitrogen soil extractable potassium and zinc were the main factors affecting variabilities in eta and cwp in the farmers fields with dpsi being the top explanatory variable there was generally a positive association up to a given threshold between eta and dpsi sand and silt contents and soil extractable zinc for cwp the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non monotonic that is a mix of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either an increase or a decrease in cwp our results indicate that improving irrigated rice performance in the kou valley irrigation scheme would require growing more rice at lower

introduction worldwide more than 70 of the global freshwater resources are used for agricultural production undesapd 2014 un water 2018 in 2018 over 338 7 million ha of agricultural land areas were equipped with irrigation infrastructures in the world and 15 9 million ha in africa fao 2020 in most of the countries in sub sahara africa ssa especially those located in the sahelian zone the increasing year to year rainfall variability lebel and ali 2009 paturel et al 2010 coupled with rapid socioeconomic growth and increasing demand of water for non agricultural purposes e g urbanization industrialization has put substantial pressure on available water for irrigation thereby worsening water scarcity related issues in those regions in countries where agricultural production is predominantly rainfed and farmers are typically subsistence farmers the recourse to irrigation is crucial to face the adverse effects of rainfall variability and maintain satisfactory yield levels over years to ensure farm profitability and improve farmers livelihoods furthermore increasing water use efficiency through improved crop water productivity has gained attention over the past years as emphasized by the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs sgd2 3 and sgd6 4 which refer to the substantial increase in agricultural productivity and water use efficiency by 2030 anon 2015 https sdgs un org goals thus besides the good knowledge of water available for irrigation over time and of the proportion of irrigated land areas implementing relevant policies to improve agricultural irrigation water management and achieve the sustainable management of irrigated land areas requires a good diagnostic of irrigation performance of these areas and a clear characterization of the environmental factors affecting the performance of irrigated schemes bastiaanssen and bos 1999 bos et al 2005 various approaches including field campaigns and surveys remote sensing rs based methods are being applied to characterize the performance of irrigated areas temporally and spatially from field to national scales field campaigns and surveys are typically costly labor intensive and time consuming when dealing with large land areas on the other hand rs based methods can be cost effective and less time consuming as remotely sensed data used for assessing the irrigation performance of irrigation schemes are most often readily available and provide continual spatial coverage at frequent time intervals across varying spatial scales bastiaanssen and bos 1999 blatchford et al 2019

which is located in the kou watershed a relatively water rich watershed in southwest burkina faso wellens et al 2013 with alternate rainy june to september and dry october to may seasons the kou watershed is characterized by a sub humid climate wellens et al 2004 traoré 2012 with annual rainfall varying between 900 mm and 1100 mm and potential evapotranspiration up to 2000 mm on average dembélé et al 2012 traoré 2012 the monthly minimum and maximum temperatures are on average 18 c and 37 c respectively and the relative humidity ranges from 20 to 80 annually traoré 2012 the kvis diverts water from the kou river into its irrigation canals at an average flow rate of 3 5 m3 s 1 and 1 4 m3 s 1 during the rainy and dry seasons respectively wellens et al 2013 six dominant soil types are found across the kvis clay clay loam sandy clay sandy clay loam loam and sandy loam dembélé et al 2012 plot size in the kvis varies between 0 2 ha and 1 5 ha irrigation water is typically supplied through the basin system with the critical period of irrigation spanning from january to april rice nursery most often starts in december followed by transplantation in january the growth cycle varies between 90 and 120 days with harvest occurring in may during the study period 2013 and 2014 new rice for africa nerica cultivars were sown across the kvis by farmers with the areas sown being 452 ha and 317 ha in 2013 and 2014 respectively nitcheu et al 2014 potential paddy yields for rice cultivars sown during the study period ranged from 5 0 to 7 0 t ha 1 nitcheu et al 2014 2 2 data 2 2 1 biophysical predictors data various soil physicochemical variables sourced from the africa soil information service afsis hengl et al 2015 and the africa soil profiles database compiled for

available water capacity awc potential of hydrogen ph cation exchange capacity cec total nitrogen n and extractable calcium ca iron fe magnesium mg phosphorus p potassium k and zinc zn except for the depth to the bedrock soil physicochemical properties were extracted for the topsoil layer of 30 cm due to the shallow rooting depth of rice plants soil physicochemical variables from the afsis and the africa soil profiles database compiled for afsis represent an average status of soil properties at 250 m spatial resolution encompassing the 1960 2016 period hengl et al 2015 2017 such soil properties data have proven effective in understanding the sources of variation in several crop fields including rice in ssa djagba et al 2018 dossou yovo et al 2019 akpoti et al 2020 further information on the methodology of soil data compilation and assessment of soil nutrient maps in the afsis can be found in leenaars et al 2014 hengl et al 2015 2017 two additional variables related to each of the rice plots were included in the analysis the plot s elevation and the distance between the plot and the scheme inlet dpsi plot elevations were extracted from the 30 m spatial resolution digital elevation model sourced from the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa s shuttle radar topography mission farr et al 2007 dpsi was determined as the sum of distances between the centroid of each rice plot and the nearest secondary canal inlet and between that secondary canal inlet and the main scheme inlet of the kvis using the near distance tool from the arcgis software 2 2 2 pysebal

air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation and digital elevation model data eta values were derived as residuals of the surface energy balance cwp was determined as the ratio between yield and eta both estimated using pysebal rice yield was estimated as follows 1 yield biomass hi 1 moist where biomass is the crop biomass estimated using pysebal kg ha 1 hi refers to the harvest index 0 45 in this study and moist is the moisture content of the grain at harvest 17 in this study biomass values in pysebal are estimated as a function of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and light use efficiency bastiaanssen and ali 2003 the value for hi in this study was selected based on reported values in the literature steduto et al 2012 moist value was from the average moisture contents observed at the kvis nitcheu et al 2014 a full description of the calculation methods of eta and cwp using pysebal as well as performance results of pysebal in estimating eta across the kvis can be found in sawadogo et al 2020a and sawadogo et al 2020b comparisons between the fao water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data fao wapor and pysebal derived eta values indicated that pysebal satisfactorily estimated eta values across the kvis with r2 and root mean square error rmse values ranging from 0 74 to 0 80 and 3 6 11 0 mm respectively for the dekadal estimates while for the seasonal estimates of eta the corresponding values were 0 60 0 70 and from 64 mm to 150 mm respectively sawadogo et al 2020b in this study pixel values from the afsis and the africa soil profiles database compiled for afsis both at 250 m spatial resolution were extracted for each of the rice plots using qgis version 2 18 27 https

random forests are based on a learning algorithm relying on the concept of model aggregation breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 they combine binary decision trees built with bootstrapped samples from the learning sample where a subset of predictors has been chosen randomly at each node prasad et al 2006 kouadio et al 2018 rf was used to estimate the importance of the potential predictors or explanatory variables of eta or cwp in rice plots across the kvis the same randomly divided datasets used for training and testing in the lmm approach were used the number of decision trees ntree was set to 500 the optimal minimum number of observations per tree leaf mtry was selected automatically during the execution of the rf algorithm using the caret package kuhn et al 2020 variable importance partial dependence plot and model prediction were used as tools for evaluating the performance of the rf based models the training dataset was used for both variable importance and partial dependence

performance 3 results 3 1 rice growing environment actual evapotranspiration and water productivity a correlation matrix for each pair of the potential explanatory variables is shown in fig s1 from the initial set of variables only 12 were considered in the modeling these were dpsi elv dtb bld sl sn ph n ca fe k and zn noticeable variations in these soil properties were found across the kvis table 1 fig s2 compared to the other chemical elements ca was dominant in the 0 30 cm soil horizon its proportion ranged from 581 to 1427 ppm with an average of 885 ppm table 1 values of ph varied between 5 9 and 6 4 indicating that rice was grown on acidic soils during the study period the range of ph found for rice plots across the kvis was within the correct balance of soil ph for rice 5 5 and 7 5 yu 1991 nishikawa et al 2014 the dtb was on average 157 cm with the maximum being 174 cm sand and silt proportions at 15 30 cm depth varied between 38 and 49 w and 23 and 31 w respectively suggesting that at this depth the soils of rice plots were more sandy clay to sandy clay loam rice plots were located at 295 310 m above sea level masl table 1 with the majority of plots 75 being above 300 masl the closest plot to the kvis scheme inlet was at 815 m and the farthest was at 11 289 m table 1 large variations were found in the soil physico chemical properties plot elevation and distance to the inlet of the irrigation scheme in farmers fields table 1 with regard to estimated rice eta relatively higher values were found in 2014 compared to those in 2013 with the averages being 619 mm range 239 794 mm and 554 mm range 178 750 mm respectively fig 2a estimated water productivity values were on average 0 53 kg m 3 range 0 15 1 09 kg m 3 and 0 59 kg m 3 range 0 31 1 30 kg m 3 in 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 2b 3 2 determinants of actual evapotranspiration and crop water productivity 3 2 1 assessment using linear mixed modeling approach table 2 shows the estimates of each of the predictors as well as their statistical significance overall the distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet dpsi depth to bedrock dtb bulk density bld silt content sl sand content sn total soil nitrogen n and potassium k were the predictors explaining the variability in rice eta p 0 05 table 2 factors such as dpsi bld sl and sn were negatively related to eta thus the farther the rice plot was from the scheme inlet the lower its eta was likewise the higher the soil content in silt or sand or the bulk density the lower the eta other statistically significant predictors dtb n and k were positively related to eta table 2 on the other hand there were fewer predictors that affected significantly rice cwp during the study period these predictors were plot elevation elv dpsi and n table 2 all these three predictors were negatively related to cwp indicating that low cwp occurred either in rice plots located at higher altitudes or in plots far from the inlet scheme or in plots with soils having relatively higher n concentrations the results of the general dominance analysis for eta and cwp are presented in fig 3 for the variability in eta dpsi and n were the predictors with relatively higher marginal r² values 0 165 and 0 125 respectively fig 3a the marginal r² for the other statistically significant predictors bld dtb sl sn k table 2 varied between 0 010 and 0 020 fig 3a for cwp dpsi had the highest marginal r² value 0 107 fig 3b the remainder of the statistically significant predictors elv n had their marginal r² ranging from 0 010 to 0 030 fig 3b 3 2 2 assessment using random forest based modeling approach overall the rank of each of the variables based on the rf models differed according to the response variables fig 4 exception included the variable dpsi which was found to contribute the most in both rice eta and cwp with 52 and 22 for the mean decrease in accuracy respectively fig 4 for rice eta besides dpsi variables with contribution 20 included extractable zinc zn potassium k and n fig 4a silt and sand contents and bulk density contributed to about 11 16 respectively the top six contributors were dpsi n zn k sn and sl fig 4a for rice cwp the majority of the remaining 11 explanatory variables had their contribution to the rf based model varying between 10 and 20 dtb and bld were the less contributing predictors 7 fig 4b the top six contributors based on the rf approach were dpsi k n elv ca and sn fig 4b figs 5 and 6 show the partial dependence plots for the top six predictors explaining variabilities in rice eta and cwp respectively they displayed the pattern of association i e monotonic or non monotonic linear or non linear between the predictor and the response variable among the top six covariates only the relationship between rice eta and k or n was monotonic an increase in k or n concentration was positively associated to an increase in rice eta with that of k being linear fig 5 non monotonic associations were found between rice eta and dpsi zn sn and sl fig 5 for those predictors there was generally an increasing trend to rice eta up to a given threshold followed by a decreasing trend fig 5 with regard to rice cwp the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non monotonic fig 6 that is there was a mixed of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either increasing or decreasing cwp depending on predictor value for example for plot elevation and soil total nitrogen n there was a decreasing association to rice cwp up to a given threshold value of the predictor i e 305 m for elv and 780 ppm for n before an increasing association afterwards fig 6 3 3 comparison of lmm and rf based models performance both lmm and rf based models achieved good performance in predicting eta rmse were 39 mm and 38 mm respectively their corresponding r2 being 0 74 and 0 75 and nse being 0 74 and 0 75 fig 7a however for cwp the performance of both models was fair rmse 0 07 kg m 3 and 0 08 kg m 3 for rf based model and lmm respectively corresponding r2 of 0 43 and 0 38 respectively fig 7b this suggests that additional observational data are needed for better assessing the variability of cwp in rice plots across the kvis 4 discussion achieving the full potential of irrigated rice during the dry season through tailored soil and management practices is pivotal to the success of farming activities in the kvis in this study soil physicochemical properties and plot characteristics affecting eta and cwp in irrigated rice in the kvis were investigated the spatial variation of eta and cwp both obtained with pysebal were predominantly linked to the distance between the plot and the irrigation scheme inlet elevation soil sand and silt contents soil total nitrogen and extractable potassium and zinc soil texture influences the movement of water in the soil as well as its storage capacity and the amount of stored water that is available to the plants the results from the linear mixed model showed negative relationships between eta and dpsi sl sn bld and positive relationships between eta and dtb n and k contents the negative relationships between eta and the sand or silt contents could be attributed to reduced soil water availability with an increase in sand and silt contents leading to water stress and subsequent reduction in the eta by the rice plants haefele et al 2006 niang et al 2018 the reduced eta with an increase in bld could be related to reduced root growth due to higher soil compaction which would limit the growth and development of the rice plants and result in reduced eta huang et al 2012 we also noticed that soil water holding capacity and bld were negatively correlated in this study fig s1 and therefore higher bld is associated with lower soil water holding capacity and higher water stress and reduced eta overall soil texture and plot distance to the irrigation scheme inlet had great influences on the movement of water in the soil as well as its storage capacity and the amount of stored water that is available to the plants therefore practices that improved through for instance addition of organic matter have the potential to increase infiltration water holding ability and actual evapotranspiration and can be recommended to the farmers of the kvis wilson et al 2020 there was a statistically significant and positive effect of soil nitrogen and potassium on eta in the kvis during the study period this can be related to the role of both nutrients on photosynthesis and crop growth which enhance the transpiration water loss and result in higher eta skinner 2013 santos et al 2016 such results indicate that a good management of these two nutrients through soil fertility management remains crucial for the overall performance of the kvis donovan et al 1999 dembelé et al 2005 yameogo et al 2013 supporting farmers in acquiring fertilizer increase their awareness for best fertilizer management practices and strengthening their capacity in implementing integrated soil fertility management practices would help farmers in the kvis effectively address the ongoing crop nutrients management issues wopereis et al 1999 wopereis and defoer 2007 lompo et al 2018 the negative effect of the nitrogen on rice cwp as shown in the lmm results indicated that the proportional increase in eta due to the positive effect of the nitrogen is greater than the proportional increase in yield various factors including crop management practices soil fertility cropping calendars can influence cwp through their effects on eta and crop yield kijne and fao 2003 nangia et al 2008 topography is well known as affecting cwp in rice bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 foley et al 2020 dossou yovo et al 2022 our results indicate that relatively lower cwp were found in irrigated plots located at higher altitudes in the kvis which can be related to soil erosion at these altitudes and the subsequent loss in soil fertility seibert et al 2007 karaca et al 2018 indicating the need to improve land and soil water conservation at higher altitudes in the kvis as reported in a previous study sawadogo et al 2020b in basin irrigation systems crop water productivity and actual evapotranspiration most often decrease as one moves away from the head of irrigation canals given the reduced canal water supply van dam et al 2006 latif 2007 the distance between the plot and the scheme inlet dpsi acted as the most influential factor for eta and cwp in our study for several reasons including the relatively high irrigation water consumption by head enders compared to tail enders in such irrigation schemes renault et al 2013 and the poor water management of the kvis indeed the irrigation water management across the kvis was carried out by inexperienced members of the water users association and that would probably affect more the tail end farmers traoré 2012 wellens et al 2013 several studies reported that tail end farmers face challenges in having access to irrigation water when needed leading to water stress and yield penalty compared to farmers fields located close to the water source sam amoah and gowing 2001 zwart and leclert 2010 training sessions and outputs from such studies are among the means used to improve the management of the kvis growing crops with less water requirement in the tail of the scheme or using efficient irrigation systems such as drip irrigation system for the other crops grown in the kvis can help improve the overall irrigation performance of the scheme regarding the two modeling approaches used in the study it has been shown that random forest based models most often outperform multiple linear regression models e g breiman 2001 jeong et al 2016 our results were in line with such conclusions at least for cwp for eta both models resulted in similar performance jeong et al 2016 argued that the relatively higher performance of rf based models is likely more evident when the response is a result of complex interactions between multiple predictors as it is the case in crop and farming systems and evidenced by the partial dependence plots figs 5 and 6 other factors such as vapor pressure deficit water availability crop variety crop management practices and socio economic factors e g water users association characteristics proximity of farmers to the irrigation scheme logistic challenges etc can potentially impact on irrigation performance in irrigated perimeters and schemes zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 dawe 2005 zhang et al 2013 including such potential variables would help improve our understanding of the key constraints of irrigation performance in the kvis there were no experiments carried out to investigate the effect of each of the potential explanatory variables on eta and cwp in rice plots at the study site achieving this was beyond the scope of the study nevertheless the effects of biophysical factors on crop evapotranspiration have already been documented e g allen et al 1998 katerji and mastrorilli 2009 garrigues et al 2015 garrigues et al 2018 lehmann et al 2018 carrying out such experiments in the future could provide additional insights into developing better strategies to improve irrigation water management at the kvis another limitation of the study was the short data period two years expanding the data period to include several years with different climate patterns improve the record keeping of the crop yield databases every season and collect additional socio economic data would improve the outcomes of the study this is considered as part of a future potential research in the study country 5 conclusions we investigated the potential soil physical and chemical properties and plot characteristics affecting the variability of irrigation performance in rice across the kvis during the dry season production periods in 2013 and 2014 using two modeling approaches random forest based and linear mixed models the main variables affecting rice eta and cwp both obtained with pysebal were the distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet dpsi plot elevation soil content in sand and silt soil total nitrogen and soil extractable potassium and zinc various association patterns were found between eta or cwp and the top six predictors non monotonic association for all top six predictors in case of cwp and either monotonic or non monotonic association in case of eta depending on the predictor results also indicated that relatively good performing rice plots in terms of cwp were those located close to the scheme perimeter and at relatively lower altitudes in the kvis the effects of soil nitrogen and potassium on eta and cwp in rice across the irrigation scheme suggest that good soil fertility management would be beneficial to rice both lmm and rf based models achieved good performance in predicting eta the fair models performances for predicting cwp nse for lmm and rf being 0 35 and 0 41 respectively and corresponding rmse of 0 08 kg m 3 and 0 07 kg m 3 indicate that additional observational data might be needed to improve our understanding of the key constraints of irrigation performance in the kvis nonetheless this study can serve as a basis for improving irrigation water management through helping the kvis managers to strategically locate underperforming plots to better prioritize their operations future research to improve our understanding of the key constraints of irrigation performance in the kvis can include investigating potential factors influencing irrigation performance such as water availability demographics of irrigation water users households characteristics proximity of farmers to the irrigation scheme logistic

climate conditions in this study soil physical and chemical variables and plots characteristics were used through linear mixed and random forest based modeling to evaluate the determinants of actual evapotranspiration eta and crop water productivity cwp in rice in the kou valley irrigated scheme in burkina faso multi temporal landsat images were used within the python module for the surface energy balance algorithm for land model to calculate rice eta and cwp during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014 results showed noticeable spatial variations in pysebal derived eta and cwp in farmers fields during the study period the distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet dpsi plot elevation sand and silt contents soil total nitrogen soil extractable potassium and zinc were the main factors affecting variabilities in eta and cwp in the farmers fields with dpsi being the top explanatory variable there was generally a positive association up to a given threshold between eta and dpsi sand and silt contents and soil extractable zinc for cwp the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non monotonic that is a mix of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either an increase or a decrease in cwp our results indicate that improving irrigated rice performance in the kou valley irrigation scheme would require growing more rice at lower

introduction worldwide more than 70 of the global freshwater resources are used for agricultural production undesapd 2014 un water 2018 in 2018 over 338 7 million ha of agricultural land areas were equipped with irrigation infrastructures in the world and 15 9 million ha in africa fao 2020 in most of the countries in sub sahara africa ssa especially those located in the sahelian zone the increasing year to year rainfall variability lebel and ali 2009 paturel et al 2010 coupled with rapid socioeconomic growth and increasing demand of water for non agricultural purposes e g urbanization industrialization has put substantial pressure on available water for irrigation thereby worsening water scarcity related issues in those regions in countries where agricultural production is predominantly rainfed and farmers are typically subsistence farmers the recourse to irrigation is crucial to face the adverse effects of rainfall variability and maintain satisfactory yield levels over years to ensure farm profitability and improve farmers livelihoods furthermore increasing water use efficiency through improved crop water productivity has gained attention over the past years as emphasized by the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs sgd2 3 and sgd6 4 which refer to the substantial increase in agricultural productivity and water use efficiency by 2030 anon 2015 https sdgs un org goals thus besides the good knowledge of water available for irrigation over time and of the proportion of irrigated land areas implementing relevant policies to improve agricultural irrigation water management and achieve the sustainable management of irrigated land areas requires a good diagnostic of irrigation performance of these areas and a clear characterization of the environmental factors affecting the performance of irrigated schemes bastiaanssen and bos 1999 bos et al 2005 various approaches including field campaigns and surveys remote sensing rs based methods are being applied to characterize the performance of irrigated areas temporally and spatially from field to national scales field campaigns and surveys are typically costly labor intensive and time consuming when dealing with large land areas on the other hand rs based methods can be cost effective and less time consuming as remotely sensed data used for assessing the irrigation performance of

which is located in the kou watershed a relatively water rich watershed in southwest burkina faso wellens et al 2013 with alternate rainy june to september and dry october to may seasons the kou watershed is characterized by a sub humid climate wellens et al 2004 traoré 2012 with annual rainfall varying between 900 mm and 1100 mm and potential evapotranspiration up to 2000 mm on average dembélé et al 2012 traoré 2012 the monthly minimum and maximum temperatures are on average 18 c and 37 c respectively and the relative humidity ranges from 20 to 80 annually traoré 2012 the kvis diverts water from the kou river into its irrigation canals at an average flow rate of 3 5 m3 s 1 and 1 4 m3 s 1 during the rainy and dry seasons respectively wellens et al 2013 six dominant soil types are found across the kvis clay clay loam sandy clay sandy clay loam loam and sandy loam dembélé et al 2012 plot size in the kvis varies between 0 2 ha and 1 5 ha irrigation water is typically supplied through the basin system with the critical period of irrigation spanning from january to april rice nursery most often starts in december followed by transplantation in january the growth cycle varies between 90 and 120 days with harvest occurring in may during the study period 2013 and 2014 new rice for africa nerica cultivars were sown across the kvis by farmers with the areas sown being 452 ha and 317 ha in 2013 and 2014 respectively nitcheu et al 2014 potential paddy yields for rice cultivars sown during the study period ranged from 5 0 to 7 0 t ha 1 nitcheu et al 2014 2 2

africa soil profiles database compiled for afsis represent an average status of soil properties at 250 m spatial resolution encompassing the 1960 2016 period hengl et al 2015 2017 such soil properties data have proven effective in understanding the sources of variation in several crop fields including rice in ssa djagba et al 2018 dossou yovo et al 2019 akpoti et al 2020 further information on the methodology of soil data compilation and assessment of soil nutrient maps in the afsis can be found in leenaars et al 2014 hengl et al 2015 2017 two additional variables related to each of the rice plots were included in the analysis the plot s elevation and the distance between the plot and the scheme inlet dpsi plot elevations were extracted from the 30 m spatial resolution digital elevation model sourced from the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa s shuttle radar topography mission farr et al 2007 dpsi was determined as the sum of distances between the centroid of each rice plot and the nearest secondary canal inlet and between that secondary canal inlet and the main scheme inlet of the kvis using the near distance tool from the arcgis software 2 2 2 pysebal

air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation and digital elevation model data eta values were derived as residuals of the surface energy balance cwp was determined as the ratio between yield and eta both estimated using pysebal rice yield was estimated as follows 1 yield biomass hi 1 moist where biomass is the crop biomass estimated using pysebal kg ha 1 hi refers to the harvest index 0 45 in this study and moist is the moisture content of the grain at harvest 17 in this study biomass values in pysebal are estimated as a function of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and light use efficiency bastiaanssen and ali 2003 the value for hi in this study was selected based on reported values in the literature steduto et al 2012 moist value was from the average moisture contents observed at the kvis nitcheu et al 2014 a full description of the calculation methods of eta and cwp using pysebal as well as performance results of pysebal in estimating eta across the kvis can be found in sawadogo et al 2020a and sawadogo et al 2020b comparisons between the fao water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data fao wapor and pysebal derived eta values indicated that pysebal satisfactorily estimated eta values across the kvis with r2 and root mean square error rmse values ranging from 0 74 to 0 80 and 3 6 11 0 mm respectively for the dekadal estimates while for the seasonal estimates of eta the corresponding values were 0 60 0 70 and from 64 mm to 150 mm respectively sawadogo et al 2020b in this study pixel values from the afsis and the africa soil profiles database compiled for afsis both at 250 m spatial resolution were extracted for each of the rice plots using qgis version 2 18 27 https

random forests are based on a learning algorithm relying on the concept of model aggregation breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 they combine binary decision trees built with bootstrapped samples from the learning sample where a subset of predictors has been chosen randomly at each node prasad et al 2006 kouadio et al 2018 rf was used to estimate the importance of the potential predictors or explanatory variables of eta or cwp in rice plots across the kvis the same randomly divided datasets used for training and testing in the lmm approach were used the number of decision trees ntree was set to 500 the optimal minimum number of observations per tree leaf mtry was selected automatically during the execution of the rf algorithm using the caret package kuhn et al 2020 variable importance partial dependence plot and model prediction were used as tools for evaluating the performance of the rf based models the training dataset was used for both variable importance and partial dependence

are the average predicted and pysebal derived values of eta or cwp respectively and n is the testing sample number lower rmse values and r2 or nse values close to 1 are indicative of good model performance 3 results 3 1 rice growing environment actual evapotranspiration and water productivity a correlation matrix for each pair of the potential explanatory variables is shown in fig s1 from the initial set of variables only 12 were considered in the modeling these were dpsi elv dtb bld sl sn ph n ca fe k and zn noticeable variations in these soil properties were found across the kvis table 1 fig s2 compared to the other chemical elements ca was dominant in the 0 30 cm soil horizon its proportion ranged from 581 to 1427 ppm with an average of 885 ppm table 1 values of ph varied between 5 9 and 6 4 indicating that rice was grown on acidic soils during the study period the range of ph found for rice plots across the kvis was within the correct balance of soil ph for rice 5 5

suggesting that at this depth the soils of rice plots were more sandy clay to sandy clay loam rice plots were located at 295 310 m above sea level masl table 1 with the majority of plots 75 being above 300 masl the closest plot to the kvis scheme inlet was at 815 m and the farthest was at 11 289 m table 1 large variations were found in the soil physico chemical properties plot elevation and distance to the inlet of the irrigation scheme in farmers fields table 1 with regard to estimated rice eta relatively higher values were found in 2014 compared to those in 2013 with the averages being

2013 and 2014 respectively fig 2b 3 2 determinants of actual evapotranspiration and crop water productivity 3 2 1 assessment using linear mixed modeling approach table 2 shows the estimates of each of the predictors as well as their statistical significance overall the distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet dpsi depth to bedrock dtb bulk density bld silt content sl sand content sn total soil nitrogen n and potassium k were the predictors explaining the variability in rice eta p 0 05 table 2 factors such as dpsi bld sl and sn were negatively related to eta thus the farther the rice plot was from the scheme inlet the lower its eta was likewise the higher the soil content in silt or sand or the bulk density the lower the eta other statistically significant predictors dtb n and k were positively related to eta table 2 on the other hand there were fewer predictors that affected significantly rice cwp during the study period these predictors were plot elevation elv dpsi and n table 2 all these three predictors were negatively related to cwp indicating that low cwp occurred either in rice plots located at higher altitudes or in plots far from the inlet scheme or in plots with soils having relatively higher n concentrations the results of the general dominance analysis for eta and cwp are presented in fig 3 for the variability in eta dpsi and n were the predictors with relatively higher marginal r² values 0 165 and 0 125 respectively fig 3a the marginal r² for the other statistically significant predictors bld dtb sl sn k table 2 varied between 0 010 and 0 020 fig 3a for cwp dpsi had the highest marginal r² value 0 107 fig 3b the remainder of the statistically significant predictors elv n had their marginal r² ranging from 0 010 to 0 030 fig 3b 3 2 2 assessment using random forest based modeling approach overall the rank of each of the variables based on the rf models differed according to the response variables fig 4 exception included the variable dpsi which was found to contribute the most in both rice eta and cwp with 52 and 22 for the mean decrease in accuracy respectively fig 4 for rice eta besides dpsi variables with contribution 20 included extractable zinc zn potassium k and n fig 4a silt and sand contents and bulk density contributed to about 11 16 respectively the top six contributors were dpsi n zn k sn and sl fig 4a for rice cwp the majority of the remaining 11 explanatory variables had their contribution to the rf based model varying between 10 and 20 dtb and bld were the less contributing predictors 7 fig 4b the top six contributors based on the rf approach were dpsi k n elv ca and sn fig 4b figs 5 and 6 show the partial dependence plots for the top six predictors explaining variabilities in rice eta and cwp respectively they displayed the pattern of association i e monotonic or non monotonic linear or non linear between the predictor and the response variable among the top six covariates only the relationship between rice eta and k or n was monotonic an increase in k or n concentration was positively associated to an increase in rice eta with that of k being linear fig 5 non monotonic associations were found between rice eta and dpsi zn sn and sl fig 5 for those predictors there was generally an increasing trend to rice eta up to a given threshold followed by a decreasing trend fig 5 with regard to rice cwp the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non monotonic fig 6 that is there was a mixed of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either increasing or decreasing cwp depending on predictor value for example for plot elevation and soil total nitrogen n there was a decreasing association to rice cwp up to a given threshold value of the predictor i e 305 m for elv and 780 ppm for n before an increasing association afterwards fig 6 3 3 comparison of lmm and rf based models performance both lmm and rf based models achieved good performance in predicting eta rmse were 39 mm and 38 mm respectively their corresponding r2 being 0 74 and 0 75 and nse being 0 74 and 0 75 fig 7a however for cwp the performance of both models was fair rmse 0 07 kg m 3 and 0 08 kg m 3 for rf based model and lmm respectively corresponding r2 of 0 43 and 0 38 respectively fig 7b this suggests that additional observational data are needed for better assessing the variability of cwp in rice plots across the kvis 4 discussion achieving the full potential of irrigated rice during the dry season through tailored soil and management practices is pivotal to the success of farming activities in the kvis in this study soil physicochemical properties and plot characteristics affecting eta and cwp in irrigated rice in the kvis were investigated the spatial variation of eta and cwp both obtained with pysebal were predominantly linked to the distance between the plot and the irrigation scheme inlet elevation soil sand and silt contents soil total nitrogen and extractable potassium and zinc soil texture influences the movement of water in the soil as well as its storage capacity and the amount of stored water that is available to the plants the results from the linear mixed model showed negative relationships between eta and dpsi sl sn bld and positive relationships between eta and dtb n and k contents the negative relationships between eta and the sand or silt contents could be attributed to reduced soil water availability with an increase in sand and silt contents leading to water stress and subsequent reduction in the eta by the rice plants haefele et al 2006 niang et al 2018 the reduced eta with an increase in bld could be related to reduced root growth due to higher soil compaction which would limit the growth and development of the rice plants and result in reduced eta huang et al 2012 we also noticed that soil water holding capacity and bld were negatively correlated in this study fig s1 and therefore higher bld is associated with lower soil water holding capacity and higher water stress and reduced eta overall soil texture and plot distance to the irrigation scheme inlet had great influences on the movement of water in the soil as well as its storage capacity and the amount of stored water that is available to the plants therefore practices that improved through for instance addition of organic matter have the potential to increase infiltration water holding ability and actual evapotranspiration and can be recommended to the farmers of the kvis wilson et al 2020 there was a statistically significant and positive effect of soil nitrogen and potassium on eta in the kvis during the study period this can be related to the role of both nutrients on photosynthesis and crop growth which enhance the transpiration water loss and result in higher eta skinner 2013 santos et al 2016 such results indicate that a good management of these two nutrients through soil fertility management remains crucial for the overall performance of the kvis donovan et al 1999 dembelé et al 2005 yameogo et al 2013 supporting farmers in acquiring fertilizer increase their awareness for best fertilizer management practices and strengthening their capacity in implementing integrated soil fertility management practices would help farmers in the kvis effectively address the ongoing crop nutrients management issues wopereis et al 1999 wopereis and defoer 2007 lompo et al 2018 the negative effect of the nitrogen on rice cwp as shown in the lmm results indicated that the proportional increase in eta due to the positive effect of the nitrogen is greater than the proportional increase in yield various factors including crop management practices soil fertility cropping calendars can influence cwp through their effects on eta and crop yield kijne and fao 2003 nangia et al 2008 topography is well known as affecting cwp in rice bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 foley et al 2020 dossou yovo et al 2022 our results indicate that relatively lower cwp were found in irrigated plots located at higher altitudes in the kvis which can be related to soil erosion at these altitudes and the subsequent loss in soil fertility seibert et al 2007 karaca et al 2018 indicating the need to improve land and soil water conservation at higher altitudes in the kvis as reported in a previous study sawadogo et al 2020b in basin irrigation systems crop water productivity and actual evapotranspiration most often decrease as one moves away from the head of irrigation canals given the reduced canal water supply van dam et al 2006 latif 2007 the distance between the plot and the scheme inlet dpsi acted as the most influential factor for eta and cwp in our study for several reasons including the relatively high irrigation water consumption by head enders compared to tail enders in such irrigation schemes renault et al 2013 and the poor water management of the kvis indeed the irrigation water management across the kvis was carried out by inexperienced members of the water users association and that would probably affect more the tail end farmers traoré 2012 wellens et al 2013 several studies reported that tail end farmers face challenges in having access to irrigation water when needed leading to water stress and yield penalty compared to farmers fields located close to the water source sam amoah and gowing 2001 zwart and leclert 2010 training sessions and outputs from such studies are among the means used to improve the management of the kvis growing crops with less water requirement in the tail of the scheme or using efficient irrigation systems such as drip irrigation system for the other crops grown in the kvis can help improve the overall irrigation performance of the scheme regarding the two modeling approaches used in the study it has been shown that random forest based models most often outperform multiple linear regression models e g breiman 2001 jeong et al 2016 our results were in line with such conclusions at least for cwp for eta both models resulted in similar performance jeong et al 2016 argued that the relatively higher performance of rf based models is likely more evident when the response is a result of complex interactions between multiple predictors as it is the case in crop and farming systems and evidenced by the partial dependence plots figs 5 and 6 other factors such as vapor pressure deficit water availability crop variety crop management practices and socio economic factors e g water users association characteristics proximity of farmers to the irrigation scheme logistic challenges etc can potentially impact on irrigation performance in irrigated perimeters and schemes zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 dawe 2005 zhang et al 2013 including such potential variables would help improve our understanding of the key constraints of irrigation performance in the kvis there were no experiments carried out to investigate the effect of each of the potential explanatory variables on eta and cwp in rice plots at the study site achieving this was beyond the scope of the study nevertheless the effects of biophysical factors on crop evapotranspiration have already been documented e g allen et al 1998 katerji and mastrorilli 2009 garrigues et al 2015 garrigues et al 2018 lehmann et al 2018 carrying out such experiments in the future could provide additional insights into developing better strategies to improve irrigation water management at the kvis another limitation of the study was the short data period two years expanding the data period to include several years with different climate patterns improve the record keeping of the crop yield databases every season and collect additional socio economic data would improve the outcomes of the study this is considered as part of a future potential research in the study country 5 conclusions we investigated the potential soil physical and chemical properties and plot characteristics affecting the variability of irrigation performance in rice across the kvis during the dry season production periods in 2013 and 2014 using two modeling approaches random forest based and linear mixed models the main variables affecting rice eta and cwp both obtained with pysebal were the distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet dpsi plot elevation soil content in sand and silt soil total nitrogen and soil extractable potassium and zinc various association patterns were found between eta or cwp and the top six predictors non monotonic association for all top six predictors in case of cwp and either monotonic or non monotonic association in case of eta depending on the predictor results also indicated that relatively good performing rice plots in terms of cwp were those located close to the scheme perimeter and at relatively lower altitudes in the kvis the effects of soil nitrogen and potassium on eta and cwp in rice across the irrigation scheme suggest that good soil fertility management would be beneficial to rice both lmm and rf based models achieved good performance in predicting eta the fair models performances for predicting cwp nse for lmm and rf being 0 35 and 0 41 respectively and corresponding rmse of 0 08 kg m 3 and 0 07 kg m 3 indicate that additional observational data might be needed to improve our understanding of the key constraints of irrigation performance in the kvis nonetheless this study can serve as a basis for improving irrigation water management through helping the kvis managers to strategically locate underperforming plots to better prioritize their operations future research to improve our understanding of the key constraints of irrigation performance in the kvis can include investigating potential factors influencing irrigation performance such as water availability demographics of irrigation water users households characteristics proximity of farmers to the irrigation scheme logistic

data will be made available on request 1 introduction onion allium cepa l is an important vegetable crop worldwide which is cultivated on about 5 7 million hectares of land area with annual production of 109 million tonnes food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 india ranks first in acreage and second in production after china thus contributing to 20 of the global production immanuelraj et al 2014 setiya and muthuselvan 2018 about half of onion is produced in the deccan plateau dp where it is cultivated both during monsoon and post monsoon season former is transplanted during june september which is highly vulnerable to aberrant weather conditions especially heavy rainfall events in short spells result in surface water stagnation on low permeability clay basaltic soils and the hypoxia is further exacerbated with prevailing high temperature regimes najeeb et al 2015 with shallower rooting onion crop has low submergence tolerance dubey et al 2020 these conditions may lead to complete failure of the crop in wet years but the bulb yield losses to the extent of 50 70 are often reported gedam et al 2022 of course the plant survival yields and quality of onion owing to waterlogging are influenced by duration and intensity of rainfall growth stages at which water stagnation occurs adaptability of agronomic practices sensitivity and tolerance of genotypes ratnarajah and gnanachelvam 2021 transient waterlogging hinders the exchange of oxygen o2 to create anoxic conditions in soil which affects respiration and thus energy synthesis of root cells borella et al 2014 the declination of root functions in turn restricts water and nutrients uptake hinders the influx of co2 into leaf and transpirations causing leaf wilting and senescence besides the inhibition of photosynthesis leading to lower dry matter accumulation najeeb et al 2015 tian et al 2021 besides this hypoxia induces toxicity nutrient deficiency again restricting array of shoot physiological processes ultimately causes chlorosis necrosis and plant death bailey serres and colmer 2014 in onion waterlogging stress at the early bulb initiation to development stages reduces the plant height leaf area bulb weight and marketable size ghodke et al 2018 several reports have specified that waterlogging affects the bulbs tss total phenol antioxidants and pyruvic acid contents at specific growth stages depending on genotypes management practices and environment interactions dubey et al 2021 gedam et al 2022 to overcome the waterlogging induced constraints farmers largely resort to the practice of the removal of excess rainwater from the onion fields some of the engineering breeding and agronomic strategies such as transplanting in raised bed increasing soil profile de watering through drainage and tillage fertiliser application and use of tolerant species and varieties employed are also helpful to improving performance of crops under waterlogging manik et al 2019 however there are gaps in current knowledge strategies and technologies and farmer s practices which can minimise the losses emanating from waterlogging particularly in sensitive crops like onion a practical alternative seems to go in for exogenous application of plant growth regulators pgrs and nutrients supplements which are economically viable several pgrs such as salicylic acid thio urea potassium nitrate abscisic acid salicylic acid sodium benzoate gibberellins jasmonates and polyamines have been tested in both actual field and controlled environments for abiotic stresses like drought salinity sodicity etc srivastava et al 2016 bali et al 2019 pan pan et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 nkrumah et al 2021 singh et al 2022 these pgrs regulate physiological processes and mechanisms including photosynthesis proline metabolism nitrogen metabolism antioxidant defence systems and plant water relations at various developmental stages waqas et al 2019 recently mediating role of some these pgrs in enhancement of growth bulb yields and quality of onions under water deficits stress conditions was elaborated by wakchaure et al 2018 pgrs were also shown to assist in recovery from physiological injury due to waterlogging in onion manik et al 2019 specifically thio urea tu a major sulfhydryl pgr implicated in antioxidant defence and glyoxalase system stimulation osmoregulation protection of photosynthetic pigments and scavenging ros consequently ameliorating the adverse effects of drought waterlogging salinity and heat stress in plants ahmed et al 2021 leaching of nitrate ions from the soil indirectly related to lower waterlogging tolerance in plants thus application of potassium nitrate kno3 for improving plant tolerance carbon dioxide assimilation biosynthesis of sucrose and activation of fermentative enzymes has been reported in flooded plants goyal et al 2020 recently significance of salicylic acid sa a crucial phytohormone in promoting the development of axile and surface adventitious roots improving photosynthetic efficiency and enhancing the antioxidative defence system in waterlogged plants have been thoroughly investigated wang et al 2021 koramutla et al 2022 sodium benzoate bs an active oxygen scavenger can obviously reduce the waterlogging injury caused by oxy radicals through lowering the rate of o2 production and h2o2 content which further increased chlorophyll content and non enzymatic antioxidants in plants bin and qiujie 1995 nonetheless there is general lack of information on the relative responses of these pgrs as generated from actual field conditions in addition relative sensitivity of onion to waterlogging at various growth stages and its influence on growth bulb yields water productivity and quality has not been reported coherently therefore we hypothesised that differential responses of onion to transient waterlogging at different growth specific stages and its alleviation with pgrs could be explained better under field circumstances keeping this in views two year 2018 19 and 2019 20 field experiment was conducted for monsoon onion crop with the specific objectives of i to determine the effects of waterlogging at various growth stages on canopy traits bulb yield and quality of onion in deccan plateau of india and ii to evaluate the relative efficacy of selected pgrs for enhancing growth bulb

emerging from the literature supplementary table 1 includes the detailed description of experimental treatments assigned to each plot of 5 4 m2 6 m 0 9 m size with the blocks laid across the slope of the experimental field each block was separated by non experimental strip 1 5 m while spacing between plots in each block was kept as 0 5 m which acted as buffers to prevent lateral movement of water between blocks and plots respectively the seed material of the most popular cultivar bhima kiran known for tender onion in the region was procured from icar directorate of onion and garlic research rajgurnagar pune maharashtra the seeds were sown in the nursery and 45 days old healthy seedlings were transplanted manually in six rows in each bed on 3rd and 4th september in 2018 and 2019 respectively the spacing between rows was kept as 15 cm and plants were 10 cm apart before transplanting beds were prepared after proper pulverising of field soil with ploughing followed by rotovating two common irrigations were applied initially to ensure better crop establishment interval between the subsequent irrigations was maintained based climatological approach i e depth of irrigation water

were collected with soil auger down to 25 cm depth after 3 days of irrigation or waterlogging treatment until the onion harvest in both seasons average soil moisture was determined using hot air oven drying at 105 ºc for 24 h kumar et al 2007 the onion bulb harvesting was done after performing rolling operation at physiological maturity i e when at least 50 of leaves became yellow and neck

and canopy traits such as plant height plant vigour i e normalised difference vegetative index ndvi canopy air temperature difference catd and relative water content rwc were recorded at 27 days interval starting from the day of transplanting until harvest of crop to measure plant height five plants per plot were randomly selected during both seasons the height cm of the selected plants was taken from ground surface up to the tip of longest leaf and mean was calculated canopy temperatures were monitored using handheld infra red thermometer irt agri therm iii 6210 l everest interscience inc usa at or just after solar noon when plant water deficit is maximum the irt also measures the difference between canopy and air temperatures that is strongly related with plant water status average of five leaf reading in each plot was taken by placing the irt at fixed angle of view 2 5 degrees for targeting only canopy leaves a positive canopy air temperature difference catd showed that the plant is under stress while a negative difference specifies no stress the relative water content of fresh samples of five leaves collected from each plot was estimated following the method

diameter with load cell 100 kg at equatorial position of three onion bulb samples in each plot sharma et al 2020 to determine the biochemical characteristics onion bulb samples were thoroughly washed by tap water and adhering dirt was removed the outer skins neck and root ends of cleaned samples were detached the internal material was sliced into smaller pieces 3 5 mm mixed homogenously and put into an oven at 60 c for 48 h then part of each dried onion sample was powdered by electric blender and stored at 4 c until further biochemical analysis remaining dried onion samples were utilised for estimating rehydration quality during rehydration test more and tayade 2019 and expressed as rehydration ratio rr it was computed by dividing drained weight of rehydrated samples to weight of dehydrated samples taken for rehydration test performed at 45 c for 60 min the ph and total soluble solids tss brix of freshly sampled bulb tissues was measured using glass electrode ph metre pc 700 eutech and refractometer hanna instruments usa respectively the crude protein content mg g 1 dm was estimated from powdered onion sample in accordance to the kjeldahl s method as defined in official manual of analysis of association of official analytical chemists aoac 1990 which includes protein digestion and distillation dinkecha and muniye 2017 the total phenolic content tpc of powdered onion samples was carried out with minor changes in method suggested by of sun et al 2007 pyruvic acid a vital metabolic in onion and directly indicates its pungency was measured as per method given by teare ketter and randle 1998 2 5 statistical data analyses data obtained from two years field experiment laid in split plot design was analysed using sas software ver 9 3 to illustrate the pgrs effects on canopy traits bulb yields and quality attributes of onion grown under different waterlogging conditions the statistical significance between pgrs and their interaction with growth stage specific waterlogging treatments was completed by individual and combined analysis of variance over years as outlined by gomez and gomez 1984 least significant difference lsd method and duncan multiple range test were applied to compare differences in means for treatment effects p 0 05 similarly periodic variations in canopy growth and biochemical quality characteristics of onion bulbs were evaluated in triplicates n 3 and data were illustrated as mean with standard errors bars in excel plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth and canopy trait responses the results illustrated in fig 1a

temperature difference catd and relative water content rwc in both seasons 2018 19 and 2019 20 the growth rate expressed in term of increase of plant height was quite faster until 81 days after transplantation dat and thereafter it almost stabilised plant height improved to 51 7 54 3 cm with pgrs as compared with 51 cm in control no pgrs at 108 dat fig 1b pgrs also improved other canopy traits of onion ndvi and leaf rwc averaged between 0 35 and 0 47 and 74 6 86 7 with pgrs during effective period of foliar application 54 135 dat while respective values were 0 33 0 39 and 74 2 83 1 without pgrs fig 1d and f this was manifested as pgrs stimulated the formation of adventitious roots and aerenchyama promotes the gas exchange and thus improved plant growth and waterlogging tolerance pan et al 2021 an et al 2016 and manik et al 2019 reported the benefits of pgrs in increasing chlorophyll content stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity leaf relative water content rwc and antioxidant defence mechanism of plants that enabled to resist oxidative damage caused by hypoxia stress in waterlogged conditions an immediate effect of waterlogging stress was slowed down in plant growth and appearance of leaf chlorosis these changes in canopy traits were further associated with duration of waterlogged conditions incidental to specific growth stages of onion the plant height ndvi and rwc showed significant differences after 27 dat i e when waterlogged treatments were imposed either individually or in combinations at vegetative bulb formation and bulb development stages of onion the maximum differences of ndvi 0 11 and plant height 8 cm were observed at 81 dat indicating higher sensitivity at bulb initiation fig 1a and c the leaf rwc remained 6 8 9 2 lower in waterlogged plants from bulb initiation until the end of bulb development stage fig 1e growth monitored at maturity 135 dat in terms of plant height ndvi and rwc in wlvg and wlbd treatments was at par with wlc at maturity 135 dat while a recovery was noticed in wlvg and the growth was almost sustained under wlbd similar sensitivity and recovery to contribute towards better performance under waterlogging conditions was reported by ghodke et al 2018 compared with plant height 54 4 cm ndvi 0 41 and rwc 79 1 obtained with wlc at 135 dat their respective values of these traits ranged between 49 5 and 54 1 cm 0 32 0 40 and 71 1 78 0 and the in treatments were ranked as wlvg bi bd wlvg bi wlbi bd wlvg bd wlbi wlvg wlbd respectively this further indicated that larger reduction in crop growth when it was subject to more incidents of waterlogging the major reasons for this have been reported to be waterlogged induced oxygen depletion of soil which inhibited aerobic respiration in plant roots energy formation photosynthesis nutrients assimilations net carbon assimilation and induces oxidative damage to plant tissues thereby reduced overall plant growth and survival wang et al 2017 ratnarajah and gnanachelvam 2021 gedam et al 2022 analogous detrimental effects of waterlogging stress on various plant growth traits were reported previously yiu 2009 gibson 2016 barickman et al 2019 the catd increased with waterlogging stress fig 1g the negative catd 0 33 to 1 8 c during entire growing period for wlbd treatment were almost comparable with wlc 0 9 to 2 1 c indicative of negligible impact of waterlogging stress the positive catd 1 3 2 c recorded between 54 and 81 dat indicating the restricted water and nutrients uptake owing to occurrence of waterlogged situation in bulb initiation this also specified reduction in transpiration rate as the corresponding increase of catd and lowering of leaf rwc in different waterlogged conditions fig 1g and e earlier al mahmud et al 2015 observed similar inverse relationship between upraised canopy temperature depressions and lower leaf water content to lowers the transpiration rates of different potato genotypes under water stress environments zhang et al 2019 suggested the leaf air temperature difference could be as indicators to evaluate the waterlogging tolerance since it was directly related with the leaf rwc gas exchange parameters photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of plants foliar application of pgrs helped to maintain relatively lower catd readings 2 5 to 1 8 c than the no pgrs 2 1 to 3 3 c during entire growing period fig 1h for all pgrs negative catd readings 0 1 to 0 1 c were noted until 44 dat while no pgr showed corresponding positive catd 0 7 c indicating their role of keeping comparatively cooler canopy under waterlogged situation afterwards pgrs lowered catd ranged from 1 4 1 8 c at 54 135 dat with lowest values in pn followed by tu sa and sb than control without pgrs 0 4 1 9 c indicating their impacts for alleviation of waterlogging stress by maintaining leaf rwc 74 6 86 7 especially pn and tu had greater influence on the advancement of onion growth thus pgrs could have protective role for minimising adverse effect of oxidative stresses caused different abiotic factors on plant by lowering canopy temperatures through maintenance of higher leaf water content modulation of stomatal opening and regulation of other physiological processes ratnakumar et al 2017 wakchaure et al 2020 overall it can be interpreted that with pgrs morphological development of the onion waterlogged at the different stages showed assured compensatory growing ability but it varied with occurrence of waterlogging situation to specific growth stage 3 2 bulb yield splited bulb losses and water productivity the bulb yields water productivity wp and split bulb losses monitored under different pgrs and waterlogging treatments during both years are presented in tables 2 and 3 besides having similar trends total bulb yields tby and marketable bulb yields mby obtained in 2018 19 were significantly higher than those of 2019 20 season these differences in bulb yields were mainly due to mortality of seedlings 18 25 resulting from high soil moisture and excess rainfall occurred in 2019 20 supplementary fig 1 and supplementary table 2 latter of course is a general phenomenon as onion is extremely sensitive to waterlogging stress dubey et al 2020 conversely the crop experienced relatively dryer and cooler weather conditions in entire growing period of 2018 19 which were quite congenial for its growth and production mean temperature and relative humidity during 2018 19 season lower by 0 5 ºc and 12 5 when compared with 2019 20 and thus showed positive impacts on bulb development until harvest table 1 earlier reports also stated the benefits of congenial weather and soil situations for maintaining growth and bulb development thus improved yields under stress environments sable et al 2020 ghodke et al 2018 both tby and mby responded to significantly different waterlogged treatments applied at specific growth stages p 0 05 when averaged for the two years the bulb yields were reduced to 6 8 8 3 15 20 8 20 5 24 7 34 5 37 6 40 3 42 6 44 0 47 5 and 59 0 62 0 at wlbd wlvg wlbi wlvg bd wlbi bd wlvg bi and wlvg bi bd respectively relative to the non waterlogged wlc conditions thus the losses in bulb yields were comparatively lesser when one time waterlogging was imposed at either of vegetative bulb initiation and bulb development stages amongst these treatments yields were most susceptible at wlbi and least at wlbd effects of waterlogging at an early stage i e wlvg could be visualised but crop recovered considerably during the following growth period conversely the effects became additive on yield reductions when the crop was subject to waterlogging second or third time e g maximum losses in yield were observed 60 in wlvg bi bd treatment this means the damage of waterlogging is more on the already weakened crops ren et al 2014 have earlier reported that increased frequency and duration of waterlogging induces the severity of hypoxia waterlogging inhibited the translocation of assimilates from source to sink thereby reduces the bulb yields ratnarajah and gnanachelvam 2021 moreover the magnitude of bulb damage by waterlogging depends on the seasons intensity and duration of rainfall soil properties genotypes and cropping stages sarkar et al 2019 laxman et al 2020 pan et al 2021 exogenous pgrs effectively improved onion bulb yields the interaction effects of pgrs and waterlogged treatments were also significant p 0 05 the two years averaged results showed the pn was most effective in improving tby 18 1 subsequently tu sa and sb where yields enhancement were 15 1 13 2 and 9 0 respectively over no pgrs the corresponding improvement in mby ranged between 10 4 and 23 3 especially pgrs were more efficient in alleviating detrimental effects of waterlogging at more sensitive stages e g relative tby obtained with wlbi was 28 8 25 4 21 8 and 14 8 with pn tu sa and sb respectively whereas improvement at wlbd and wlvg bi bd were ranged between 16 5 and 18 2 13 3 14 9 10 7 13 6 and 6 4 8 8 with pn tu sa and sb respectively the effectiveness of exogenous pgrs in ameliorating the inhibitory effects of abiotic stress environments has been reported previously in different crops e g in cotton ashraf et al 2011 and canola habibzadeh et al 2013 with kno3 under waterlogging stress in eggplant with tu under salinity perveen and nawaz 2021 and water stress wakchaure et al 2020 in mustard with sa under salt stress husen et al 2018 and drought stress nazar et al 2015 and in wheat with sb under heavy metal stress pan pan et al 2020 further the results of pn in the present study was based on its capability to improve waterlogging tolerance through carbon dioxide assimilation and biosynthesis of sucrose thus improving growth and yields in flooded crops jain et al 2016 whereas tu is synthetic pgrs 36 n and 42 s that gained importance to fine tune plant redox homoeostasis under saline waterlogged environments which regulates root growth for improving plant nutrient water status photosynthetic efficacy plant growth metabolism thus source sink homoeostasis for enhanced crop yields srivastava et al 2016 yadav et al 2020 salah et al 2019 reported the similar promotional effects of pgrs in maize under waterlogging by down regulating rois producing enzymes activating antioxidant defence systems and improving chloroplast ultrastructure and photosynthetic traits the applied water aw calculated as the sum of irrigation water iw and effective rainfall erf during both years averaged 522 mm water productivity wp was computed as ratio of tby and aw is included in table 3 in pooled results following wp of 6 5 kg m 3 with wlc wp of 6 0 kg m 3 was computed in wlbd whereas lowest 3 4 kg m 3 was with wlvg bi bd wp for other waterlogged treatments averaged between 3 4 and 5 2 kg m 3 respectively the usage prospective agronomic and breeding strategies viz raised bed planting improved irrigation fertiliser methods straw mulch and screening of genotypes with promising adaptive traits to increase crop productivity under waterlogging has been highlighted earlier sarker et al 2017 haile et al 2019 mubarak 2020 zhang et al 2021 when the crop is exposed beyond threshold level of waterlogging its yields are affected drastically ghodke et al 2018 which also impacts wp moreover different stages onion are not equally sensitive to waterlogging also causes larger differences in wp of individual or combined treatments the wp also varied with pgrs across the waterlogging treatments when pooled for two years comparatively higher wp values of 4 9 4 7 4 6 4 4 kg m 3 with pn tu sa and sb were obtained under different waterlogging treatments over control without pgrs 4 0 kg m 3 their individual and interactive effects were also significant p 0 05 these results are similar with findings of yiu et al 2009 who noticed that waterlogging tolerance of welsh onion enhanced by exogenous pgrs like spermidine and spermine by preventing oxidative damage but protective effects of spermidine was found to be greater than that of spermine li et al 2013 reported the foliar usage of pgrs for mitigating waterlogging injury in crops through regulating growth and development thus improved yield and productivity yield losses owing to splitting behaviour of bulbs under stressed conditions is a serious concern for marketability and processing of onions ortola and knox 2015 the individual and interactive effects of pgrs and waterlogging treatments on bulb losses were also significant during all the both years p 0 05 the percentage of splitted bulb losses increased up to 18 40 when soil water deficit stress was imposed with holding irrigation in different leaf growth stages of onion pelter et al 2004 contradictorily to this report supplementary fig 1 and supplementary table 2 shows that as soil water was not limiting under waterlogging situation the average yield losses resulted from splited centred bulbs were lowered by 7 8 13 in different waterlogged treatments than control 14 1 during both years amongst the individual treatments minimum splited bulb loss 8 3 was observed in wlvg followed by in wlbi 9 8 respectively thus waterlogging stress early in the growing period decreased the formation of multiple centred splitted bulbs than when it occurred late in the growing season this trend of bulb splitting was dissimilar with previous report of zayton 2007 who observed highest multiple centred bulbs production when soil water stress imposed at initial growing stages of onion in sandy soil shock et al 2007 reported the onions were sensitive to the formation of multiple centred bulbs depending upon duration of environmental stresses cropping stages growing weather choice of irrigation system and cultivars in pooled data pgrs effectively reduced multi centred bulb development across the waterlogging treatments in particular pn was found to be most effective in reducing average splitted bulb losses 39 7 followed by sa tu and sb where these reduction were 36 0 30 9 and 11 8 respectively over control no pgrs similar benefits of pgrs for reducing yields losses were reported wakchaure et al 2018 in onion under water deficit stress conditions 3 3 marketable bulb quality in both years marketable bulb quality of onion as expressed in term of physical attributes viz mean bulb weight geometric bulb diameters dgm harvest index hi sphericity ɸ and firmness was influenced significantly by pgrs and waterlogging treatments both had significant individual and interaction p 0 05 effects on physical attributes table 4 in general waterlogging had led the significant declination in physical quality of bulbs the average bulb weight dgm hi sphercity and firmness decreased between 80 5 and 112 7 g 50 2 58 6 mm 0 781 0 836 0 964 0 991 and 1542 4 2176 3 g in different waterlogged treatments against their respective values of 119 7 g 61 3 mm 0 856 0 994 and 2256 8 g in wlc i e without waterlogging particularly average bulb weight and firmness reduced to extremist almost 32 7 and 31 6 under combined wlvg bi bd treatment while dgm reduced by 18 1 respectively least reduction in average bulb weight and dgm was observed in wlbd while it recorded maximum in wlbi amongst individual treatments alternately it can be stated that the bulb initiation was most sensitive stage for waterlogging stress with maximum reduction in average bulb weight by 18 and dgm by 10 obviously this might be due to lower photosynthesis assimilate translocation and nutrient imbalance under waterlogging conditions that severely affects bulb development thus reduced the bulb weight and size zhang et al 2016 the largest sphericity and firmness readings in waterlogged onion bulbs were recorded from wlvg while hi was found maximum in wlbi respectively previously rani and srivastava 2006 reported the fruit firmness dependent on shape indices and increased with sphericity of fruits as the smallest ratio of surface area to volume of spherical fruits resulted into little water loss rate and permeance to water vapour thereby of increased firmness diaz perez et al 2007 the higher hi in present study specified that larger reduction in above ground vegetative biomass production than bulb yields during occurrence of waterlogging at most sensitive stage of onion similar variations in physical attributes like fruit weight size matrices and hi was observed in other fruit vegetables including onion under waterlogging stress mohanty et al 2020 laxman et al 2020 the variations in physical attributes of bulbs further specified the pgr improved onion quality for better transportation marketability and storage the bulb weight dgm and sphericity averaged between 95 9 and 101 6 g 54 2 57 1 mm and 0 972 0 983 with exogenous pgrs while corresponding values were 94 8 g 53 6 mm and 0 968 with no pgrs relatively higher hi 0 808 0 834 was obtained with pgrs than that no pgrs 0 799 even the bulb firmness averaged between 1800 5 and 1928 4 g got improved with pgrs as compared to no pgr 1748 1 g overall superiority in these physical attributes of bulbs with pn and tu specified positive impact of pgrs to improve the onion quality under waterlogging stress analogous results of foliar pgrs usage for improving shelf life and fruit quality attributes viz fruit set weight fruit size and firmness of horticultural crops under stress environments has been reported by sharma and chauhan 2019 and drobek et al 2019 the pgrs enhanced source sink relationship stimulated the translocation of photo assimilates and nutrients improved water utilisation and resistance to pests diseases and thus improved plant growth yields and quality of fruit vegetables meena 2015 toungus 2018 overall it is concluded that exogenous usage of pgrs could be an effective strategy for augmenting marketable bulb quality of onion under waterlogging conditions 3 4 biochemical quality traits the variations in biochemical quality traits of onion bulbs evaluated at maturity after harvest under different pgrs and waterlogging treatments are presented in fig 2a f the rehydration ratio rr as an indicator of dry matter dm accumulation got adversely affected by waterlogging stress waterlogging markedly reduced the rr the rr averaged between 5 1 and 7 1 in different waterlogged treatments whereas its relative value of 8 0 in wlc fig 2a the commencement of waterlogging stress at different onion growing stages also reduced total soluble solids tss considerably 12 9 14 4ºb over wlc 14 7ºb fig 2b pandey et al 2002 specified the similar inhibitory effects of waterlogging on dm accumulation thus reduced rr and tss besides waterlogging induced anaerobic respiration leads to the depletion of soluble carbohydrate by altering the balance between carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis sharma et al 2021 similar was the case with ph protein content and total phenolics where the values were declined by 5 7 6 2 9 3 10 4 mg g 1 dw and 3 0 6 2 mg ga equi g 1 dw in waterlogged treatments as compared to their corresponding s values of 6 3 11 3 mg g 1 dw and 6 4 mg ga equi g 1 dw in wlc respectively fig 2c e conversely higher pyruvic acid 90 2 103 2 mmg 1 was monitored in waterlogged onion bulbs as compared to 88 4 m mg 1 in wlc fig 2f these parameters also got influenced significantly by either individual or combined waterlogging treatments applied to specified onion growth stages e g maximum and minimum values of rr tss ph protein content and total phenol content tpc were obtained at wlbd and wlvg bi bd respectively the findings of this study corroborated with previous observations of gedam et al 2022 reported the waterlogging stress significantly decreased the biochemical attributes like total phenol antioxidant activity pyruvic acid tss and membrane stability index of different onion genotypes foliar usage of pgrs significantly affected biochemical accumulation of onion bulbs in waterlogged situations pgrs enriched the bulbs rr quality and its values averaged between 5 5 and 8 5 5 2 8 2 5 0 8 0 4 9 7 8 and 4 6 7 5 with pn tu sa and sb respectively in comparison to 4 6 and 7 5 without pgr fig 2a this may ascribed due to the exogenous tu enhanced dm accumulation by motivating photosynthetic carbon fixation mechanism that improved plant growth singh and meena 2019 the pn and sa application might have increased photosynthetic efficiency by increasing chlorophyll content and keeping assimilating organs more active for longer period which ultimately resulted in higher dry matter accumulation under waterlogged conditions ashraf et al 2011 meena et al 2017 further tss of onion bulbs with pgrs exhibited increasing tendency 12 7 15 2 b over no pgrs 12 5 14 2 b in both waterlogging and normal conditions fig 2b rise in tss caused by the pgrs usage could be attributed to the mobilisation of metabolites from source to sink besides the conversion of starch and acids into sugars aly et al 2021 protein content also increased 9 1 11 7 mg g 1 dw by pgrs over control 9 0 10 2 mg g 1 dw in waterlogged onion bulbs with maximum accumulation in pn 5 77 8 16 and tu 2 97 7 22 fig 2d these result exhibited even after decrease of total proteins under waterlogging stress it enhanced with pgrs that could be attributed to synthesis of anaerobic stress proteins asps induced by root hypoxia singh et al 2017 pgrs induced increased protein content might be helpful for maintenance of cell osmolarity under stress conditions el tayeb 2005 the application of pgrs showed significant improvement 0 9 9 7 with respect to the control no pgrs in terms of maintenance of bulb ph in waterlogged onions than normal irrigation conditions 0 8 6 9 fig 2c this was owing to as tss increased the content of acids is altered or lowered causing increase in ph as noticed from different pgrs treatments ouma and matta 2001 similarly foliar application of pgrs increased the bulbs tpc from 2 4 to 24 3 depending on the treatments fig 2e especially pn and tu were found most efficacious to tpc in waterlogged onion bulbs at wlbi treatment and its combinations pgrs pronounced polyphenols synthesis by regulating metabolic processes thus enhanced plant resistance to abiotic stresses taraseviciene et al 2021 islam et al 2022 reported the plants sprayed with pgrs suffered less to oxidative stress owing to the improvement of total phenolics and flavonoids levels pyruvic acid an indicator of pungency in onion bulbs got affected positively by pgrs in individual and combined waterlogging treatments it was considerably increased by 1 6 9 7 with pgrs over control no pgrs in waterlogged onion bulbs than that of normal irrigation conditions 0 8 6 9 amongst individual and combined treatments the maximum pyruvic acid of bulbs 102 1 and 107 4 mm g 1 was recorded with pn in wlbi and wlvg bi bd respectively though these values were slightly higher but almost at par with tu whereas the minimum pyruvic acid content 85 4 mm g 1 was recorded in wlc fig 2f pyruvic acid as by product of degradation of sulphur containing volatile compounds generated upon rapture of bulb tissues during the process pungent flavour is produced by following action of enzymes allinase on s alk en yl cysteine sulfoxide particularly pn kno3 constitutes nitrate n had a significant effect on sulphur uptake and thus enhanced onion pungency gamiely et al 1991 tu molecule is a good donor of sulphur atom in biological reactions thus bulbs grown under abiotic stresses had high sulphur content and more pungent flavour precursors haldar et al 2014 overall it can be interpreted that waterlogged induced reactive oxygen species ros accumulation and the subsequently elevated levels of malondialdehyde were considerably reduced by pgrs thus mediated tolerance and ensured the biochemical quality of onions 4 conclusions waterlogging is key constraint in majority of onion growing areas especially when cultivated during monsoon season on low permeable black clayey soils transient waterlogging imposed at different growth stages showed the bulb initiation to be most sensitive 20 yield loss followed by vegetative growth 15 and bulb development 7 effects became additive when imposed at both vegetative growth and bulb initiation 44 vegetative growth and bulb development 40 bulb initiation and bulb development 35 and thrice on all the stages 60 the quality of onions was also impacted similarly exogenous foliar spraying of pgrs alleviated the waterlogging stress to a large extent especially potassium nitrate and thio urea were quite effective and improved bulb yields by 15 18 wp by 4 7 4 9 kg m 3 and also maintained marketable quality it is concluded that exogenous use of pgrs like pn and tu is a viable option to off shoot the impacts of transient waterlogging declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9079,rainfall induced hypoxia with transient waterlogging is a major constraint limiting the productivity and quality of monsoon season onion allium cepa l therefore the effects of water stagnation at different growth stages and possibilities of its alleviation with plant growth regulators pgrs namely potassium nitrate pn 20 g l 1 thio urea tu 600 mg l 1 salicylic acid sa 2 07 mg l 1 sodium benzoate sb 200 mg l 1 were evaluated during 2018 20 bulb yield loss ranged between 7 and 60 per cent bulb initiation stage was the most sensitive 20 to waterlogging followed by vegetative growth 15 and bulb development 7 effects became additive when imposed at vegetative growth and bulb initiation 44 vegetative growth and bulb development 40 bulb initiation and bulb development 35 and all the three stages 60 spraying pgrs improved marketable bulb yields by 10 4 23 3 water productivity from 4 0 to 4 4 4 9 kg m 3 and helped to mitigate waterlogging stress through maintenance higher leaf water contents greenness and plant vigour lower canopy temperatures and modulating stomatal openings especially the crop was more receptive to pn and tu sprays at the most sensitive bulb initiation stage waterlogging also impacted the quality traits like bulb weight geometric mean diameter sphericity and firmness of bulbs but these got largely recovered with pgrs pgrs exhibited considerably higher rehydration ratio rr ph total soluble solids tss protein contents accumulation of total phenols and pyruvic acid thus spraying pgrs like pn and tu emerged as a viable option to off shoot the impacts of transient waterlogging graphical abstract ga1 keywords bulb yields monsoon onion plant growth regulators pgrs waterlogging stress water productivity biochemical quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction onion allium cepa l is an important vegetable crop worldwide which is cultivated on about 5 7 million hectares of land area with annual production of 109 million tonnes food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 india ranks first in acreage and second in production after china thus contributing to 20 of the global production immanuelraj et al 2014 setiya and muthuselvan 2018 about half of onion is produced in the deccan plateau dp where it is cultivated both during monsoon and post monsoon season former is transplanted during june september which is highly vulnerable to aberrant weather conditions especially heavy rainfall events in short spells result in surface water stagnation on low permeability clay basaltic soils and the hypoxia is further exacerbated with prevailing high temperature regimes najeeb et al 2015 with shallower rooting onion crop has low submergence tolerance dubey et al 2020 these conditions may lead to complete failure of the crop in wet years but the bulb yield losses to the extent of 50 70 are often reported gedam et al 2022 of course the plant survival yields and quality of onion owing to waterlogging are influenced by duration and intensity of rainfall growth stages at which water stagnation occurs adaptability of agronomic practices sensitivity and tolerance of genotypes ratnarajah and gnanachelvam 2021 transient waterlogging hinders the exchange of oxygen o2 to create anoxic conditions in soil which affects respiration and thus energy synthesis of root cells borella et al 2014 the declination of root functions in turn restricts water and nutrients uptake hinders the influx of co2 into leaf and transpirations causing leaf wilting and senescence besides the inhibition of photosynthesis leading to lower dry matter accumulation najeeb et al 2015 tian et al 2021 besides this hypoxia induces toxicity nutrient deficiency again restricting array of shoot physiological processes ultimately causes chlorosis necrosis and plant death bailey serres and colmer 2014 in onion waterlogging stress at the early bulb initiation to development stages reduces the plant height leaf area bulb weight and marketable size ghodke et al 2018 several reports have specified that waterlogging affects the bulbs tss total phenol antioxidants and pyruvic acid contents at specific growth stages depending on genotypes management practices and environment interactions dubey et al 2021 gedam et al 2022 to overcome the waterlogging induced constraints farmers largely resort to the practice of the removal of excess rainwater from the onion fields some of the engineering breeding and agronomic strategies such as transplanting in raised bed increasing soil profile de watering through drainage and tillage fertiliser application and use of tolerant species and varieties employed are also helpful to improving performance of crops under waterlogging manik et al 2019 however there are gaps in current knowledge strategies and technologies and farmer s practices which can minimise the losses emanating from waterlogging particularly in sensitive crops like onion a practical alternative seems to go in for exogenous application of plant growth regulators pgrs and nutrients supplements which are economically viable several pgrs such as salicylic acid thio urea potassium nitrate abscisic acid salicylic acid sodium benzoate gibberellins jasmonates and polyamines have been tested in both actual field and controlled environments for abiotic stresses like drought salinity sodicity etc srivastava et al 2016 bali et al 2019 pan pan et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 nkrumah et al 2021 singh et al 2022 these pgrs regulate physiological processes and mechanisms including photosynthesis proline metabolism nitrogen metabolism antioxidant defence systems and plant water relations at various developmental stages waqas et al 2019 recently mediating role of some these pgrs in enhancement of growth bulb yields and quality of onions under water deficits stress conditions was elaborated by wakchaure et al 2018 pgrs were also shown to assist in recovery from physiological injury due to waterlogging in onion manik et al 2019 specifically thio urea tu a major sulfhydryl pgr implicated in antioxidant defence and glyoxalase system stimulation osmoregulation protection of photosynthetic pigments and scavenging ros consequently ameliorating the adverse effects of drought waterlogging salinity and heat stress in plants ahmed et al 2021 leaching of nitrate ions from the soil indirectly related to lower waterlogging tolerance in plants thus application of potassium nitrate kno3 for improving plant tolerance carbon dioxide assimilation biosynthesis of sucrose and activation of fermentative enzymes has been reported in flooded plants goyal et al 2020 recently significance of salicylic acid sa a crucial phytohormone in promoting the development of axile and surface adventitious roots improving photosynthetic efficiency and enhancing the antioxidative defence system in waterlogged plants have been thoroughly investigated wang et al 2021 koramutla et al 2022 sodium benzoate bs an active oxygen scavenger can obviously reduce the waterlogging injury caused by oxy radicals through lowering the rate of o2 production and h2o2 content which further increased chlorophyll content and non enzymatic antioxidants in plants bin and qiujie 1995 nonetheless there is general lack of information on the relative responses of these pgrs as generated from actual field conditions in addition relative sensitivity of onion to waterlogging at various growth stages and its influence on growth bulb yields water productivity and quality has not been reported coherently therefore we hypothesised that differential responses of onion to transient waterlogging at different growth specific stages and its alleviation with pgrs could be explained better under field circumstances keeping this in views two year 2018 19 and 2019 20 field experiment was conducted for monsoon onion crop with the specific objectives of i to determine the effects of waterlogging at various growth stages on canopy traits bulb yield and quality of onion in deccan plateau of india and ii to evaluate the relative efficacy of selected pgrs for enhancing growth bulb yield water productivity and quality of onion 2 material and methods 2 1 climate and soil of the experimental site a field experiment was conducted for two years 2018 19 and 2019 20 at research farm

emerging from the literature supplementary table 1 includes the detailed description of experimental treatments assigned to each plot of 5 4 m2 6 m 0 9 m size with the blocks laid across the slope of the experimental field each block was separated by non experimental strip 1 5 m while spacing between plots in each block was kept as 0 5 m which acted as buffers to prevent lateral movement of water

average of five leaf reading in each plot was taken by placing the irt at fixed angle of view 2 5 degrees for targeting only canopy leaves a positive canopy air temperature difference catd showed that the plant is under stress while a negative difference specifies no stress the relative water content of fresh samples of five leaves collected from each plot was estimated following the method suggested by bandyopadhyay et al 2014 the observations of ndvi an indicator to access the health or vigour of plants was recorded by using greenseeker a hand held portable battery operated ndvi sensor trimble spltech pvt ltd india total bulb yield tby mg ha 1 was estimated on fresh weight basis fwb by taking total bulb weight in each plot at harvest marketable bulb yield mby mg ha 1 was obtained after manual separation of splitted centred bulbs the weight of splitted centred bulb was monitored and expressed in terms of percentage of splitted bulb losses with reference to total bulb weight in each plot simultaneously the above ground leaf biomass observations were recorded from each plot the water productivity wp defined as the output quantified in terms of crop yield or economic returns with respect to the water input in crop production in the present study wp kg m 3 was calculated as ratio of total bulb yield tby with respect to total water supplied that comprises irrigation water and effective rainfall received during cropping season igbaduna et al 2012 2 4 physicochemical parameters estimation freshly harvested 25 uniform and matured onion samples were randomly selected from each plots and physical quality attributes viz bulb weight mean bulb diameter dgm sphericity and harvest index hi were calculated by following standard procedures suggested by gererufael et al 2020 kaveri and thirupathi 2015 and park et al 2013 the firmness was expressed in term of penetration force kg analysed by ta hdplus texture analysers stable microsystems uk using p 2 needle probe of 2 mm diameter with load cell 100 kg at equatorial position of three onion bulb samples in each plot sharma et al 2020 to determine the biochemical characteristics onion bulb samples were thoroughly washed by tap water and adhering dirt was removed the outer skins neck and root ends of cleaned samples were detached the internal material was sliced into smaller pieces 3 5 mm mixed homogenously and put into an oven at 60 c for 48 h then part of each dried onion sample was powdered by electric blender and stored at 4 c until further biochemical analysis remaining dried onion samples were utilised for estimating rehydration quality during rehydration test more and tayade 2019 and expressed as rehydration ratio rr it was computed by dividing drained weight of rehydrated samples to weight of dehydrated samples taken for rehydration test performed at 45 c for 60 min the ph and total soluble solids tss brix of freshly sampled bulb tissues was measured using glass electrode ph metre pc 700 eutech and refractometer hanna instruments usa respectively the crude protein content mg g 1 dm was estimated from powdered onion sample in accordance to the kjeldahl s method as defined in official manual of analysis of association of official analytical chemists aoac 1990 which includes protein digestion and distillation dinkecha and muniye 2017 the total phenolic content tpc of powdered onion samples was carried out with minor changes in method suggested by of sun et al 2007 pyruvic acid a vital metabolic in onion and directly indicates its pungency was measured as per method given by teare ketter and randle 1998 2 5 statistical data analyses data obtained from two years field experiment laid in split plot design was analysed using sas software ver 9 3 to illustrate the pgrs effects on canopy traits bulb yields and quality attributes of onion grown under different waterlogging conditions the statistical significance between pgrs and their interaction with growth stage specific waterlogging treatments was completed by individual and combined analysis of variance over years as outlined by gomez and gomez 1984 least significant difference lsd method and duncan multiple range test were applied to compare differences in means for treatment effects p 0 05 similarly periodic variations in canopy growth and biochemical quality characteristics of onion bulbs were evaluated in triplicates n 3 and data were illustrated as mean with standard errors bars in excel plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth and canopy trait responses the results illustrated in fig 1a h indicate that both plant growth regulators pgrs and waterlogging treatments exerted individual and interactive effects on plant height normalised difference vegetative index ndvi canopy air temperature difference catd and relative water content rwc in both seasons 2018 19 and 2019 20 the growth rate expressed in term of increase of plant height was quite faster until 81 days after transplantation dat and thereafter it almost stabilised plant height improved to 51 7 54 3 cm with pgrs as compared with 51 cm in control no pgrs at 108 dat fig 1b pgrs also improved other canopy traits of onion ndvi and leaf rwc averaged between 0 35 and 0 47 and 74 6 86 7 with pgrs during effective period of foliar application 54 135 dat while respective values were 0 33 0 39 and 74 2 83 1 without pgrs fig 1d and f this was manifested as pgrs stimulated the formation of adventitious roots and aerenchyama promotes the gas exchange and thus improved plant growth and waterlogging tolerance pan et al 2021 an et al 2016 and manik et al 2019 reported the benefits of pgrs in increasing chlorophyll content stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity leaf relative water content rwc and antioxidant defence mechanism of plants that enabled to resist oxidative damage caused by hypoxia stress in waterlogged conditions an immediate effect of waterlogging stress was slowed down in plant growth and appearance of leaf chlorosis these changes in canopy traits were further associated with duration of waterlogged conditions incidental to specific growth stages of onion the plant height ndvi and rwc showed significant differences after 27 dat i e when waterlogged treatments were imposed either individually or in combinations at vegetative bulb formation and bulb development stages of onion the maximum differences of ndvi 0 11 and plant height 8 cm were observed at 81 dat indicating higher sensitivity at bulb initiation fig 1a and c the leaf rwc remained 6 8 9 2 lower in waterlogged plants from bulb initiation until the end of bulb development stage fig 1e growth monitored at maturity 135 dat in terms of plant height ndvi and rwc in wlvg and wlbd treatments was at par with wlc at maturity 135 dat while a recovery was noticed in wlvg and the growth was almost sustained under wlbd similar sensitivity and recovery to contribute towards better performance under waterlogging conditions was reported by ghodke et al 2018 compared with plant height 54 4 cm ndvi 0 41 and rwc 79 1 obtained with wlc at 135 dat their respective values of these traits ranged between 49 5 and 54 1 cm 0 32 0 40 and 71 1 78 0 and the in treatments were ranked as wlvg bi bd wlvg bi wlbi bd wlvg bd wlbi wlvg wlbd respectively this further indicated that larger reduction in crop growth when it was subject to more incidents of waterlogging the major reasons for this have been reported to be waterlogged induced oxygen depletion of soil which inhibited aerobic respiration in plant roots energy formation photosynthesis nutrients assimilations net carbon assimilation and induces oxidative damage to plant tissues thereby reduced overall plant growth and survival wang et al 2017 ratnarajah and gnanachelvam 2021 gedam et al 2022 analogous detrimental effects of waterlogging stress on various plant growth traits were reported previously yiu 2009 gibson 2016 barickman et al 2019 the catd increased with waterlogging stress fig 1g the negative catd 0 33 to 1 8 c during entire growing period for wlbd treatment were almost comparable with wlc 0 9 to 2 1 c indicative of negligible impact of waterlogging stress the positive catd 1 3 2 c recorded between 54 and 81 dat indicating the restricted water and nutrients uptake owing to occurrence of waterlogged situation in bulb initiation this also specified reduction in transpiration rate as the corresponding increase of catd and lowering of leaf rwc in different waterlogged conditions fig 1g and e earlier al mahmud et al 2015 observed similar inverse relationship between upraised canopy temperature depressions and lower leaf water content to lowers the transpiration rates of different potato genotypes under water stress environments zhang et al 2019 suggested the leaf air temperature difference could be as indicators to evaluate the waterlogging tolerance since it was directly related with the leaf rwc gas exchange parameters photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of plants foliar application of pgrs helped to maintain relatively lower catd readings 2 5 to 1 8 c than the no pgrs 2 1 to 3 3 c during entire growing period fig 1h for all pgrs negative catd readings 0 1 to 0 1 c were noted until 44 dat while no pgr showed corresponding positive catd 0 7 c indicating their role of keeping comparatively cooler canopy under waterlogged situation afterwards pgrs lowered catd ranged from 1 4 1 8 c at 54 135 dat with lowest values in pn followed by tu sa and sb than control without pgrs 0 4 1 9 c indicating their impacts for alleviation of waterlogging stress by maintaining leaf rwc 74 6 86 7 especially pn and tu had greater influence on the advancement of onion growth thus pgrs could have protective role for minimising adverse effect of oxidative stresses caused different abiotic factors on plant by lowering canopy temperatures through maintenance of higher leaf water content modulation of stomatal opening and regulation of other physiological processes ratnakumar et al 2017 wakchaure et al 2020 overall it can be interpreted that with pgrs morphological development of the onion waterlogged at the different stages showed assured compensatory growing ability but it varied with occurrence of waterlogging situation to specific growth stage 3 2 bulb yield splited bulb losses and water productivity the bulb yields water productivity wp and split bulb losses monitored under different pgrs and waterlogging treatments during both years are presented in tables 2 and 3 besides having similar trends total bulb yields tby and marketable bulb yields mby obtained in 2018 19 were significantly higher than those of 2019 20 season these differences in bulb yields were mainly due to mortality of seedlings 18 25 resulting from high soil moisture and excess rainfall occurred in 2019 20 supplementary fig 1 and supplementary table 2 latter of course is a general phenomenon as onion is extremely sensitive to waterlogging stress dubey et al 2020 conversely the crop experienced relatively dryer and cooler weather conditions in entire growing period of 2018 19 which were quite congenial for its growth and production mean temperature and relative humidity during 2018 19 season lower by 0 5 ºc and 12 5 when compared with 2019 20 and thus showed positive impacts on bulb development until harvest table 1 earlier reports also stated the benefits of congenial weather and soil situations for maintaining growth and bulb development thus improved yields under stress environments sable et al 2020 ghodke et al 2018 both tby and mby responded to significantly different waterlogged treatments applied at specific growth stages p 0 05 when averaged for the two years the bulb yields were reduced to 6 8 8 3 15 20 8 20 5 24 7 34 5 37 6 40 3 42 6 44 0 47 5 and 59 0 62 0 at wlbd wlvg wlbi wlvg bd wlbi bd wlvg bi and wlvg bi bd respectively relative to the non waterlogged wlc conditions thus the losses in bulb yields were comparatively lesser when one time waterlogging was imposed at either of vegetative bulb initiation and bulb development stages amongst these treatments yields were most susceptible at wlbi and least at wlbd effects of waterlogging at an early stage i e wlvg could be visualised but crop recovered considerably during the following growth period conversely the effects became additive on yield reductions when the crop was subject to waterlogging second or third time e g maximum losses in yield were observed 60 in wlvg bi bd treatment this means the damage of waterlogging is more on the already weakened crops ren et al 2014 have earlier reported that increased frequency and duration of waterlogging induces the severity of hypoxia waterlogging inhibited the translocation of assimilates from source to sink thereby reduces the bulb yields ratnarajah and gnanachelvam 2021 moreover the magnitude of bulb damage by waterlogging depends on the seasons intensity and duration of rainfall soil properties genotypes and cropping stages sarkar et al 2019 laxman et al 2020 pan et al 2021 exogenous pgrs effectively improved onion bulb yields the interaction effects of pgrs and waterlogged treatments were also significant p 0 05 the two years averaged results showed the pn was most effective in improving tby 18 1 subsequently tu sa and sb where yields enhancement were 15 1 13 2 and 9 0 respectively over no pgrs the corresponding improvement in mby ranged between 10 4 and 23 3 especially pgrs were more efficient in alleviating detrimental effects of waterlogging at more sensitive stages e g relative tby obtained with wlbi was 28 8 25 4 21 8 and 14 8 with pn tu sa and sb respectively whereas improvement at wlbd and wlvg bi bd were ranged between 16 5 and 18 2 13 3 14 9 10 7 13 6 and 6 4 8 8 with pn tu sa and sb respectively the effectiveness of exogenous pgrs in ameliorating the inhibitory effects of abiotic stress environments has been reported previously in different crops e g in cotton ashraf et al 2011 and canola habibzadeh et al 2013 with kno3 under waterlogging stress in eggplant with tu under salinity perveen and nawaz 2021 and water stress wakchaure et al 2020 in mustard with sa under salt stress husen et al 2018 and drought stress nazar et al 2015 and in wheat with sb under heavy metal stress pan pan et al 2020 further the results of pn in the present study was based on its capability to improve waterlogging tolerance through carbon dioxide assimilation and biosynthesis of sucrose thus improving growth and yields in flooded crops jain et al 2016 whereas tu is synthetic pgrs 36 n and 42 s that gained importance to fine tune plant redox homoeostasis under saline waterlogged environments which regulates root growth for improving plant nutrient water status photosynthetic efficacy plant growth metabolism thus source sink homoeostasis for enhanced crop yields srivastava et al 2016 yadav et al 2020 salah et al 2019 reported the similar promotional effects of pgrs in maize under waterlogging by down regulating rois producing enzymes activating antioxidant defence systems and improving chloroplast ultrastructure and photosynthetic traits the applied water aw calculated as the sum of irrigation water iw and effective rainfall erf during both years averaged 522 mm water productivity wp was computed as ratio of tby and aw is included in table 3 in pooled results following wp of 6 5 kg m 3 with wlc wp of 6 0 kg m 3 was computed in wlbd whereas lowest 3 4 kg m 3 was with wlvg bi bd wp for other waterlogged treatments averaged between 3 4 and 5 2 kg m 3 respectively the usage prospective agronomic and breeding strategies viz raised bed planting improved irrigation fertiliser methods straw mulch and screening of genotypes with promising adaptive traits to increase crop productivity under waterlogging has been highlighted earlier sarker et al 2017 haile et al 2019 mubarak 2020 zhang et al 2021 when the crop is exposed beyond threshold level of waterlogging its yields are affected drastically ghodke et al 2018 which also impacts wp moreover different stages onion are not equally sensitive to waterlogging also causes larger differences in wp of individual or combined treatments the wp also varied with pgrs across the waterlogging treatments when pooled for two years comparatively higher wp values of 4 9 4 7 4 6 4 4 kg m 3 with pn tu sa and sb were obtained under different waterlogging treatments over control without pgrs 4 0 kg m 3 their individual and interactive effects were also significant p 0 05 these results are similar with findings of yiu et al 2009 who noticed that waterlogging tolerance of welsh onion enhanced by exogenous pgrs like spermidine and spermine by preventing oxidative damage but protective effects of spermidine was found to be greater than that of spermine li et al 2013 reported the foliar usage of pgrs for mitigating waterlogging injury in crops through regulating growth and development thus improved yield and productivity yield losses owing to splitting behaviour of bulbs under stressed conditions is a serious concern for marketability and processing of onions ortola and knox 2015 the individual and interactive effects of pgrs and waterlogging treatments on bulb losses were also significant during all the both years p 0 05 the percentage of splitted bulb losses increased up to 18 40 when soil water deficit stress was imposed with holding irrigation in different leaf growth stages of onion pelter et al 2004 contradictorily to this report supplementary fig 1 and supplementary table 2 shows that as soil water was not limiting under waterlogging situation the average yield losses resulted from splited centred bulbs were lowered by 7 8 13 in different waterlogged treatments than control 14 1 during both years amongst the individual treatments minimum splited bulb loss 8 3 was observed in wlvg followed by in wlbi 9 8 respectively thus waterlogging stress early in the growing period decreased the formation of multiple centred splitted bulbs than when it occurred late in the growing season this trend of bulb splitting was dissimilar with previous report of zayton 2007 who observed highest multiple centred bulbs production when soil water stress imposed at initial growing stages of onion in sandy soil shock et al 2007 reported the onions were sensitive to the formation of multiple centred bulbs depending upon duration of environmental stresses cropping stages growing weather choice of irrigation system and cultivars in pooled data pgrs effectively reduced multi centred bulb development across the waterlogging treatments in particular pn was found to be most effective in reducing average splitted bulb losses 39 7 followed by sa tu and sb where these reduction were 36 0 30 9 and 11 8 respectively over control no pgrs similar benefits of pgrs for reducing yields losses were reported wakchaure et al 2018 in onion under water deficit stress conditions 3 3 marketable bulb quality in both years marketable bulb quality of onion as expressed in term of physical attributes viz mean bulb weight geometric bulb diameters dgm harvest index hi sphericity ɸ and firmness was influenced significantly by pgrs and waterlogging treatments both had significant individual and interaction p 0 05 effects on physical attributes table 4 in general waterlogging had led the significant declination in physical quality of bulbs the average bulb weight dgm hi sphercity and firmness decreased between 80 5 and 112 7 g 50 2 58 6 mm 0 781 0 836 0 964 0 991 and 1542 4 2176 3 g in different waterlogged treatments against their respective values of 119 7 g 61 3 mm 0 856 0 994 and 2256 8 g in wlc i e without waterlogging particularly average bulb weight and firmness reduced to extremist almost 32 7 and 31 6 under combined wlvg bi bd treatment while dgm reduced by 18 1 respectively least reduction in average bulb weight and dgm was observed in wlbd while it recorded maximum in wlbi amongst individual treatments alternately it can be stated that the bulb initiation was most sensitive stage for waterlogging stress with maximum reduction in average bulb weight by 18 and dgm by 10 obviously this might be due to lower photosynthesis assimilate translocation and nutrient imbalance under waterlogging conditions that severely affects bulb development thus reduced the bulb weight and size zhang et al 2016 the largest sphericity and firmness readings in waterlogged onion bulbs were recorded from wlvg while hi was found maximum in wlbi respectively previously rani and srivastava 2006 reported the fruit firmness dependent on shape indices and increased with sphericity of fruits as the smallest ratio of surface area to volume of spherical fruits resulted into little water loss rate and permeance to water vapour thereby of increased firmness diaz perez et al 2007 the higher hi in present study specified that larger reduction in above ground vegetative biomass production than bulb yields during occurrence of waterlogging at most sensitive stage of onion similar variations in physical attributes like fruit weight size matrices and hi was observed in other fruit vegetables including onion under waterlogging stress mohanty et al 2020 laxman et al 2020 the variations in physical attributes of bulbs further specified the pgr improved onion quality for better transportation marketability and storage the bulb weight dgm and sphericity averaged between 95 9 and 101 6 g 54 2 57 1 mm and 0 972 0 983 with exogenous pgrs while corresponding values were 94 8 g 53 6 mm and 0 968 with no pgrs relatively higher hi 0 808 0 834 was obtained with pgrs than that no pgrs 0 799 even the bulb firmness averaged between 1800 5 and 1928 4 g got improved with pgrs as compared to no pgr 1748 1 g overall superiority in these physical attributes of bulbs with pn and tu specified positive impact of pgrs to improve the onion quality under waterlogging stress analogous results of foliar pgrs usage for improving shelf life and fruit quality attributes viz fruit set weight fruit size and firmness of horticultural crops under stress environments has been reported by sharma and chauhan 2019 and drobek et al 2019 the pgrs enhanced source sink relationship stimulated the translocation of photo assimilates and nutrients improved water utilisation and resistance to pests diseases and thus improved plant growth yields and quality of fruit vegetables meena 2015 toungus 2018 overall it is concluded that exogenous usage of pgrs could be an effective strategy for augmenting marketable bulb quality of onion under waterlogging conditions 3 4 biochemical quality traits the variations in biochemical quality traits of onion bulbs evaluated at maturity after harvest under different pgrs and waterlogging treatments are presented in fig 2a f the rehydration ratio rr as an indicator of dry matter dm accumulation got adversely affected by waterlogging stress waterlogging markedly reduced the rr the rr averaged between 5 1 and 7 1 in different waterlogged treatments whereas its relative value of 8 0 in wlc fig 2a the commencement of waterlogging stress at different onion growing stages also reduced total soluble solids tss considerably 12 9 14 4ºb over wlc 14 7ºb fig 2b pandey et al 2002 specified the similar inhibitory effects of waterlogging on dm accumulation thus reduced rr and tss besides waterlogging induced anaerobic respiration leads to the depletion of soluble carbohydrate by altering the balance between carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis sharma et al 2021 similar was the case with ph protein content and total phenolics where the values were declined by 5 7 6 2 9 3 10 4 mg g 1 dw and 3 0 6 2 mg ga equi g 1 dw in waterlogged treatments as compared to their corresponding s values of 6 3 11 3 mg g 1 dw and 6 4 mg ga equi g 1 dw in wlc respectively fig 2c e conversely higher pyruvic acid 90 2 103 2 mmg 1 was monitored in waterlogged onion bulbs as compared to 88 4 m mg 1 in wlc fig 2f these parameters also got influenced significantly by either individual or combined waterlogging treatments applied to specified onion growth stages e g maximum and minimum values of rr tss ph protein content and total phenol content tpc were obtained at wlbd and wlvg bi bd respectively the findings of this study corroborated with previous observations of gedam et al 2022 reported the waterlogging stress significantly decreased the biochemical attributes like total phenol antioxidant activity pyruvic acid tss and membrane stability index of different onion genotypes foliar usage of pgrs significantly affected biochemical accumulation of onion bulbs in waterlogged situations pgrs enriched the bulbs rr quality and its values averaged between 5 5 and 8 5 5 2 8 2 5 0 8 0 4 9 7 8 and 4 6 7 5 with pn tu sa and sb respectively in comparison to 4 6 and 7 5 without pgr fig 2a this may ascribed due to the exogenous tu enhanced dm accumulation by motivating photosynthetic carbon fixation mechanism that improved plant growth singh and meena 2019 the pn and sa application might have increased photosynthetic efficiency by increasing chlorophyll content and keeping assimilating organs more active for longer period which ultimately resulted in higher dry matter accumulation under waterlogged conditions ashraf et al 2011 meena et al 2017 further tss of onion bulbs with pgrs exhibited increasing tendency 12 7 15 2 b over no pgrs 12 5 14 2 b in both waterlogging and normal conditions fig 2b rise in tss caused by the pgrs usage could be attributed to the mobilisation of metabolites from source to sink besides the conversion of starch and acids into sugars aly et al 2021 protein content also increased 9 1 11 7 mg g 1 dw by pgrs over control 9 0 10 2 mg g 1 dw in waterlogged onion bulbs with maximum accumulation in pn 5 77 8 16 and tu 2 97 7 22 fig 2d these result exhibited even after decrease of total proteins under waterlogging stress it enhanced with pgrs that could be attributed to synthesis of anaerobic stress proteins asps induced by root hypoxia singh et al 2017 pgrs induced increased protein content might be helpful for maintenance of cell osmolarity under stress conditions el tayeb 2005 the application of pgrs showed significant improvement 0 9 9 7 with respect to the control no pgrs in terms of maintenance of bulb ph in waterlogged onions than normal irrigation conditions 0 8 6 9 fig 2c this was owing to as tss increased the content of acids is altered or lowered causing increase in ph as noticed from different pgrs treatments ouma and matta 2001 similarly foliar application of pgrs increased the bulbs tpc from 2 4 to 24 3 depending on the treatments fig 2e especially pn and tu were found most efficacious to tpc in waterlogged onion bulbs at wlbi treatment and its combinations pgrs pronounced polyphenols synthesis by regulating metabolic processes thus enhanced plant resistance to abiotic stresses taraseviciene et al 2021 islam et al 2022 reported the plants sprayed with pgrs suffered less to oxidative stress owing to the improvement of total phenolics and flavonoids levels pyruvic acid an indicator of pungency in onion bulbs got affected positively by pgrs in individual and combined waterlogging treatments it was considerably increased by 1 6 9 7 with pgrs over control no pgrs in waterlogged onion bulbs than that of normal irrigation conditions 0 8 6 9 amongst individual and combined treatments the maximum pyruvic acid of bulbs 102 1 and 107 4 mm g 1 was recorded with pn in wlbi and wlvg bi bd respectively though these values were slightly higher but almost at par with tu whereas the minimum pyruvic acid content 85 4 mm g 1 was recorded in wlc fig 2f pyruvic acid as by product of degradation of sulphur containing volatile compounds generated upon rapture of bulb tissues during the process pungent flavour is produced by following action of enzymes allinase on s alk en yl cysteine sulfoxide particularly pn kno3 constitutes nitrate n had a significant effect on sulphur uptake and thus enhanced onion pungency gamiely et al 1991 tu molecule is a good donor of sulphur atom in biological reactions thus bulbs grown under abiotic stresses had high sulphur content and more pungent flavour precursors haldar et al 2014 overall it can be interpreted that waterlogged induced reactive oxygen species ros accumulation and the subsequently elevated levels of malondialdehyde were considerably reduced by pgrs thus mediated tolerance and ensured the biochemical quality of onions 4 conclusions waterlogging is key constraint in majority of onion growing areas especially when cultivated during monsoon season on low permeable black clayey soils transient waterlogging imposed at different growth stages showed the bulb initiation to be most sensitive 20 yield loss followed by vegetative growth 15 and bulb development 7 effects became additive when imposed at both vegetative growth and bulb initiation 44 vegetative growth and bulb development 40 bulb initiation and bulb development 35 and thrice on all the stages 60 the quality of onions was also impacted similarly exogenous foliar spraying of pgrs alleviated the waterlogging stress to a large extent especially potassium nitrate and thio urea were quite effective and improved bulb yields by 15 18 wp by 4 7 4 9 kg m 3 and also maintained marketable quality it is concluded that exogenous use of pgrs like pn and tu is a viable option to off shoot the impacts of transient waterlogging declaration of competing interest the authors declare
